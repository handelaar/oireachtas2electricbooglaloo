    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 1 to 22, inclusive, together.</P>
      <P>As Deputies will be aware, negotiations on the successor agreement to the PPF concluded in February, and the majority of constituent social partner organisations have now formally ratified the new agreement, Sustaining Progress. I wish to take this opportunity to express my deep appreciation of the positive contribution made by all the people who took part in the negotiations and who worked tirelessly to bring about this new agreement.</P>
      <P>The Government is in absolutely no doubt that a renewed consensus expressed in this new agreement is in the best interests of all our people and we look forward to working closely with the social partners throughout the implementation of the proposed agreement. I also want to take this opportunity to again emphasise, with my colleagues, the Government's continued strong commitment to pursuing our nation's well-being and prosperity through the process of social dialogue and look forward to the ongoing dialogue on items of mutual interest.</P>
      <P>All pillars that were involved in the partnership negotiations &ndash; trade unions, business, farming, and the community and voluntary pillar &ndash; fully participated in the process. The process itself involved protracted negotiations to reach a position which maximised the area of agreement between the partners in the light of objective constraints. It is an inherent principle of partnership that all parties participate in all aspects of the negotiations, except with regard to the pay element of the agreement in which only the Government, the employers and unions were involved, as has been the case in all previous agreements.</P>
      <P>Formal meetings such as the last PPF plenary session in Dublin Castle on 31 October complement the meetings which I hold with representatives of the social partners on a regular basis. I will continue to meet with the social partners regularly, and as required, over the lifetime of the new agreement.</P>
      <P>I reported to the House on 5 February on the meeting which the Tánaiste, the Minister for Finance and I had with the employers and trade unions on Monday, 13 January, where we presented the two sides with a set of proposals on some of the key issues under discussion at the time, including pay.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I also met with representatives of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions on Friday, 7 February 2003 to clarify my position on a number of issues <Col N="5" /> covered by the proposed pay agreement in the context of a three-year social partnership programme.</P>
    <P>First, with regard to the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights, I stated that, on the basis that the charter is incorporated in a way that does not increase EU competence over national legislation or over socio-economic decisions which are for national governments to make, and would not reduce the standard of protection which Irish citizens enjoy under our Constitution, I would favour incorporation into the treaty.</P>
    <P>Second, with regard to the commercial semi-State sector, I confirmed that we are committed to active engagement with the social partners on the basis of the Government's commitment to its role in providing services of world-class quality at a competitive price to the consumer, with a viable long-term future for individual companies based on the most appropriate form of ownership or structure for its particular needs.</P>
    <P>Third, with regard to the special housing initiative, I confirmed my personal enthusiastic support for developing this proposal. We must, of course, be pragmatic about the timescale within which objectives can be achieved. However, I stated that I firmly believe that the shared resolve of the Government and the social partners in addressing issues which undoubtedly have to be resolved, will enable us to meet the commitment in the agreement of ensuring that the necessary actions are taken during the programme to achieve the objective, with measurable progress by the mid-term review.</P>
    <P>The new agreement indicates that the national centre for partnership and performance, which operates under the aegis of my Department, will play an increasing role in supporting the process of extending and deepening partnership and performance in the workplace. It identifies a number of specific projects which are to be carried forward by the centre with this in mind, namely: the establishment of a forum on the workplace of the future; a joint project with FÁS to promote a learning culture in Irish organisations; the development and dissemination of best practice in the area of partnership and performance; the development of a national training strategy to assist those involved in organisational change through partnership; the preparation of guidelines on the different forms of employee financial involvement; a project aimed at improving practices and procedures in relation to information, consultation and participation rights, in the context of the Information and Consultation Directive; and the promotion of existing joint partnership training materials as developed with IBEC and ICTU. These projects, which have the full support of IBEC and ICTU, will make a significant contribution to organisational change and modernisation in the years ahead.</P>
    <P>The Government attaches particular importance to the establishment later this year of the forum on the workplace of the future, which will facilitate in-depth discussion on how workplaces <Col N="6" /> can best adapt to competitive pressures, improve the delivery of services and respond to the changing needs and preferences of employees. This will enable us to take a holistic approach to improving partnership and performance in both the private and public sectors. The Government intends that the work of the forum will be showcased during our EU Presidency as a contribution to the implementation of the Lisbon agenda. On inflation, Sustaining Progress provides that, in the context of the agreement on pay and the maintenance of employment and competitiveness, the Government, with IBEC and ICTU, will work together to help exert downward pressure on inflation, recognising, of course, that some of the underlying problems can only be tackled over the medium term.</P>
    <P>The agreement provides in particular for the convening of a group, comprising representatives of my Department, the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment and the Department of Finance, together with representatives of IBEC and ICTU, to draw up a detailed action plan and to monitor its progress. Representatives of the Competition Authority and the Office of the Director of Consumer Affairs will also be invited to participate, as appropriate. The group, which will be established shortly, will present regular reports to me, the Tánaiste and the Minister for Finance and will submit a report reviewing progress six months after ratification of the agreement. The report will take account of progress in implementing the range of measures already set out in the Sustaining Progress agreement &ndash; for example, in relation to housing and insurance costs &ndash; as well as additional measures to be developed by the group.</P>
    <P>The group will be chaired by my Department. However, Dáil questions regarding the Government's policies on inflation will continue to be a matter for the individual Ministers concerned, including, in particular, the Minister for Finance and the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment. In my recent address at the launch of the new offices of the National Economic and Social Development office, I stated that it was for each organisation to decide whether it wishes to sustain the social partnership relationship and commitment to work together in advancing a shared agenda in the challenging period ahead. I reiterated that, for our part, we are anxious to continue to work and build on what we have achieved together. I acknowledged that we will regret the absence of those who choose to walk away but will engage with commitment and energy with those who decide to continue with the process, as I sincerely urged all who have been party to recent negotiations to do.</P>
    <P>Obviously, I regret that a minority of the social partners have not found it possible to ratify Sustaining Progress. However, I welcome the fact that a majority of the social partners have signed up to the agreement and I am fully committed to working within the social partnership process with these organisations. With regard to the con<Col N="7" /> tinued participation of the farming pillar, my officials are in informal contact with the farming organisations. I still hope that they will find it possible to continue in social partnership. It is my desire and that of the Government that they should. I hope that they can see that their objectives can best be pursued in the context of the partnership process.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeHiggins" hpid="Mr. J. Higgins Mr. J. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Taoiseach accept that the new agreement will see substantial falls in the real living standards of workers, beginning this year? How does the Taoiseach stand over an agreement that provides a pay increase of about 3.5% to private sector workers in the first year when inflation will run close to 6%? The real inflation rate will be much higher than that. How does the Taoiseach expect young workers to be able to buy a home given the abolition of first time buyer's grant and the raft of hidden charges introduced in the budget and other Government measures?</P>
      <P>Does the Taoiseach agree that this is a particularly disappointing agreement for public sector workers, particularly those on low pay? How does he stand over a six-month pay pause for public sector workers while inflation is at its current level? Does he agree that to use benchmarking as an excuse for the pay pause would be totally dishonest because benchmarking is supposed to help public sector workers catch up with those in the private sector? Does the Taoiseach agree that this new deal represents nothing more than the same philosophy and mechanism of all such previous deals, which is to restrain wage increases for workers to the maximum extent possible while placing no restraint on profiteering in the housing market, on landlords in the private rented sector or on the services sector, which rips workers off left, right and centre?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>A number of the problems the Deputy mentioned are specifically provided for in the programme so that we can try to deal with issues on the pay front. In tougher times, both domestically and internationally, the Government has been mainly criticised for paying increases of this level. The circumstances are difficult and I am glad the social partners accepted this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I said last week in reply to a question from Deputy Kenny, the level of inflation in our society is too high. It is higher than the EU average. In the programme, Sustaining Progress, a set of mechanisms has been agreed by the social partners where ICTU and IBEC along with Government agencies, the Competition Authority and the Prices Commission will work together to see if we can, as the Central Bank predicted, force down the levels of inflation. Time will tell whether it is possible to do that but I look forward to working with the agencies in trying to deal with these matters. There are issues in terms of competition and of trying to convince those taking profit margins, particularly in the services <Col N="8" /> sector where these have been identified across a range of personal services and where it has shown that price increases are far higher than in other sectors and are out of line with the international position.</P>
    <P>The same applies to housing. The policy is to try to deal with housing by trying to match up supply and demand. That is the only way to try to influence the market to ensure more houses and to bring about a control of prices. There is a range of issues in this programme to deal with this issue on which work has already started and I look forward to pursuing it. I have answered questions on this matter several times in recent weeks.</P>
    <P>In relation to some of the other points the Deputy made, as he knows, I disagree with his view on partnership agreements. The reality is that partnership agreements have changed, or at least have played a major part in changing, this country. They are the reason we have 600,000 more people working in our society and the reason we have far more valued added and higher quality jobs. We must be careful we remain competitive and do not out-price ourselves in the market. The Deputy is well aware of the pressures in this area. Pay levels are higher than the average for many international jobs and we must continue to be cautious. However, people are getting a decent wage even if it is, in many cases, higher than that being paid to their counterparts elsewhere in the world, as is increasingly happening here. Pay levels and pay rates are not only higher than those in Britain but are higher than those in Europe and, in many cases, in the United States. That is a risk in terms of competitiveness and that is why the programme is very much centred around competitiveness issues.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny" hpid="Mr. Kenny Mr. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>Given that this programme is to last for 18 months, will the Taoiseach consider the possibility of a new type of partnership process for the future which would reflect the needs of a modern society, such as real efficiency in the delivery of public services? Does the Taoiseach accept that this agreement is predicated on the Government being able to keep the rate of inflation under control? Given the antics and activities of the Government in recent years, is it not a fact that Government fiscal policy has led directly to an increase in inflation which puts us way ahead in the European league and has caused us to drop in the competitive ratings as a consequence? Does he accept that persistently high inflation will damage that competitiveness and threaten the entire partnership process? </P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Following on from that, does the Taoiseach accept the findings of the report recently released by CORI which highlights the widening division in Irish society and shows the extensive gaps in social provision where we have growing poverty rates, unequal income distribution, a growing rich-poor gap, under-equipped health and education systems and road, railway and transport systems which compare very badly with those of <Col N="9" /> our European counterparts? Will the Taoiseach comment on those clear indicators, many of which are a direct result of Government inefficiency and inability to manage the public services properly?</P>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I will try to answer those questions in order. The agreement itself is for three years. The pay agreement is to be re-examined after 18 months but the process, work and especially the key items that must be worked on between the social partners and Government agencies are for a three year period.</P>
      <P>I agree with the Deputy on the public service. Benchmarking is not just a pay increase but a pay increase in return for efficiencies, enhanced co-operation and modernisation in the public sector. This is the subject matter of the agreement. Mechanisms have been established in the health area, local authorities, Departments and semi-State agencies to ensure that these efficiencies are achieved, are monitored and that it is not a case of automatically receiving the increase. These mechanisms worked well under the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness, and the structures have been enhanced to deal with the new agreement.</P>
      <P>On the issue of competitiveness and inflation, part of the inflationary figure, as I have stated previously, relates to Government measures, but it is a small part. The larger part of inflation is directly linked to services. Central Statistics Office figures and other reports have shown this. The Central Bank's report last week showed clearly where increases have occurred and where they are out of line with international trends. The European Union's report a month ago showed this as well. The problem is in the area of services and results from people who provide professional and personal services taking profits and continuing to increase prices rather than lose market share or profitability. That is wrong and I will continue to say that. I know all the predictions are that inflation will work its way downwards, but intervention will be necessary to drive it down and drive more competitive actions and initiatives, not just in the area of competition, to try to force down the rate of inflation which is too high. There is no argument about that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Inflation obviously affects competitiveness and there are input costs, but our real problem with competitiveness and the reality which costs many jobs is that the level of salaries in this country is increasingly becoming higher than in the United Kingdom, Germany and the United States. Deputy Kenny will know this well, especially as we have moved as a matter of policy over the past decade to try to attract higher value jobs. I have seen the figures for comparative costs, primarily although not exclusively within the multinational systems where the competition for jobs is within the companies, and it is increasingly the case that salaries in this country are higher. That may appear extraordinary, but when I query these figures, it is the case. I am not talking about the <Col N="10" /> lower end of the market. I know there are people on low pay and there are mechanisms through which we are trying to deal with them. However, it is increasingly the case that salaries in Ireland are higher.</P>
    <P>The viability and profitability of companies in these cases must be examined. I know it is an issue of concern not only to employers and the Irish managers of these companies but to their employees. It is an issue we must address. It is not all located in the east coast but also in many parts of the country. It is a challenge for us and the reasons for it are clear. In the past two or three years when there has been almost negative growth in Germany, increases have been tiny compared with this country. It is a challenge and a concern, but we are still winning inward investment. This year has been a better year than last year, despite all the international difficulties. We must watch our competitive base.</P>

      <P>Can I stay with this anti-inflation chapter? I would have thought what the Taoiseach said in agreeing with Deputy Kenny, that we are no longer competitive in a number of areas, would be very interesting coming from a commentator. Does the Government have a view on it? The Taoiseach is not a commentator, he is the Taoiseach. If he agrees with Deputy Kenny that these factors are making us uncompetitive, will he say what the Government intends to do about it?</P>
      <P>Can the Taoiseach draw my attention to any line or paragraph in the anti-inflation initiative, or am I missing something, that says tangibly what the Government will do about it? I note there is a commitment to an explicit and co-ordinated set of policies which could help to slow the present rate of domestically generated inflation. However, I see no such policies or tangibles in the relevant paragraph or chapter. Irrespective of whether we differ on what is domestically induced and what is imported, I presume the Taoiseach is not saying that this anti-inflation package will change what we import from outside. The Government is, therefore, addressing domestically induced inflation.</P>
      <P>Has the Minister for Finance not made the main contribution to that inflation since last July and not simply since the budget? The new levy of charges that the various Ministers have thought up are the main contributory factor to domestically induced inflation.</P>
      <P>For Members who were not at the talks, will the Taoiseach tell the House what the anti-inflation initiative comprises? In so far as I can read it, I cannot find anything tangible other than that the Government will pull together a committee of the usual suspects. There is nothing in the package to tackle the fact that the Minister for Finance has driven inflation through the roof &ndash; it is now about three times the European Union average.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I have already stated that the smaller part of the overall level of inflation is linked to charges brought in by the Government. It is the smaller part of that as shown by the Central Bank analysis of last week, which also showed what accounts for the major part. As far as possible, we do not want to return to high taxes, whether direct or indirect, although I am not against the Government imposing charges where sectors in society that do not contribute to it have a clear advantage. Some of the charges were in those areas and Deputy Rabbitte knows precisely where they are. There are many arguments about those but people should pay something back.</P>
      <P>On the particular initiatives, IBEC and ICTU in the talks and publicly put forward a range of measures they wanted implemented by the Government. They put forward their views but I cannot say at this stage whether it is possible to implement all the points which they put into the programme and into the public domain.</P>
      <P>The Deputy referred to &ldquo;the usual suspects&rdquo; but the social partners do not change. They remain the employers, trade unions, the Government and agencies and we will try to deal with those. A number of issues were highlighted at the time even though the competition report has now been published, which shows that the increases for engineers, architects, dentists, optometrists, veterinary surgeons, medical practitioners, solicitors and barristers are all very high with regard to inflation.</P>
      <P>Indecon Economic Consultants put forward a recent report which adds to the significant debate with regard to competition in these sectors. We must challenge these areas. The recommendations in these areas will be addressed by the relevant Ministers and the Competition Authority will take each area in turn, which will help. It is clear in all these areas that the increases are way out of line with international competition in the UK and the EU.</P>
      <P>Eight areas have been highlighted by the social partners over the past year or two, although they are not the only eight in Irish society, and it is not impossible for us to challenge those. There are also other areas, including the insurance issue regarding which the Tánaiste will soon bring forward her proposals. The Government is also bringing in proposals and legislation with regard to the rental sector. Control and regulation in all these areas should give us an advantage in trying to reduce inflation and bring increased competition into Irish life. These are not the only areas that need to be addressed.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>What are the differences between the Competition Authority's report and the report, many years ago, of the old Fair Trade Commission in relation to this matter? Can the Taoiseach outline one new proposal that is contained in the Competition Authority's report? The Law Reform Commission, for example, has said that the legal contracts handed out by successive Attorneys General of this Government in the past six or seven years are absurd. I refer to lawyers' fees, intended for High Court cases of two or three days' duration, but taken by lawyers for cases that have lasted two or three years &ndash; some of them have lasted longer than the Second World War. What will the Taoiseach do about this matter? Will he change the traditional system of awarding legal contracts in a manner that looks after his own in the Bar Library? Will he put such contracts out to tender?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no problem whatever with putting legal contracts out to tender, or with making changes to the present position, for example by working away from the <i>per diem</i> fee system. I am glad that the Law Reform Commission has made its statements. I know that Deputy Rabbitte agrees with me in relation to this matter, as we debated it in this House about a month ago. The Government can deal with this issue in a number of ways. The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform has produced proposals for dealing with inquiries and investigations in an entirely different way. We must decide whether these matters must always be dealt with on a legal basis &ndash; I do not believe they do. Other people in Irish society can investigate many of these issues. Perhaps one can use only the law in many of these areas, but I do not think that the legal profession has to undertake every examination. The Law Reform Commission agrees with this view.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Rabbitte's first question related to the work of the Competition Authority. The authority's recent report is certainly the first major report to be produced on these sectors in the past 20 years. It is the first report to set out a path for challenging and changing the operation of these professions in Irish society. It is the first report to mention fairly tight protection arrangements, although it may not be fair to refer to them as &ldquo;cartels&rdquo;. They are not really cartels as many different companies and agencies are involved in them. The report shows that those involved in the sector do not work in a competitive way. There is no competition between them as the industry's sectors and professional services are regulated in <Col N="13" /> a way that ensures that, far from competing with each other, their costs are the same. The only thing that changes is that the fees go up in the better-known firms. The fees are never reduced. There is no real competition of the type found in the retail and other sectors.</P>

      <P>Deputy Rabbitte has asked a fair question and the answer to it is &ldquo;Yes&rdquo;. The inflation group has made a commitment to work on these reports. I hope it does not take too long to deal with individual reports. I have said to the social partners that the Competition Authority's recent report, published in the last few weeks, is enough to proceed with. We should not have to wait for individual reports as we might be waiting for two years.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent" hpid="Mr. Sargent Mr. Sargent">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Taoiseach see anything ironic in the title of the partnership agreement, Sustaining Progress, given that Ireland's greenhouse gas emissions are going off the scale? The suggestion that there is anything sustainable about the agreement is absurd. Does the Taoiseach agree that the endorsement of incineration in the agreement will do nothing to encourage sustainability? If sustainability is not grasped, competitiveness will sink as greenhouse gas emissions will make the country very uncompetitive by comparison with efficient countries that have managed to grasp this nettle. Is the Taoiseach aware that the community platform, which includes the National Women's Council of Ireland, is concerned that its representatives, including those who represent poorer and marginalised people, will not be afforded the space to participate in partnership in the future? I ask this in light of the Taoiseach's remarks that the partnership arrangements will be re-organised. If the arrangement is reorganised, will the Taoiseach include the environmental sector? The Taoiseach says housing proposals must be pragmatic, but what is pragmatic to him may be useless from the perspective of the homeless. The Simon Community newsletter says the proposal for affordable housing will have no direct impact on the crisis faced by the homeless and that it gives no thought to sustainability or social integration. Will the Taoiseach address that matter in the agreement to ensure that progress is made on the issue of homelessness?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The title Sustaining Progress was not used in terms of the environment, although I agree that such issues have to be tackled. The Minister for the Environment and Local Government, Deputy Cullen, is actively involved in addressing them. In this context, the <Col N="14" /> principle of sustaining progress refers to maintaining the economy and the numbers in employment at their current levels. We are attempting to maintain our standard of living while creating a more competitive market which will see further high growth from the future improvement in international economic circumstances.</P>
      <P>Some of the organisations in the community and voluntary pillar did not ratify the partnership agreement so they have automatically stated that they wish to withdraw from the process. Most organisations have ratified the agreement and the agencies which have not will continue to engage with Departments in their usual way, but they will not be part of the ongoing pillar. I hope they continue to play a constructive role.</P>
      <P>Deputy Sargent will agree that substantial resources have been invested in initiatives to address housing problems. We have put in place many strategies and employed many officers to tackle homelessness. That may not solve every single homelessness problem, but it is having a huge impact.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent" hpid="Mr. Sargent Mr. Sargent">

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not the case and, while they will always lobby for more resources, it is not what the people involved are saying. I addressed the annual meeting of the Simon Community last year and pointed out the difference between the provisions made in the past and those that are being made now. I acknowledge that there are difficulties and conflicting arguments and I understand that questions are being asked about mixing the homeless with those who have substance abuse and other problems. The relevant Ministers, agencies and the homelessness officer in this city are addressing the issues and I was privy to a paper a month ago which outlined local authority plans in this regard.</P>
      <P>Useful programmes and initiatives are under way whose goals will be costly to achieve. We will continue in the life of the current agreement to invest money and effort to increase the number and range of voluntary housing agencies. Deputy Sargent will acknowledge the excellence of the work of the voluntary housing sector, which is almost 100% funded by the State. The number of houses built was very low in the past, but we have made substantial increases in the grants available and I hope we continue to do that.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>How can the Taoiseach claim that we are formulating effective integrated competition and social inclusion policies when 75 groups under area development management have had their funding cut substantially this year? They are holding a special meeting to discuss the matter this week. That cutback means, for example, that personal assistants to those in wheelchairs, carers <Col N="15" /> and others in society who have no voice, are being let go. It demonstrates clearly the extent of the gap that has opened up in Irish society. Will the Taoiseach comment on that?</P>
      <P>In respect of the agricultural community whose members are now depressed and demoralised and who feel quite rightly that the Minister for Agriculture and Food has let them down seriously, does the Taoiseach expect the agricultural sector to be part of the partnership agreement? If so, can he confirm that the disease levies which were doubled by Government will be dealt with and that the roll-over relief for land acquired for road widening purposes will be restored to the farming community, their two conditions for joining the partnership process? Given the difficulties farmers are now experiencing as a result of the stealth taxes introduced by this Government, the difficulties to come as a result of the Fischler proposals, and those in terms of the World Trade Organisation, can the Taoiseach confirm that these two conditions will be approved by Government this week?</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>On social inclusion and the negotiations on this programme, not every aspiration of every organisation can be fulfilled. The organisations themselves would acknowledge that during the period of the last programme there was an enormous increase in the resources given to them, as well as to the people they wish to assist. An enormous number of these organisations are now almost fully funded by the State in one way or another, whether through Combat Poverty, ADM, partnership or social welfare grants, or funds given out by various Departments in a range of ways. Most of these organisations are staffed by full-time, part-time and contract staff. There are literally hundreds of people employed in them. In implementing reductions or tightening up on expenditure, all organisations must take some of the hit, but I am sure it is the policy of Ministers, in disbursing their allocations under the Estimates, to endeavour as much as possible to avoid hitting those people most in need. There are particular areas that some of the organisations want examined. Organisations that are in the social partnership negotiations and organisations that are not will continue to raise their various points with Ministers and Departments, and I have no problem with that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to agriculture, as I have said previously, last year was a difficult year. Production costs increased, it was a bad year for prices and there was a prolonged period of bad weather. There is no doubt that the combination of the three affected agriculture. However, the overall figure for State assistance to the agricultural sector was &euro;2.8 billion, a sizeable proportion of which, &euro;1.7 billion, constituted direct payments. The interests of farmers domestically, in the world trade round and in the mid-term review of agriculture is very much in social partnership. It does not make sense for farmers to remain out<Col N="16" /> side the process. I would prefer them to come in. I have no argument with farmers in these areas.</P>
    <P>In relation to costs, tax concessions and so on, farmers have been discussing these issues with Ministers McCreevy and Walsh. Some of the decisions relating to them will not be reversed. Alternative mechanisms and ways of looking at these were put forward. However, in some of these areas, a contribution by farmers is necessary to pay for the provision of services that are quite costly. The State can pay and attempt to engage with these issues as much as it can. The budget of the Department of Agriculture and Food is more than &euro;800 million. It is not possible for the State to simply pay everything and that has been explained to the farming bodies. The wider issues of agriculture, based on the 2010 report which will be reviewed shortly in Mr. Fischler's mid-term review and the World Trade Round are important issues. I would like to see farmers taking part in the negotiations dealing with those issues.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelAhern" hpid="Mr. N. Ahern Mr. N. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment and Local Government (Mr. N. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 78 and 298 together.</P>
      <P>The operation of the disabled person's grant scheme is at present under review in my Department. On completion of the review, which I envisage being finalised in the next few months, I will be in a position to determine the changes, if any, required to the regulations governing the scheme. Notification of capital allocations to local authorities in respect of the payment of disabled person's and essential repairs grants in 2003 will issue as soon as all authorities have submitted their expenditure outturns on the schemes for 2002, as well as estimates for 2003. As the administration of the disabled person's grant scheme is the responsibility of individual local authorities, it is a matter for them to decide on the level of funding to be provided for the scheme in their areas from within these allocations. My Department also recoups to local authorities two thirds of their expenditure on the payment of individual grants. It is the responsibility of authorities to fund the balance from their own resources from amounts provided for that purpose in their annual estimates of expenditure.</P>
      <P>The significant improvements made in recent years to the maximum disabled person's grant and the level of recoupment available have resulted in increased levels of activity with expenditure on the scheme increasing from &euro;15.8 million in 1999 to &euro;41.7 million in 2001. The figures for 2002 are currently being compiled. In line with this increase in the Department's capital provision for the scheme, recoupment costs have also increased significantly from &euro;6.3 million for 2,512 grants in 1998 to almost &euro;31.5 million for 5,070 grants in 2002. This very significant increase in the level of funding provided is a clear indication of the Government's commitment to the disabled person's grant scheme.</P>
      <P>The special housing aid for the elderly scheme, which is available to elderly persons, provides assistance by way of necessary emergency repairs to improve conditions in the existing housing of elderly persons living alone in unfit or unsanitary conditions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <i>Additional information</i>Funding for the scheme, which is operated at local level by the health boards in line with the various guidelines issued from time to time by the task force which administers the scheme, under the aegis of my Department, has increased significantly in the past five years, with &euro;11.5 million <Col N="20" /> provided in 2003 as against &euro;6.3 million in 1998. The number of jobs has also increased significantly from 3,302 in 1998 to 4,998 in 2002. Funding for the scheme is provided through the national lottery and an initial allocation of &euro;11 million for 2003 has been notified to the health boards. A further allocation of the balance &ndash;&euro;500,000 &ndash; for 2003, based on activity under the scheme, will be notified to the health boards later in the year. Decisions to grant assistance in individual cases are the responsibility of the health boards at local level and it is a matter for each board to determine, within the funds available, the priority of cases on hand. I am satisfied that the scheme is kept under appropriate review by the task force and I have no proposals to amend it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BernardAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>Given the stark statistics of 10,263 applicants as at 31 December 2002 under the housing aid for the elderly scheme and more than 11,000 applicants awaiting consideration under the disabled person's grant scheme, does the Minister of State agree that if this is a litmus test of his achievement following seven years of an economic boom, the Government has failed the most needy and vulnerable in our communities? Each time I raise the issue in the House, I am sick hearing that the scheme is under consideration. When will the review and consideration of amalgamating the DPG and the housing aid for the elderly scheme be completed? Some 21,000 elderly people, some just looking for a few slates on the roof, are being told the money is not available. Surely that is an example of the Minister of State's total failure in this whole area where the most vulnerable are suffering as a result of gross mismanagement.</P>

      <P>It was announced only a few weeks ago that a review was taking place, therefore I do not understand how the Deputy is sick hearing about it. There has been enormous demand on all these schemes in recent years. Millions of pounds have been invested in the scheme in recent years. An increase from &euro;16 million to &euro;52 million over three years is enormous. We cannot meet all the demands, even though we have done so up to now. While the Department pays two thirds of the funding, there is a responsibility on local authorities to provide one third of the funding. Some of them have difficulties in this regard. We are considering suggestions they have put forward about how to amend the scheme. The review, which has been going on for some weeks, will probably take two or three months more.</P>

      <P>We are approaching Easter and the Minister of State's answer is a Pontius Pilate act. He is washing his hands of his responsibility. How does he expect local authorities to fund one third of the amount required under the regulations when his Department has, in effect, cut back the financial allocations this year to local government? To blame local authorities for this crisis in <Col N="21" /> one of the most needy areas is washing his hands of his responsibility.</P>

      <P>The most recent assessment of housing needs, which included a count of the <Col N="22" /> number of homeless persons, was carried out by local authorities at the end of March 2002. The data in relation to local authority housing waiting lists, which have been finalised and published, show that a total of 2,468 homeless households were considered to be in need of, and suitable for, local authority housing.</P>
      <P>A further separate assessment of the total number of homeless people, whether seeking local authority housing, was also carried out by local authorities in co-operation with the voluntary housing organisations as part of the assessment of housing need. As well as the 2,468 households who are seeking local authority housing and for whom local authority housing is appropriate, this assessment includes people who are living in long-term supported accommodation for homeless people and are not seeking alternative accommodation. The outcome of this assessment is currently being finalised and will be published shortly.</P>

      <P>The Minister of State has not answered my simple question. I wish to ascertain the total number of homeless people in the country. He has given me half an answer and has indicated that a further examination is under way. I cannot understand why he will not answer my question. How many people in the country are homeless? Local authorities have compiled assessments of housing needs and homelessness action plans while there is an agency to deal with homelessness in Dublin. Why can the Minister of State not provide me with a straight answer?</P>

      <P>The total number might be the same again. However, they are not necessarily homeless. I understand the number of homeless people on the streets of Dublin has been calculated at 79. A number of people may be included in the loose category of the homeless. They are looked after by the various voluntary agencies <Col N="23" /> with assistance from the Department and would be in long-term sheltered accommodation.</P>
      <P>Two different studies have been undertaken by the ESRI and the local authorities which have produced different figures in the Dublin context. A new count was taken a few weeks ago and the figures will be available shortly. There was a disagreement over the earlier two studies because they were compiled on a different basis. One surveyed those using homelessness services while the other surveyed those in accommodation for the homeless. There are no definite figures for each category. For example, some who are in their own or local authority homes use homelessness services. A report undertaken in recent weeks is trying to produce a revised figure by merging the findings of the two earlier reports.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment and Local Government (Mr. Cullen)</NameTxt>
      <P>The report published by the Health Research Board is a lengthy and detailed document which, alongside the related inventory of dioxin emissions to the Irish environment that was published by the EPA in late December 2002, is receiving careful consideration, both within my Department and the EPA. In due course, having consulted the agency, the Department of Health and Children and other bodies that may be concerned, I will make a fuller statement in response to the HRB report and its findings. In the meantime, the rigorous environmental licensing system implemented by the EPA in respect of all significant waste facilities will continue to ensure that such activities do not present a significant risk to public health or the environment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BernardAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>A key recommendation of the report is that further research using reliable estimates of exposure over long periods is required to determine whether living near incinerators is injurious to health. In view of this, will the Minister indicate that he will terminate all plans to develop incineration until this study is completed? It is ironic that when the Minister for Health and Children is proposing to ban smoking in public places, the Minister appears to be gung-ho to develop a programme of incineration, despite the warning of the Health Research Board.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
      <P>The recommendation to which the Deputy refers has been completely misinterpreted. Risk assessment in the context of the HRB recommendation does not mean the site-<Col N="25" /> specific risk assessment routinely undertaken by the EPA before it grants a waste licence to a proposed waste facility. Rather, the report clearly refers to a perceived need for health information systems to support routine and long-term monitoring of the health of people living near waste facilities, so that over time, any public health impact from such facilities can be identified and evaluated. These kinds of systems have only been recently developed in all countries and we will welcome them when they occur.</P>
      <P>I have made consistent attempts to make the point, which I hope the Deputy supports, that in terms of the overall development of a waste integrated management system here, there are four aspects to the internationally respected waste hierarchy. One of these is thermal treatment incineration. When politicians talk to people on this aspect they should put in context that the total impact of the combined hazardous waste incinerators in the country contribute less than 1% of the dioxins that currently go into the environment. When the proposed new municipal waste facilities are in place, the total combined of all these facilities in terms of dioxin emissions will be approximately 1.85%. There is a responsibility on us all to deal with the facts. We should stop scaring people.</P>
      <P>At present, there is uncontrolled combustion throughout the country where people are burning waste in their back gardens, farmyards or wherever. The vast majority of dioxins are emitted into the Irish atmosphere from such sources. I propose that we move to the use of managed, state-of-the-art and controlled facilities which will allow everybody to know what is happening.</P>

Does he agree that if waste incineration is introduced before the other programmes are fully implemented it will be self-defeating? Does he also agree that a policy of incineration will require huge resources and energy to justify the presence of incinerators in regions?</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>The other issue in the report about which I am pleased is that it clearly draws a distinction <Col N="26" /> between the assessments and the research done which was based on old landfills and old types of incinerators. I am delighted to be able to say that we will not have these in this country. Since the EU directives of 1999 and 2000 on landfill and incineration have come into being, the bar has been set at the highest level. Although we have a massive problem we are fortunate in coming to deal with this issue now because technology has advanced so much in the past few years that the qualitative approach we can guarantee to the people in putting in these facilities will use cutting edge technology which was not available in many of the assessments in the HRB report.

      <AskConj>asked the </AskConj>
      <askee>Minister for the Environment and Local Government</askee>
      <Quest>if his attention has been drawn to newspaper accounts of a report commissioned by the environmental organisation, Greenpeace, showing that up to 3.5 million people could die in the event of a terrorist attack on a British nuclear installation, such as Sellafield; the assurances he has sought or received from the British authorities regarding the security of such installations in view of the potential danger to the public and the environment; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware of media references to three reports commissioned by the UK branch of Greenpeace which apparently emphasise the dangers associated with a terrorist attack on Sellafield. In a recent press statement, Greenpeace UK has said that these reports are still in draft form and are in the process of completion. Obviously, Ireland will have a keen interest in these reports and, when published, we will study them carefully.</P>
      <P>I can assure the Deputy that there is regular high level contact with the UK authorities regarding security around Sellafield and I have recently written to the responsible Minister expressing Ireland's concerns in this regard. However, because the UK feels constrained for security reasons in what it can say, it does not take Irish authorities into its confidence in relation to security measures to the extent we would wish it to. The level of security information available to Irish authorities is one of the issues in the current legal action under the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea. We firmly believe there is greater scope for higher quality exchanges while recognising and respecting legitimate security concerns.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EmmetStagg" hpid="Mr. Stagg Mr. Stagg">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Stagg</NameTxt>
      <P>So am I and I may be a bit more up-to-date in that respect. Is the Minister aware that Greenpeace has decided to suppress the details of the report because of the information contained in them which shows that the total lack of security, at Sellafield in particular, is such that any terrorist who wished to blow up Sellafield would have no difficulty doing so? Is he aware that there is no effective plan to limit the effect of any such action on the population and that the reports demonstrate that 3.6 million people in Britain and Ireland would be at serious risk if such an attack were to occur?</P>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that a diversion of a jumbo jet from its current course would only take three to four minutes for it to crash into Sellafield? In particular, has the Minister taken up the issue of the most vulnerable part of Sellafield in that regard which is the storage of highly active liquid waste in over-ground tanks? These tanks have been described as being at high risk from explosion and from chain reaction and would yield a fall-out 25 times that arising from Chernobyl. Has the Minister taken any particular action against the use of these tanks and towards the changing of the liquid into a glass form which could be stored more safely?</P>

    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
      <P>I am well aware of the points the Deputy has made. My concerns and those of the Government reflect his as he well knows. We are proceeding against the UK authorities on these issues in two specific areas. One area is under the OSPAR Convention. I hope we will have the results of that particular case, which deals with the last aspect of the Deputy's question, available within the next month or two. We are awaiting the outcome of OSPAR. The UNCLOS case, to which I just referred, is well under way. It is scheduled for an oral hearing in June of this year.</P>
      <P>I have made the point on numerous occasions that the Government feels strongly about the sort of security arrangements that are in place. I recognise, of course, that they are a matter for the British authorities. Nevertheless, we believe that the Government, through my Department and the Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland, should have more information. We are in contact with the authorities on a regular basis and in contact with British Government Ministers. I know the Taoiseach has raised the issue of Sellafield with the British Prime Minister also. There is no doubt in the British authorities' minds, given the fact that we have proceeded with the two cases to which I have just referred, as to the Government's serious concerns in regard to the operation of Sellafield and the storage etc. of nuclear waste there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EmmetStagg" hpid="Mr. Stagg Mr. Stagg">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Stagg</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no effective plan to limit the effect of any such accident or explosion or terrorist attack. Is the Minister aware of the exercise carried out by the British nuclear authorities and the health and safety authorities of a simulated attack by a jumbo jet on a power station in Essex? It was described as high farce arising from the inadequacy of the ability of the authorities to respond. In view of that high farce description, has the Minister raised this matter given that Ireland would be directly affected by any such attack?</P>
      <P>Given that Ireland is now part of the coalition of the willing, of which Britain is an important part, and that there is an increased risk of terrorist attack arising from our involvement in that, has the Minister sought any increase in the precautions or any increased security to cover the increased risk which is evident and has been written about in some detail? Would the Minister, in doing that, raise with the British authorities the contrast between this ring of steel which has been put around Heathrow Airport, for a relatively minor risk in comparison to the 3.6 million people who would be at risk from Sellafield going up, and the minimal security around Sellafield today?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
      <P>I just informed the Deputy, and he is well aware of this as he follows the issue closely, that we have had to take legal action against the UK authorities under two major international conventions. We have gone past the rhetoric and have moved to serious action. The Attorney General, whom I compliment on the level of his input and on his knowledge of this issue, apart from the legal proceedings involved, has been most impressive internationally in the way he has gone about these cases.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy would know the Office for Civil Nuclear Safety, OCNS, is responsible for security within the UK. It assures us that the highest and most stringent security measures are put in place. We would like to have a greater and deeper knowledge of what these stringent security measures are concerning Sellafield. That is the purpose of the two cases. We have demonstrated, not just to the British Government but internationally, that it is no longer acceptable for neighbouring nuclear countries not to be part and parcel of the knowledge base that forms the nuclear country's opinion of what security in the area entails. Other countries now support Ireland on this.</P>
      <P>A country cannot operate on its own without reference to its neighbouring country. That was one of the successes in an earlier judgment that Ireland got internationally and which was warmly welcomed by others. We have been involved on a long complicated and detailed process through the Deputy's time in Government and there are many legal issues involved but our determination and our resolve in this issue and the Taoiseach's resolve are clear.</P>

      <P>The need to review local electoral areas will be considered when the census report setting out the population of the State, classified by area, is published by the Central Statistics Office.

The last review was carried out in 1998 and the preview review was in 1985. We have a recent review in place.

      <P>Deputy Ring's reservations are about the constitutionality issue and he should not be misrepresented here.

      <P>Do I understand the Minister correctly, that unless a dramatic change is shown in the census report his view is that there will not be a change in local election boundaries for the local elections in 2004? If that is his view, will he give the House an indication of the nature of the change the census report would have to show? Does he have some parameter in mind in terms of population change or changes within an electoral area that would cause him to ask the Local Government Commission to report on the issue?</P>

      <P>Unlike Dáil constituencies there are no mandatory requirements for examination of local electoral boundaries. There is also the issue of the European elections which are running concurrent. There will have to be changes there because the number of seats has been reduced. I cannot say anything at this stage without looking at the census report in detail. I am conscious of the tight timeframe for colleagues in all parties throughout the country. It is mandatory to have the European review done because the number of seats has diminished. There will be changes in that area and that review will take some time. I am concerned that the time frame for a major review of the local government boundaries may cause enormous difficulties for colleagues in parties all over the country. It may be so close to the election date that it might be wiser, if it does not cause massive difficulties all over the country, not to proceed beyond it. I would not like to be pre-emptive until I see the published census report. I have been helpful to the House in the way I am approaching this matter.</P>

      <Quest>if his attention has been drawn to planning difficulties which have arisen for those who are promoting the development of wind farms; the national guidelines in this regard; and his views on whether an active planning policy is necessary if there is to be any coherent and co-ordinated policy for the development of renewable energy project facilities.</Quest>
      <QRef>[8789/03]</QRef>
    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
      <P>The development of alternative energy sources is a priority, nationally and at European level, for both environmental and energy policy reasons. My Department published Guidelines for Planning Authorities on Wind Farm Development in September 1996. The guidelines, a copy of which is available in the Oireachtas Library, are intended to facilitate implementation of Government policy in the development of renewable sources of energy. They are designed to assist planning authorities in making suitable provision for wind farm development in their development plans and to ensure a consistency of approach throughout the country to the treatment of planning applications for such development.</P>
      <P>The guidelines are currently being reviewed in the light of experience since they were issued to ensure that they continue to be relevant and useful. As part of the review, a public consultation process has been undertaken. All comments received will be taken into consideration in the preparation of revised guidelines which I intend to issue later in the year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am aware of some objections raised by the then Department of Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands to planning applications for wind <Col N="34" /> farm development. I have already endorsed the need for a considerable expansion nationally of renewable energy developments and, in that context, for practical solutions to accommodate this kind of development with nature conservation requirements. It is not the case internationally that nature conservation requirements represent a major obstacle to the expansion of renewable energy, nor is this envisaged in Ireland. It will be important that the revised planning guidelines address the accommodation of wind farming and nature conservation requirements.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PadraicMcCormack" hpid="Mr. McCormack Mr. McCormack">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCormack</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister agree that although wind farms are an environmentally friendly way of generating energy, there are no clear guidelines on wind farms in any county development plan? The Department of the Environment and Local Government issued guidelines in 1996 but councils did not put those guidelines in their county development plans. Will the Minister recommend that special areas within counties be designated where it would be possible to get permission for wind farms? One end of the Government is telling us they are acceptable and Dúchas and the other end of the Government are objecting to them.</P>

      <P>I am glad the Deputy has raised this issue and I agree with much of what he has said. I fully support wind farms as a source of renewable energy which affords us great hope for the future. I have been straightforward in my response to the House on this matter. I do not see an incompatibility between special areas of conservation and the use of wind energy. There is no incompatibility between them.</P>
      <P>That applies to the issue that has arisen lately with regard to the hen harrier in the south-west. As Minister responsible, I regret that the communications systems that were in place were not adequate to make clear the fact that we have only entered into a consultation process. Incorrect presumptions were made as to the impact of these. I am confident that we will have compatibility between wind energy, afforestation and areas of preservation.</P>

      <P>I welcome the Minister's statement. A problem is developing with regard to the AER VI programme which is to be introduced shortly. One of the conditions of the programme is that full planning permission must be granted before a project can qualify for inclusion. Planning permissions are being held up by local authorities because of the Dúchas designation of SPAs. In those circumstances, will the Minister consider extending this time limit to enable local authorities to deal with this issue, as he has already admitted that there has been a difficulty in communication?</P>

      <P>I am satisfied that An Bord Pleanála has the necessary resources to fulfil its functions.</P>
      <P>My Department and the board have been addressing on an ongoing basis a range of measures to enable the board to process appeals more expeditiously and to discharge the new functions transferred to the board in accordance with the provisions of the Planning and Development Act 2000. As a result, significant additional staffing and financial resources have been allocated to the board. In July 2000, the board was given approval for an increase of 29 additional staff &ndash; nine professional and 20 administrative staff. An additional four administrative staff were approved in July 2001, bringing the authorised staff complement, excluding board members, to 138. This is an increase of 53 since July 1997.</P>
      <P>The board has now advised my Department that the backlog of appeals, which had previously built up, has been eliminated. At 31 December 2002 the total number of cases on hand had been reduced to 1,372, compared to a peak of 2,700 in 2001. This has been further reduced to 1,308 at the end of February 2003. With the elimination of the backlog, the workload in An Bord Pleanála is now for the first time in over five years at a level consistent with the board's strategic target of giving decisions within 18 weeks in 90% of cases. I anticipate that the great majority of recent and future appeals will be determined within that timeframe.</P>

    <P>In response to the issue raised by Deputy Durkan on rural planning &ndash; the national spatial strategy recognises that different situations pertain in different parts of the country. I am not implacably opposed to people living in the areas they come from, and I have made this clear in my capacity as Minister for the Environment and Local Government. That is the way it should be. I am very supportive of many of the views of my colleague, the Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs, Deputy Ó Cuív. However, a balance must be achieved and there must also be a balance in terms of resources. There is a dispersed population pattern in this country. We need communities and we also need to strengthen the resources of villages in terms of the services that are required. I equally want to balance the environmental issues created by some one-off <Col N="38" /> houses and I believe that we have now reached a point of technology and common sense where all of those aspects can be accommodated.</P>

To be frank, I would like to see the 18-week period reduced and, correspondingly, to see the 90% figure increase. That standard was set a few years ago and we have now achieved it. While it has taken some time, the situation must be viewed in the context of the volume and change in planning applications.</P>
      <P>It was inevitable that a great deal of resources would be used.

      <P>The United States is committing an extra 100,000 soldiers and weaponry to this conflict. There was speculation at the weekend that Baldonnel and Casement aerodromes are now also being used for military flights in addition to Shannon. The Minister for Defence confirmed that no flights had gone through there since last July. Will the Taoiseach inform the House as to the facilities that are being made available? Under Irish law it is necessary that, in this instance, the United States would receive the authorisation of the Department of Transport for overflights and landing. Will the Taoiseach also inform the House of the number of flights and overflights, if he has that information, plus the weaponry that is being carried in landings and overflights that has been communicated to the Department of Transport or to the Government?</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="40" />Is the Taoiseach in a position to give us a guarantee that there is no danger to Irish citizens, in view of the number of accidents that have occurred in Iraq because of inter-flying? God forbid, if an accident were to happen with the over-flights or landing of military planes at Shannon Airport or some other facility. Given that this matter is of serious concern to Irish citizens, has the Taoiseach been kept fully informed by the US authorities of the number of flights that are either flying over or landing and of the equipment, type and amount of weaponry that is being carried on any flights that are using our facilities?</P>

Our view is, as it always has been, that these matters could have been resolved at the United Nations but that was not to be and, unfortunately, we are now into what everyone hoped we would avoid for all of those months. The reports are disturbing. We continue to do everything we can in terms of humanitarian aid working with the various agencies. That is where our focus has been for the past 12 days and where it will continue to be. I had an opportunity last week to refer to one or two of the agencies involved but there are a number of them working in the field. Deputy Kenny referred to reports about Baldonnel being used for military stop-overs. Foreign military aircraft occasionally use the facilities at Baldonnel, but no US military aircraft have landed at Baldonnel since the summer of 2002. Permission for the landing of foreign military aircraft at Baldonnel is granted subject to the usual stipulations, that the aircraft is unarmed and carries no ammunition, explosives or intelligence gathering equipment. There have been no landings at Baldonnel and no requests for such landings since the present US military movements began in the autumn of 2002.</P>
      <P>I do not have numbers, but my latest information in relation to military aircraft at Shannon is that a very limited number of US airforce planes are currently using Shannon. I understand that US authorities do not anticipate any significant increase in the number of planes using Shannon in the period ahead. A few days' notice is usually given in these cases and we have not been given any indications as yet of further use of the airport. Obviously, a proportion of the civilian aircraft carrying additional US troops to be deployed in the Gulf may land at Shannon, but the usual rules would apply in such cases and they must inform us in such cases.</P>
      <P>Civilian aircraft charted by the US military sometimes transport personal weapons and ammunition over Ireland, but permission for such flights must be sought from the Minister for Transport. However, there is no question of large-scale weaponry being routed to Iraq over Irish sovereign space. The US does not use our air space for that.</P>

      <P>I thank the Taoiseach in advance for the Government's support for our motion on humanitarian aid to Iraq, which is due for debate this evening. At least the Dáil should be able to speak with a single voice on that issue.</P>
      <P>The Taoiseach said that a very limited number of US military aircraft now use facilities at Shannon and that he does not expect a great increase in such usage. Has the Government been informed by the US of the number of overflights taking place. I am informed that on one night ten days ago, there were 63 overflights at 65,000 feet, and they would have refuelling facilities available to them. A court action is due regarding the legitimacy of offering the US the use of facilities at Shannon. The Taoiseach has been at pains to point out that Ireland is not a participant in this war, but what about military personnel who have passed through Shannon and might have been the victims of the suicide bombing in Iraq a number of days ago, or who are involved in the deaths of civilians at Basra? Does that not constitute assistance in the provision of facilities for the war effort? Does it not mean the Taoiseach's claim of non-participation in the war and non-contribution to the US war effort is invalid?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>No, it does not. Under our law, it is clear that US use of facilities at Shannon does not constitute participation on our part. That has been the position down through generations. I know people continue to raise this issue, but the international legal position is that we are not participants in the war. We have provided facilities at Shannon for many different countries since 1955. I do not have exact figures of overflights, but I can obtain them for the Deputy. Over the first 90 days of 2003, 61 military aircraft landed at Shannon. I have seen questions put by Deputy Kenny suggesting that there were ten or 15 flights landing per day and that there were 30 landings on a single weekend, but in the whole 90 day period, only 61 US military aircraft landed at Shannon, and most of those were in January. It is not the case that the US flies heavy weaponry over Shannon. US planes carry personal ammunition but not heavy equipment. Last weekend, all the heavy equipment was flown to Iraq over Germany and France. That is the route the Americans are taking with their heavy equipment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>On the domestic front, I wish to raise the issue of the cuts taking place throughout the country, unknown to many people who are not personally affected. I refer the Taoiseach to a story in <i>The Irish Times</i> this morning about cuts enforced by the Department of Health and Children to save &euro;71,000 which will prevent Enable Ireland from providing hot meals to 53 children with disabilities. Given the scale of the cutbacks in the most vulnerable and deprived parts of the country, does the Taoiseach recall launching the RAPID programme on 8 February 2001 &ndash; RAPID stands for revitalising areas by invest<Col N="42" /> ment and development. This very carefully chosen acronym was intended to convey, before the election, the Government's intention to rapidly address areas of disadvantage.</P>
      <P>The Taoiseach will recall that the programme targeted 25 of the most disadvantaged and deprived areas of the country. Another 20 targeted areas were subsequently added. These were the most deprived areas, according to the Government's statistics, and there was to be a massive transfer of resources. The figure of &euro;1.9 billion was mooted for fast-tracking out of the social inclusion component of the national development plan. Does the Taoiseach know that the plan has collapsed? Does he know that the Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs, Deputy Ó Cuív, went to Tallaght a couple weeks ago and confessed that it had collapsed and that there is no money to meet any of the plans agreed in the 45 targeted areas. The most disadvantaged communities in Ireland were told to create their own plans and that the Government would fast-track funding. There was no question of funding not being provided, but now, as soon as the election is over, the Minister, Deputy Ó Cuív, said &ndash; if I had the time, I would read into the record what he said &ndash; that there is no money.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand that Enable Ireland receives annual grants of &euro;16 million under section 65 of the Health (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2001. The body has a shortfall, between the costs of providing services and the funding received from health boards, of &euro;4 million. Enable Ireland has indicated that deficits have arisen for a number of reasons. A detailed review of the activities of voluntary service providers in the physical and sensory disabilities sector is being carried out jointly by the Department of Health and Children and the health boards to establish the extent of core funding and staffing deficits. It always amazes me in cases where organisations have a budget of &euro;16 million or, in some cases, &euro;100 million that hot meals to children seem to be cut back before anything else. Perhaps this case is different &ndash; I imagine a number of expenditure items in a budget of &euro;16 million could be cut before hot meals to children. The issue is being examined in a detailed review.</P>

Every day the Taoiseach's replies increasingly resemble something from the mad hatter's tea party. He is somehow trying to say there are plans and they are being funded. The Minister responsible, Deputy Ó Cuív, told this House in response to an Adjournment matter I raised, after his announce<Col N="44" /> ment in Tallaght, that there is no funding available for RAPID.</P>

      <P>The full list of the building programme was produced by the Minister for Education and Science in January. At that stage I was asked questions in the House and I said the primary schools building programme in 1997 amounted to &euro;27 million and we were only able to deal with about ten or 12 significant projects. Although slightly less than last year, this year the school buildings programme amounts to &euro;342.9 million. This year the programme will deliver 140 large-scale projects at primary and post-primary levels, which is a significant number. Approximately 430 primary and post-primary schools will, in addition, benefit in some way from the capital <Col N="46" /> programme, namely, for smaller works rather than total replacements.</P>
      <P>An innovative feature of this year's programme is the introduction of a devolved building initiative for small rural primary schools. Many schools will benefit under that programme and the Minister hopes to extend it next year. The budget allocation for 2004 and subsequent years will determine the rate of progress on projects. I know many schools will remain to be dealt with but the Deputy will see we are making enormous changes compared to what we were able to do in the past. Any fair examination would acknowledge that.</P>
      <P>The Department of Education and Science is in negotiation with the Department of Finance to secure a five year funding envelope to address the historical infrastructure deficit at primary and post-primary levels. That would mean the Minister would be able to better indicate to the various schools where we are going in terms of those programmes. It is a significant development plan. Clearly it is not possible to wipe out in the short-term the cumulative deficit of generations, but anyone in the House can see that we are making enormous inroads into that by providing young people with modern, updated and comfortable schools with proper facilities. We will continue to do this.</P>

      <P>I support Deputy Kenny's amendment. Will you, a Cheann Comhairle, inquire on behalf of Members about the rights of Opposition Members given that, this early in its lifetime, the Government takes as a matter of practice that it will guillotine Bills coming before the House? No fewer than six times this week the Government will guillotine a Bill brought before the House. There has never been a precedent such as this in the first year of the lifetime of a Government. A guillotine is a matter of emergency that is resorted to by Government when time is running out or when it is a matter of some importance that a Bill gets through before a certain date. It is unacceptable that we should be asked to do business by rote whereby the Government brings down a guillotine and votes through Bills by superior numbers. That is not the way to enact legislation and, for that reason, I too oppose the Order of Business.</P>

      <P>The Green Party opposes the Order of Business based on the fact that it omits the real need for a further debate on Iraq. I realise the Broadcasting (Major Events Television Coverage) (Amendment) Bill may refer to Iraq if we are talking about television coverage of major events, but it is hardly the most direct way of dealing with the major crisis of our time. Does the Minister for Defence agree that there is a need to include on the Order of Business each week a debate on Iraq which would take into account the unfolding horrors there, the use of Shannon Airport, the civilian casualties and the need to withdraw the Shannon facility before any more innocent people lose their lives?</P>

      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>This debate provides an opportunity for the House to consider the additional measures set out in the Bill which are designed to ensure the continued television coverage of events of major importance to the people of Ireland. Deputies will have the opportunity to express their views on these issues and I am very interested in hearing those views.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Irish television viewers have traditionally enjoyed access to major events, both sporting and <Col N="62" /> otherwise, on free television services. In the past, given the demands on the radio frequency spectrum for broadcasting purposes, the number of broadcasters has been necessarily restricted. In the past ten years, however, the emergence of digital broadcasting services, operated on an almost entirely commercial basis, has changed the broadcasting map considerably. We have seen the emergence of dedicated sports channels which often acquire exclusive broadcasting rights to major sports events and this exclusivity has proved to be a key driver in the uptake of their services. It is undeniable that these channels have provided increased choice to interested fans who can afford to pay the price for such services. The potential of digital broadcasting to vastly increase the capacity for the provision of broadcasting channels has caused revolutionary change. Commercial services have discovered the importance of sport to their schedules. Indeed, the market for any kind of programming with popular appeal is becoming more and more intense leading, in turn, to increased costs in acquiring broadcasting rights. There is clear evidence of coverage of sports events migrating to pay television services on an exclusive basis.</P>
    <P>EU Directive 89/552/EEC, as amended &ndash; the Television Without Frontiers Directive &ndash; recognised that member states should have the right to take measures to ensure that events that are regarded by that member state as &ldquo;events of major importance to society&rdquo; should continue to be available on free television services. The directive rules that it is open to each individual member state to decide whether it wishes to designate events as events of major importance to society. A cornerstone of the directive is that it requires each member state to take measures to protect the interests of other member states which have decided to designate events.</P>
    <P>The Broadcasting (Major Events Television Coverage) Act 1999 incorporated into Irish law the provisions of Article 3a of the Television Without Frontiers Directive. The Act provides that the Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources, may designate certain events as events of major importance to society for which the right of a qualifying broadcaster to provide coverage on free television services should be provided in the public interest.</P>
    <P>Before making such an order, the 1999 Act requires the Minister to first consult with event organisers, broadcasters within the State and members of the public. The Act sets out the procedure which the Minister is obliged to follow in relation to the designation of events. Specifically, the Minister is required to consult with the Minister for Arts, Sports and Tourism; consult with event organisers and broadcasters; publish a proposed list of events; invite comments on the proposed list from members of the public; and lay a draft of the order designating events before both Houses of the Oireachtas for approval. The Minister is also required to have regard to the extent to which the event has a special general reson<Col N="63" /> ance and a generally recognised distinct cultural importance for the people of Ireland.</P>
    <P>Following the enactment of the Broadcasting (Major Events Television Coverage) Act 1999, a process of consultation was initiated in December 1999 when sports event organisers and broadcasters were circulated with a copy of the 1999 Act and asked for comments in relation to the designation of events. Arising from that process it became clear that the designation of sports events was a complex matter and that the main sporting organisations were opposed to their events being designated.</P>
    <P>Shortly after my appointment as Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources, the Football Association of Ireland announced that it had sold the live exclusive rights to broadcast Republic of Ireland home European Championship and World Cup qualifying matches to the British Sky Broadcasting Group. I immediately ordered that the consultation process should be recommenced. In July last I received Government approval to publish a draft list of events that I proposed to designate as events of major importance, which should, in the public interest, continue to be available on free television services.</P>
    <P>Immediately following the Government decision I met with representatives of the FAI, the Irish Rugby Football Union and the Gaelic Athletic Association to inform them of the decision to proceed with the designation process. My officials held further meetings with these organisations and also held meetings with representatives of the International Rugby Board and the Association of Irish Racecourses.</P>
    <P>A notice with details of the proposed list and inviting written comments from members of the public was published in four national newspapers on 19 July 2002. Members of the public had until 16 August to submit comments. At the same time my Department wrote to sports events organisers and broadcasters to formally seek their views on the proposed list. In order to further enhance the consultation process, an on-line forum was established on my Department's website and I hosted and addressed a public meeting which was held in Dublin Castle on 26 August 2002. That meeting was also addressed by RTE and the Irish Sports Council. The IRFU, the FAI and the GAA were invited to make presentations at the meeting but they declined the invitation to attend. I had further meetings with the FAI, the IRFU, the GAA and the Irish Sports Council on 28 August 2002. Having concluded the consultation process, I then proceeded to finalise the list.</P>
    <P>As required, I also sought the opinion of the EU Contact Committee established under Article 3a of the Television Without Frontiers Directive. That committee considered the measures proposed to be taken by Ireland at its meeting on 31 January and gave the opinion that it had no objection to the measures proposed.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="64" />A draft of the Broadcasting (Major Events Television Coverage) Act 1999 (Designation of Major Events) Order 2003, was laid before both Houses of the Oireachtas on 28 February 2003. A resolution approving the draft order was passed by this House on 6 March and in Seanad Éireann on 12 March 2003. I signed the order designating events under the Broadcasting (Major Events Television Coverage) Act 1999 on 13 March 2003. A copy of the order is available in the Oireachtas Library.</P>
    <P>In accordance with Article 3a of the Television Without Frontiers Directive, the designation order will only have legal force following the publication in the <i>Official Journal of the European Communities</i> of a notice of the measures which Ireland has taken. The Commission has indicated that a notice will be published shortly.</P>
    <P>It was clear to me from the consultation process that there was a strong case for amending the 1999 Act. Throughout the designation process I have tried to adhere to the principle of being proportionate. While acting to protect the public interest, I also had to take account of the interests of event organisers and of broadcasters. I believe that the list of events to be designated reflects a balanced and proportionate approach.</P>
    <P>The amending legislation also follows this principle and provides for an arbitration process for event organisers and qualifying broadcasters in relation to the terms for broadcasting rights to a designated event; a fast-track mechanism through the High Court to fix terms for broadcasting rights where the date of an event is close at hand; and a mechanism to deal with circumstances where a qualifying broadcaster has not acquired broadcasting rights to a designated event, but a non-qualifying broadcaster has.</P>
    <P>The question of arbitration arose a number of times during the consultation process. Some of the sports organisations argued that competition in the domestic market for Irish television sports rights is limited by the number of qualifying broadcasters in the State.</P>
    <P>The Act provides that a broadcaster can be deemed to be a qualifying broadcaster if it provides coverage to over 90% of the population of the State on a free television service. I am working on the assumption that both RTE and TV3 are qualifying broadcasters. Notwithstanding that there are two qualifying broadcasters in the State, sports event organisers argue that RTE remains the only real potential purchaser of television rights. They also argue that until now they had been able to use the possibility of a sale of rights to a non-qualifying broadcaster as leverage for securing a reasonable price from RTE and as a means of securing coverage for their domestic games. Some of the sports organisations expressed the view that designation could negatively impact on their negotiating power with a qualifying broadcaster. They argued this on the basis that non-qualifying broadcasters are less likely to be interested in purchasing the rights to their events if those events are designated as <Col N="65" /> events of major importance that should continue to be available on free television services. Accordingly, sports events organisers argue that they will, in effect, be forced to deal only with RTE and that designation will weaken their position in future negotiations with RTE. This would, in turn, reduce the level of funding available for the development of their sports.</P>
    <P>Several sports organisations, in referring to the provisions of the Broadcasting (Major Events Television Coverage) Act 1999 point to the fact that it does not provide for arbitration between an event organiser and a qualifying broadcaster. During the public consultation process a number of the sports organisations put forward the idea of an arbitration mechanism to determine a fair price for a listed event. I have seriously considered their concerns.</P>
    <P>Given the limitations of the Irish market and my wish to be proportionate in relation to the extent of State intervention in the market, I decided the Broadcasting (Major Events Television Coverage) Act 1999 should be amended to provide for an arbitration process between event organisers and a qualifying broadcaster to determine a fair market price. Section 5 provides for a non-binding arbitration mechanism. The next important matter for which the Bill provides is a fast-track mechanism through the High Court to fix terms for broadcasting rights, where the date of the event is close at hand.</P>
    <P>Section 4 provides this mechanism. This is an important provision if the over-riding objective of ensuring that the designated events continue to be available to be carried on free television services is to be achieved. Section 4 also deals with circumstances where a qualifying broadcaster has not acquired broadcasting rights to a designated event, but a non-qualifying broadcaster has. This provision provides for circumstances where a contract with a non-qualifying broadcaster is already in place at the time of designation and also provides for future contracts. The Bill also sets out the criteria which the High Court must have regard to in determining reasonable market rates. In addition, the Bill provides that the Minister may, in the public interest, require an event organiser to provide the Minister with a copy of any agreement entered into by the event organiser with a broadcaster.</P>
    <P>The Bill's provisions are designed to strengthen the existing statutory provisions contained in the principal Act for the purpose of ensuring that a substantial proportion of the Irish population are not deprived of the opportunity of continuing to watch designated events on free television services.</P>
    <P>Section 1 is the interpretation section and contains the definitions used throughout the Bill. Section 2 provides that the Bill applies to all events designated under the principal Act and to any contracts in relation to those events entered into after 13 November 1999, which was the date on which the principal Act was enacted. Section 3, for the purposes of clarification, amends the <Col N="66" /> definition of &ldquo;the Minister&rdquo; as defined in the 1999 Act to read the &ldquo;Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Section 4 provides for a fast-track mechanism for determining terms for broadcasting rights in circumstances where no deal is in place with a qualifying broadcaster and the date of an event is drawing near. It provides that the High Court may fix the terms upon which the event organiser must give rights to a qualifying broadcaster.</P>
    <P>Section 4(1) provides that where an event organiser has not, within 28 days of the event taking place, entered into a contract with a qualifying broadcaster, then a qualifying broadcaster may request the High Court to direct the event organiser to give it rights to the event. Section 4(2) allows for the possibility that the High Court may not have sufficient time to make a final decision in relation to the terms upon which rights are to be given. This subsection provides that the High Court may direct that rights be given to a qualifying broadcaster even though the terms, including price, have not yet been fixed. It is important that the High Court be given this flexibility. If faced with a very short period to make a decision, the court might not have sufficient time to make an informed decision as to what would constitute &ldquo;reasonable market rates.&rdquo;  This should not stop the court from taking steps to protect the public interest by determining that a qualifying broadcaster may secure rights to the event. Section 4(3) establishes the principle that an event organiser can decide that an event is not to be televised.</P>
    <P>The provisions of section 4 will not apply where an event organiser has decided not to sell broadcasting rights and has informed me of its decision before a qualifying broadcaster makes an application to the High Court under subsection (1). While there was a time in the past where event organisers might have decided not to have their events televised to ensure good attendance, it is difficult to envisage circumstances where this would apply in relation to the events to be designated. Section 4(4) provides that the High Court may appoint an arbitrator to assist the court with the computation of reasonable market rates. This provision is designed to be of assistance to the High Court in making a determination as to reasonable market rates for the acquisition of broadcasting rights to a designated event. Section 4(5) provides that the High Court may give procedural directions to the arbitrator, including the fixing of the period in which the arbitrator must issue the award. This provision is designed to be of assistance to the High Court in making a determination as to reasonable market rates for the acquisition of broadcasting rights to a designated event.</P>
    <P>Section 4(6) provides that a qualifying broadcaster may withdraw its application to the High Court under subsection (1) after reasonable market rates have been set, but before the court makes its final order and in circumstances where the court has indicated that it will determine <Col N="67" /> reasonable market rates after the event has taken place. In these circumstances the High Court may award costs as it considers appropriate and may have regard to the intention of the broadcaster making the application. The purpose of designating an event is to prevent an event which has been traditionally available on free television services from migrating to pay-per-view or subscription services on an exclusive basis only. This is achieved by ensuring that qualifying broadcasters have an opportunity to provide coverage of an event subject to the payment of reasonable market rates to the event organiser. The decision to pay the asking price for an event was, and will continue to be, the prerogative of the broadcaster. If the qualifying broadcaster decides not to pay the price fixed by the High Court, then the event organiser is free to sell broadcasting rights to any broadcaster.</P>
    <P>Section 4(7) provides that the High Court may, from time to time, issue such directions in relation to arbitration under this section as it considers just and proper. This provision is designed to be of assistance to the High Court in making a determination as to reasonable market rates for the acquisition of broadcasting rights to a designated event.</P>
    <P>Section 4(8) addresses the possibility of more than one qualifying broadcaster applying to the High Court for access to a designated event. As long as the event is made available to a qualifying broadcaster the event organiser should be free to choose to which qualifying broadcaster it sells rights. Section 4(9) recognises the fact that an event organiser may be a party to an existing contract with a non-qualifying broadcaster. This provision would apply in the case of the existing contract between the FAI and Sky and would also apply to any future case where an event organiser has a contract with a non-qualifying broadcaster. It provides that where the High Court is considering an application made under subsection (1), and where there is an existing contract with a non-qualifying broadcaster, that the court shall decide to whom and in what proportion moneys in respect of reasonable market rates should be paid.</P>
    <P>Section 4(10) provides that the High Court may adjust, as it considers appropriate, the terms of an existing contract between an event organiser and a non-qualifying broadcaster. Section 4(11) provides that the High Court may when considering an application under subsection (1) make any interim or interlocutory order as it considers appropriate.</P>
    <P>Section 5 of the Bill provides for a voluntary and non-binding arbitration mechanism to assist event organisers and qualifying broadcasters to agree terms for broadcasting rights to designated events. This section of the Bill provides a framework for the two parties to agree terms where negotiations have failed to result in an agreement. Section 5(1) affirms that the arbitration process <Col N="68" /> provided for in section 5 relates to circumstances where an event organiser is willing to sell broadcasting rights to a designated event to a qualifying broadcaster and where terms have not been agreed.</P>
    <P>Section 5(2) provides that either party may request the other to agree to the appointment of an arbitrator for the purposes of fixing reasonable market rates. Where the parties are unable to agree on the appointment of an arbitrator, this subsection provides that I may appoint an arbitrator within 21 days of being notified.</P>
    <P>Section 5(3) provides that the Arbitration Acts 1954 to 1998 apply to an arbitration under this section. Section 5(4) provides that the arbitrator shall issue an award in writing which shall be a provisional award. The arbitrator shall notify the parties of the award. Section 5(5) sets out the steps to be taken by an event organiser and a qualifying broadcaster if they are to agree a contract on the basis of the terms of an arbitrator's award.</P>
    <P>Section 6 provides the criteria to which the High Court or an arbitrator must have regard when determining reasonable market rates under sections 4 or 5 of the Bill or under section 5 of the principal Act. Section 7 provides that the Minister can require an event organiser to provide him or her with a copy of any agreement it has entered into with any broadcaster in respect of a designated event, where he or she considers it in the public interest to do so. Section 8 is procedural and sets out how the directions and notifications required under the Bill may be served while section 9 provides for the Short Title.</P>
    <P>Both the FAI and the IRFU wrote to me recently suggesting a number of amendments. My officials have met them to consider the issues raised. These are under consideration and I am open to amending the Bill if it is considered to be justifiable and necessary. I will deal with this matter further on Committee Stage.</P>

      <P>I will do so between now and Committee Stage. I believe there is widespread support by the public that certain events which are of major importance to society must continue to be available on free television services on a near universal coverage basis. Full participation in society requires that individuals should not be excluded from following events of major importance on the basis of inability to pay.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have no doubt that the public will welcome and support the provisions of the Bill. I am sure Deputies will agree that given the important role that sports play in the life of our country, it is essential that sports events of major importance are accessible to the widest possible number of viewers via free television. Access to such events should not be restricted to those who can afford to pay the rates demanded by subscription or pay-<Col N="69" /> per-view television services. I commend the Bill to the House.</P>

      <P>We do not need to be reminded that we are a sports crazy country, both as fans and participants. Last weekend was significant. The Six Nations rugby tournament reached its climax, but unfortunately, the result did not go our way. However, it was a tremendous sporting spectacle. Last Saturday, the European Championships qualifier involving Ireland and Georgia produced a favourable result. Padraig Harrington and Darren Clarke performed very well in the players championship in Sawgrass in the United States. The GAA engaged in its usual hectic schedule of national league games at this time of the year, which included huge fixtures, such as the match involving Cork and Tipperary.</P>
      <P>Part of what it means to be Irish is expressed on the sports field every weekend. In view of this, I subscribe to the principle of creating a list of key sporting events to protect for free to view television. However, there are other responsibilities to consider when dealing with this legislation. We need to ensure that we treat fairly the sporting bodies, the two main broadcasters, RTE and TV3, the other broadcasters, such as Sky, who do not have the right under this legislation to go to court, and, most importantly, the public.</P>
      <P>The main purpose of the Bill is to strengthen existing legislation and statutory provisions contained in the Broadcasting (Major Events Television Coverage) Act 1999, to ensure that the majority of the Irish population would not be deprived of an opportunity to watch sporting events of national importance on a free television service. This should have happened two years ago, but instead, following the success of the Irish soccer team in the World Cup finals in Japan and South Korea last summer, there was uproar when Sky secured sole rights to broadcast live Irish home games for the European Championship qualifiers. That controversy led to the Government belatedly taking action. Two years ago it could, and should, have addressed the problem by putting in place a structure to secure and name key sporting events for free to air viewing.</P>
      <P>The original Act incorporated into Irish law the provisions of Article 3a of the European Union Television Without Frontiers Directive, allowing member states to designate certain events as events of major importance to be shown on a free to air basis. Preceding this Second Stage debate, the Minister published a list of events to be designated. A number of weeks ago the House confirmed and approved, as it needed to, the list following brief statements. At the time I said I looked forward to the opportunity to debate a number of concerns regarding the legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="70" />I welcome the consultation process outlined by the Minister. Many sporting bodies have expressed concerns about their ability to negotiate a fair deal in payment terms for access to coverage of events. It should not be forgotten that television coverage for most of the sporting bodies concerned is the main source of income for the promotion and structuring of their sport nationally. For example, in its negotiations for Six Nations coverage, an exception was made for the IFFU because of its links with the Scottish and Welsh rugby unions. I welcome that. It shows the Department was listening during the consultation process. As a result, the Six Nations championship is designated on a deferred basis, although that is academic because RTE has secured rights for the next number of years.</P>
    <P>Funding is an imperative to the success of any sporting body. The ability to negotiate a fair price is a legitimate concern. In view of this, an arbitration mechanism has been included under section 5 to deal with occasions when a sporting body cannot agree a price figure for coverage of a designated event with RTE or, in some circumstances, TV3. As I understand it, if two bodies &ndash; a broadcaster and sporting body &ndash; are unable to agree on a fair market price for a designated event, a likely scenario in some cases, they will seek a solution from an arbitrator. This process would be similar to the use of the Labour Court in industrial relations disputes. The first step would be agreement on an arbitrator. What happens if this is not possible? The Minister is indicating he would have the power to appoint one. I welcome that, although it is not clear from the explanatory memorandum.</P>
    <P>The arbitration recommendation will not be binding. If, for example, RTE considers that the figure provided by the arbitrator is too high it can ignore it and go to court. This severely weakens the arbitration process and the ability of a sporting body to negotiate aggressively to get the best possible price because it knows that the arbitration figure can be totally ignored by the broadcaster.</P>
    <P>If the arbitration figure is not agreed, the broadcaster can go to court within 28 days of the event to ensure it can have access to it. I have problems with this part of the process also. If it is the case that the court decides an arbitration figure, which it will have to do to recommend a price the broadcaster needs to pay to the sporting body, and the broadcaster decides that this is too high a figure to pay then within the space of perhaps two weeks before an event starts, RTE may decide to pull out. It may say it cannot afford it. Then we may be faced with a situation where a sporting body may have two weeks to try to negotiate with a non-qualifying broadcaster to cover an event. In an extreme scenario it is possible, and there is a loophole here, that the event may not be covered at all because the two qualifying broadcasters, RTE and TV3, may not be able to afford the price set out by the arbitrator or by the <Col N="71" /> court. This may occur close to the date when the event is due to happen.</P>
    <P>We have gone to the trouble of debating and have undergone a consultation process to confirm that these key events, whether soccer, rugby, horse racing, the Olympics or Gaelic games, will be available. If we are serious about ensuring that they are covered on free-to-view television, we must ensure that if the broadcasters take the final step of going to court to ensure they get access to cover an event that they are also bound by the court decision in regard to the price they are to pay for access for the event.</P>
    <P>I can understand why the figure of the arbitrator may not be binding. Essentially, that is a recommendation. I understand the argument for not making that decision binding but if the decision of the court is to be binding for the sporting body, it should also be binding for the broadcaster. If the broadcaster takes a sporting body to court and is asked to pay &euro;500,000 for access to a certain event or series of events and the fee is set at a date close to the event itself the broadcaster should be forced to pay it and to cover the event regardless of the price set out by the court. That is my fundamental concern in regard to this legislation.</P>
    <P>Essentially the negotiation process, as a result of what we are doing here, is stacked in favour of the broadcaster to the disadvantage of the sporting body. At no stage during the negotiation process does the sporting body have any power to negotiate. All it can say is &ldquo;no&rdquo; and that it wants to go to arbitration. If TV3 or RTE reject the arbitration figure, the sporting body has no choice but to accept that and to wait for the qualifying broadcasters to take them to court to get access. Again, at no stage during the process does the sporting body have the power to reject arbitration figures but the broadcaster does.</P>
    <P>The ability of broadcasters to maximise the financial return, which is limited anyway because the process is essentially between two broadcasters, is severely restricted under the proposals we are making here on Second Stage. For that reason, I will bring forward amendments on Committee Stage, on behalf of Fine Gael, to try to address some of those concerns. I would be interested to hear the Minister's views. I was glad to hear he has an open mind towards looking at amendments on Committee Stage. Fine Gael supports this legislation in principle although it should have happened a long time ago. We will not oppose the Bill on Second Stage because we are looking forward to getting it into committee where we can discuss it in more detail.</P>
    <P>Another concern I have in regard to this legislation concerns the legal issues surrounding the contract that was signed and the deal that was done between the FAI, Sky and TV3. The deal that was announced by Sky last September-October was a valid contract at the time and recognised in law to be so. My understanding is <Col N="72" /> that there is a question mark over the legality of the Government's effective overturning of a legally recognised signed contract between Sky and the FAI.</P>
    <P>The Television Without Frontiers Directive allows, but does not require, member states within the EU to draw up lists of designated events for free-to-view television. There would be no ambiguity in law if we were required under an EU directive to draw up this list and therefore make the Sky deal with the FAI irrelevant. As we are not required to do that, but merely allowed to do it should we want to, there is a legal doubt over whether we can effectively destroy the contract and deal that has been done between the FAI and Sky. The consequence may well be that when this legislation is passed, the FAI may decide to go to court to defend its contract with Sky and at a minimum may look for some compensation. If the State needs to pay out compensation to the FAI, a realistic possibility though it may not be a probability, it is due to the Government's incompetence in not putting together this list two years ago when it should have. It is as a result of that incompetence that we may now be faced with having to pay out compensation to a sporting body that feels genuinely aggrieved, having done a good financial deal for itself in September. It now has its contract overturned because we have the ability to do that under an EU directive, as opposed to being required to do it through an EU directive.</P>
    <P>Will the Minister outline in his summing up whether he has received any legal advice from the Attorney General as to whether he feels confident that compensation will not be an issue if the FAI decides to challenge this legislation and the consequences for its signed contract? If he feels that compensation may be an issue, will he outline at what level?</P>
    <P>This Bill is welcome in principle. It is about ensuring that sports fans across the country see their national team competing or see events that are of significant sporting importance to Ireland and are able to access them. In particular it ensures that people who are living in rural regions of Ireland who may not have access to cable or satellite channels will not be disadvantaged in the sporting context. Sport is of such importance to many people and to social life in Ireland that it needs to be protected on a certain level to ensure that we have free-to-view television. It could be argued that it is not free because people are paying a licence fee but they are not paying specifically to watch an event to which in the past they had access free of charge.</P>
    <P>Fine Gael supports Second Stage of this Bill but with the caveat that we have concerns in regard to striking a balance between treating fairly the qualifying broadcasters, RTE and TV3 on the one hand to ensure they get a fair deal and are not overcharged for covering events, and on the other hand, that sporting bodies, who rely heavily on these events in particular for significant financial return, have the power to negotiate <Col N="73" /> a good deal for themselves to ensure they can reinvest the money from the television coverage of these events in their respective sports.</P>
    <P>I look forward to tabling amendments to reflect my concerns on Committee Stage.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Deenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am delighted to have an opportunity to speak on the Bill. I read in an article from <i>The Irish Times </i>of October 1998 that according to the Minister for Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands legislation to protect major sporting and cultural events from being available only on subscription television would be introduced. The Government had accepted her proposal to ensure some events remained available on free-to-air television services. This would have enabled the then Minister to draw up a list of such major events. Her plan was the fourth attempt in two years to draft legislation to reflect domestic and European concern at the increasing number of sporting events being bought for subscription or pay-per-view television services. We have waited four and a half years for the proposal before the House. It would probably never have happened were it not for the FAI deal with Sky which would have turned in &euro;7.5 million and about which there was much fuss last summer at a time when soccer fever was high. The Minister had just taken over the ministry and would not be here this evening were it not for the public revulsion at the time that the Irish home games would not be free-to-air for spectators all over the country and that trend could continue into other sports, be it Gaelic football, rugby or other major sports. The Government was forced to act and act it did. I welcome the Bill before the House even though it is four and a half years late in arriving.</P>
      <P>Regarding the designated events listed, I made the point previously that while it was difficult for the Minister to be inclusive of major events here, certainly in Gaelic games, semi-finals, quarter finals and even a Munster hurling final can be a major sporting event. I wonder why he did not consider going below just the All-Ireland county finals in both hurling and football? If he will not consider other events, I would have no problem with the events that are designated. I am sure that in time the Minister can add events to the list if he so wishes.</P>

      <P>As has been said many times here, the influence of sport on all our people and especially on our young people cannot be underestimated. It is important that our young people have access to all the sporting events of interest at a particular time, especially when our national team is playing whether in rugby, soccer or compromise rules in the future. On the last occasion on which I addressed this issue a month or so ago, I said we are becoming a nation of spectators. There is so much demand for this designation of events that people have become <Col N="74" /> dependent on watching television. When all of us were young we watched the match on television and went out and played it afterwards in our back gardens, at cross-roads or at the local sports field.</P>

      <P>Not always. Unfortunately, that is not the case nowadays. Since the Minister has a responsibility here, perhaps the aspects of involvement and participation could be attached so that the event organiser and the broadcaster would engage in the promotion of healthy living and fitness. There should be a requirement for positive messages about fitness and participation rather than watching as a fan or a supporter.</P>
      <P>An issue which is of genuine concern to the sporting organisations was mentioned by the Minister. There are just a few revenue streams open to the major organisations, one of which is revenue through television coverage. Without the revenue stream from television coverage, the IRFU, the GAA and the FAI could be deprived of the possibilities which their games provide them, for providing money for development work at grass roots level. At present there is competition between the main sporting organisations regarding coaching in schools and providing a whole range of services to schools and clubs across the country. The IRFU has approximately 300 development officers on the ground. The FAI has a regional structure extending to club level in counties and the GAA is following suit. Money is needed to fund the whole structure and the revenue stream from broadcasting of television coverage is very important.</P>
      <P>It is important that RTE and TV3 are fair. While the Minister has set up an arbitration mechanism to determine reasonable market rates for a designated event, it is important that RTE and TV3 realise that for the national organisations of the sports involved television coverage is very important for their revenue stream. It is one of the few sources of revenue they can get to encourage young people to participate at grass roots level and to develop in those young people the skills that will, I hope, win Ireland international acclaim in the future. It is important that the balance is kept right, on the one hand that these games are free to air in order that the vast array of supporters and fans across the country, in what is a sports mad country, can see the match live on television without any cost and on the other that the sporting organisations can capitalise on these major events to gain important revenue. That must be a prime consideration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Generally speaking, despite improvements in recent years, mainly because of the introduction of the national lottery and increased commercial<Col N="75" /> ism, there is more finance available to support sport. Nevertheless, compared to other countries sport in Ireland is still underfunded. The support given to the English rugby team, for example, compared with that for the Irish team makes this obvious. The network of resources in place at grass roots level throughout England includes quality coaching for children playing rugby and soccer. While facilities are improving in Ireland it is clear why athletes in the English system are of a higher quality than ours. More money is being spent in the English system at all levels. That is an important consideration.</P>
    <P>I hope this legislation will be monitored in the future and that the arbitration mechanism and recourse to the courts will work effectively. Deputy Coveney raised a number of pertinent issues to which I hope the Minister will respond.</P>
    <P>I am not aware of any precedent for this legislation. Is it modelled on legislation in other countries or is it completely new and designed to address Irish issues? Is a similar mechanism in place in other countries for arbitration and recourse to the courts? I would like to hear the Minister expand on that aspect of the Bill. Will the &euro;5.5 million deal between Mr. Rupert Murdoch and the FAI for the exclusive TV rights for Ireland's home internationals in the qualifying stages of the 2004 European championships be a matter for the courts to settle? Can this legislation be made retrospective to ensure that it covers that agreement? </P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill which I hope will have the effect of encouraging young people to become involved in sport by making free coverage of sporting events more widely available to them.</P>

      <P>The Labour Party welcomes the Bill. However, we deplore the fact that the legislation has been so long delayed and has had to come forward as a remedy for a piece of delayed and botched legislation, the Broadasting (Major Events Television Coverage) Act 1999. The 1999 Act attempted to implement the <i>Television sans Frontières </i>Directive. That directive laid down that each member state should ensure that broadcasters &ldquo;under its jurisdiction do not broadcast, on an exclusive basis, events which are regarded by that member state as being of major importance for society, in such as way as to deprive a substantial proportion of the public in that member state of the possibility of following such events via live coverage or deferred coverage on free television.&rdquo;  A key element of EU Directive 89/552, as amended by Directive 97/36, is that the Government &ldquo;shall do so in a clear and transparent manner in due and effective time.&rdquo;  Has there ever been an action of Government which <Col N="76" /> has failed to fulfil a clear directive at European level? The Government has not followed the directive. The six years of this Government's history has been a period of lamentable failure to implement, in an efficient and transparent manner, the requirements of the <i>Television sans Frontières </i>Directive.</P>
      <P>It is the Irish sports fans who have lost out. When the Minister took office last year he found that two and a half years' work, which should have been carried out after the 1999 Act, had not been done. With a red face he appeared on television and tried to undo the damage done when the FAI signed up to the &euro;8 million package with BSkyB. Given that the former Minister for Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands, Deputy de Valera, failed so lamentably, it is no wonder that the Minister for Finance is in a committee this evening trying to prevent us from seeing the papers which would allow us to discover what happened during those two and a half years.</P>
      <P>I agree with Deputy Deenihan's comment regarding the way in which people have become spectators of sport rather than participants in it. BSkyB has driven that development. I deplore the practice of matches taking place at 12.30 p.m. on Saturday after Saturday. Young men crowd into hostelries to watch these matches and spend the rest of the day imbibing copious amounts of alcohol. The matches usually feature Manchester United, a team I support myself.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TommyBroughan" hpid="Mr. Broughan Mr. Broughan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Broughan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach also supports them. It is deplorable that this practice has grown up. This ruthless merchandising of great public events such as the Manchester United matches by the Sky organisation is one of the issues the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform and the Commission on Liquor Licensing should discuss.</P>
      <P>The Labour Party has serious concerns about this Bill. Our most grave concern relates to the reference in the 1999 legislation to reasonable and fair market prices. How are they to be determined, given the FAI-BSkyB deal? If the Minister has not received submissions from broadcasters in this regard he might consider the amendment which will be tabled by the Labour Party on this matter on Committee Stage.</P>
      <P>We are also concerned about the existing contract regarding Irish football and the effective powers of the High Court under sections 4(9) and 4(10). The Labour Party wishes to strengthen the powers of the High Court in this regard. We also have a particular interest in the review of designation. The Minister has said the designation period would be two years but, given some of the decisions made in this regard, it should perhaps be included in the legislation itself.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I pay tribute to my colleague, Deputy Michael D. Higgins. As Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht, President of the European Council of <Col N="77" /> Culture Ministers and President of the European Council of Broadcasting Ministers, he helped to bring into law the <i>Television sans Frontières </i>legislation and Protocol 52 of the Treaty of Amsterdam. Deputy Michael D. Higgins's view when he was Minister with responsibility for this area was that great sporting and cultural events are acts of communication to which all people across Europe, and specifically in this State, have an absolute right. It should not be possible for some rich monopoly group to come along and take away the right to view free-to-air major events in the life of the nation. Last Saturday and Sunday were two examples when our two national football teams were engaged in events which had a tremendous resonance across the nation &ndash; the association football team on Saturday and the rugby football team, sadly less successfully, on Sunday. Early on Sunday afternoon, parts of the country came to a stop.</P>
    <P>A few weeks ago Deputy Michael D. Higgins rightly deplored the fact that organisations such as that of Rupert Murdoch and the Kirch Media organisation in Germany have been able to put a vice-like grip on major sporting events such as the World Cup and the Olympic Games. I hope that with this legislation we will bring to fruition the aspirations of that former Minister. Given that this policy was in existence when the rainbow Government left office it seems incredible that we had to wait until 1999 for the Broadcasting (Major Events Television Coverage) Act. Designation was addressed in section 2 of that Act and consultation in section 3. It is difficult to understand why the Minister of the day, Deputy de Valera, and her colleagues did not consult the major sporting organisations and broadcasters prior to framing the Act. Why was it put forward without addressing all of the issues of concern to the GAA, the FAI and the IRFU? I do not think the Minister can have any effective answer to that.</P>
    <P>Section 3 laid down a very clear programme of action which the Minister was supposed to take following the enactment of the legislation, which was highlighted by my colleague, Deputy Gilmore, when the deal emerged between the FAI and BSkyB last July. Section 6 of the 1999 Act also laid out a process of civil remedy for event organisers and broadcasters, although it has to be said that the Act also refers to reasonable market rates without giving any indication of how this could be arrived at. In that context the Minister has advanced the situation somewhat today in sections 4 and 5.</P>
    <P>On Committee Stage of the 1999 Act another colleague of mine, the then Labour Party spokesperson, Deputy O'Shea, tried valiantly to amend the Bill to ensure that the concerns in regard to designation were addressed so that what transpired in regard to satellite television could be anticipated. He wanted to ensure that the procedures contained in sections 2 and 3 would be implemented within six months. The then Minister, Deputy de Valera, adamantly refused to <Col N="78" /> allow that. She just did not seem to want to know. While the issues at stake here were advanced in the United Kingdom, Italy and Denmark, the previous Fianna Fáil-PD Administration sat on its hands. There was a famous case in Denmark which ultimately went to the House of Lords because a company was registered in the UK.</P>
    <P>I commend the Minister for making documentation available to Members in regard to the submissions to him on the designation of certain events as events of major importance to society under Article 3a of the Television Without Frontiers Directive and section 2(1) of the Broadcasting (Major Events Television Coverage) Act 1999. This was put on the Department's website in October 2002. The report reveals that the GAA, the FAI and the IRFU were written to in December 1999. There were a few desultory submissions and meetings early in 2000 after which the matter fell into abeyance. Nothing seems to have happened for at least two years. It appears to be Deputy Dermot Ahern's destiny to pick up the pieces; he is currently picking up the pieces in regard to areas of the marine issues, communications and, now, in regard to the broadcasting sector.</P>
    <P>Irish fans lost out on a number of significant matches and a new area of uncertainty was opened up in regard to the EU directive and the 1999 legislation. The Taoiseach is probably the common link in the chain of events from the passage of the Act in 1999 to the disastrous move by the Football Association of Ireland in July of last year. He waged a sustained and vindictive campaign against the FAI over a proposed Eircom stadium. The Football Association of Ireland had costed and planned the new 45,000-seater stadium in south-west Dublin and was well on the way to achieving this ambition. At the same time, the ill-fated, monstrous Abbotstown project was directed from the Taoiseach's Department by Mr. Paddy Teahon <i>et al</i> at the helm. Since then they have all been censured by the Comptroller and Auditor General at the Committee of Public Accounts for this vainglorious project of an 80,000-seater stadium.</P>
    <P>We had a ludicrous and sinister campaign whose shameful and undemocratic background was investigated a few weeks ago by RTE's &ldquo;Prime Time&rdquo;. The Minister for Defence, Deputy Michael Smith, would not allow the stadium to be built near Baldonnell on the most ludicrous and spurious grounds. The hard-working men and women of junior soccer who toil constantly in leagues like the Leinster league, the AUL and the Brenfor were all great supporters of Eircom park and were bitterly disappointed by what happened in regard to it. It is heartening to see an official from under age football, Mr. Brian Kerr, in charge of the Irish senior football team.</P>
    <P>Events from the summer of 2000 also place the Taoiseach at the centre of the failure to follow-up on the 1999 Act. On a famous walkabout in the constituency of Dublin Central there was a media perception that he was going to call a gen<Col N="79" /> eral election at any time. During the following year or 18 months our affairs were watched closely by Mr. Murdoch and his media empire. It is clear that the Television Without Frontiers Directive and the 1999 Act were anathema to the Murdoch organisation. Can it be any wonder that on his first day back in power the Taoiseach opened a new printing press for Murdoch's News International in County Meath? The major director of BSkyB and one of the world's foremost media moguls was hailed by him as one of the most outstanding Australian figures of modern times. The Taoiseach was well aware of the role Mr. Murdoch played in Australian politics &ndash; supporting the Australian Labour Party and then viciously turning against it &ndash; the role he played in British politics in support of the Conservative Party before turning viciously against it and, recently, in support of the British Labour Party.</P>
    <P>In examining the reasons for the mysterious two year lacuna of inaction, the answer may well lie in a desire to appease the magnate who runs BSkyB and News International. In July 2002, an embarrassed Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources, Deputy Dermot Ahern, had to try to pick up the pieces following the painful news of the FAI-BSkyB deal. I commend him on going through a consultation process over the past six or seven months. It is regrettable that on 26 August 2002, the IRFU, FAI and GAA declined his invitation to come to Dublin Castle and talk openly about these issues. I also welcome the fact that the Minister finally submitted a list to the EU contact committee. A few weeks ago, the designation list was produced.</P>
    <P>In relation to designation, the Minister told us today and, I think, also told the Seanad that, following all the consultations he had decided to act in a proportionate way. He felt his role was to try to protect the public interest in relation to the EU directive while taking account of the needs of event organisers and broadcasters. That is fair enough as far as it goes. Clearly, the organisations concerned have played a very powerful and wonderful role in Irish life over the past 100 years, or even longer in some cases. We obviously must take cognisance of their needs.</P>
    <P>The GAA, in its submission, made a strong case for non-designation of all its events other than the All Ireland finals on the basis of the domestic nature of its support. It said that it would never sell its product to a foreign-based broadcaster, although it has featured heavily on broadcasting outlets not based in this jurisdiction. I would agree with Deputy Deenihan that, particularly with the back door system in both hurling and football, there are other matches that constitute national events. Most people would view the 2002 match between Armagh and Dublin, or various Dublin matches over the years, as such <Col N="80" /> occasions. These are events the Minister might look at again&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="TommyBroughan" hpid="Mr. Broughan Mr. Broughan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Broughan</NameTxt>
      <P>I outlined the probable background to the FAI's deal with BSkyB and the treatment of the FAI in recent times. The FAI, in its interesting submission, made a good case that the national team is its only great money spinner. It is fundamental to the organisation, given the nature of the domestic league and the fact that 150 to 200 of our best footballers live and work professionally in the English leagues, with a few in Scotland. It is striking that most of the designation discussed in the House a few weeks ago applies to Irish football, to the home and away qualifying games for the European Championship and the World Cup. The FAI also made a plea for market forces to be allowed to dictate prices.</P>
      <P>Notwithstanding the case made by the FAI, the Minister was right to proceed as he did. The only way to compensate the FAI now is for the Minister for Arts, Sport and Tourism, Deputy O'Donoghue, to proceed immediately to help the FAI to build a national stadium, whether it is shared with the IRFU or whatever. It is lamentable that association football has done so badly over the years in terms of national lottery grants and other sources of funding. I looked recently at the half built stadium of Shamrock Rovers in the centre of Tallaght, a team I followed strongly in my youth and whose results I would still look out for. It is only in a country like ours that this would be allowed to happen and that a leading club would not to be supported to the hilt.</P>
      <P>There has also been controversy as to whether Six Nations rugby matches should be designated. I accept the point the IRFU made in its submission about the pool structure for financing its sport, but given their national importance and viewing figures, there is a case for also including these matches in the designation. Looking at the designation list, one would be suspicious at times that the Minister perhaps yielded to more powerful vested interests in the IRFU and the GAA but not to association football and other sports that are not as strong.</P>
      <P>There are other major sporting events such as horse races. However, the Department's recommendations document makes little reference to cultural events. That should be kept under review. One can think of major cultural events in which the whole nation would have a very strong interest. I am thinking in particular of when our own super-group, U2, was given the freedom of the city of Dublin a few years ago and a major event developed around the occasion in Smithfield. It is important that an event like that be available on free-to-air television.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="81" />I welcome this belated Bill, after a process that was deliberately held up by the Taoiseach. As the Minister rightly says, section 4 attempts to establish a fast-track mechanism for the High Court in the event of disputes or of a designated broadcaster being left outside the loop. The Minister is attempting to create a situation where the needs of such broadcasters can be fulfilled. I stated briefly already that subsections (9) and (10) should be revisited. Subsection (9) concerns existing contracts with non-qualifying broadcasters. The High Court should have fundamental powers in cases such as the &euro;7.8 million deal that was done between BSkyB and the FAI in the summer of 2002. Subsection (10) provides that the High Court may adjust an existing agreement, but what does this actually mean? If, for example, we wished to abrogate an existing agreement, does the power exist to do so? It does not seem to.</P>
    <P>The Minister stressed this evening, and in the Seanad previously, that the purpose of this Bill is to prevent events traditionally broadcast for free from migrating to pay-per-view channels and to ensure that event organisers would be paid reasonable market rates. If a qualifying broadcaster will not pay, event organisers are free to sell their product to any broadcaster. The submissions of many organisations put forward the idea of arbitration. However, RTE and TV3, in their submissions, stressed the public nature of some of the important events.</P>
    <P>The key problem for this House and relevant committee members is determining how a fair market price is arrived at. The term &ldquo;fair market price&rdquo; contains within it the idea that these great public sporting events in which our nation is engrossed are not just sporting or cultural occasions but are a product or commodity to be bought and sold. We have seen in recent years how, in the UK, association football, particularly in the premiership, has become dominated by the flow of money from satellite broadcasters. If a team loses its place in the premiership now and drops down a division, it loses £25 million sterling. As people said when the deal in regard to the first division collapsed with digital ITV, the entire first division lost something like £100 million. The game itself, no matter which teams are involved or whether it is the cup final or a critical match in the English premiership, seems to be taken for granted; essentially it is a commodity. One will see the same in other European countries and in America.</P>
    <P>In regard to the FAI-BSkyB &euro;7.8 million deal, it was striking last summer how many of our media commentators, including some of the journalists who work in this House, indicated that a fair price for that deal would have been &euro;6 million. A sum of &euro;6 million would be a massive outlay for RTE or, indeed, TV3.</P>
    <P>The Minister has at long last acted in relation to the Broadcasting Forum. I would welcome further legislation in that regard which I am sure he will bring before the House. The Minister has tried to solidify the finances of the national <Col N="82" /> broadcaster to which this House has given many high national tasks. Last week representatives of TV3 appeared before the Joint Committee on Communications, Marine and Natural Resources. I tried to encourage the station to become a strong competitor to RTE, to produce a chat show, which it does not have, and to give all the big stars in RTE a run for their money.</P>
    <P>If the satellite broadcaster is to determine the major market price then the outlook for our designated broadcasters, RTE and TV3, is bad. Will the Minister return to section 5(6) in regard to the criteria? We would like to propose some amendments to it, particularly to strengthen the subsection on previous fees, and to include something in regard to the two national broadcasters, RTE and TV3.</P>
    <P>I commend the Minister on starting the process to finish the legislation of 1999 and implementing the directive on which the Government has a deplorable record. I give a general welcome to the Bill but deplore the lethargy and incompetence of the previous Minister and the machinations of the Taoiseach in relation to the football association and dominance by the satellite broadcaster. I note the views of the main sporting organisations and I hope the Minister will accept some amendments from the Labour Party in relation to sections 4 and 5.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Crowe</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to share my time with Deputies Cowley, Joe Higgins and Eamon Ryan. I begin by commending the Minister on bringing this legislation before the House. He has acted quickly since his appointment to deal with this problem and I hope all parties will facilitate the speedy passage of this Bill through the House. However, it is unfortunate that it has taken so long to get to this stage. The EU Television Without Frontiers Directive, designed to keep major cultural and sporting events on free-to-air television dates from 1997. Two years later, legislation was introduced by the then Minister for Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands, Deputy de Valera, but then the issues seemed to disappear off the Government's radar screen. This was a regrettable step. Many genuine sports fans, particularly soccer fans, felt let down by the inexplicable delay which resulted in the shoddy deal between the FAI and BSkyB.</P>
      <P>The globalisation of the media has advanced at an accelerated rate over the past 15 years and it is certainly moving more rapidly than many national legislators seem to be able to cope with. I still remember the excitement in this State at the arrival of a second national station, RTE 2, as it was then called. Today Irish television viewers have a bewildering array of options before them. Every day we see our public service broadcaster come under increasing pressure from many of these commercial industries. It is worth noting that the issue before us today goes far beyond sports to the future of the media in Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This legislation may bring a welcome delay to the onward march of Rupert Murdoch and News <Col N="83" /> Corporation which, as I am sure the Minister knows, owns BSkyB. Murdoch said some years ago that sport would be the battering-ram by which he would conquer television. He meant, of course, the replacement of public service broadcasting and free-to-air television with pay-per-view television. Customers who want to watch one of the ever-growing number of sporting events to which Murdoch has bought the rights must subscribe to Sky Sports. Once they have done this, they often find it necessary to subscribe to other sports channels, as coverage of the event has moved, or to take package deals, including news and entertainment channels. Commercial channels of this type are primarily about marketing and entertainment with a small &ldquo;e&rdquo; and have been extremely successful in turning news into entertainment.</P>
    <P>The chief such news channel in Ireland is Sky News whose coverage of the war in Iraq provides daily evidence of the erosion of any serious journalism. It is a cliché to refer to its coverage of the war as being the same as watching a video game, but how else can it be described? Presenters stand over a large computer generated map with simulated explosions, helicopters, tanks, soldiers and jets moving about it. Analysts with a disturbing fetish for weapons specifications draw lines and circles on maps in a manner which reminds me of watching Captain Mainwaring of &ldquo;Dad's Army&rdquo;. It is war sanitised and stripped of its horror. In a few years watching Sky News will be like a trip to the cinema. Viewers will probably even eat popcorn while civilians of America's next target die from smart bombs as distinct from the stupid bombs the enemy has.</P>
    <P>The most shocking images of the war in Iraq have not come from Sky News or any western media organisation but from a growing number of independent media organisations in the Middle East. They are unique for Arab broadcasters in that they are not merely propaganda tools for Arab nations but have criticised Arab nations, including those allied to the United States, and serial abusers of human rights. Increasingly, western broadcasters are using more of their footage. Many of these broadcasters were set up as a result of Arabs feeling that the coverage by organisations, such as CNN, Fox or Sky News, was not representative of what was really going on in the Arab world. Last weekend at our Ard Fheis my party colleague, Councillor Larry O'Toole, referred to a meeting or a press conference he attended at which unedited pictures taken by these organisations of the devastation caused by the war in Iraq were shown. It was taken by these organisations. Having listened to his description of what he saw of the real horrors of 21st century war, I only wish that every Deputy on the Government benches would be forced to watch the holocaust they have facilitated by allowing the use of Shannon. Of course, we will never see it because the sanitised media reports <Col N="84" /> we see in the mostly compliant pro-western media has no space for this.</P>
    <P>That is why the issue of protecting our sporting and cultural events is such an important one. It is the front line in the protection of elements of our culture and elements of the media from increasing globalisation of media outlets. While there may be an increasing number of television channels and newspapers, the number of owners continues to decline. The formation of mass media conglomerates and the level of control of these organisations over what we see and hear is terrifying. The global music industry, for example, worth &euro;40 billion annually is controlled by five companies &ndash; Sony, Warner, EMI, BMG and Vivendi Universal. The last decade has seen a consolidation and globalisation of the media which is frightening to watch. Companies like AOL Time Warner dominate the way we see the world.</P>
    <P>A great deal of opposition is often expressed at Microsoft's increasing domination of the world's computer market. Most of our computers, including the ones we use in Leinster House, use Microsoft platforms. It is as difficult to go for a week without using Microsoft products in a globalised world as it is to avoid watching a television programme owned by Warner. Many of these groups are using the vast profits they make in film and television to penetrate newspaper markets.</P>
    <P>I spoke earlier about Rupert Murdoch, who owns 175 newspapers around the world, including <i>The Times, The Sunday Times, The Sun </i>and the <i>News of the World </i>which are available here. It is only the existence of our own media monopoly ironically titled, Independent Newspapers, with 18 national and local newspapers which has impeded Murdoch's progress into Ireland. It is clear from the deal struck between the FAI and Sky last summer that Murdoch intends to expand his foothold here.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That Dáil Éireann:</P>
      <P>&ndash;&nbsp;conscious of the growing concern regarding the humanitarian crisis that is evolving in Iraq and in light of the fact that aid agencies believe that:</P>
      <P>&ndash;&nbsp;there will be an increase in acute malnutrition in children under five years of age from 4% to 30% as a result of critical food shortages and an increase in morbidity rates in children, particularly diarrhoeal disease, from the consumption of contaminated water;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ndash;&nbsp;there are more than 1 million malnourished children in Iraq who, upon commencement of the military action, have <Col N="85" /> been unable to receive much of the humanitarian aid they had previously been availing of;</P>
    <P>&ndash;&nbsp;the risk of a measles outbreak among displaced populations is significant and there is an urgent need to immunise children aged six to 12 who may not have received immunisation against the disease, as children aged five and younger have, and who cannot access such immunisation in the present circumstances;</P>
    <P>&ndash;&nbsp;60% of Iraqi people are dependent on Government food subsidies;</P>
    <P>&ndash;&nbsp;the long-term effects on the pyscho-social health of Iraqi children are likely to be a major problem in the aftermath of war;</P>
    <P>&ndash;&nbsp;there are likely to be shortages of essential drugs, especially antibiotics, as rates of diarrhoeal disease and acute respiratory infections will increase significantly due to population displacements, contaminated water and shortages of heating fuels;</P>
    <P>&ndash;&nbsp;as many as 5% of children from displaced or refugee populations might be separated from their families; and</P>
    <P>&ndash;&nbsp;upon an end to the conflict, it is possible that schools will have been looted, will be bereft of materials and will suffer a teacher shortage due to unsafe conditions;</P>
    <P>&ndash;&nbsp;calls on the Government to play a full role in the international relief effort in Iraq in order to avoid a humanitarian catastrophe;</P>
    <P>&ndash;&nbsp;calls on the Government to work to ensure that the United Nations plays the lead co-ordinating role in the humanitarian relief effort;</P>
    <P>&ndash;&nbsp;calls on the Government to vigorously pursue a commitment from our partners in the European Union and the United Nations, to provide the necessary funding to ensure the alleviation of hunger and disease amongst the Iraqi population; and</P>
    <P>&ndash;&nbsp;calls on the Government to work to ensure that such funding should not come from existing moneys already allocated to help in the humanitarian needs of other regions.</P>
    <P>I wish to share my time with Deputies Gay Mitchell and Coveney.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle An Ceann Comhairle">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>Is that agreed? Agreed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny" hpid="Mr. Kenny Mr. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like the Dáil to unite behind this motion to address the humanitarian <Col N="86" /> crisis facing Iraq. The Iraqi need is great and urgent. However, in the interests of justice, humanity and democracy, I will refer to what is fuelling the humanitarian crisis, namely, the war that is in its twelfth day, this war that will affect international politics and the way the people of the world will co-exist for years if not generations to come.</P>
      <P>Regardless of how long the war lasts, two things are required. There must be respect for Iraq's sovereignty, territorial integrity and independence, and the right of the Iraqi people to determine their own political future and to control their known natural resources, primarily oil, remains sacrosanct. This will only happen if the reconstruction of Iraq is directed by the United Nations. Installing the UN immediately and strategically in the humanitarian aid effort, must be step one of that process.</P>
      <P>Fine Gael remains resolutely opposed to this war. That it is now on is no reason to accept or excuse it &ndash; far from it. This is a time for conviction, not convention and acquiescence. The truth is that every effort had not been exhausted to defuse the crisis by peaceful means, which means, under the rule of international law and order, this war is wrong, unjust and unnecessary. The choice is clear. We either believe in the international rule of law and order, the collective, unifying will of the many, or we believe in the international rule of force and the divisive will of the few. By invading Iraq, the United States has fractured the asset of global consensus after 11 September. It has split the UN, NATO and the European Union.</P>
      <P>Fine Gael believes firmly in a unifying, collective will, and the growing civilian cost of this war, a version of which is beamed day and night into our sitting rooms, offices, banks, hospitals and public houses, confirms that belief by the hour. Almost two weeks into Operation Iraqi Freedom, the Dáil stands divided, as do the UN and the EU. However, as Kofi Annan put it to the UN, we have it within our power either to deepen those divisions or to begin to heal them. Fine Gael believes the mammoth humanitarian operation which must flow from this war is the best way to start.</P>
      <P>In the meantime, there remain outstanding questions for the US. Raising them is neither anti-America nor anti-American. It is independent, centrist, thinking. America was and is a real friend to Ireland in trade, economics, family ties and political support. Our relationship, as I have said before, is warm and historic. It is precisely in that context that I ask on behalf of many people in this country: what next, or more critically, where next, or, as the Taoiseach put it on television, if the UN is to be sidelined, what happens in the next crisis and the one after that?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Saddam Hussein is a criminal and a brutal dictator, but we must remember that the gassing of the Kurds at Halabja in 1988, cited every day now as one of the key reasons for this &ldquo;war of liberation&rdquo;, did not result in any international calls for <Col N="87" /> a military strike at the time. Neither must we forget that the British Government was forced to admit to the Scott inquiry into arms for Iraq, that it had continued to grant licences to British companies to export materials that could be used to make biological weapons until 1996 at least.</P>
    <P>I remain to be convinced by the talk of a new and soon-to-be-published road map for a resolution of the Palestinian-Israeli conflict. This conflict is one of the root causes of the emerging deep antagonism between the East and the West in recent years. Previous inner-sanctum comments about the US subcontracting its foreign policy to others, namely, the UN Security Council, were not lost on us. The US has used its veto on many occasions over the past 58 years where the Palestinian-Israeli conflict is concerned. This was referred to by Robin Cook recently in the House of Commons.</P>
    <P>To note that the ongoing situation in Palestine is stoking Arab anger and inflaming the Arab sense of human, social and political injustice, is to state the blindingly obvious. I must say once again that the European and international institutions should, at the behest of this country and others like us, address the implications of the Palestinian-Israeli conflict, and now Iraq, for opinion and developments in the wider, Arab world. If we do not, our humanitarian programmes could, in time, extend well beyond the Euphrates and the Tigris rivers.</P>
    <P>Meanwhile, Iraq bleeds. I thank the Government for its formal support for the motion in the name of Fine Gael on the issue of humanitarian aid. I also thank the Labour Party and a number of Independent Members who have also given their support. I would like to think that Ireland's politicians can speak with one voice on this fundamental issue and that moneys made available would be additional and new and not diverted from any funds destined for relief purposes elsewhere. If the Government wishes to allocate in excess of the &euro;5 million already announced by the Minister of State, Deputy Kitt, we will accept and support that.</P>
    <P>The Government should do everything it can to make the arrival and distribution of humanitarian aid rapid and dramatic. It must also be planned, targeted and precise. Clearly, there is a desperate need for the kind of expert logistics of the UN and humanitarian aid agencies in this area. Witness the indiscriminate distribution of food by military personnel firing boxes of food from the backs of lorries. Where personnel are neither trained for nor expert in this work, it can lead to other chaos.</P>
    <P>Clearly there is an urgent need for the creation of corridors of access for humanitarian aid so that it can be delivered to those who are identified by the relief agencies as needing it most. There is an equally urgent need that food, water and other assistance be delivered untainted by military involvement. This is essential in respect of the independence and integrity of all the humani<Col N="88" /> tarian aid agencies involved in Iraq. UNICEF, the Red Cross and the Iraqi Red Crescent are already distributing aid in the country to an extent. The problem is getting in there. It is very difficult to do anything now with the war going on, and I understand that some of the local and native Iraqi relief workers have been instructed by the Government to stay at home. That obviously reduces contact with the international aid agencies and makes it that much more difficult.</P>
    <P>According to UNICEF, at least 5,000 Iraqi children die every month due to sanctions. If war is added to that equation, the loss of life among children will surely be immeasurable, literally and metaphorically. The impact of such loss on the Iraqi psyche is unimaginable in its horror, just as the long-term psycho-social effects of the war on the Iraqi population and the military will be as diverse as they are difficult to quantify, especially when 5% of children displaced by the conflict could be separated from their families &ndash; families similar to ours. If one read the newspapers at the weekend, one will have seen the change in the attitudes of young men who have been exposed to the horror of this conflict.</P>
    <P>The aid agencies believe that acute malnutrition in under fives will rocket from 4% to 30%, both as a result of critical food shortages and diarrhoeal disease from drinking contaminated water. Some 60% of the Iraqi population is dependent on Government food subsidies. All the indicators suggested that, once war was waged, the 1 million children who were already malnourished would no longer be unable to access the humanitarian aid to which they had had access. It is not the same as Chad, Ethiopia or other places in Africa. This is a population that should not be subject to this and it is not the same type of humanitarian crisis. The problem is in getting aid into the country and having it managed independently and with the integrity of the agencies. We heard a doctor from a village near Najaf talk to Sky News about the dire need for basic medical treatment and drugs such as antibiotics and pain killers.</P>
    <P>I wish to make it crystal clear to the Minister of State, who I know has considerable experience in this area, that humanitarian aid should not be linked to military activity in any way and should not be a part of any propaganda machine. The sight of embedded journalists, as they are called, on various television channels &ldquo;liberating&rdquo; people with sweets and water is not the way to do business in a crisis that is not of the making of Iraqi civilians. Aid must be delivered by the aid agencies alone. It must not become a bit player in Operation Hearts and Minds. The aid agencies best know the need and it is they, not the military, who are the humanitarian relief experts. This aid is not a privilege but is the right of the innocent Iraqi people who are suffering so much in a war not of their making. It should not become a social anaesthetic delivered by any military agency while taken over areas are cleared.</P>
    <P>The Irish Government must lead on this issue <Col N="89" /> with other EU governments and must show example. We must lead on healing the rift and should show strength in line with Ireland's tradition of being generous, committed and caring to Christian and Muslim alike. We have been a shining example in this area and we must continue to concentrate on it. I urge the Minister to do this on my behalf and that of my party and the Irish people. While we may have differences on politics in this House, in this area we are absolutely united.</P>

      <P>Humanitarian aid and our collective parliamentary concern is for the people &ndash; those like Dr. Tarek Taher, the surgeon on duty at the an-Noor Hospital in Baghdad the other day when another explosion ripped through a city market killing 52 people, children and teenagers among them. Asked if it would get worse, this doctor, a hardened veteran of the Iran-Iraq war, told Lara Marlowe of <i>The Irish Times: </i>&ldquo;Yes. The Americans are still far away. When they come nearer, I am afraid, really afraid &ndash; for my own life, for other innocent people. You see, I am one of the innocent people.&rdquo;  Dr. Taher is one of the 24 million people who now depend for their lives and future in part on the aid generated through this House.</P>
      <P>I thank the Government for its generous support for what is a non-contentious motion in respect of something this House has been very good at over the years: the issue of humanitarian aid. I commend the Minister for his efforts to date in this regard and ask him to keep up that effort. He has our full support in what he is doing.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>I join Deputy Kenny in thanking the Government, the Labour Party and the other parties and Independent Deputies in the House for supporting this motion. It is appropriate that the House should not divide on an issue of this kind at this time.</P>
      <P>I turn in my opening comments to a topic I have raised time out of number since this issue was first discussed in the House in October last, namely, the role of the United Nations in regard to the conflict in Iraq. I was surprised to see Members of this House, when it seemed that the United Nations might sanction a further resolution allowing action against Iraq following Resolution 1441, turn on the United Nations to say that they supported the United Nations, not this United Nations but another, reformed United Nations. Those Members put themselves in the exact position of the Americans and British who they had said they opposed, because the Americans and British are saying: &ldquo;Not this United Nations. We have our own authority. We are going our own way.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The record of this House will show that certain Members have been totally inconsistent in what <Col N="90" /> they have said about the United Nations over the years. It is central to the motion before the House that we ask the Government to do everything possible to get the UN back in the driving seat with regard to the delivery of humanitarian aid in Iraq as soon as is practicable.</P>
    <P>We must not only be concerned for the humanitarian needs of Iraq, we must be seen to be concerned. We cannot allow the impression to go around that this is a Christian versus Muslim conflict, or a West versus Middle East conflict. We must do everything in our power to demonstrate our genuine concerns for innocent Iraqis. Similarly, we must be energetic at the European Union and the United Nations in making the case for humanitarian aid to be kept separate from military action. To quote Kofi Annan in relation to Kosovo and Serbia: &ldquo;If these lines are blurred, there is a grave risk of irreparable damage to the principle of impartiality and humanitarian assistance.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Humanitarian non-governmental organisations will go into Iraq as soon as is practicable, but only bearing UN-led relief. Keeping the UN out of involvement with humanitarian aid is an enormous blunder. One NGO has already described the military campaign as using &ldquo;hearts and minds&rdquo; interventions as part of its integral plan. The same organisation has described the &ldquo;hearts and minds&rdquo; interventions to date as shambolic, with media images, which Deputy Kenny has mentioned, of soldiers throwing boxes of water off the backs of trucks.</P>
    <P>Thankfully, there is capacity to deliver humanitarian aid when it is safe to do so. However, the lack of humanitarian space &ndash; the term given to the creation of conditions that allow for impartial and neutral humanitarian interventions in the midst of conflict &ndash; may be such that some NGOs will feel unable to intervene, or carry out their work, for fear of being identified as parties to the conflict with all the danger that brings. I ask the Minister, in his reply, to tell the House what steps the Government will take at the European Union and the United Nations to pro-actively campaign to get the UN back in the leadership of the delivery of humanitarian aid.</P>
    <P>The scale of the humanitarian crisis facing Iraq is immense. It is worth looking at the assessment of the various aid agencies of the current situation in Iraq. According to Trócaire, the UN has estimated that 11 million people will need some sort of humanitarian aid and that may well be an understatement. It is said that at least 10,000 people will die in this conflict. It is not known how many have died to date although it seems to be in low numbers, but we do not know what may be unleashed in the immediate future.</P>
    <P>The UN estimates that 900,000 Iraqis are likely to become refugees when the conflict reaches full scale; some 500,000 people will be left injured or sick as a result of poor water supplies and sewage which is not properly pumped away; some 3 million mothers and children will need food; some 2 million people will require shelter; and food sup<Col N="91" /> plies will be disrupted affecting millions of people.</P>
    <P>Trócaire estimates that 150,000 people are expected to flee from central and southern Iraq into the north and border areas with all of the implications that has for bordering countries. However, these people could fall prey to the land mines that litter the area and the Mines Advisory Group has already identified more than 2,000 mined areas.</P>
    <P>Caritas Iraq claims that many of Basra's 1.5 million people have been forced to use river water for drinking and cooking. The river is polluted by waste water and sewage and up to 100,000 children under the age of five are at risk of disease. Only 40% of Basra's population has access to clean water. Some 700 families or 4,000 people in the village surrounding Mosul have fled their homes and sought refuge in Karakosh where Caritas has two centres. An entire family of parents and three children were killed in the A'Adhamiya residential area of Baghdad.</P>
    <P>UNICEF states that, before the war, to improve the chances of survival of Iraqi children it had delivered therapeutic food for more than 400,000 children, but that there are still more than 1 million malnourished children. In recent weeks 1,000 metric tonnes of high-protein biscuits and therapeutic milk was delivered. Some 4 million children were vaccinated against polio in February. This shows what can be done when humanitarian NGOs are allowed to work in an area, particularly with the blessing of the United Nations. Back-up generators have been placed in water and sewage treatment plants to ensure that safe water will continue to flow, but only one third of Baghdad's water supply network has benefited in this way.</P>
    <P>Maura Quinn, the executive director of UNICEF Ireland, said:</P>
    <P>Children will die in this war. That's a fact. The question is how many we can protect. That has got to be a priority for all of us now.</P>
    <P>The aid agency claims that reports from Baghdad confirm that children there are suffering obvious signs of trauma, such as continuous crying, fear of loud noises and nightmares. These problems are exacerbated by the closure of schools and the resultant ending of so-called normal life.</P>
    <P>UNICEF is co-ordinating relief from Amman, in Jordan, but all it can do is keep a close eye on matters and be ready to respond. It is vital that Governments make it as easy as possible for UNICEF to respond, but it can only do so if the United Nations is back in the driving seat. UNICEF estimates that the funding it needs for the next six months is less than $166 million, a figure that contrasts with the $76 billion sought by the US President, George Bush, from Congress to help to continue the war. The moneys sought by UNICEF will go towards the provision of potable water and safe sanitation, care for unaccompanied and traumatised children and children living <Col N="92" /> in institutions, child immunisation, the provision of safe birthing equipment for pregnant women, the feeding of malnourished children and pregnant women and the return of primary aged school children to school as soon as possible. These are not unimportant, fanciful concerns; they are issues of life and death.</P>
    <P>Oxfam Ireland claims that the United Nations is the only body with the international legitimacy to act as the co-ordinator of a humanitarian response and as a guarantor of neutral transition to a new Government. It also states that a one-sided US occupation of Iraq is the development most likely to inflame the Middle East. It is vital, therefore, that those in the White House who do not see a role for the UN in a post-Saddam Iraq do not have their way. As a friend of the United States, the Government should use every avenue open to it to convey that view. We should not be afraid to express that opinion at every opportunity.</P>
    <P>Amnesty International has stated that the possibility of Turkish troops flowing into northern Iraq, on foot of a motion passed by the Turkish Parliament on 20 March that allows for their deployment, could mean that refugees will be unable to cross the border. This is not a fanciful thought. A senior Turkish source said to me recently, in a matter of fact manner, that his country's troops will enter northern Iraq to a depth of 20 km. The implications of such a move for the region &ndash; let alone for Iraq and Turkey &ndash; are extraordinary. Iran has said it will be selective about who it allows to cross the border, indicating it will only allow those whose lives are in real danger to enter. Such a policy will create many difficulties for refugees and their families. Kuwait and Saudi Arabia have closed their borders and Syria re-opened its borders only after intervention from UNHCR. I understand that refugee camps are being constructed there, which is a welcome development.</P>
    <P>It is clear that we will face a humanitarian nightmare if Operation Iraqi Freedom drags on and there is a large displacement of people. The facilities and the political will to deal with such problems do not exist. In its document, Protection First, Amnesty International says:</P>
    <P>In situations of mass influx, wealthier states have a responsibility to commit financial and other support to those neighbouring states receiving refugees. The protection of refugees' human rights is an international obligation, and cannot be left solely to states neighbouring Iraq, some of which already host hundreds of thousands of refugees.</P>
    <P>This motion goes some way to meeting our responsibilities in that regard.</P>
    <P>John O'Shea, of GOAL, has said that the crisis being faced in Iraq can be averted because, for once, some of the machinery to stave off the suffering is in place. Mr. O'Shea has argued that the world needs strong leadership from the UN Secretary General, Kofi Annan and he pointed out <Col N="93" /> that the crisis in Iraq is different from crises in Somalia, Rwanda, Ethiopia and elsewhere, in which the poor have paid the ultimate price. He said that the television footage of the intervention in the Iraqi border town of Safwan provided a lesson in how not to deliver aid. If aid distributions are planned in such a poor manner, according to Mr. O'Shea, we can be sure that only the strongest will receive aid, and we are all demeaned when a few trucks are opened and a desperate crowd is allowed to fight for aid.</P>
    <P>The developed world, which includes Ireland, has a chance to do what is right and moral. Ireland can make a difference, as a small and neutral nation, by championing the rights of the United Nations and the Iraqi people. If Kofi Annan is to provide the leadership that is needed at this time, he will need to be strengthened by the pro-active support of Parliaments, such as the Oireachtas, and Administrations, such as our Government. Every ounce of this country's influence &ndash; in the European Union, among the applicant states and with all friendly countries &ndash; should be used to champion this cause. Kofi Annan should be given the strength, support and pro-active encouragement he needs to stand up to those who would like to see humanitarian aid delivered by the military only. Such a form of delivery has many connotations for NGOs and for real humanitarian aid.</P>
    <P>I am delighted the Government is supporting this motion and I welcome the support it has received from Members of the House. I hope there will be more disquisition than disquiet and that concern and discernment will be demonstrated in relation to Iraq's needs. A certain element in Irish politics has sought to get ahead of the crowd during the debate on Iraq. It has tried to discover what the crowd wants to hear and it has followed the crowd. Certain people have reversed their policy of supporting the United Nations, which they championed inside and outside this House for a long time. I hope this debate will represent an end to the undermining of the UN. We should ensure, in every way we can, that the UN is given the strength and support it needs to resume its leadership of the situation in Iraq, particularly in relation to humanitarian aid.</P>
    <P>I would like to share the rest of my time with Deputy Coveney, with the agreement of the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SimonCoveney" hpid="Mr. Coveney Mr. Coveney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coveney</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank my colleague, Deputy Gay Mitchell, for providing this opportunity to debate an issue about which my party feels strongly. I share that concern on a personal level, as do other Members of the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Up to now the debate on Iraq has been predominantly about military conflict, weapons of mass destruction, regime change and the rights and wrongs of the decision to go to war. The debate will move on soon, however, to reflect concerns about mass refugee movements, human rights abuses and the human impact and misery <Col N="94" /> of war. We need to consider the complexities of reconstructing a broken nation after the sanctions and conflict have ended. We may have to consider these issues while the war rages in the coming weeks and months, as it does not look like it will end in the short-term. This House must ask itself how Ireland, as a European nation, can maximise its contribution, to assist millions of innocent people who find themselves caught up in this war and its consequences.</P>
    <P>My party's motion calls on the Government to take action in four clear areas. It calls on it, first, &ldquo;to play a full role in the international relief effort in Iraq in order to avoid a humanitarian catastrophe&rdquo;. The catastrophe will probably happen anyway, unfortunately. Second, the motion calls on the Government &ldquo;to work to ensure that the United Nations plays the lead co-ordinating role in the humanitarian relief effort&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Third, the motion calls on the Government, &ldquo;to vigorously pursue a commitment from our partners in the European Union and the United Nations to provide the necessary funding to ensure the alleviation of hunger and disease amongst the Iraqi population.&rdquo;  Finally, the motion calls on the Government, &ldquo;to work to ensure that such funding should not come from existing moneys already allocated to help in the humanitarian needs of other regions.&rdquo;  I welcome the fact that the Government has decided to endorse this motion and I look forward to seeing the evidence of its support in the weeks ahead.</P>
    <P>The Irish people underestimate the credibility and influence this country has within the United Nations and the European Union when it comes to issues of humanitarian aid. In October 2001, during the most intense bombing of the Taliban regime in Afghanistan, I witnessed at first hand the influence and pressure this small country can exert. I witnessed also the level of our involvement in the United Nations humanitarian aid structure. I travelled to Chaman which borders Afghanistan and is the closest part of Pakistan to Kandahar which was undergoing heavy bombing at the time. Before journeying there, I visited the United Nations headquarters in Islamabad where I found that the chief adviser on humanitarian issues was Nora Hyland, a lady from Dublin. In Chaman, to my astonishment, I discovered that the man responsible for establishing the refugee camp for displaced families fleeing the bombing in Afghanistan was John Costello from Beare Island. He had a beard down to his waist and fitted in very well. He was central to the humanitarian aid effort on the ground where he constructed tents for the United Nations. At the time, the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights was Mary Robinson and Ireland was a member of the United Nations Security Council under the guidance of our United Nations ambassador, Richard Ryan. Time and again, Ireland raised the issue of humanitarian aid in the Security Council and made a significant contribution to keeping the humanitarian issue <Col N="95" /> centre stage during the awful conflict in Afghanistan.</P>
    <P>Also influential were the Irish NGOs which worked at the coal face of the crisis as they always do. In Chaman I met representatives of Goal and Concern having travelled to the area under cover as a Concern worker. The organisations were waiting to get into Afghanistan and were campaigning to open safe corridors to avoid the sorts of problems emerging in Iraq where the soldiers who are waging the war are the same people giving out the aid. How confused must that population be as bombs drop on their homes and soldiers take cities while aid, food, water and medicine are provided. In a country that has been decimated by the sanctions of the last decade, it must be confusing to have westerners, who are unfortunately despised by the Iraqi population for the wrong reasons in many cases, giving out aid. In Pakistan, I witnessed the suffering of young, often fatherless families walking for up to 100 miles to reach the safety of a refugee camp. Many were unable to cross from Afghanistan which is a problem we may face in the Middle East where Iraq's neighbours have closed their borders to refugees.</P>
    <P>We face the same crisis in Iraq as we faced in Afghanistan except there is a larger population involved. Ireland must play its part in ensuring the international aid effort is led by the United Nations. The aid programme cannot be a US-British military initiative which is used as a public relations campaign. I am not interested in discussing the pros and cons of war or whether the decision to take military action should have been made. I am interested in the role Ireland can play in the area where we have credibility. We have no credibility on the international stage to advise the US or British military on how best to undertake a military campaign in Iraq or to criticise their methods. We should concentrate on the issues in regard to which people listen to what we have to say. We should concentrate on humanitarian aid efforts where we can make a real impact and in which we have a proven capacity to make a serious contribution to far larger countries.</P>
    <P>The most effective way to distribute aid in Iraq is to use Iraqis and other Arab personnel through UN aid agencies rather than through western personnel. Agencies like Concern and Goal have links with Islamic populations and organisations and they are the people who should be first in. Ireland should be fighting to ensure that the military provides aid corridors to allow them in, which is where we can be of benefit. Ireland must lobby intensively within the European Union and the United Nations to ensure that the crisis we see unfolding on our screens every evening is kept centre stage. That is how we can be of value. Reconstructing Afghanistan over the next ten years, which is how long it will take, will cost approximately $15 billion. Estimates suggest that the same process in Iraq will cost up to $100 billion. If there is anything left of Iraq's health <Col N="96" /> system after the sanctions of the last 12 years, there will certainly not be anything after the current conflict.</P>
    <P>Approximately 10 million people are in need of direct food assistance from aid agencies while hundreds of thousands of people are on the move as we speak. There will be more refugees when the war really hits Baghdad as soldiers reach the city. Iraq has a population of about 26 million, give or take 3 million or 4 million, as no one seems able to provide an accurate number. Of these, 50% are children under the age of 15 who spend their nights at home hoping they will survive this war. They are the people Ireland must now concentrate on helping instead of pontificating on the pros and cons of war. Let us try to make a real impact in Iraq by ensuring that as a small country but an effective international humanitarian aid lobbyist, we keep this issue at the centre of attention. We must do so at every European Union summit and at every United Nations meeting in which we participate.</P>
    <P>Ireland's financial contribution should not be dismissed because we are a small country. The aid package of &euro;5 million announced last week may seem like a miserable contribution in the context of the current crisis, but it is a start. However, I understand that this sum is to come from an annual &euro;23 million fund for emergencies and unexpected crises. The current humanitarian crisis is man-made and we should look for extra funding. I understood that the &euro;23 million fund was earmarked to alleviate the hunger Ethiopians and other Africans will suffer later on this year. We must provide extra funding to address the crisis in Iraq if for no other reason than to make a clear statement that the Irish people and the Irish Government are willing to suffer a financial cost to demonstrate our resolve to address the humanitarian cost of the war being waged.</P>
    <P>Let us concentrate on what we can achieve rather than on what we can talk about. Let us now use all the influence we have within the UN to ensure that it takes centre-stage in relation to the humanitarian efforts in a co-ordinated international effort. Let us not accept what we see at the moment on our television screens whereby British and US soldiers are the ones handing out aid. Instead let us insist on those soldiers providing safe humanitarian aid corridors and let us have Arabs primarily, through humanitarian aid agencies, giving out food to people so that we can prevent the kind of hatred that is building up between westerners and Arabs in Iraq as we speak.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomKitt" hpid="Mr. Kitt Mr. Kitt">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs (Mr. Kitt)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to share my time with Deputies Carey and O'Connor.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I sincerely thank the leader of the Fine Gael Party, Deputy Kenny, and his colleagues for initiating this debate and the spirit in which they brought it to the floor of the House. On my own behalf and on behalf of my party I wish to say that we are pleased to support this motion which <Col N="97" /> deserves our support. I agree with those who have affirmed that Ireland has a very long and proud tradition of supporting the United Nations, of supporting humanitarian relief efforts wherever they occur, and we have been a strong voice for the innocent victims of many conflicts such as the one we are now discussing. I also reiterate our strong respect for the many very effective NGOs that have worked so well with successive Governments.</P>
    <P>I welcome the opportunity to debate the humanitarian situation in Iraq. It is clear that Iraq is potentially facing an enormous humanitarian crisis with millions of innocent civilians threatened by conflict, hunger and a lack of basic needs. As Minister responsible for development co-operation and human rights my focus remains on the protection and saving of human lives. This is a humanitarian imperative to which I am absolutely committed.</P>
    <P>The present conflict in Iraq follows years of hardship and difficulty. Since 1991 the Iraqi people have seen a dramatic drop in their living standards. In the league table that measures quality of life &ndash; the human development index &ndash; HDI &ndash; Iraq fell from 96th place to 127th place in a little over ten years. No country has fallen so far so rapidly. This deterioration is translated at the basic human level into increased child deaths, malnutrition and high rates of disease. Iraqi children are facing extreme risks at this time, and we should be conscious of the fact that they constitute half of the population of Iraq.</P>
    <P>Prior to the beginning of the current conflict 60% of the population &ndash; 16 million people &ndash; were dependent on rations delivered under the UN oil for food programme, OFFP, as their only food supply. The suspension of this programme on 17 March, when the Secretary General withdrew United Nations personnel from Iraq, has put even greater pressures on an already extremely vulnerable population.</P>
    <P>I greatly welcome the unanimous decision of the Security Council, through Resolution 1472, authorising the Secretary General to administer the oil for food programme for the next 45 days and possibly longer. I hope that the resumption of the programme will mean that, despite the difficulties, basic food assistance can once again reach those who are most vulnerable. Estimates of the scale of the humanitarian crisis cannot easily be made at this point as the situation changes daily. Iraqis from various regions in the country have responded differently to the conflict. The latest indications are that the majority of people in the south have remained in their homes, rather than fleeing to safer areas either within the country or to neighbouring states. In the north there appears to be a larger displacement of people. The southern city of Basra is an area of particular concern. We are monitoring carefully the humanitarian situation in Iraq in order to gauge the precise needs of those directly affected by the conflict and to assess what we can do to address those needs.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="98" />The Government will play a strong role in bringing emergency relief to the innocent victims of this conflict. In response to the impending humanitarian crisis, on Tuesday last I held discussions with non-governmental organisations that have a proven track record in addressing emergency humanitarian needs throughout the world. I have also had meetings with a wide range of international agencies and organisations which have kept me briefed on their plans to assist the most vulnerable Iraqis.</P>
    <P>Deputies will be aware that I have announced a special &euro;5 million emergency assistance package for the people of Iraq, with a particular emphasis on women and children. These funds will be disbursed through non-governmental organisations and through international agencies such as UNICEF and the Red Cross. We will work with those agencies which are best equipped and which have the capacity and experience to respond effectively to this crisis.</P>
    <P>I have already authorised initial disbursements from this emergency funding. Assistance amounting to &euro;1.5 million will be provided to the Red Cross and Red Crescent family and to UNICEF. These agencies are present in Iraq and their staff, the great majority of whom are Iraqi, are providing assistance on a daily basis to those most in need.</P>
    <P>Red Cross teams are providing medical and water assistance in Baghdad and Basra and, where possible, in other locations. They are also attempting to address the power situation in Basra. UNICEF is also continuing to implement emergency relief operations within Iraq, carried out by committed and experienced nationals. UNICEF is immunising children against measles and delivering food and medicines to orphanages and other institutions around Baghdad. UNICEF is co-ordinating closely with the Red Cross and other agencies and organisations.</P>
    <P>I commend UNICEF and the Red Cross for the work that they are continuing to do inside Iraq in very difficult circumstances. My Department is currently appraising applications for emergency funding from Concern, Goal and Trócaire. These NGOs have a proven track record for delivering emergency assistance rapidly and effectively.</P>
    <P>In my discussions with these NGOs and others I have stressed the need for effective co-ordination in order to maximise the value of our assistance. They will be working closely with partner organisations within Iraq and with the relevant UN agencies. We will, I hope, also be able to work with other NGOs such as Oxfam and World Vision.</P>
    <P>Deputies may wish to note that I have already provided &euro;500,000 in start-up costs to key Irish NGOs to enable them to become operational quickly at the onset of an emergency. These funds can be prioritised for Iraq if the NGOs so wish. While the delivery of essential relief to Iraq will be difficult, the challenges we face are not unique and with a concerted effort from the international <Col N="99" /> community they can be met. We have garnered valuable experience and lessons from similar humanitarian situations, most recently in Afghanistan.</P>
    <P>From the outset I have emphasised &ndash; and I agree with those who said so this evening, including Deputy Kenny &ndash; that the UN must play a lead role in any humanitarian relief operation. In our contacts with the UN we are emphasising this point and &ndash; in response to Deputies Mitchell and Coveney &ndash; I will be using every opportunity, with my EU colleagues, over the coming weeks to ensure that the UN takes and maintains the lead in the humanitarian effort. The UN has the international mandate to co-ordinate a humanitarian response and also has a substantial record of achievement in this area. I have recently returned from a visit to East Timor where I witnessed at first hand the successful outcome of a UN operation which has placed this newly independent country on the road to development and prosperity.</P>
    <P>In 1999 the situation in East Timor seemed almost hopeless. Its infrastructure was destroyed and a large proportion of its population was displaced, yet today that new nation is looking to the future with determination and confidence. The UN played the key role in this transformation. The experience of East Timor clearly shows how strong a force for good the UN can be when its members act in a united manner.</P>
    <P>A few days ago the United Nations issued a major international appeal for assistance in relation to the humanitarian situation in Iraq over the next six months. This assistance will be provided in strict adherence to the humanitarian principles of neutrality and impartiality that underpin the mandates of the United Nations and its emergency response agencies. The UN appeal has two components, food and non-food needs. It is estimated that the food needs of the Iraqi population will amount to 480,000 metric tonnes per month for at least a three-month period. Non-food needs include the provision of water, health, shelter, education, protection, de-mining and emergency repairs.</P>
    <P>In any conflict the primary responsibility for the protection and welfare of the civilian population rests with the warring parties. In a case of foreign occupation, it is the occupying power that has the responsibility to ensure the provision of food and medical supplies to the civilian population.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>In relation to this issue which has been raised in terms of the military and humanitarian roles, I emphasise that it is also the responsibility of the UN to respond immediately and effectively to save lives, to mitigate suffering and, even in these dark moments, to preserve hope for a peaceful future.</P>
      <P>We will respond positively to the UN appeal through assisting our key UN partners such as UNICEF, UNHCR and the world food programme. The needs of the UN Office for the Co-ordination of Humanitarian Affairs will also be examined. Ireland has already provided almost &euro;15 million to UNICEF and UNHCR in 2003 for their global operations including emergencies. These funds are not earmarked, thus providing these agencies with the necessary flexibility and the potential for fast delivery which can improve effectiveness and save lives.</P>
      <P>The European Union and its member states are the largest donors of development assistance in the world. It is anticipated that the EU will spend approximately &euro;100 million on an immediate response to the emergency in Iraq. The first tranche of &euro;3 million is already being used to deliver assistance in Iraq by means of the International Red Cross. I welcome this rapid response and I will continue to use every opportunity to highlight the humanitarian needs of Iraq to my colleagues in the EU.</P>
      <P>Irish funding of &euro;5 million is being provided to save lives in Iraq. The funding provided by the Irish Government for development co-operation and the reduction of poverty in the developing world has never been at a higher level. The primary focus of our assistance remains sub-Saharan Africa, where the greatest number of poor countries in the world are located. This focus will not change. However, there are many millions of poor people in other parts of the world and we regard it as our duty to respond to their needs as well. In relation to the emergency humanitarian budget I wish to assure Deputies that this budget, which currently stands at &euro;23 million, is by its very nature designed to be flexible. It is not allocated to any particular region or emergency in advance, but is available to save lives and livelihoods in whatever region of the world there is greatest need.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We cannot predict the number or intensity of crises, therefore the funding must remain flexible. My priority is to address humanitarian needs wherever they arise. I have sufficient funding under the programme as a whole to deal with the full range of humanitarian needs and also to <Col N="101" /> tackle the longer term development challenges in Africa and elsewhere. Funding for Iraq will not come from the moneys already allocated to help with humanitarian needs of other regions.</P>
    <P>In 2002 the Government intervened to provide humanitarian assistance such as food, water, shelter and medicines on more than 120 occasions in over 30 countries, including Iraq, throughout the world. This is testament to our commitment to respond to the needs of the poor in times of crisis. It was the flexible and unallocated nature of our funds which allowed us to respond quickly to humanitarian needs as they arose. As the situation in Iraq unfolds, Ireland will work as part of a concerted international humanitarian effort involving the United Nations, the European Union and NGOs.</P>
    <P>I remind Deputies that we live in a very imperfect world. I dearly wish this conflict could have been avoided. We worked very hard during our time as a member of the Security Council to alleviate the effects of economic sanctions on the innocent civilian population of Iraq. We lent our support to every effort to find a peaceful solution through diplomatic means. At this difficult time I will do everything in my power to address the dreadful humanitarian consequences of this conflict. I thank Deputy Kenny and his party for bringing this motion to the House. There is a significant sense of solidarity and unity emanating from this debate tonight. It is appropriate to have a debate in the House on this subject. It is right and proper that all Members unite in playing our part with the United Nations, NGOs and other countries to provide much needed assistance to the innocent civilians in Iraq who are suffering and are in urgent need.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatCarey" hpid="Mr. Carey Mr. Carey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Carey</NameTxt>
      <P>I compliment Deputy Kenny and the Fine Gael Party for presenting the House with the opportunity to debate the appalling disaster in Iraq. To echo what Deputy Coveney said, I am not here to talk about the legitimacy or otherwise of the war. Those of us who are members of the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs listened today to John O'Shea, Tom Arnold and their colleagues talk about the humanitarian aspects of this conflict and this is what I wish to focus on in my contribution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I saw a film clip on the television news tonight which was virtually nauseating. Journalists who are embedded with the coalition forces, so-called independent journalists, had been brought in to see how coalition forces were distributing humanitarian aid. There are many losses in this war and one of the greatest is the link being made between military intervention and humanitarian aid. It is an appalling perversion to attempt that. The other great loser is undoubtedly the United Nations. A strong respected organisation has been virtually brought to its knees by the actions of members who could not convince their colleagues of their point of view. Like other speakers, I urge the Minister of State and his colleagues to do everything in their power to restore the pri<Col N="102" /> macy of the United Nations as a determining force in the preservation of the rule of law, humanitarian assistance and regulation of world politics.</P>
    <P>The famine in the Horn of Africa has been another loser. It does not have the same attraction for the media as the Playstation war being played out on television. We must help to restore the attention of the world to that famine.</P>
    <P>John O'Shea outlined various scenarios to the committee this afternoon. We all want to see an end to this war very quickly but I wonder if that will happen. I note that the British soldiers were instructed to take off their helmets and mix with the local people and develop a bond with them. I am reminded of another time and place when the same soldiers made the same attempt to fraternise with the locals only to find that they had to admit 30 years later that their intervention was not capable of solving the problems of the North. Like Deputy Coveney, I hope it will not take as long for the world to extricate itself from this mess. I hope there will be fewer casualties in Iraq than I fear there may well be.</P>
    <P>There is a need to restore water and food supplies. Humanitarian corridors must be established as a matter of urgency. We must ensure that the United Nations is regarded as the agent of the delivery of humanitarian aid to Iraq, otherwise there will be a replication of what was attempted in Kosovo and Afghanistan. There is a pattern emerging which links humanitarian aid with military intervention in order to win over the population. Tom Arnold from Concern made an interesting and frightening comment this afternoon. He said that the cost of the first 30 days of the military intervention was estimated at $62 billion. The allocation by the United States for reconstruction in Iraq is $1.7 billion and for humanitarian intervention it is $ 0.5 billion. This is the same as the request for additional funding for the FBI to enhance domestic counter-terrorism measures. The humanitarian budget is 3.5% of that for the prosecution of the conflict. I urge the Minister of State to work with his colleagues in the European Union to ensure Ireland works with its colleagues in the United Nations to use the people, about whom Deputy Coveney spoke, who have expertise and world respect in this area. There are at least three such people in this House, the Minister of State, Deputy Kitt, Deputy O'Donnell and Deputy Michael D. Higgins, all of whom have contacts, expertise and a level of respect which will help contribute to the resolution of this conflict.</P>
    <P>I hope the House will unite tomorrow night around the Fine Gael motion, which is comprehensive, all-embracing and will attract the support of the Irish people by way of a response that probably has not been seen before, but which will be necessary. If the small number of us who are here talking about this particular issue do nothing else other than mobilise the Irish humanitarian will behind the need to support the people in <Col N="103" /> Iraq, it will have been a couple of hours well spent.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieOConnorFF" hpid="Mr. O'Connor Mr. O'Connor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Connor</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister of State, Deputy Kitt, for allowing me to share time with him and Deputy Carey because I am anxious to contribute to the debate. I compliment Deputy Gay Mitchell, Deputy Kenny and other members of the Fine Gael Party for giving us an opportunity to speak on this important matter.</P>
      <P>A number of phrases struck me today. Some people take the notion that certain members of certain parties have different attitudes to war and attempts are made to paint us as some sort of pro-war advocates, which we are not. I come from a generation which was opposed to war. My father was a member of the Irish Guards and saw action in the war. As I grew up, I had very clear views on war and what it meant. It upsets me as a public representative that politicians like me are being targeted by anti-war groups. Some 12 people turned up at my clinic in Old Bawn the other day chanting and screaming, trying to intimidate and upset people who had come to my clinic. These people try to prevent politicians from providing a service, which is what we do at advice centres.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FinianMcGrath" hpid="Mr. F. McGrath Mr. F. McGrath">
      <NameTxt>Mr. F. McGrath</NameTxt>
      <P>There is nothing wrong with peaceful protests.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieOConnorFF" hpid="Mr. O'Connor Mr. O'Connor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Connor</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not the way to behave. If I were protesting I would not threaten to throw paint, bang on windows, kick doors or push posters in the faces of elderly vulnerable people. I have no problem with protests because I have often been involved in them. It is how I learned my political trade. However, this is not the way to behave. Apart from intimidating people seeking help from politicians, it creates the impression that all politicians are somehow involved in this situation. I am clearly stating that I oppose war. There should be a more effective way to deal with world problems other than bombing poor people.</P>
      <P>I am struck by the images I see on television and in the media. Years ago, when we saw war pictures they were all done in a sort of ra-ra way, which seemed harmless. Now television, particularly Sky News, is bringing war and killing into our homes. We see civilians and children being killed, which is very upsetting. Two phrases struck me particularly today; I listened to a young person being interviewed on &ldquo;Five Seven Live&rdquo; who said that &ldquo;war is never the answer&rdquo; which is correct. The Taoiseach also said today that an enormous tragedy is unfolding. There is no question about that. It typifies the way we all feel about it. It is correct to call on the Government to deal with the humanitarian fall-out which is happening.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While I am not a member of the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Foreign Affairs, I compliment my colleagues who arranged the meeting today. I watched the entire meeting and I was <Col N="104" /> very impressed by Concern and GOAL's presentations. John O'Shea articulated a sense of what we all feel. It is important to put on record a couple of the important remarks. He said the Irish Government should support efforts by the UN to make the aid operation in Iraq a UN-led operation. I hope we all agree to that. He also said that the Irish Government must assist all the NGOs 100% once they become operational. He made the point that no one should be testing these organisations; now is the time to help them deliver. He stated in his document that the Irish Government should not be in any great rush to pledge huge sums to the problem because the area is awash with money. It is important to understand the challenge NGOs face. One of the things that came across to me, which has been mentioned in this debate, is that the food shortages and droughts in Southern Africa, for example, have not gone away. John O'Shea made the point that the fact we do not read about the problem in the newspapers and hear about it on our TV screens does not mean it has gone away. That is what Iraq is doing because there is nothing else on the news.</P>
    <P>Perhaps now is the time for all of us to put our money where our mouth is and assist these organisations. I hope the Irish people will be generous in their response to them, as they always have been. We should lead the way in that regard. I hope the different political parties, through all their representatives, will find a way to do that.</P>
    <P>We must support the Government in its efforts. I was pleased last week when the Government was one of the first countries to respond to the situation by donating &euro;5 million. It is important that the Minister of State understands that what he is attempting to achieve has widespread support. He certainly has my support. It is important that we all unite on the issue before us tonight because we can see the difficulties of the Iraqi people and the terrible deeds which are being carried out by the international community. It upsets me that it is presumed that people on different sides of the House, who belong to different political parties, do not have a strong desire for peace. It is not just talk. I am saying to the Government &ndash; I know other colleagues will do likewise &ndash; that it must do everything possible in this regard. I was pleased when I listened last night to the Minister of State, Deputy Kitt, on &ldquo;Questions and Answers&rdquo; who calmly and responsibly dealt with the issues. It is an emotive issue, as Deputy Finian McGrath demonstrated. To some extent, we should all unite behind it. I am not a warmonger and anyone who thinks I am is off his head as far as I am concerned. We should show solidarity with the UN and the people of Iraq. We should say this is wrong and there should be a different way to deal with the issue.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to share my time with Deputy Burton.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The first point I want to make is that there has always been unanimity in this House in regard to <Col N="105" /> development aid, which is to be welcomed. As Labour Party spokesperson on foreign affairs, I am pleased to support this motion. I echo Deputy Kenny's statement that the war is illegal; it has no legal authority. Our participation in this debate should not be a substitute for a deeper debate, which I hope will be provided in Government time, on some fundamentals regarding the causes of this war, its implications and the possibility of bringing it to a halt. I urge the Minister of State to ask his colleague, the Chief Whip, to arrange that debate as speedily as possible. It must consider such issues as the legality or otherwise of the actions taking place, the serious consequences of pre-emption being accepted as a principle in international policy and the fundamental issue as to where, if in any resolution or any aspect of international law, the suggestion that regime change can be a project of one government directed against another. The United Nations Charter makes no provision for this.</P>
    <P>We cannot avoid these issues. It is not that we can choose to avoid them. As signatories to the United Nations Charter we have an obligation to consider them. Our consideration of the humanitarian dimension cannot ever be a substitute for our consideration of the fundamental principles of foreign policy, except at a moral cost. The Fine Gael Party leader adverted to this aspect when he moved the motion. He has my support. Those of us who have spent all our lives urging the importance of development aid and its expansion, and applauded its significant achievements under people such as Deputy O'Donnell, never saw it as a substitute for foreign policy, nor can it ever be.</P>
    <P>Turning to the specifics of the motion, it is important that we draw some distinctions. There appears to be general agreement in the House that the militarisation of aid would be a disaster. Before we get to that point it is important to understand the situation in Iraq. According to the human development index, it has fallen from 96th place to 127th. The country is perhaps the most important world centre in terms of the development of human civilisation. In the mouth of the two great rivers, the Tigres and Euphrates, we have the origins of most of the world's civilisations, all the major religions, the origins of the first written code of law, the code of <i>Hammurabi,</i> the city of Uhr and the origins of the Syrian civilisation. We are concerned with a people who have been engaged in thousands of years of the development of culture before western civilisation, as we like to describe it, developed.</P>
    <P>I have had the advantages and the sorrow of visiting Iraq on three occasions, in 1990, 2001 and some weeks ago. Between 1991 and 2001, the country had been humiliated by the sanctions. A proud country had been brought to its knees, its children put at risk and the civilian population made the target of initiatives that were directed allegedly against the consequences and the actions of a regime which was rightly criticised.</P>
    <P>In 1988 in this House I criticised <i>Alaja.</i> I can <Col N="106" /> speak about it in detail. It arose because of a war between Iran and Iraq, but also because of immediate engagement between the two countries. Contrary to what many say, my information in 1988, which has remained unchanged, was that the chemical capacity was supplied to Iran by western powers. Iraq used mustard gas. It does not matter. The Kurds were the victims and at the time not much attention was focused on what happened. People went on not only to sell weapons of destruction to both sides, but they tried to sell beef and more. They also tried to buy oil. They were not interested in dealing with the position of the Kurdish people. Later, the Shiite people would be abandoned in the south.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State said that United Nations Resolution 1472 authorises the Secretary General to administer the oil for food programme for the next 45 days and possibly longer. That is somewhat abstracted. While the resolution was passed, we must be clear about a number of aspects that people do not seem to understand.</P>
    <P>The oil for food programme was offered to Iraq in 1991. I recall the debate around it. It was accepted by Iraq in 1996. Resolution 687 introduced the sanctions. Paragraph 22 provided that if Iraq eliminated its weapons of mass destruction the sanctions would end. It was arbitrarily ended by the then United States Secretary of State, Warren Christopher, who dropped the offer of the ending of the sanctions for compliance by Iraq. In 1997, his successor, Madeline Albright, confirmed this position. Tragically, those who wanted a war in Iraq and prepared a project for it, started their preparations in the early 1990s. I will return to this in the substantive debate.</P>
    <P>When the oil for food programme commenced, it was not an alternative to normal economic production. It was accepted in 1996 and changed in 1999 when Iraq was allowed to produce as much oil as it wished. The programme would then be implemented in a certain way. Some 25% of oil revenue was directed to the reparation fund while between 3% and 5% was directed to the United Nations administration costs. At one stage the Iraqi people were using their oil to pay for bombs being dropped on them in the no fly zone. They also paid for the inspectors. Resolution 1441 was succeeding. The inspectors could have worked under it and could have succeeded in the elimination of weapons of mass destruction. Much of their efforts were funded by Iraqi oil production.</P>
    <P>Since 1996, &euro;61 billion has been generated by oil production. Of that, $26 billion has been spent on humanitarian supplies, while six months ago &ndash; the last occasion I checked the figures &ndash; $10 billion was held up in production and delivery pipeline systems. Under the oil for food programme, Iraq could produce oil. Some of the revenue was directed to the reparation fund and administration while the remainder was directed to purchasing food. Hitherto, in the three Kurdish governorships in the north of the country, the food was administered directly by United Nations <Col N="107" /> officials who have since gone. Some local people remain, but who will now undertake this task?</P>
    <P>In the south and centre of the country, which includes Baghdad, 46% of the population are under the age of 15 years while 72% live in cities. This will produce a high ratio of civilian casualties should there be urban warfare. Food is distributed to 48,352 distribution centres. It arrives in the south and is sent to regional warehouses from where it goes to the distribution centres.</P>
    <P>When I visited Baghdad I was told that the population had been instructed by the Ba'ath Party to stay in their homes. They have now been told by the newspapers and a scandalous media, one that has prostituted itself in the case of Sky Television, that they will face a siege. How will they access the food distribution points, many of which contain members of the Ba'ath Party? If every member of the Ba'ath Party is to be regarded as a potential member of the <i>Fedayeen</i> to be removed, what structure will be put in place?</P>
    <P>According to my estimates, approximately 500,000 tonnes of food have been distributed in the south and centre of the country. The Minister of State mentioned 480,000 tonnes. The difference is not significant, but it is significant that the largest amount of food moved in the world was between Pakistan and Afghanistan. That amounted to 100,000 tonnes per month. The food distribution structure is now to be removed, which means that people will no longer be able to access the distribution centres and collect their allowance, made up of a daily amount of 2,250 kilocalories 40 grams of protein, etc. That system, akin to a ration card approach, was in existence before the oil for food programme. It means that a food programme paid for by Iraqi oil and distributed by the Iraqi Government will be removed.</P>
    <P>What, then, is suggested by Resolution 1472? Is it suggested that the Iraqi Government should agree to the production of the oil for distribution by the United States and the United Kingdom? How is the food to arrive in the country and make its way to the warehouses and distribution centres and how is it to get to the people? That is the size of the problem.</P>
    <P>In regard to the health requirement, there is no provision for a figure of about 3.5 million people, particularly those at immediate risk such as pregnant women and lactating mothers. The militarisation of aid is not a slogan. What is happening is that a national government-administered food programme is being taken out without any humanitarian substitute being put in its place. The suggestion is that we have either a US military person step in or that we negotiate with some Iraqi officials.</P>
    <P>The reality in regard to Basra and other cities is that UNICEF has 160 Iraqi nationals working for the organisation. They are enormously valuable but the people in charge of the contingency plans for the distribution in Baghdad, whom I <Col N="108" /> met and spoke to, were the people who were first removed and then withdrawn. The people with the contingency plan are gone. Therefore, the best way of looking after the humanitarian relief is to end the war. That means taking initiatives at the Security Council to get like minded groups of nations to intervene, even at this stage, to stop this civilian catastrophe that will take place and that will cause such damage to the people of Iraq, to the region and to the entire Muslim world. We are not just left wing people who are against the war. What about the Muslim populations of Indonesia and Malaysia and those across the world? It is this madness that is creating this war and its enormous consequences.</P>
    <P>About three months ago when I was in Baghdad, one of the most valuable meetings I had was with six international medical people who produced a report which they handed over to me and which has been distributed, I understand, to many Members of this House. The report was entitled Our Common Responsibility &ndash; The Impact of a New War on Iraqi Children. This report gave all the figures that anybody might want. It draws on UNICEF figures showing that 24% of the children under five are malnourished and it refers to the people I mentioned already, those immediately in need.</P>
    <P>There is another side to this. How can a people with 9,000 years of civilisation behind them accept the suggestion that they must have $62 billion worth of destruction rained down on top of their houses, their institutions, their infrastructure, their electricity network and so on and then have someone come along and say they are willing to invite them to democracy with $500 million of expenditure? That is an obscenity. The depictions we are getting of all of this on our television screens lower us. I feel demeaned by the totally unregulated images I have to see on television.</P>
    <P>Before I give time to my colleague, Deputy Burton, I want to propose something practical we can do. The Fourth Geneva Convention on the protection of civilians and children states that the destruction of infrastructure required for &ldquo;the protection and sustenance of children&rdquo; is illegal. Of course that was a crime in 1991 but it happened then and 50,000 children under the age of five died for one reason or another. If we are to avoid that happening again we must exercise the capacity of the Fourth Geneva Convention which suggests, under Articles 52, 53, 132 and 149, that a body of inquiry, an independent commission, be established to look at compliance with the Geneva Convention. That is what we should be seeking. We should be at the Security Council working night and day with like minded nations to stop this war. We should be seeking the implementation of the Fourth Geneva Convention. We should be objecting, as I am sure all Members do, to the militarisation of aid. We should also seek to enter into dialogue on a regional basis with all of the parties involved.</P>
    <P>I would not like to have it on my hands that I <Col N="109" /> introduced the concept of a suicide bomber to some Palestinians neglected by the international community since 1947. Now this concept is in Iraq and we wait and wait for somebody else like Donald Rumsfeld to say Iran might be next or Syria is not to be trusted.</P>
    <P>Remember the people who started this war and those who sustain it. They are talking about a war fought with other people's children. That itself is scandalous. Youngsters from Britain and the United States will die in an unnecessary and disgraceful war.</P>

      <P>There are two issues that raise questions for the Irish Government tonight about the role that Ireland will play in humanitarian relief in Iraq. Will our aid budget for emergencies in Africa and other desperately poor parts of the world be raided to divert funds to offer short-term relief to those wounded or displaced by the war machine? Will the poorest in Africa, or AIDS victims, have to suffer more and wait longer in order to finance the relief of war suffering. Will we rob the starving and the sick of Africa to heal the war wounds of Iraq? The second issue raises the question: What is the view of our Government of the current scenes of aid distribution in Iraq?</P>
      <P>Our television screens are currently showing disgraceful and shameful images of fit, young Iraqi men in their early 20s fighting and scrambling to catch the aid, bottles of water and small packets of food, from other fit young men, British and American soldiers. These scenes are either a staged photographic show or the distribution of the assistance is entirely haphazard and unplanned. Either way, the chances are that the young men receiving the assistance will probably go on to sell it on the black market.</P>
      <P>As a former development worker in Tanzania, and as a former Minister of State with responsibility for development aid from 1995-97, I have been in many refugee camps and have witnessed many distributions. I was shocked to see these able bodied young men being the recipients of humanitarian aid rather than women and children or vulnerable older people of both sexes.</P>
      <P>All wars and conflict situations produce those who aim to make money out of the extremes of human suffering and out of the aid business. Realists know that to prevent humanitarian aid being ripped off by the fittest, as we saw this week, it has to be well organised, with the vulnerable coming first. Reputable international and Irish agencies have worked out &ldquo;rules of the game&rdquo; to try to prevent abuse. Armies, unless trained to do the job, are not the appropriate mechanism for the delivery of aid.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the Irish Government wants to make sure that the &euro;5 million we are donating is not abused, as we have seen, it better exert what influence it has to ensure that UN organisations such as UNDP and UNICEF, as well as our own internationally recognised NGOs, such as Trócaire, <Col N="110" /> Concern and GOAL, are centrally involved in the distribution of humanitarian assistance.</P>
    <P>I witnessed the attempted re-colonisation of Rwanda by hundreds of different aid agencies and NGOs, all fighting for shares of the aid dollars post the horrible genocide. I do not want to see a repetition of that situation in Iraq or to see our Government sanctioning that.</P>
    <P>I remember as the war in Afghanistan raged that many world leaders promised a war on disease and poverty. A new international social order would be born to arrest the drift of the world's poorest to Islamic terrorists. It was a false dawn. The first priority of American aid, such as it is, in Afghanistan after the war was not a hospital or a school or a clinic, the biggest single project is a five star hotel in Kabul.</P>
    <P>The US has become the master dodger of humanitarian obligations. It wants Europe to mop up after the bombs and missiles, while the cronies and paymasters of Cheney and Rumsfeld carpet bag their way to the plunder of Iraq's fabulous wealth.</P>
    <P>We need re-assurances from our Government that Irish aid to Iraq is additional to the humanitarian budget already agreed. Given the inherent wealth and capacity of Iraq, Ireland will assist the victims of the war in Iraq best by continuously and strenuously opposing the war, helping it to a conclusion as quickly as possible.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanCroweSF" hpid="Mr. Crowe Mr. Crowe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crowe</NameTxt>
      <P>It is clear from the deal struck between the FAI and Sky last summer that Murdoch intends to expand his foothold here. The effect Murdoch has had on the media and on news and journalism, in particular, was described by prize-winning German journalist Reiner Luyken as a cultural Chernobyl. Fox News in the United States is a byword for sleaze in journalism and pioneered the practice of chasing celebrities with television cameras. Sinn Féin is committed to the principle of a free and open media. A significant portion of our general election manifesto was devoted to the media and the need to protect free speech and public service broadcasting. We say specifically that certain major sporting and cultural events should be designated as protected free-to-air television and we are pleased the Government is moving on this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>An essential part of any democracy is an independent, robust and vigorous media. One of the grassroots responses to what is a battle for the freedom of the press has been the development of the network, Indymedia, which has hundreds of media outlets around the world. These collectives are run by volunteers who believe the cor<Col N="111" /> porate media's coverage of news is deeply flawed and, for all practical purposes, pushes one world view. This is a decision to be welcomed as the media continues to become the property of the few, instead of the voice of the many.</P>
    <P>No Irish broadcaster would be able to compete with the near limitless funds which these trans-national media organisations could pour into Ireland. Already we have seen an erosion of our public service broadcaster's position in Ireland. Regular attacks on public service broadcasting are made by journalists who believe that a market driven approach would ensure a more open media when what we have all seen from the market is an incredible consolidation of media power in the hands of a few companies.</P>
    <P>Many people might still be cynical about why this legislation was not introduced before an election campaign and why the Government parties received a great deal of support from newspapers owned by News Corporation but I do welcome it and thank the Minister for introducing it. As well as his decision to introduce a welcome licence fee increase for RTE before the new year he has done much to protect the principles of public service broadcasting in the State. It would be wrong not to give him credit for this. I look forward to more positive contributions from the Minister and his Department.</P>

      <P>I am very pleased to speak on this Bill which will be welcomed. I say &ldquo;hear, hear&rdquo; to the Minister, Deputy Ahern's comment that his aspiration is that the legislation will ensure that events of major importance will not end up out of reach of those who wish to view them. He said it would stop a two-tier television system developing which, according to the Minister, would deprive the public of involvement in events which are part of Irish culture and identity. I congratulate the Minister on the Bill and I hope all the talk of ending the two-tier system is contagious. I hope it will spread to the Departments of the Taoiseach, Finance, and Health and Children, in particular, to persuade them to end the two-tier health system, this health apartheid and especially the cancer care apartheid, about which people demonstrated on Saturday, and allow equal access to radiotherapy and oncology services.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister said access to sports events should not be limited to those who can pay. Similarly, access to the health service should not be limited to those who can pay. I wish the Minister, Deputy Ahern, would convince the Taoiseach and his Cabinet colleagues to introduce similar legislation in the health area but that is a pious aspiration. Let us imagine legislation which ensured that a person suffering from cancer, whom a consultant knows is in urgent need of radiotherapy and would be cured by its immediate application, would not have to wait for, say, four months which is the norm. I would be very <Col N="112" /> excited about that type of legislation. I suppose it has something to do with money that it is not being introduced. It is penny-wise and pound foolish because bringing people all over Ireland for radiotherapy services costs more money than would the provision of local radiotherapy services. I do not begrudge the &euro;161 million allocated to sporting organisations by the Government in 2002 but I resent the fact that only &euro;23.5 million was allocated to 11 health boards to develop cancer services in 2002.</P>
    <P>I pay tribute to the sporting organisations which do good work and deserve to be supported. The events covered by the Bill are part of what we are and part of our national fabric. It would be wrong if the population was denied access to these events due to an inability to pay. It is ironic that we agree it is wrong that people can be denied access to those sporting events while we think it is right that people can be deprived of health services because they cannot pay.</P>
    <P>It is important for us in the west to have access to these sporting events on the television because it is impossible to get to Dublin due to the condition of the roads. Even the railway line goes south before it goes west. We in Mayo have the worst road access in the country. That these events will be shown on television will certainly help us. Sport helps young people; anything that keeps our young people out of public houses is a help. If the sporting event is on Sky television, youngsters will go to the pub to watch it and that is particularly bad in rural areas. If it is available on the television at home they, and perhaps their mothers, fathers and the rest of us, can stay away from the pub.</P>
    <P>There is a move to commercialisation and the drinks companies have been backing the sporting organisations. It is important that the GAA would not sell its soul in all of this. While the broadcasting rights are worth a good deal of money it is no harm that there is a bar on a free-for-all for the organisations who would deprive the public of the right to view those interesting events. A number of sporting events have been listed about which other Members will speak. At the end of the day, sporting organisations are being given an opportunity to raise money.</P>
    <P>I would like to see more legislation to prevent discrimination, particularly in the area of health. Let us have legislation to prevent discrimination against balanced regional development in the west.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeHiggins" hpid="Mr. J. Higgins Mr. J. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>The coverage of the war in Iraq by the international television networks demonstrates graphically the urgency for regulations covering the activity of major television broadcasters. A criminal and illegal war involving the slaughter and brutalisation of hundreds, if not thousands, of civilians is manipulated by these networks as if it were the latest version of a Playstation game. Human suffering and the brutalisation of people are merely used as the raw <Col N="113" /> material for these networks to increase their profits, to make more money for their proprietors. In effect, they have become a propaganda arm of the US and British invasion forces devoid of morality, humanity and any sense of fair play as far as the innocent people of Iraq are concerned.</P>
      <P>The approach is the same when it comes to the coverage of major events, whether sports, cultural or other events which are important to people here. These networks are not concerned about sports, human endeavour, healthy recreation, cultural advancement of people but about the maximisation of profit for the networks and their major shareholders.</P>
      <P>Irish people were rightly disgusted when the BSkyB network was given the rights for the Irish soccer internationals last year. That should never have been allowed to happen. Under the 1999 Act the Government should have already moved in order to ring-fence crucial major sporting events in anticipation of what might happen. The Government was negligent in not having acted at that stage and is now attempting to catch up.</P>
      <P>When the Sky organisation tried to grab the rights to Irish soccer it did not do so in the interest of Irish sport or of the tens of thousands of people, including many young people, who play soccer. It made a cynical marketing ploy, hoping to use the popularity of soccer, particularly in working class communities but now more widely spread, to increase the level of subscriptions to its channels. This is what it did in the UK to drive up satellite subscriptions over a period of time. It is incredible that the FAI was prepared to co-operate with this and it shows how far the leadership of that organisation has grown from the ordinary people who support the game.</P>
      <P>Public broadcasting is crucial to a decent society, where news, current affairs and other important events are debated with all points of view taken into account. That is not the type of service we will get from the private broadcasters and that is why we must protect and develop public broadcasting. We must, of course, democratise it further from where it is at the present time.</P>
      <P>The list of major events drawn up by the Minister is minimalist in the extreme. Other events may be corralled off by some of the private broadcasters. If that happens the Government will bear responsibility for not having created a sufficiently wide list.</P>
      <P>Tá sé thar a bheith tábhachtach go mbeadh ócáidí móra le fáil go hoscailte ag an bpobal go ginearálta tríd an teilifís. Chuige sin, tá córas láidir teilifíse poiblí ag teastáil.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Eamon Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The key to the Minister's speech is his saying that in protecting the public <Col N="114" /> interest he also has to take into account the interests of event organisers and broadcasters. The Minister also said he is considering the concerns raised by certain sporting organisations and is open to amendments that are justifiable and necessary. I hope he will also be open to amendments from this side of the House which would protect the public interest. This Bill does not go far enough nor does it water tighten sufficiently the public's right to free access by terrestrial television to key sporting events and key parts of our cultural life. I accept the general purpose of the Bill but I ask the Minister to accept amendments on Committee Stage which will make the Bill work. In its present guise it will not lead to protection of our sporting events from encroachment by pay-per-view satellite television.</P>
      <P>I can understand the pressure the Minister is under from certain sporting organisations which are going to face funding difficulties, given Government cutbacks, and which will be looking for revenue. However, I question the judgment of those sporting organisations if they see revenue generation as coming ahead of looking after their core supporters, the Irish public. I agree with Deputy Joe Higgins when he says the FAI's action in this regard was reprehensible. I also question the IRFU's lobbying to ensure the Six Nations Championship was taken off the list of completely free events. The IRFU has deferred rights in terms of television for those matches. I have been a rugby supporter all my life but if I cannot get a ticket and if I cannot get to watch my team playing, like many others I will soon lose interest and follow a different sport. The main sporting organisations must realise that they have a responsibility to work with national and terrestrial broadcasters and provide free televised access to certain key events which are the cornerstone of our sporting life.</P>
      <P>Although they are not the cornerstone of our life some of the satellite broadcasters, such as Sky, have been given complete freedom to broadcast. The Minister recently indicated that he will place a restriction on Sky's broadcasting into the State but the reality is that Sky can broadcast directly into the State at little or no cost in terms of its access to the broadcasting spectrum. It can advertise directly by inserting specifically Irish advertising into its programmes which are made for an international market. With no programming costs Sky can suck advertising revenue out of the country with no regulation, no quality in standards and no comeback to an Irish customer who has a difficulty with the network. The inability of the Government and its slow, ponderous, hear no evil, see no evil approach which has allowed Sky to win a strong position in Irish broadcasting will have serious consequences for broadcasting in this State and must be addressed urgently. This Bill is part of that process.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the key amendments will address the question of how the arbiter is guided as to what costs he or she would impose for particular events. I am concerned when I hear the Minister <Col N="115" /> talk about market rates. Should we follow the market in terms of pay-per-view market prices for sporting events? That would give an unfair advantage. Organisations like Sky, which can earn large revenues from the Republic at no cost, can buy up sporting events. Its £12 million purchase of the European Championships games works out at a rate of about &euro;380,000 per game. The main terrestrial broadcasters cannot compete against that because they are not competing on a like basis. Sky has no costs other than the set-up costs in terms of sets. It has no significant broadcasting costs compared with Irish terrestrial television.</P>
    <P>When we talk about market rate we must be sure that the arbiter takes into account the previous rates as applied to terrestrial television and not the special inflated prices that satellite television has used to muscle its way into the broadcasting market. That must be made clear in an amendment to the Bill.</P>
    <P>A further amendment would ensure that production costs involved for terrestrial television companies are taken into account. The broadcaster's role must be recognised and account taken of the broadcaster's costs when the arbiter is deciding on rates.</P>
    <P>A key component, which must be included by amendment, is that recognition is made of terrestrial broadcasters' regular involvement in broadcasting a sport on a weekly basis in the early rounds of competitions. This must be taken into account in the bidding war for the final prize of the major event. The arbiter will have to have a complex analysis of what the rate should be and not simply decide that if Sky is prepared to pay a certain amount then the terrestrial broadcasters should do the same.</P>
    <P>If we do not consider those complex factors, the main Irish terrestrial broadcasters will not be able to afford the rate the arbiter will set and the satellite channels will continue to pick up our main sporting events and continue their encroachment on Irish broadcasting. We will then lose control, independence and our own broadcasting facilities, which are better, in the long run, for Irish sport.</P>
    <P>Another key amendment will clarify how the Bill will apply to institutions outside the State. The rights to most of the major sporting events are increasingly held internationally, often on a temporary contract basis by companies who may be trading it on elsewhere. We are into a difficult area here in terms of how international law applies and how an Irish High Court decision can have effect in regard to a broadcasting right which is held in Britain or elsewhere. If we do not include this, it will lessen the claim of Irish broadcasters and Irish sporting organisations to that broadcasting right. We need to work out some legal mechanism within the Bill which enforces its applicability in the overseas market or in overseas courts.</P>
    <P>In general, I am supportive of the Bill. The <Col N="116" /> Minister and the Government are coming incredibly late to this. They have slipped up and allowed a loss of control of Irish broadcasting to outside satellite stations which are coming in here. I do not mind that. It is a reasonable component of international broadcasting and while we cannot stop it, we certainly must regulate it and support and protect our indigenous broadcasting industry. If we do not do so, we will find we cannot compete against digital or satellite services which do not have any investment in this State, nor any local knowledge or colour and just use a strategy of picking certain high profile sporting events to increase their subscriber levels to encroach into a dominant position in the Irish broadcasting market. If the Government were to allow that to happen, it would be a huge loss to the State.</P>
    <P>I encourage the Minister to be open to amendments. The Bill is complex and the arbiter's role is a difficult and complex one. It is a legally complex situation and an area where none of us is an expert but I hope the Minister will take advice and amendments which will strengthen the legal role of the arbiter and make his decisions more finely balanced in favour of the broadcasters and the sporting institutions but also, crucially, in favour of the public interest.</P>

      <P>Alarm bells rang in my head when I heard the news last July of the FAI selling the rights to Ireland's home games. Fans who had followed the team all over the globe were angry that hundreds of thousands of supporters would be forced to subscribe to BSkyB. I have rarely seen an issue which aroused such strong public emotions. Everyone I spoke to was absolutely fuming because there are so many fans who cannot make it to games or even get tickets for games and they rely on free-to-air television to watch their heroes. My constituents in Cork were angry at the BSkyB deal which would have meant thousands of households would have to fork out &euro;40 per month to see the home games live on TV. Irate fans telephoned Cork's 96 FM, 103 FM and Red FM and wrote letters to the <i>Evening Echo, Inside Cork</i> and the <i>Irish Examiner.</i> The parents of young children believed their offspring would effectively be prevented from watching their role models, Robbie Keane, Damian Duff, our own Roy Keane when he was playing, and so on, in the comfort of their own homes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The FAI failed to give due consideration to the interests of Cork's children and young people prior to the sale of its broadcasting rights for Ireland's home international football matches. As a body that receives substantial public funding, the FAI is obliged to ensure that its decisions and actions conform to generally accepted standards regarding the promotion of the public interest. <Col N="117" /> One of the most widely accepted standards holds that in all actions that concern children, the best interests of the child should be a primary consideration. By limiting viewing access to families who can afford to pay almost &euro;500 per year, the FAI turned its back on the great majority of children and young people in Ireland. The situation was made worse by the suggestion that pubs might offer an alternative viewing venue. We should be doing everything in our power to break the strong link which connects alcohol and sport in this country. Very few of my constituents in Cork North-Central would allow their children to go to the pub on a Wednesday night to watch matches. Without the next generation being able to watch their heroes, the money invested in local soccer would be wasted due to lack of interest.</P>
    <P>I was delighted that within a few days of the FAI announcement, the Minister, Deputy Dermot Ahern, made clear his intention to sort out the situation. The fruits of his efforts over the past nine months is this Broadcasting (Major Events Television Coverage) (Amendment) Bill, which copper-fastens the viewing of major sporting events on free-to-air television. The original Act, the Broadcasting (Major Events Television Coverage) Act 1999 incorporated into Irish law the provisions of Article 3a of the Television Without Frontiers Directive, which allows member states to designate certain events as events of major importance to society in order to ensure that a substantial proportion of the Irish population is not deprived of the possibility of watching such events on free television services.</P>
    <P>In accordance with the provisions of the 1999 Act, the Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources published a list of events which he proposed to designate. The order giving effect to the designation has already been approved by both Houses of the Oireachtas and has been signed by the Minister.</P>
    <P>The consultation process undertaken by him in regard to the listing of events gave rise to two substantive issues which need to be addressed by way of amending legislation. It became clear that existing legislation would not adequately ensure that designated events that are already the subject of an existing contract for exclusive broadcasting rights would continue to be available on Irish free television services. Accordingly, the Broadcasting (Major Events Television Coverage) (Amendment) Bill 2003 will include provisions dealing with this issue, which we welcome.</P>
    <P>The national governing bodies of sports organisations expressed the fear that they would not receive a fair price for the sale of the broadcasting rights to a qualified broadcaster, for example, RTE or TV3 for a designated event and highlighted the need to introduce a formal arbitration mechanism. Accordingly, the Bill will include a provision establishing an arbitration mechanism to facilitate the determination of reasonable market rates for a designated event. This legislation <Col N="118" /> will ensure that sports events of major importance will not end up out of reach of those who wish to view them. This will stop the development of a two-tier television system which would deprive the public of involvement in events that are part of our national identity.</P>
    <P>In recent times the media has become a major social force in modern Irish society, fulfilling numerous different functions &ndash; it entertains, informs, provokes, excites and saddens. When it first emerged, the media's role was to report what was happening in the world but in recent times it has developed this role to investigate, challenge and expose, which is crucial to the development and maintenance of a mature and democratic society. The media has become the public watchdog and is known as the fourth estate. It enables people to communicate and participate in civil society and with the State. If the Irish, at home and abroad, are to debate our past, present and future, if we need to give public expression to our values then we will need indigenous broadcasting on radio and television to express this community's dialogue with itself and the rest of the world. The public purpose of this broadcasting will be first and foremost to serve the entire community with a range of programming which is universally available and affordable and which will not be supplied by broadcasters who are principally obliged to make profits for their commercial operators. Vigorous public service broadcasting is essential to our country's future as a democracy. The Minister has protected the public's right to view major events deemed of national importance.</P>
    <P>We will have time next week to tease out all of the concerns expressed by the Opposition. Any amendments put down will be debated in the Select Committee on Communications, Marine and Natural Resources. I hope that following this we will emerge with legislation of which everyone in the House will be proud and in which we can all say we had a part in ensuring its safe passage through the Houses.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BillyKelleher" hpid="Mr. Kelleher Mr. Kelleher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelleher</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy O'Flynn for sharing time with me. I welcome the opportunity to debate this important Bill which is indicative of the esteem in which we hold sport in this country.</P>
      <P>If one looks back over recent great sporting moments in Irish history we see evidence of a nation coming to a standstill when the Irish soccer team played abroad or during the All-Ireland Final or, as happened last Sunday, when the rugby team played for the grand slam and the Triple Crown. This goes to show how dearly we feel about sport. It is part and parcel of our everyday life. For that reason, this Bill is very timely.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have a few general concerns about the direction in which sport is going. The whole issue of advertising and sponsorship must be looked at, particularly the close association of sporting events with drinks companies. In the past, tobacco companies sponsored great sporting events, <Col N="119" /> but this role is now being filled by drinks companies. This must be seriously considered.</P>
    <P>Reports have been published on the problems associated with underage binge drinking. Advertisers are covertly creating an association between sport and alcohol, and it is creating problems in our society that must be tackled on a long-term basis. Dr. Loftus of the GAA has raised this issue on numerous occasions, and it is now widely accepted that advertising has a very strong hold over young people. They are impressionable at an early age, and drinks companies can use their sporting heroes to market their products. That must be addressed.</P>
    <P>Over recent years, sport has become a major industry internationally. One of the fastest growing sports in the world, for example, is golf, and a single individual like Tiger Woods can generate huge advertising revenue. Even in this country, there has been a huge growth in sponsorship of the GAA, soccer and rugby. All-Ireland finals have become huge commercial as well as sporting events. That is very welcome, but we must recognise that sport is about participation. It is about young people getting involved at an early age, becoming part of a team, enhancing their self-esteem and developing as individuals. Participation is the essence of sport.</P>
    <P>If we keep going down the road of massive sponsorship and huge advertising campaigns, we will end up with people not participating in sport anymore but merely viewing it. That would have a long-term serious impact for society. Many reports have noted the role of sport as an attractive alternative to anti-social behaviour like drinking and drug taking. However, through their success in attracting advertising and sponsorship, sporting bodies themselves will effectively cut off their noses to spite their faces. Instead of young people getting involved and participating on the field, they will remain at home watching sport day in, day out. Saturation of sports coverage to the point of overkill is an issue that must be addressed.</P>
    <P>Prior to television, among the generation before mine, neighbours would gather in one house to listen to the radio broadcast of the all-Ireland final. It was almost an event in itself in townlands, villages and parishes. That is very important. Families can now sit down and watch sporting events together on television, cheering on their sporting heroes, their country, county or parish. That is what sport is all about. If we go beyond that, to the point where sport becomes a form of entertainment that no longer involves the actual participation of young people, it would be a very dangerous development.</P>
    <P>The FAI and domestic soccer is being swamped by the saturation coverage of the Premiership and the Champions League. If we have an arbitrator in place to adjudicate on which companies can broadcast the various designated events, that arbitrator must take into account the effort that has been made by qualifying broadcasters to <Col N="120" /> cover less prestigious fixtures. Take the FAI as an example. TV3 now broadcasts domestic soccer matches, which is a very welcome and positive development. It gives the domestic league an opportunity to promote itself, to demonstrate that there is good home talent, that facilities are improving and that the standard of the domestic league is improving. Such coverage should be taken into account when it comes to deciding who broadcasts the FAI Cup Final or other events under the control of the FAI.</P>
    <P>Thus, for an organisation that has made the effort to send reporters out on wet, miserable nights to Turners Cross or wherever, that should be taken into account when it then tries to secure the rights to show one of the major sporting events covered in this legislation. That is a very important point. The Minister, through this legislation, gains leverage over organisations interested in showing major sporting events. The fact that companies have shown commitment to lower profile games and to the drudgery that accompanies everyday sport should be taken into account when the arbitrator decides who should be awarded the broadcasting rights to designated events.</P>
    <P>The era of professionalism has been upon us for many years in soccer and has been evident in rugby more recently. It has raised the standard of these games on the pitch. There is now huge pressure on the GAA to embrace professionalism. When one attends an all-Ireland final, one witnesses the spectacle of huge crowds cheering on their county teams. Huge advertising and commercialism has built up around such occasions. Obviously, the main participants in this are the people on the pitch performing for the spectators in the stadium and at home. That issue must be addressed. In the long-term, we must acknowledge that people incur costs when training for many months each year. They also must cope with huge family and financial commitments. This will create enormous pressure on the GAA.</P>
    <P>Equally, however, if organisations are intent on capitalising on the major sporting events and trying to sell them to the highest bidder without taking into account the people who sustain the sport at grass roots levels and attend less glamorous fixtures, it can create different tiers of supporters. Sponsorship will obviously attract the more attractive fixtures with the larger audiences.</P>
    <P>In general, this Bill is very welcome. I have followed Cork hurling and football in particular, which has given us many great occasions over many years. Cork city soccer club also has a new manager, Pat Dolan, whom I wish the best of luck. I know he will bring us on by leaps and bounds. Coverage of less glamorous, everyday sporting events should be taken into account. This Bill gives us an opportunity to create a situation whereby the arbitrator must give consideration to the costs incurred by broadcasters who cover less glamorous events. This would pay great dividends.</P>
    <P>The Irish Derby and Grand National are also <Col N="121" /> events in which a large proportion of the population take a great interest, even if they do not follow horse racing for the rest of the year. I welcome the thrust of the Bill and compliment the Minister on it. Obviously, the FAI jumped the gun in its sponsorship deal in 2002 with BskyB, and it is regrettable that we find ourselves in this situation. If taxpayers make contributions to sporting organisations, the sport ceases to belong exclusively to that organisation. The public take ownership of the sport also by making a contribution to the development of the sport and its infrastructure, training programmes and so on. That has to be taken into account as well when the arbitrator is deciding what terrestrial company should show the major sporting events.</P>
    <P>In recent years the drink culture has grown and we will have many debates on it in the years ahead. If we do not acknowledge that it is one of the biggest scourges facing Irish society, then we have our heads in the sand. All sporting organisations along with Government and society will have to address and confront this problem.</P>
    <P>Reports show that sport is a mechanism which encourages young people to get involved and to participate in something which is positive and which will provide them with an opportunity to express themselves, to build self-esteem and to develop into young adults. Most sporting organisations have developed this area but a grave difficulty is emerging in regard to volunteerism. Many sporting organisations will find it difficult to get volunteers in the years ahead. In the past a person who lined the pitches or who trained the under 14 or the under 12 team received a ticket to the All-Ireland Final at the end of the year as a bonus. As a result of the lack of available tickets, clubs can no longer recognise volunteerism in this way. That is something which will effect all sporting organisations.</P>
    <P>It is time to ensure we have a stadium which can accommodate a greater number of people than heretofore. I urge everybody involved, particularly the GAA which holds the trump card with Croke Park, to ensure as many people as possible can access sport, whether by attending or by viewing it on terrestrial television free of charge. I commend the Bill and I congratulate the Minister on bringing it forward.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaulKehoeFG" hpid="Mr. Kehoe Mr. Kehoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kehoe</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to share my time with Deputies Hayes, Pat Breen and Connaughton.</P>
      <P>I welcome this Bill. The events covered by the Bill are wide-ranging and I do not have to tell the House how important sport is to the people, all of whom have a favourite sport. The Minister has said he would like to get the Bill promptly through the House. For many years there has been much procrastination on this issue and I hope the Bill will copper-fasten the availability of major public events to the television viewing public.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are only too well aware of the circumstances which necessitated this Bill, namely, the loss of international soccer matches. Some people <Col N="122" /> are willing to pay considerable sums of money or pay-per-view fees to watch games which were, in the past, free to those who wished to watch them on RTE 1 or Network 2. I hope this Bill will prevent what has happened from happening in the future.</P>
    <P>This situation would not have arisen if it had been handled more professionally. I understand there was toing and froing between the two parties involved, the FAI and RTE. The FAI wanted to make as much money as possible while RTE was trying to save money. We hope this embarrassing situation whereby the national broadcaster was unable to broadcast the soccer matches and stop the likes of BSkyB coming in will not happen again.</P>
    <P>In Ireland, there are only one or two bidders but in other countries, there are many more because there are more television companies. This creates more competition. When there is only one bidder, it is difficult to establish a market value. In Denmark, Germany and France, there is a range of television stations and they are willing to outbid one another.</P>
    <P>When one thinks back over what happened, it would have been crazy for the FAI to turn down the extra money Sky was willing to pay over RTE. One should consider the type of development for which the extra money could have been used. Maybe it could have been used to improve rural pitches, to look after local teams and to develop the game in urban and rural areas.</P>
    <P>Those who were unable to pay for Sky Television and for the viewing rights were disappointed and, as Deputy O'Flynn said, people were annoyed because they did not believe Sky could come in and prevent the likes of RTE from having the right to show these soccer matches. People were unable to see their favourite team and we all know what the people think of the soccer team going back to the early 1990s when it was managed by Jack Charlton. I hope we never face this situation again.</P>
    <P>The Minister has designated different events but given the sensitive manner in which this set of circumstances came about, much of the debate will centre around soccer. In recent years, this sport has captured the imagination of almost every person on this island, young and old, and they have enjoyed its success. It is easy to understand why people were unhappy when they found out they would have to pay to watch some soccer matches or would only be able to view them when they were over. The people had been deprived of something they enjoyed and deserved. Soccer matches may be the main events requiring free-to-air television coverage but there are other great sporting events, all which cannot be designated as events which must be free-to-air.</P>
    <P>The Government has approved a draft list of sporting events for designation as events of major importance under section 2 of the Broadcasting Act 1999. An array of sporting events is listed but I would like to ask the Minister about one event which is not listed, namely, the provincial hurling <Col N="123" /> and football finals. Like the Minister of State, Deputy Browne, I would like to see Wexford playing in the Leinster final on RTE.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomHayes" hpid="Mr. Hayes Mr. Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>Like the other speakers, I welcome the Bill and I am glad of the opportunity to say a few words on what is important legislation. We all know how important it is to give viewers a chance to see all major sporting events. The proposed legislation ensures that all citizens will have television access to major sporting events in Ireland which Ireland claims as part of its great cultural tradition. These events, such as the All-Ireland Finals, the Irish Grand National and Ireland's home and away qualifying games in the European Football Championships and in the FIFA World Cup tournament, are not merely sporting events, they are part of our cultural tradition and identity.</P>
      <P>These are popular major events that people want to watch on television if they cannot make it to the stadiums, a reality that is becoming more common as ticket prices for these sporting events become increasingly expensive, almost to the point that the average parent finds it difficult to bring the family to some of these events. Last week we saw tickets for the Ireland-England rugby game selling for &euro;2,000, an incredible amount of money. People who were extremely anxious to attend could not get tickets for what was hailed as a huge event in the rugby world. Obviously that will not be the case for every event to which the Bill applies, but it highlights the trend of major sporting events becoming increasingly difficult to watch live, hence its importance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It therefore stands to reason that every citizen should be able to watch these events without having to worry about whether he or she can afford cable television. People deserve to be able to go to pubs to see any of these games free of charge. That is the reason the Bill should have been introduced by the Government, or the previous Government, years ago. We could perhaps have avoided the outrageous situation last year where 30% of the population were deprived of seeing our national soccer team playing in the World Cup when the broadcasting rights were sold to <Col N="124" /> Sky Television. A significant proportion of people in this country, especially those living in rural areas, have no access to cable or satellite television and have no way now of watching the games. I am sure that even those who are able to watch would agree that the sale of the broadcasting rights was an injustice as it ensured that only those soccer fans with money could watch the games.</P>
    <P>Such an outrage should not be a necessary pre-requisite for the introduction of important legislation such as that under discussion. We should not sell the rights of Irish citizens to watch their national team to foreign television networks. These are our games and should be broadcast on our networks. The fact that approximately 30% of citizens do not receive cable television does not mean they do not have an interest in these sporting events. RTE and TV3 were specifically established to ensure that people could watch such events. Any group that limits the exposure of these sporting events does a disservice to the sporting organisations, the broadcasting networks and the people.</P>
    <P>It is important for young people that sports are available for them to watch because it encourages them to participate. Any time there is a major event that achieves much publicity on television, such as an All-Ireland Hurling Final or rugby or soccer matches, the following week young people will be out playing with their footballs or hurleys or whatever. We in Tipperary have seen in the weeks following the many times we have had the honour of winning the All-Ireland in the first Sunday in September young people at crossroads hurling a ball left, right and centre.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Breen</NameTxt>
      <P>I am delighted to have an opportunity to speak on the Bill. Ireland has always been a nation that has been very proud of its sports. The great spirit they have raised in this country is priceless. The All-Ireland hurling wins in 1995 and 1997 showed how important sport was to County Clare and they lifted the spirits of the people of the Banner county. We still talk about it. This was proven again last weekend with the great win Ireland had in Georgia and the scramble for tickets for the Ireland-England match which attracted record numbers of television viewers.</P>
      <P>It cannot be disputed that sport is built into our society, culture and identity as a nation. It is for these reasons that an overdue change in the current law regarding the broadcasting of sporting events must happen immediately. We must support the Bill and not let another opportunity pass us by for fixing the problems surrounding the broadcasting of sporting events. It is necessary to pass this law, not only for the future of sport in this country but also for the future of broadcasting.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The current law, the Broadcasting (Major Events Television Coverage) Act 1999, has <Col N="125" /> caused many problems in the sporting world. Many sporting events are directly affected by the current legislation. The event that stands out most was when our national soccer team made it to the World Cup in Japan and Korea in 2002. This was a great accomplishment for the team and a great triumph for the people. Ireland's admission to the tournament spread excitement throughout the country and the world. It created a great deal of hype and put Ireland on the map of international soccer.</P>
    <P>The positive spirit soon turned sour last September after the FAI made a financial deal with Sky Television. Instead of the local television stations, RTE and TV3, Sky Television showed the first of Ireland's qualifying matches and no live matches were available for the devoted followers of the sport. I welcome TG4's coverage of sporting events in Ireland, especially the provincial matches which is a great boost to local societies and counties.</P>
    <P>The agreement was good for the FAI because it negotiated a lucrative deal with Sky Television that could be used as badly-needed funding to promote soccer, especially at the under-age stage. However, this is not the way forward for Irish sport and is an outrage to its devoted fans. Statistics show that 30% of Irish homes do not have satellite or cable television. Not being able to watch certain events at home encourages people, including teenagers, to go to pubs to watch them. This encourages and adds to young people's drinking problems and does nothing to help family life.</P>
    <P>It is events such as the FAI deal with Sky that proved that the current law was not being enforced efficiently, especially the provision in the principal Act which allows member states to designate certain events as events of major importance to society to ensure that a substantial proportion of the population are not deprived of the opportunity of continuing to watch designated events on free television services. This was not put into action. It should have been in recent years by the previous Government under my colleague from Clare, the former Minister, Deputy de Valera. It is an outrage this issue was not dealt with. The situation cannot be allowed to go further and we cannot let more people and sporting events become the victims of the practice I mentioned previously.</P>
    <P>We approve of the principle and support the Minister in laying out and designating events for free television. It is a principle that should have been put into law a long time ago by the previous Government. It is important that we protect the people from those who possess satellite and cable television but do not possess a love for Irish sport.</P>
    <P>The sporting organisations were consulted in the context of the principal Act of 1999. Their main concern with that Act was that it would hurt their income. Much of the funding sporting organisations receive comes from television broadcasting. The Minister has included an arbitration process to deal with such concerns and <Col N="126" /> this is important. Will he ensure the arbitration is binding because at present it is not?</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaulConnaughton" hpid="Mr. Connaughton Mr. Connaughton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connaughton</NameTxt>
      <P>The debate gives us an opportunity to examine the world of sport on television, especially the all-embracing coverage of world events whereby they can be seen on every television in every home in every part of the world. It also gives us an opportunity to ensure that the aspirations of ordinary people in Ireland, including the elderly, the poor and those outside the cable network, to see and enjoy our national sport on our television networks is taken into account and that, whatever legislation is necessary in this regard, either here or in Europe, is put into practice. I will return to this.</P>
      <P>I congratulate the Minister on what he is doing. It is a difficult matter. I am not sure that television networks such as Sky will not have their way in years to come. However, I hope the European Union will be more cohesive regarding this matter than other recent events.</P>
      <P>Most speakers on this Bill have referred to the very sharp reaction of the public to the Sky-FAI deal. I have no problem with what the FAI wants, which is what most other national sporting bodies want, extra finance to build up infrastructure. However, people in Irish society greatly resent having to pay for certain sporting events. While, I do not have the time to list all those events, I agree with those that have been listed. While I am not a golfer, I am surprised at the omission of golf from the list. I presume there is some rationale behind that decision.</P>
      <P>Given the new era in digital broadcasting services, the landscape has changed completely. Television companies can now do things that were not dreamed of ten years ago, which will cause huge problems for our service providers, RTE and TV3.</P>
      <P>The principle of this Bill is correct and I believe it will have the backing of the vast majority of the people. Nonetheless, the Minister must be careful with the question of how the arbitrator will act. Irrespective of who he or she is, the arbitrator will have a terrible job because commercial influences will be at work on one side while sporting and cultural aspirations will be at work on the other. To equate those competing influences to a level where everybody will be relatively happy will create a lot of trouble from a commercial perspective. I commend the Bill to the House but would like to think that when it returns to the House on Committee Stage, the Minister will deal with my concerns regarding the arbitrator.</P>

Before I continue, I should declare that I have no interests in any broadcasting service, whatever interests I may have had in the past.

      <P>Anybody listening to this debate will be familiar with, and most speakers have mentioned, the value of sport and its place in Irish society. It is of crucial importance and an integral part of the fabric of Irish life throughout the country, in urban and rural areas. However, speaking as a sportsman, I must issue a note of caution. It is ironic that we are talking about the role of the media in a certain aspect of sport because there was a very interesting article in today's edition of <i>The Irish Times</i> by Tom Humphries, a journalist for whom I have huge respect. He stated:</P>
      <P>Sport in schools is dying. A minority of good players get all the games and all the pressure, whether it's Leinster Schools Senior Cup rugby or Harty Cup hurling. The coverage given to these exploits could fool a body into thinking that sport in general is in a healthy state at schools' level. It's not.</P>
      <P>That is a warning to us all. Sport in Ireland is not about what we see on Sky Sports or at the weekend with professional players indulging in what to me is a brand of show business. Sport is about participation at grass roots, parish, club and, particularly, underage level, and we should not lose sight of that.</P>
      <P>That brings me to the crux of this Bill, something we should address carefully, namely, if worthwhile sport is to develop in this country, as it should, a balance must be struck between the revenue earning potential of media rights and the need for the sporting bodies which control the games to market those games and exploit the media opportunities presented. I have a particular reservation about section 2 of the Bill which confers on the Minister a retrospective right to review arrangements.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan" hpid="Mr. Durkan Mr. Durkan">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimGlennonFF" hpid="Mr. Glennon Mr. Glennon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Glennon</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no doubt this is being carefully considered at present, as should be the case before Committee Stage. Any sports body negotiating television rights with this clause hanging over it negotiates with its hands tied behind its back. While the principal purpose of the Bill is well known in that it is aimed at a <Col N="128" /> particular contract, nevertheless, we should be very careful that we do not throw out the baby with the bath water. It is important that the revenue generating potential of sport at the highest level in this country, which we saw examples of last weekend, is not spoiled for the major organisations.</P>
      <P>Sport is extremely important and vital to the health of the nation. However, while we like to see ourselves as a hugely sports oriented nation, sport is hugely underdeveloped in many sectors &ndash; I am thinking particularly of women's sport and of some of the less well-off areas of our cities. It is vital that our major sporting organisations, particularly the GAA, which have done such huge work in propagating games and healthy activity for boys and girls around the country, have every possible means made available to them for generating the revenue necessary to continue that work.</P>
      <P>I support totally the principle that the population at large is entitled to see our national events, be they games involving teams wearing the green jersey and using the brand name of Ireland &ndash; if I can be totally commercial &ndash; or with regard to all-Ireland finals. Whatever it is, people have a right to see major events.</P>
      <P>However, people should not fool themselves, in this Chamber or anywhere else, into thinking that such a right comes free. Nothing comes free in this world. A pay day is due somewhere along the line and the sporting organisations are due that pay day. We must ensure that their capacity to earn their due from the material they have developed so assiduously over the years is protected. I congratulate the Minister and I commend the Bill to the House.</P>
      <P>I would like to give one word of warning, however, in line with Deputy Kelleher's earlier comments. The Bill removes some of the major revenue generating streams from the sporting organisations and we need to be very careful about this. Another area of revenue generation which is under threat is the sponsorship of sporting events by alcohol companies. Such sponsorship will probably be outlawed sooner than we think. Although it will be a good move for Irish sport and for the Irish nation, we should ensure that we do not throw out the baby with the bath water.</P>

      <P>I welcome the Broadcasting (Major Events Television Coverage) (Amendment) Bill 2003 and I am glad the Opposition supports it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Television Without Frontiers Directive provides that EU member states may designate certain sporting and cultural events as being of major importance to society. It ensures that events can be designated to continue to be available to the public on free-to-air television services. Individual member states can decide whether or not to draw up such a list. The directive was initiated at a time when competition was being introduced to the provision of television <Col N="129" /> services in the Union. It obliges member states to provide national legislation as a statutory basis for designating such sporting events. The Broadcasting (Major Events Television Coverage) Act 1999 fulfils Ireland's obligations in this regard. When designating sporting events, the Minister must have regard to the relevant circumstances and, specifically, to the extent to which the sporting event in question has a general special resonance with the people of Ireland. The Government must have cognisance of whether the event has a generally recognised and distinct cultural importance for the people.</P>
    <P>The European Commission has three months to verify that the list of sporting events, published by the Government, is compatible with EU law. The list of events which come under this order include Ireland's home and away qualifying games in the European Championships and the World Cup; the All-Ireland senior inter-county hurling and football finals; and the Irish Grand National and the Irish Derby. I share Deputy Naughten's worries in relation to the exclusion of golfing events. The Government hopes this Bill will be signed into law before Ireland's next home football match, against Albania on 7 June, in the qualifying competition for the European championships.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources, Deputy Dermot Ahern, recently said that this legislation will ensure that sports events of major importance will not end up out of the reach of those who wish to view them. It will prevent the advent of a two-tier television system, which would deprive the public of involvement in events that are part of our national identity. Given the important role that sport plays in the life of our country, it is essential that sports events of major importance are accessible to the largest possible number of viewers, via free television. Access to such events should not be restricted to those who can afford to pay the rates demanded by subscription or pay-per-view television services. There is widespread support among the people for the political decision taken by the Government. Certain events of major importance must continue to be available on free television services on a near-universal coverage basis. We have seen clear evidence in recent times of sporting events migrating to pay-per-view television services.</P>
    <P>I commend the determination and vigour shown by the Minister, Deputy Dermot Ahern, in pursuing this legislation which has been a live political issue since last summer. All Deputies should support the position that has been taken by the Government. The public's right to watch sporting events on terrestrial television should be protected. On 17 July 2002, the Government received approval to publish a draft list of events it proposed to designate as events of major importance that should, in the public interest, continue to be available on free television services. Government officials met representatives of the FAI, the IRFU and the GAA to inform <Col N="130" /> them of the Government's decision to proceed with the process of designation. Officials also met representatives of the European Commission to advise them of the relevant steps that were being taken. More than 120 submissions were received from the general public as part of the consultation process, which also involved a public meeting held in Dublin Castle on 26 August 2002.</P>
    <P>Analysis of the policy reasons which lie behind the Government's decision should not only bear in mind young people, but also recall that there are 500,000 pensioners in Ireland. A strong case was made by organisations representing senior citizens, who argued that many such people would not be able to afford to pay the higher television subscription charges to watch major sports events. Many contributors to the public consultation process argued, in light of the level of support provided to the sporting organisations from Exchequer funds, that the State has a duty to protect the wider public interest by ensuring continued access to certain events and free-to-air television services.</P>
    <P>The all-Ireland senior inter-county football and hurling finals have, quite rightly, been designated under this legislation. The GAA is a broadly-based organisation, with over 2,500 clubs and over 300,000 participants in this country. It is clear that the FAI strongly opposes the proposed designation of certain soccer events under this legislation. This is not surprising, given that Ireland's qualifying games in the European Championships and the World Cup enjoy enormous public interest. The level of interest is such that the British Sky Broadcasting Group is willing to pay a substantial sum of money to broadcast the games I have mentioned on a live and exclusive basis on its subscription television services. The purpose of designation, however, is to prevent events of major importance to society, which have traditionally been available on free television services, from migrating to subscription or pay-per-view services on an exclusive basis.</P>
    <P>I commend this Bill to the House.</P>

      <P>Deputy Kehoe was correct to claim that Wexford will win this year's all-Ireland hurling final and I support him on that issue.</P>
      <P>I welcome the broad support for this Bill, the purpose of which is to strengthen the existing statutory provisions contained in the principal Act. It is clear, from today's debate and an earlier debate on the designation order, that there is support on all sides of the House for the principles that underpin the notion of designating major events. Deputies share the Minister's wish to protect the public interest in a proportionate and balanced manner.</P>
      <P>One of the issues raised by a number of Deputies was the arbitration mechanism provided for under section 5 of the Bill, which provides that the Minister can appoint an arbitrator if the parties are unable to agree on one. Notwithstanding the provisions of this Bill, it is envisaged that broadcasters and event organisers will, in general, negotiate terms without recourse to arbitration or the High Court. It is intended that a mechanism will be put in place to help event organisers and qualifying broadcasters to reach an agreement where negotiations have broken down. The arbitration mechanism provided for under section 5 is entirely different from the High Court route, provided for under section 4. Rights to broadcast events are often sold as a package and the arbitration mechanism will be capable of dealing with this reality by offering a view as to what should constitute reasonable market rates for a series of designated events. The High Court option can only be used to deal with a single or small number of events that are shortly to take place.</P>
      <P>It was also suggested during the debate that the findings of an arbitrator under section 5, or a High Court order under section 4, should be binding on the qualifying broadcaster. The Bill is deliberately drafted to provide the qualifying broadcaster with the right to withdraw from seeking access to an event when the price for access is about to be fixed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Broadcasters have an important role to play in a modern democracy like ours and their editorial independence must be guaranteed. That is true of national and commercial organisations. To impose an obligation on a broadcaster to include a specific item in its programming schedule at a price over which it had no control would constitute unacceptable interference. In practice, interfering in that way might mean that a qualifying broadcaster who tries to gain access to an event could be forced to buy the rights at any price. Broadcasters have limited budgets and they have to make choices about what to include in their schedules. Qualifying broadcasters must continue to have the right not to purchase broadcasting rights to designated events, otherwise they might be forced to drop other valuable programmes from their schedules to meet the costs imposed <Col N="132" /> on them. Such interference in their activities cannot be justified.</P>
    <P>If qualifying broadcasters were not given the right to withdraw from a bidding process, they might decide not to seek access to designated events in the first instance. They might decide that to do so would expose them to the risk of having to pay too high a price to secure broadcasting rights. As a result, designated events would not be carried on free-to-air television services which would frustrate the purpose of establishing the designation process. The arbitration finding should not, therefore, be binding on the broadcaster. For the reasons outlined, I cannot envisage any circumstances in which we would force a broadcaster to buy rights at a price it was not prepared to pay, although I am sure this issue will be debated in detail on Committee Stage. This Bill is not modelled on legislation in place in any other EU member state. Indeed, only four other member states have established lists, although others are working on criteria for designated events.</P>
    <P>Deputies have asked how reasonable market rates will be determined. Section 6 provides guidance to the High Court or an arbitrator to help them establish what should be considered in this regard while allowing them the flexibility they need to come to a conclusion. Under section 4(10), the High Court has power to adjust a contract concerning the rights to a designated event between the event organiser and a non-qualifying broadcaster although it does not seek to define the manner in which the adjustment should be made. It is a matter for the court to make any such determination.</P>
    <P>There was considerable comment during the debate on the designation process itself. Many references were made to the make-up of the list, but debate has ended for the present as the designation order has been signed. We must now put in place the legislative support to ensure that effect is given to the designation decision. This Bill serves that purpose and I look forward to the continuation of debate on Committee Stage. I thank all Deputies for their contributions. Committee Stage will be taken next week at which point we will have the opportunity to discuss the legislation in further detail. I welcome the support that has been forthcoming from all sides of the House as the Minister is anxious to ensure that the Bill is passed as quickly as possible. I thank the officials from the Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources for staying with us for the night. They have been very helpful.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Finneran</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Ceann Comhairle for permitting me to raise this matter. I bring it to the attention of the House as a result of representations made to me by retired coal miners, particularly those who used to work in Arigna, County Roscommon. They are part of a small group of retired coal miners most of whom are between the ages of 50 and 60. While many are from Arigna, others come from the Leas-Ceann Comhairle's Kilkenny constituency as well as from Tipperary.</P>
      <P>Suffering from chronic emphysema and bronchitis does not entitle one to disability benefit, which is an injustice to the miners on whose behalf I raise this matter. This is an injustice to the people involved. Disability benefit is paid where an insured person suffers loss of physical or mental faculty as a result of an accident at work or through contracting a prescribed occupational disease. The level of payment awarded depends on the degree of loss of a faculty which is medically assessed and the prescribed occupational diseases are specifically listed in social welfare legislation. Any disease not listed does not come under the scope of the scheme. The reason I have tabled this matter is that these debilitating diseases are not included. A small number of people, particularly in the Arigna coal mines area, are excluded and are being discriminated against on the basis that these conditions are not on the prescribed list in the Department of Social and Family Affairs.</P>
      <P>Constituents of mine applied for disability benefit over a period in respect of these conditions. While they have been treated with the courtesy that is usually available from the Department of Social and Family Affairs, the end result is that, irrespective of medical evidence or appeals, departmental officials have informed them that because these are not on the prescribed list, they cannot be accommodated. A change is needed in the legislation regarding this matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I understand that similar conditions are on the prescribed list in the UK and that people who suffer from these conditions, chronic emphysema and bronchitis, are entitled to the equivalent of disability benefit in that jurisdiction. I do not see why people here should be discriminated against. The number of people involved is small and limited to only a few locations. In my constituency, particularly in Roscommon, there are fewer than 20 people in this category. I do not have information in respect of other counties, for example, <Col N="134" /> Kilkenny, Tipperary or other places where there are coal mining industries, but I am sure the numbers are not great. Many of the other conditions that coal miners suffer from are accommodated under the prescribed list.</P>
    <P>I am informed, as a result of my representations, that a committee is evaluating the position of these illnesses and that this committee has not yet reported to the Minister. While little has been said or written about it over the years, it is opportune that this matter should become a matter of public debate now that a departmental committee is investigating it. The Minister should be made aware of the great concern in my constituency, in particular in the area of Arigna in County Roscommon, in the other locations I mentioned and in some other small pockets, that these conditions of chronic emphysema and bronchitis are included in the prescribed list. It would be only fair and just to include them. I call on the Minister, irrespective of the committee's recommendations, to take charge and make a decision in favour of including chronic emphysema and bronchitis as prescribed illnesses. I hope the response from the Minister of State will be positive.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBrowne2" hpid="Mr. Browne Mr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources (Mr. Browne)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Finneran for raising the issue. The legislation governing the occupational injuries scheme provides entitlement to benefit for persons suffering from certain prescribed diseases which are listed in the legislation and where those persons have contracted that disease in the course of their employment. Where a person has contracted one of the diseases listed in the legislation, benefits are payable only if he or she was employed in an occupation which is specifically prescribed in relation to that disease.</P>
      <P>Chronic emphysema and bronchitis which have been contracted in the course of coal mining are not presently included in the list of occupational injuries prescribed diseases. Accordingly, any claim to benefit under the occupational injuries scheme in respect of these diseases resulting from coal mining is not payable.</P>
      <P>When the occupational injuries scheme was introduced, a list of occupational diseases was drawn up and prescribed in legislation. Further diseases were added to the list by way of regulations in 1983 and 1985. However, until recently no changes had been made since then. In recent years concern was increasingly expressed that the list was not as comprehensive as it should be.</P>
      <P>In order to examine this complex area of the occupational injuries scheme, an internal review group was established, headed up by the Department's chief medical adviser. Its objective was to review the existing list of prescribed diseases and employments and to make recommendations or appropriate amendments, deletions and additions to it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This group made a series of recommendations for the inclusion of additional occupational dis<Col N="135" /> eases within the framework of the occupational injuries scheme. These additional occupational diseases will be included in the occupational injuries scheme by way of forthcoming regulation. The review group considered the issue of chronic emphysema and bronchitis in the case of coal miners but has not come to a conclusion on this issue pending more information.</P>
    <P>I assure the Deputy, on behalf of the Minister for Social and Family Affairs, Deputy Coughlan, who could not be here, that she has asked the review group to accord immediate priority to the question of whether these two diseases should be prescribed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Connaughton</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Chair for allowing me to raise this important issue, namely, the question of the ongoing internal dispute within the Department of Agriculture and Food concerning lack of promotional opportunities in the regional offices and other matters. I warn the Minister that failure to deal with these issues will create havoc in the farming community in the near future.</P>
      <P>I understand that offices such as the district veterinary offices in Galway, Limerick, Kerry, Mayo and other areas are not open to the public at the moment and are not taking telephone calls. I also understand that members of staff in some of the DVOs have been informed that their wages will be withheld from tomorrow and if this happens we can expect trouble.</P>
      <P>I understand that there are several residual staff-related issues that have been long-fingered and now the chickens are coming home to roost. There appears to be a daft and potentially serious row going on between field staff who provide on-the-spot farm inspection reports and administrative staff. I understand this has been simmering beneath the surface for nearly a year.</P>
      <P>I put the Minister on notice that farmers received the final balance of last year's suckler cow grant in February. This is the first week of April but they have not yet received this year's grant. According to the Minister, this happened because each farmer's file must be inspected for overpayment under all schemes. If the staff are not allowed to process the file, farmers may not get this money until late June or July. Worse, the 2002 extensification payments are due next month and any unrest or staff relations problems could jeopardise those payments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I put it to the Minister that a few months of strike might please his colleague, the Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, given the current climate of economic disaster, and it appears that the Minister for Agriculture and Food is in no hurry to have this matter resolved either. I understand that staff will not be paid from tomorrow. I have a number of questions. This is a national issue. It is a national strike. Is it true that there are no promotional opportunities in the regions? <Col N="136" /> I am told that there is no shortage of promotional opportunities in Agriculture House. Perhaps the Minister would explain the problem. Why has that ongoing row, which I mentioned, between the on-farm inspection staff and the administrative staff to whom they give their files, not been dealt with? This cropped up last autumn and several farmers were not paid for months because of it. I thought it had been solved at that stage, but apparently it has not been. It seems that there is general unrest. I would like to be brought up-to-date on the exact position concerning the unions and the Department.</P>
    <P>I want a lasting and immediate solution to ensure that the staff are allowed to process the claims of thousands of farmers. The perilous state of agriculture is causing a loss of cash flow for many farmers and many are leaving farming altogether.</P>
    <P>The closing date for receipt of applications for area aid was extended to 7 April but they are not being taken tomorrow or this week in the Galway office. I ask the Minister of State to clarify the position.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture and Food (Mr. Treacy)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Department of Agriculture and Food regrets any inconvenience caused to the public, especially the farming community, by the industrial action currently being taken by the CPSU. Members of this union in local agriculture offices voted in favour of industrial action to secure improved promotion structures. The initial action was effective from 18 March 2003 and involved CPSU members not performing duties arising from telephone calls or faxes.</P>
      <P>There are 790 CPSU members involved in the dispute. There are a further 60 executive officers, 29 higher executive officers and eight regional higher executive officers serving in the Department's local offices around the country. The CPSU advised the Department that with effect from 25 March 2003, the dispute would be regionalised, and the country was divided into four regions: region one, Waterford, Cork, Tipperary north, Tipperary south and Clare; region two, Limerick, Kerry, Galway and Mayo; region three, Longford, Sligo, Roscommon, Cavan, Donegal and Monaghan; and region four, Carlow, Dublin, Kildare, Kilkenny, Laois, Meath, Offaly, Wexford, Westmeath and Wicklow.</P>
      <P>Industrial action rotates between the regions on a weekly basis. Normal duties are being carried out by CPSU members in regions other than the one engaged in industrial action. Region one commenced industrial action on 25 March 2003. This involved a ban on telephone and fax inquiries and counter duties in the afternoon, which continued until 28 March 2003. Region two has been engaged in a similar action since 31 March 2003.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The industrial action will rotate between regions as follows: region two, from 31 March <Col N="137" /> 2003 to 4 April 2003; region three, from 7 April 2003 to 11 April 2003; and region four, from 14 April 2003 to 17 April 2003.</P>
    <P>The CPSU has advised that the action will apply to FDS offices and regional laboratories in addition to local livestock offices and district veterinary offices. The Department does not accept that any commitment was made to the union in respect of staffing in local offices and does not accept that the union has a valid basis for industrial action. While officials will meet CPSU representatives tomorrow to discuss the situation I emphasise that these negotiations are constrained by the terms of the PPF and the proposed Sustaining Progress agreement and the continuing need to control public expenditure.</P>
    <P>CPSU members will benefit from the 7% general pay awards under the Sustaining Progress agreement provided they are adjudged to have adhered to the terms. They will also receive a further 8.5% increase awarded under the benchmarking process.</P>
    <P>In view of the continuing refusal by union members to perform what are their core duties, the Department has no option but to inform some staff today that they must be removed from the payroll until they resume their normal duties within their assigned offices.</P>
    <P>Deputy Connaughton raised some points and as a former Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture he is fully aware that ministerial office holders and politicians have no involvement in personnel matters which are governed by the Civil Service. There is no restriction or prohibition on any member of staff within the Department applying for promotion within the staff system. There is no embargo and staff may apply for promotion at any time given the number of promotions available. They are not debarred from competing for other posts within other sectors of the public service. I hope there can be a meeting of minds on this issue. The closing date for area aid applications has been extended to next Monday, 7 April at 5 p.m. I hope all farmers will be able to submit applications on or before that time. We want to continue to transfer both State and European Union resources to the farmers who urgently need them.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms Burton</NameTxt>
      <P>Mary Mother of Hope national school has been established in what is probably the fastest growing area of housing not just in this country but also in Europe. It is an area of Dublin 15 on the Meath border, beside Clonee village. Some 3,500 to 4,500 houses have been built over the past five or six years and the same amount are still under construction. A community of 5,000 houses is considerably bigger than the population of many large villages and <Col N="138" /> medium sized towns. This area of Dublin 15 is designated by the Government as a high level development zone. Fingal County Council has facilitated this development by granting planning permission.</P>
      <P>The Department of Education and Science has refused to have anything to do with the building of a permanent school. There is a temporary school in use which was opened after political pressure from myself and others. On the eve of the last local elections a sign was erected by the Department, the builder and Fianna Fáil which announced that the site was acquired. Subsequently and ironically I found out by means of the Freedom of Information Act that Menolly Properties were arranging to sell the site to the Department.</P>
      <P>The school is facing an incredible crisis in the explosion of numbers, yet it is listed at level six of the Department's arrangements for the schools building programme. That means that the proposed project has proceeded to architectural planning but is effectively frozen until 2004 and after unless funding is provided.</P>
      <P>How does the Minister expect parents in the area to cope? They are paying through the nose for their nice houses but there is no school for their children. The Minister of State at the Department of Education and Science, Deputy Brian Lenihan, attended a recent meeting and had the audacity to suggest to parents that the children might be bussed to school all over Dublin. I believe that was a particular scarecrow which was being set up to be knocked down, which is a well-known tactic.</P>
      <P>The level of house building in the area is unprecedented. The practice of building prefabricated accommodation at a cost of several million euro is bad economics and bad value for money. My counterpart, the Minister for Finance, sometimes wonders where all the Government money being spent on education is going, and I suggest it is being used up on temporary accommodation.</P>
      <P>The school at present is forced to use storage heating because it is temporary accommodation. It has an enormous arrears of electricity costs of approximately &euro;5,000, but the total allocation by the Government for all the usual costs of a primary school is about &euro;6,800.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I know that the Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Dempsey, passes the school every day on his way to the Dáil. He should discuss the matter with the parents, teachers and public representatives in Dublin 15. Members from outside Dublin like to talk about the planning situation. People in Fianna Fáil often blame a lack of planning permissions. Fingal County Council has granted planning permission. A large number of houses have been built, and more houses are to be built, the equivalent of a large village or small town, yet there is no permanent school accommodation available. I plead with the Minister of State not to give me the usual excuse about level 6, planning and architectural drawings and so on. <Col N="139" /> He should say that next year he will proceed to build a permanent school and save the State money.</P>

      <P>The Minister for Education and Science and the Minister of State regret that, due to other commitments, they could not be in the House for this debate. As someone who served in the Department of Education and Science in the past, I am glad that the Deputy has given me the opportunity of outlining to the House the Department's current position regarding the allocation of funding for school building projects.</P>
      <P>The 2003 capital programme has now been published and full details on individual projects, including schools being provided with temporary accommodation, are available on the Department's website at www.education.ie. The programme is designed to give the maximum amount of information to managers, boards of management, principals, parents and students. The criteria used for selecting projects have also been published for the first time.</P>
      <P>This year's building programme amounts to &euro;342.9 million, four times the amount allocated in 1997. The 2003 programme will deliver over 140 large-scale projects at primary and post-primary level. In addition, over 400 schools will benefit in some way from the capital programme and of course all primary schools benefit directly from the devolved grants scheme for minor works.</P>
      <P>The budgetary allocation for 2004 and subsequent years will determine the rate of progress on projects at schools currently in the advanced stages of architectural planning such as the permanent building project for Mary Mother of Hope national school, Castaheany. The Department of Education and Science has provided grant-aid for the provision of additional temporary accommodation at this school and this project is currently nearing completion. The management authorities at individual schools should continue to use funds from their devolved grant to deal with urgent health and safety matters.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is ironic that there is such an explosion of houses in the area. It indicates that the Government is meeting its housing target, delivering houses quickly and that the spiralling expansion of Dublin continues. This creates major difficulties for resources in that there is a huge demographic increase throughout the country, the second highest in our history. By 2020 we will have reached a new figure. There is a demand throughout Ireland that schools be expanded, upgraded and increased in capacity due to the explosion in the population. Consequent on available resources, and commensurate with the current housing programme <Col N="140" /> which is creating a requirement for extra public service facilities, the Government will continue to prioritise resources as quickly as possible and deliver, where possible, the various projects.</P>

If we lose the salmon, which is the direction in which we are heading, in the next five to ten years, if we carry on as we are, my children will look at me in ten years' time and ask, &ldquo;What in God's name were you doing? Why did you fail? Why did you not save the salmon when you knew we were losing it?&rdquo;  We are already the international pariah for our inability to take firm and decisive action in this area. Every other country in north-western Europe has introduced a ban on driftnetting. Ireland stands alone as the only country which goes against all other trends in this area and refuses so far to introduce a ban on driftnetting.</P>
      <P>I recognise this is a complex issue. It does not require just one simple solution. It is such a complex issue that a whole range of issues, including water quality and management of our rivers, have an effect on salmon stocks. We must have a multifaceted response. There are certain steps we can take immediately, for which the Minister has responsibility. If he fails to take these steps, he will go down as the Minister who facilitated the loss of the north Atlantic salmon.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The current tagging system is not working. I have never witnessed a more confused, muddled, uncertain, inaccurate or disputed conservation system. While it is meant to provide a certain analysis, it appears that is providing no clarity whatsoever. Given that approximately 500,000 salmon are coming into our rivers, it is incredible that the Minister is proposing to take out 180,000 while the scientists are advocating a lower figure. I do not accept the argument that we can gradually reduce the figure over three or four years to reach the scientific level, nor do I accept there is a reduction on last year's figures. Last year's figures were bloated due to the election. The Minister has not yet signed the order and he will receive support in this House if he takes positive conservation measures. If he is going to operate <Col N="141" /> a tagged quota system, he should immediately reduce the figures.</P>
    <P>I do not know how the salmon commission works. There is a saying that a camel is similar to a horse designed by a committee. It appears that the recommendations of the salmon commission do not take into account the fundamental truth, which is the rapid loss in recent years of wild salmon from our rivers. That will continue if the current system is maintained. There might be a possibility of introducing clarity by way of a non-transferrable tagged quota. This would mean that we would at least know where the fish are being caught, which is not clear at present. I will be interested to hear the Minister's opinion in that regard.</P>
    <P>I would be interested in getting the report to which the Minister referred on previous occasions. It refers to a moratorium or buy-out over a period of the driftnet system. If we do not do something in this regard, all the other systems will continue with this muddled process. A buy-out would give us a simple clear break to try to increase the salmon numbers. Other measures could come into play in terms of keeping our water clean and better management of our rivers. It will not be easy but the Minister cannot wait. We cannot continue for three or four years with a failed tagging system. He must have the political courage to publish the report, which I am sure has been sitting on his desk for some time. He should discuss the issue with the Opposition and with those in the industry. He must make a political decision for which he will have support in this House and throughout the world.</P>
    <P>Ireland is increasingly seen as a country which has lost its environmental assets and does not care about protecting its green image. There is no clearer indication of that than in the way we have disregarded our important asset. The Minister must do something dramatic and quickly to save the species.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBrowne2" hpid="Mr. Browne Mr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Eamon Ryan for raising the issue. The overriding objective of the Government is to conserve the salmon resource in its own right and for the coastal and rural communities that it helps to support. The National Salmon Commission advises the Minister in relation to the conservation, management, protection and development of the national salmon and sea trout resource.</P>
      <P>When I took up office in June last year, I asked the National Salmon Commission to review the effectiveness of the wild salmon and sea trout tagging scheme which was introduced by my Department in 2001 and limited the total allowable commercial catch of salmon for the first time in 2002. The standing scientific committee of the National Salmon Commission provides scientific advice on the rational management of salmon in Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="142" />The model for management of salmon stocks is based on achieving spawning escapement targets for each stock and maintaining stocks above conservation limits. In 1998 the North Atlantic Salmon Conservation Organisation adopted the precautionary approach to fisheries management. Central to this was the argument that management measures should be aimed at maintaining all salmon stocks above pre-agreed conservation limits which is the spawning stock level that produces maximum sustainable yield.</P>
    <P>Fundamental to the provision of precautionary catch advice is the determination by the standing scientific committee of salmon conservation limits for each fishery district. To date, the calculation of salmon stock conservation limits for the fisheries districts has been based on historical catch data over a 30 year period. New data from ICES was incorporated into the model to establish stock and recruitment relationships at the end of 2002 to provide new salmon conservation limit for each district for 2003. The scientific committee presented this precautionary catch advice to the National Salmon Commission and to the National Fisheries Management Executive.</P>
    <P>The NFME considered this advice and concluded, <i>inter alia,</i> that the scientific advice given should be accepted and that reductions in catch were required to meet conservation limits; it was not desirable to close the commercial fishery in any district, to try to achieve the conservation limit in one year but that a progressive reduction should take place in the commercial catch over a number of years; districts requiring the greatest reductions in current catch to meet these limits should be targeted with the greatest cuts; and as the current catch model is largely based on the mixed stock drift net fishery, some reduction should occur in catch level in all districts.</P>
    <P>Arising out of these deliberations, the National Salmon Commission has recommended a total allowable catch of 182,000 fish for 2003. This represents a 17% cut on the total allowable catch for 2002 and a drop of 12% on the actual commercial catch in 2002. In tendering this advice, the commission recommended that a three year strategy should be put in place to ensure, through further progressive reductions, that the conservation limits specified by its standing scientific committee should be reached by 2005. The draft regulations which I have published for the 2003 season are in keeping with this approach.</P>
    <P>The sub-committee set up to review the control of fishing for salmon order is examining the changes needed to deliver significant rationalisation of categories and the numbers of commercial licences. Subject to the emerging advice, changes will be put in place for 2004. It is intended that the question of allocating non-transferable quotas to individual licences will be considered when the outcome of this review is known. My predecessor firmly ruled out buy-out <Col N="143" /> as an effective means of achieving the shared objective of restoration of salmon stocks and instead promoted the policy of quotas to achieve catch reductions as the best instrument available to achieve this objective.</P>
    <P>The issues inherent in a complete voluntary buy-out of the Irish commercial salmon sector are very complex. The international experience is also mixed. We need to caution against excessive raising of expectation about large amounts of compensation. It is not the case that all active commercial salmon fishermen are willing to be bought out. Simplistic solutions will not work.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="144" />The Central Fisheries Board is currently examining a number of options, including possible models for a buy-out/set-aside scheme, aimed at reducing the level of commercial exploitation of the salmon resource. The board will be informed in this regard by an independent report it has commissioned, and expects to be finalised shortly, on the socio-economic value of the salmon resource. As soon as it is published it will be made available to the Opposition and whoever requires a copy. Pending the outcome of these reports, I remain to be convinced about buy-outs as a cost efficient workable instrument.</P>
    <P>The Dáil adjourned at 10.35 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Wednesday, 2 April 2003.</P>

      <P>I refer to the replies to Question No. 408 on 14 March 2003 and Question No. 579 on 25 March 2003.</P>
      <P>Making arrangements for the provision of water services in Africa or any country is primarily a matter for the Government of the country involved. The initiative &ldquo;Water for Life&rdquo; is being developed by the European Union in partnership with Africa and other participating countries with a view to meeting the goal established at the World Summit on Sustainable Development of halving by 2015 the proportion of the world population without access to safe drinking water and sanitation. The initiative is intended to mobilise the necessary technical and financial resources, public and private, to provide water services in areas where such services are required and which are unlikely to be provided without the support of the international community. The initiative will be demand-led by the partner developing countries.</P>
      <P>The ministerial declaration adopted at the recent World Water Forum endorses the need to explore the full range of financing arrangements, including private sector participation, and to mobilise all sources of financing, both public and private, national and international, to meet these goals; create an environment conducive to facilitating such investment; raise funds by adopting cost-recovery approaches which suit local climatic, social and environmental conditions with due consideration for the poor; and identify and develop new mechanisms of public private partnerships while ensuring the necessary public control and legal frameworks to protect the public interest with a particular emphasis on protecting the interests of the poor.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="146" />The World Water Forum did not involve negotiations on the General Agreement on Trade in Services, GATS. The EU has the objective, in the context of World Trade Organisation negotiations, of seeking improved market access for its service sector suppliers. This objective does not affect its parallel objectives to support developing countries under its water initiative.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment and Local Government (Mr. Cullen)</NameTxt>
      <P>The report prepared for the EPA, giving an estimated inventory of releases of dioxins and furans to the Irish environment in 2000, and projections for 2010, is a very useful contribution to our information base on dioxins in the environment, especially as it identifies the relative significance of various emission sources for dioxins.</P>
      <P>Overall, the report indicates that Ireland generates relatively low amounts of dioxin &ndash; an estimated 93 grams in 2000 &ndash; and in this regard it supports the findings of earlier EPA surveys of dioxin levels in Irish cows milk, which showed an overall 16% reduction in the period 1995 to 2000, to levels that are uniformly low by international standards.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the context of ongoing criticism of proposals for the development of thermal treatment facilities, as part of an integrated waste management infrastructure, it is noteworthy that our existing nine hazardous waste incinerators were estimated <Col N="147" /> to have contributed a fraction of 1% of national dioxin emissions to air in 2001. Even taking into account a projected incineration of 1 million tonnes per annum of municipal waste by 2010, the report estimates that waste incineration would contribute less than 2% of national dioxin emissions to air.</P>
    <P>By contrast, it is evident from the report that the biggest source of emissions to both air and land is, and is expected to remain, uncontrolled combustion processes &ndash; in particular the home burning of domestic waste, house and vehicle fires, and Hallowe'en bonfires.</P>
    <P>Overall, the report anticipates that annual dioxin emissions to air from all sources will fall by more than 10% by 2010.</P>
    <P>I intend to study the findings of this report carefully, and to bring forward appropriate measures both to support an improved information database on dioxins in the Irish environment and to pursue a progressive reduction in emissions, where those are achievable in practice.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment and Local Government (Mr. Cullen)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government published the National Spatial Strategy, NSS, on 28 November 2002 as a 20 year planning framework designed to enable every part of the country to achieve its potential.</P>
      <P>The strategy aims to build up the strengths of all areas to achieve more balanced regional development and population growth. It recognises that a greater share of economic activity must take place outside the greater Dublin area. To achieve this, the strategy sets out a framework within which gateways, hubs and other urban and rural areas will act together to allow areas to grow.</P>
      <P>Regional and local authorities are key players in taking forward the NSS, starting with the preparation and adoption by regional authorities of regional planning guidelines under the Planning and Development Act 2000. Immediately following the publication of the NSS I attended a number of events at regional level to brief a wide cross-section of interested parties on the NSS and start the process of rolling it out to the regions.</P>
      <P>In February 2003, guidance notes for regional authorities on preparing regional planning guidelines have been issued by my Department to all regional authorities. Regional authorities, working in partnership with local authorities, have now commenced this work with the aim of ensuring that the guidelines are in place in all regions by early 2004.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="148" />Structures and mechanisms to integrate the NSS into planning and activities at Government, departmental, State agency, regional and local level are also being put in place to ensure that the strategy directs the spatial aspects of public sector planning, policies and programmes, including the determination of investment priorities. Already, the NSS has shaped the strategic rail review and the development of the Forfás regional investment strategy. The NSS will also influence the mid term review of the national development plan to be completed this year. An interdepartmental steering group, similar to that which oversaw preparation of the strategy, will now oversee its implementation.</P>
    <P>The successful development of gateways and hubs will require the putting in place of integrated spatial frameworks for land use, planning, urban design, transport and public service delivery. The relevant local authorities have primary responsibility for driving the preparation of these frameworks, in consultation with relevant public agencies, including those responsible for the provision of transport and other infrastructure, and translating them into statutory development plans to guide the development process. Work on the preparation of such frameworks is well advanced in some gateways, and other gateways and hubs are being advised to advance their plans as quickly as possible.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment and Local Government (Mr. Cullen)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 90 and 106 together.</P>
      <P>My Department operates a number of measures providing assistance towards the cost of conservation works for protected structures and towards renewing and repairing thatched roofs to houses.</P>
      <P>The conservation grant scheme for protected structures was introduced in 1999.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The standard grant is 50% of the approved cost of works subject to a maximum of &euro;13,000. A local authority may, at its discretion, vary this amount downwards, or, in exceptional circumstances, upwards, subject to a maximum allowable grant of 75% of the cost of the approved cost of works or &euro;25,000, whichever is the lesser. Accordingly, the scheme is not intended to meet the full cost, but is designed to assist owners or <Col N="149" /> occupiers of protected structures to undertake necessary works to secure their conservation.</P>
    <P>Local authorities administer this scheme and each local authority is allocated a fixed amount of funding for grant purposes in each calendar year. Local authorities are required to prioritise applications on the basis of a scheme of priorities drawn up by them.</P>
    <P>In 2003, an amount of &euro;2.888 million is being made available to local authorities under the scheme. This allocation was the maximum that could be made available having regard to the wider budgetary situation.</P>
    <P>My Department will continue to monitor the operation of the scheme closely.</P>
    <P>In addition to the protected structures scheme, funding of &euro;1 million will also be available in 2003 under the urban and village renewal measure of the regional operational programmes. Applications for funding under this scheme were invited from local authorities, civic trust and other not-for-profit bodies to upgrade buildings of significant architectural and heritage merit and which are in public ownership or open to the public generally. I will allocate this funding to specific projects following the evaluation of the grant applications currently before my Department.</P>
    <P>My Department also operates a scheme of grants to assist in the renewal and repair of traditional thatched roofs and has in recent years introduced significant improvements to the grant levels under the scheme. The basic maximum grant was increased in 1999 to &euro;3,810 and to &euro;5,720 for houses on specified offshore islands, with additional measures to assist lower income households. In 2002, a total of 190 grants were paid amounting to &euro;810,222. In 2003 an amount of &euro;734,000 has been provided. As with the conservation grant scheme, the allocation for 2003 was the maximum available having regard to the wider budgetary situation.</P>
    <P>The Heritage Council will also provide &euro;1.27 million in grant aid this year for architectural conservation projects.</P>
    <P>In all, therefore, some &euro;6 million will be made available this year from public funds towards the protection of listed buildings and housing with thatched roofs.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment and Local Government (Mr. Cullen)</NameTxt>
      <P>The complex technical and specialised nature of issues that may arise in relation to applications for integrated pollution control licences makes it appropriate that decisions on such applications be taken by a highly expert, independent body. The legislation has mandated the establishment of such a body in the Environmental Protection Agency which has developed considerable experience in IPC licensing over the past eight years.</P>
      <P>The provisions of the Environmental Protection Agency Act 1992 regarding notification of licence applications and proposed decisions, which I propose to enhance in some respects in the Protection of the Environment Bill 2003, ensure that the agency considers any relevant view that is put to it in respect of an application or a proposed determination.</P>
      <P>I do not propose to alter the fundamental structure of the IPC licensing system which has worked effectively for environmental protection since its inception. Environmental regulation, in common with all regulatory systems, should operate as efficiently and economically as requirements permit. It would not be consistent with this approach to extend responsibility for IPC licensing to a second expert body.</P>

      <P>Certain fixed interest rate loans issued by local authorities prior to 1988 carry rates in excess of current levels. These fixed interest rates reflect the cost of the long-term funds involved.</P>
      <P>Since 1980, borrowers with local authority fixed rate mortgages are free to redeem such loans without any interest rate penalty and refinance them in the private sector. This may be regarded as a significant concession, having regard to the redemption penalties of up to six months interest or more, applied by commercial lending agencies in the event of early redemption of such mortgages.</P>
      <P>The position regarding high fixed interest rates on local authority loans was reviewed in November 2001, in consultation with the Department of Finance. This review determined that a State subsidy to reduce interest rates would not be appropriate.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 95, 118, 312 and 313 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="152" />On the basis of emissions data contained in the European Environment Agency report, Greenhouse Gas Emissions Trends in Europe, 1990-2000, Ireland's emissions of CO2 and total greenhouse gases were second lowest of the EU member states for 2000. However, on a <i>per capita</i> basis, Ireland's emissions of CO2 were fourth highest within the EU in 2000, 11.5 tonnes compared to the EU average of 8.8 tonnes; Belgium and Luxembourg being highest at 12.4 tonnes. There is a greater disparity between Ireland's emissions of total greenhouse gases on a <i>per capita</i> basis and the EU average. These emissions were 17.4 tonnes CO2 equivalent in Ireland, the highest in the EU, compared to the EU average of 10.8 tonnes in 2000, due mainly to the greater proportion of Irish emissions attributable to the agriculture sector.</P>
    <P>The Government's national climate change strategy, published in November 2000, sets out a ten year framework for achieving the necessary greenhouse gas emissions reductions to ensure that Ireland complies with the Kyoto Protocol.</P>
    <P>A progress report on the implementation of the strategy was published in May 2002. While this shows that measures in place or in progress are capable of achieving approximately 20% of the reductions required to meet our Kyoto Protocol obligations, I am satisfied the implementation of the strategy must be intensified and additional measures to achieve reductions in emissions put in place. I have initiated a review to this end and expect it to be finalised by mid-year.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that the full implementation of the national climate change strategy over the remainder of the decade, together with any additional measures to be identified in the review, will ensure that our greenhouse gas emissions are reduced and our Kyoto obligations are fully met by the 2008-12 period.</P>
    <P>The national climate change strategy and the progress report on its implementation are available in the Oireachtas Library.</P>

      <P>The following tabular statement sets out the information requested.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have allocated &euro;439.75 million to local authorities for non-national roads in 2003. This is double the 1997 provision and an increase of almost 2% on the 2002 State grant payment of &euro;431.7 million &ndash; the highest ever State grant provision for non-national roads. I am satisfied that this significant funding, supplemented by local auth<Col N="153" /> orities' own resources, will provide adequately for the special and ongoing needs of all local authorities in 2003 and will continue the excellent progress made since 1997 in improving the network. The restoration programme provision to county <Col N="154" /> councils in 2003 will enable all county councils to carry out all of the 2003 schemes in their multi-annual restoration programmes for 2002-2005 and enable all county councils to also carry out one or more of their 2004 schemes.</P>

      <P>According to the 2002 local authority assessment of housing needs, a total of 2,468 homeless households were assessed as being in need of, and suitable for, local authority housing. The breakdown of these figures by local authority area was published in my Department's Quarterly Housing Statistics Bulletin in September 2002.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A further separate assessment of the total number of homeless people, whether seeking local authority housing or not, was also carried out by local authorities in co-operation with the voluntary housing organisations as part of the assess<Col N="155" /> ment of housing need and is currently being finalised. As well as the 2,468 households who are seeking local authority housing and for whom local authority housing is appropriate, this assessment includes people who are living in long-term supported accommodation for homeless people and are not seeking alternative accommodation.</P>
    <P>Discrepancies were found between the outcome of the assessment carried out by Dublin City Council and a separate count carried out in relation to Dublin city by the ESRI for the Homeless Agency. In order to clarify the issue, it was decided that the council and the Homeless Agency would undertake a joint assessment of homelessness in the city in January 2003. The outcome of this assessment is currently being finalised by the city council, and, following its receipt, I hope to be in a position to include further data on homelessness figures in the Annual Housing Bulletin 2002 which is due to be published shortly.</P>

      <P>At present, a sanitary authority may acquire any private water scheme, whether by agreement or by compulsory purchase, in accordance with the provisions of sections 202 and 203 of the Public Health (Ireland) Act 1878, and section 6 of the Local Government (Sanitary Services) Act 1962. The Water Services Bill now in preparation will consolidate and update these provisions, and will include powers to take over the operation and management of a scheme on a temporary basis, while problems with the operation of the scheme are resolved. This alternative approach reflects the developmental role envisaged for sanitary authorities under the proposed Bill, in addition to their supervisory functions.</P>
      <P>Drafting of the Bill is at an advanced stage, and it is anticipated that it will be published later this year.</P>

Detailed information on the results of the 2002 assessment was published in my Department's September quarterly edition of the Housing Statistics Bulletin, copies of which are available in the Oireachtas Library. Local authorities completed or acquired 5,077 units in 2002. Details by individual local authority basis will be included in my Department's Annual Housing Statistics Bulletin for 2002 which will be published shortly. My Department has received schedules of each local authority's construction and acquisition programme and these are currently being examined. Current indications are that the number of completions or acquisitions in 2003 will be of the same order as that in 2002.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 101 and 137 together.</P>
      <P>The design and implementation of fiscal policy is a matter for the Minister for Finance. Under the Government's national climate change strategy, Sustainable Energy Ireland is tasked with the preparation and dissemination of best practice guidelines, and individual energy performance indications for relevant industrial processes and the commercial and services sector. Based on this work, the Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment has responsibility for putting in place agreements to achieve agreed global energy benchmarks in all sectors.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister for Finance announced in budget 2003 that the Government had asked the relevant Departments to advance the plans for a general carbon energy tax, with a view to introducing this from the end of 2004. Given the many impli<Col N="157" /> cations of such a tax, both environmental and economic, he indicated that there would be full consultations with interested parties on the design of the tax and a reasonable period is being allowed for its effective introduction. The proposed consultation process, to be led by the Department of Finance, will allow for all relevant issues, including those raised in the question, to be discussed and assessed.</P>

I understand from the Central Statistics Office that the number of units in the private rented sector, as measured in the 2002 Census, will be available in March 2004.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment and Local Government (Mr. Cullen)</NameTxt>
      <P>Overall Government policy on rural housing is set out in the national spatial strategy. The strategy acknowledges and supports the need for sustainable rural settlement to underpin the vibrancy of rural areas. Having regard to this requirement, the strategy sets out a rural housing settlement framework which has four objectives: to sustain and renew established rural communities in a way that responds to the various spatial, structural and economic changes taking place, while protecting the important assets rural areas possess; to strengthen the established structure of villages and smaller settlements both to support local economies and to accommodate additional population in a way that supports the viability of public transport and local infrastructure and services such as schools and water services; to ensure that key assets in rural areas are protected to support quality of life and economic vitality; and to ensure that rural settle<Col N="158" /> ment policies take account of and are appropriate to the differing local circumstances in different areas.</P>
      <P>In seeking to meet these objectives, the NSS draws a distinction between rural generated housing, that is, housing needed within the established rural community by persons working in rural areas or in nearby urban areas, and urban generated housing, that is, housing in rural locations sought by people living and working in urban areas, including second homes. The strategy states that, subject to good planning practice on issues such as site location and design, rural generated housing needs should be accommodated where they arise. In relation to urban generated housing the NSS states that development driven by cities and towns should generally take place in the built up areas involved or by way of carefully planned extension to the built up area. However, for those seeking a rural lifestyle while working in a larger city or town, the strategy points out that smaller towns and villages can cater for this type of housing demand in a sustainable manner.</P>
      <P>The strategy indicates that these broad policies need to be further developed to respond to the different circumstances in different types of rural areas, that is, rural areas close to larger urban areas, rural areas with a strong agricultural base, structurally weak rural areas which have suffered population loss and economic decline and certain areas where distinctive settlement patterns have evolved. The broad principles for rural settlement policy set out in the NSS will be developed in more detail in the context of regional planning guidelines and the development plan process. I also intend that my Department will issue more detailed guidelines later this year on rural housing location.</P>

      <Quest>if his attention has been drawn to the threat to the protection of Ireland's wetlands by the reclamation of estuarine marsh land or callows for agricultural or other purposes, in view of the fact that such reclamation is exempted development under Class 11(f) of the Planning Regulations S.I.

      <P>The European Communities (Natural Habitats) Regulations 1997 and the Wildlife (Amendment) Act 2000 provide for wetlands of national and international importance to be designated as special areas of conservation, SACs, special protection areas, SPAs, or natural heritage areas, NHAs. A high proportion of all wetlands in Ireland are statutorily protected, having been designated or formally proposed for designation under the provisions outlined.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Although the reclamation described in the question is exempted development under the <Col N="159" /> planning regulations, any such development or activity in these areas which may potentially be damaging must have either the consent of the Minister for the Environment and Local Government, if it is within an area designated for conservation, or, if foreshore is involved, a licence from the Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources before work can commence.</P>

      <P>The affordable housing initiative forms part of the housing and <Col N="160" /> accommodation special initiative under the new national partnership agreement, Sustaining Progress. Following ratification of the agreement, a steering group will now be established under the new agreement representing Government and relevant social partner pillars, which will have overall responsibility for the management and implementation of the agreement, and which will decide how action will be taken forward in respect of all special initiatives, including the housing and accommodation initiative. While the details of the new initiative have yet to be worked out, it is aimed at further enhancing the supply of affordable housing. The parties to the pay agreement proposed the new initiative with the objective of increasing the supply of affordable housing by 10,000 units.</P>
      <P>It is envisaged that this initiative will differ from the 1999 affordable housing scheme in terms of the target group and the fact that it will be designed not to have an impact on the Exchequer or general Government finances. Furthermore, it is intended that the initiative will not detract from the funding available for existing social and affordable housing programmes, or affect the momentum of delivery of these programmes. I welcome this initiative as another means of bringing more affordable housing on stream. In responding to the proposal, the Government is committed to an ambitious scale of delivery of affordable housing for the target groups concerned. We will work to ensure that the output from all affordable housing schemes is maximised. It will be important more generally to ensure the continuation of measures to maintain the overall supply of new houses.</P>

      <P>The funding available to local authorities from local sources and from grants from my Department has increased greatly in recent years and this has enabled local government to improve the range and quality of its services to customers. Revenue spending by local authorities reached some &euro;3.1 billion in 2002, an increase of 16% on the corresponding figure for 2001 and an increase of 68% on the outturn for 1997.</P>
      <P>As I have previously indicated, while the present system of financing for local authorities has proved reasonably effective, it is appropriate to re-examine local government funding in view of changing demands on the local authority sector and also the developments in the economy since 1998. I intend therefore to have a wide ranging independent and thorough study of local government funding carried out. While the formal terms of reference for the study have yet to be finalised, I anticipate they will include the following issues: projections of likely expenditure and income requirements of local authorities in the medium term; review of the existing system of funding of local authorities and its potential to meet likely expenditure and income requirements; evaluation of the efficiency of the structure, organisation and service delivery of the current local government system; options for revised arrangements for funding local government including implementation strategies. The consultants to carry out the study will be appointed following an open competitive process and I anticipate that the consultants should then complete the study within 12 months.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment and Local Government (Mr. Cullen)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Waste Management (Packaging) Regulations 2003 which came into effect on 1 March 2003 are intended to facilitate the achievement by Ireland of the 50% packaging waste recovery target by end 2005 contained in EU Directive 94/62/EC on packaging and packaging waste. It is envisaged that these regulations will also support the progress made by Repak, the compliance scheme set up by industry to ensure the recovery of packaging waste, by ensuring that all members of the busi<Col N="162" /> ness community, large or small, play their part in meeting Irelands packaging recovery targets.</P>
      <P>A requirement is placed on all producers, manufacturers, importers, distributors, wholesalers and retailers &ndash; both Repak and non-Repak members for example, placing packaging on the market to segregate the packaging waste arising on their own premises &ndash; back-door packaging waste &ndash; into specified waste streams such as waste aluminium, fibreboard, glass, paper, plastic sheeting, steel and wood and have it collected by authorised recovery operators for recycling. The regulations further provide that such waste may not be landfilled. An exemption is provided for &ldquo;contaminated&rdquo; waste.</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Major producers&rdquo; who are subject to the main requirements of the regulations were defined in the 1997 regulations as those businesses which place 25 tonnes or more of packaging on the market each year and which have a turnover of &euro;1.27 million or more. The new regulations reduce the turnover threshold to &euro;1 million, which will broaden the base of major producers. It is made clear that packaging sold and consumed on a producer's premises comes within the scope of the regulations, e.g. bottles sold and consumed in pubs, clubs and hotels. This again will broaden the scope of the regulations.</P>
      <P>The requirement on self-complying major producers, non-Repak members, to provide segregated take-back facilities for the deposit of packaging waste by customers may be fulfilled either individually or in co-operation with other self-compliers &ndash; subject to a maximum of ten major producers participating in any one group scheme, and the facilities being not more than 250 metres from any participating premises. This recognises the practical realities and space limitations faced by major producers in, for example, shopping centres, industrial estates and high streets in individually providing segregated take-back facilities.</P>
      <P>For the purpose of enhanced visibility and awareness of the take-back requirements, specified signs indicating (a) the obligation of self-complying major producers to take back packaging waste from customers, or (b) the exemption of Repak members from these requirements, must now be of a specified minimum size and displayed at each entrance to a major producer's premises. The annual registration fees which self-compliers pay to local authorities are being increased from £5 per tonne of packaging placed on the market to &euro;15 per tonne, subject to a minimum registration fee of &euro;500 and a maximum fee of &euro;5,000, up from the previous range of between &euro;254 and &euro;1,270. These increased registration fees should assist towards meeting local authority enforcement costs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Self-complying major producers must now submit quarterly returns to local authorities, instead of monthly returns. This will reduce the administrative burden on self-compliers in submitting returns and on local authorities in monitoring returns. Article 13 now requires self-compliers to submit a new plan every three years on the steps <Col N="163" /> which they propose to take to prevent and minimise packaging waste.</P>
    <P>The enforcement of the obligations set out in the regulations is a matter for local authorities. In this regard, IBEC, in co-operation with my Department, is currently holding a series of regional seminars for businesses and local authorities to raise awareness of the new requirements under these regulations. In addition, my Department co-ordinates a network of enforcement officers from a number of major local authorities to facilitate improved enforcement of the packaging regulations. It is my intention to widen this network to include all local authorities in 2003.</P>

      <P>The Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland recently published the results of a pilot study of drinking water supplies in 166 houses in County Wicklow which identified four supplies, representing 2.4% of the total, with radon concentrations above the European Commission recommended action level. According to the RPII, assuming that the survey was representative of other private ground water supplies in Wicklow then between 35 and 100 households may have drinking water supplies above the EC recommended reference level. If it is further assumed that the results from Wicklow can be extrapolated nationally, then between 3,000 and 4,000 drinking water supplies may exceed the EC recommended reference level. However, this is likely to be a pessimistic estimate as the geology of Wicklow, unlike many other counties, favours the production of radon.</P>
      <P>Because it is a gas, radon is easily removed from water by boiling. Thus there should be no concerns about drinking tea or coffee. Use of water for cooking is also perfectly safe. Under my Department's rural water programme, grants are available through the county councils for the upgrading and improvement, including any necessary radon remediation measures, of a quality deficient private group water scheme supply or the improvement of a private individual supply in cases where an alternative public or group scheme supply is not readily available.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment and Local Government (Mr. Cullen)</NameTxt>
      <P>Such an estimate for the period to 2012 has not been compiled by my Department. Expenditure on the management of Natura 2000 sites is incurred by a number of Departments. In addition, my Department's expenditure on such sites is not separately indicated in all cases under current accounting arrangements; nor has the capital cost of sites acquired by my Department been depreciated over the period mentioned in the question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Protection of Natura 2000 sites is provided principally through regulation of use and assessment of proposed developments by the appropriate authorities, and the costs relevant to this regulation relate mainly to staffing. In many cases, conservation of Natura 2000 sites in private ownership is achieved by a continuation of existing practices which does not involve increased costs to land owners. Where restrictions are imposed by my Department which result in actual losses to a land owner, compensation is payable. The estimate for compensation payments of this kind in 2003 is &euro;2 million in capital expenditure and &euro;5 million in current expenditure. Similar figures are anticipated for future years. As an alter<Col N="165" /> native to these payments, compensation for environmentally friendly farming is available in appropriate cases from the Department of Agriculture and Food through the REP scheme.</P>
    <P>My Department has provided a sum of &euro;300,000 in 2003 for development of conservation management plans for Natura 2000 sites. Some 118 regional management staff and 26 scientific staff in Dublin together with administrative staff are employed primarily on conservation of Natura 2000 sites, although they also have other conservation duties. My Department's financial management systems do not currently allow separate identification of the annual cost of the time devoted to Natura 2000 sites.</P>
    <P>A recent study at EU level, under the auspices of the habitats committee, produced a tentative estimate in the range of &euro;34 billion to &euro;57 billion as the cost of managing Natura 2000 sites, measuring a total of 60.5 million hectares in existing member states, over a period of ten years. This gives an average annual cost of at least &euro;56 per hectare. That figure would cover expenditure on management planning and administration, ongoing management actions, including compensation measures and incentives to land owners and managers, and occasional works necessary for restoration or improvement of sites. The figure of &euro;56 per hectare is considerably less than the basic rate of REPS and is indeed less than the top-up paid in Natura 2000 areas.</P>
    <P>The Natura 2000 suite of sites in Ireland comprise special areas of conservation, SACs, under the EU habitats directive and special protection areas, SPAs, under the EU birds directive. To date Ireland has designated 110 SPAs and submitted 364 candidate SACs to the European Commission, and a further 25 SPAs and 24 SACs have been formally proposed for designation for public consultation. These SAC and SPA designations and proposals overlap to some extent but in total, including marine areas, cover slightly over 1 million hectares.</P>

Local authorities are now in the process of implementing these Traveller accommodation programmes, for which my Department continues to provide funding. In the first three years of the programmes, from 2000 to 2002, a total of &euro;65.46 million was provided to local authorities to meet the cost of providing new and refurbished halting sites and group houses. A further &euro;30 million has been provided in my Department's Vote for such accommodation in 2003. In addition to Traveller specific accommodation, standard local authority housing and housing provided by approved voluntary housing bodies is also allocated to Traveller families.</P>

A reply is currently being prepared in consultation with the office of the Attorney General.

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Department of the Environment and Local Government (Mr. Cullen)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 121 and 128 together.</P>
      <P>I am aware of the concerns of the Irish Wheelchair Association in relation to the disabled persons grant scheme and of the funding implications for both the Exchequer and local authorities of the significantly increased demand for assistance under the scheme. My Department is currently undertaking a review of the operation of the scheme. On completion of the review, which I envisage within in the next few months, I will be in a position to determine the changes, if any, required to the regulations governing the scheme.</P>
      <P>The administration of the disabled persons grant scheme is a matter for individual local authorities and is operated within a framework, laid down by statutory regulations, which is designed, as far as is practicable, to give them an appropriate degree of flexibility in administering the scheme. It is a matter for the authorities to decide on the level of funding to be provided for the scheme in their areas from within the combined allocations notified to them for this purpose by my Department. My Department recoups to local authorities two-thirds of their expenditure on the payment of individual grants and it is the responsibility of the authorities to fund the balance from their own revenue resources. The amount they provide in their annual estimates of expenditure for this purpose is a matter for the authority concerned. While it is open to a local authority to seek a higher allocation in the event of increased demand, an increased capital allocation would not of itself allow increased expenditure by the authority without a corresponding upward revision of its own provision for expenditure on the scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Statistics on the operation of the disabled persons grant scheme in individual local authority areas in 2002, which are currently being finalised <Col N="169" /> in my Department, will establish the extent to which each local authority is operating the scheme. The statistics will be published shortly in the Annual Housing Statistics Bulletin, 2002, copies of which will be placed in the Oireachtas Library. Estimates of their expenditure this year on the disabled persons grant scheme submitted by local authorities are also being examined in my Department and, when all such estimates have been received, authorities will be notified of their capital allocations for the scheme in 2003 without delay.</P>
    <P>The significant improvements which have been made to the terms and conditions of the disabled persons grant scheme in recent years have resulted in increased levels of activity with expenditure on the scheme increasing from &euro;15.8 million in 1999 to &euro;41.7 million in 2001. The figures for 2002 are currently being finalised. In line with this increase in the Department's capital provision for the scheme, recoupment costs have also increased significantly from &euro;6.3 million for 2,512 grants in 1998 to almost &euro;31.5 million for 5,070 grants in 2002. This very significant increase in the level of funding provided is a clear indication of the Government's commitment to the disabled persons grant scheme.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment and Local Government (Mr. Cullen)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 122 and 130 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are currently five cases in respect of which the European Commission has initiated legal action, or announced that it intends to take legal action, in areas for which my Department has responsibility. The first case concerns the Dangerous Substances Directive &ndash; 1976/464/EEC. This directive has been substantially implemented by the Local Government (Water Pollution) Acts 1977 and 1990 and by related Acts and regulations, for example the <Col N="170" /> Environmental Protection Agency Act 1992 and the Waste Management Act 1996. Water quality standards for phosphorus were made in July 1998 and water quality standards for a range of other dangerous substances were made in January 2001. Monitoring by the EPA indicates that the main threat to water quality in Ireland is eutrophication due to excess inputs of phosphorus and, to a lesser extent, nitrates and that dangerous substances are generally not a problem in Irish waters. It is envisaged that the Directive will be further implemented in the context of implementation of the Water Framework Directive &ndash; 60/2000/EEC.</P>
    <P>The second case concerns the Nitrates Directive, 1991/676/EEC, and the designation of areas as vulnerable zones and the development of action programmes to protect water quality in these areas. The Government position is that an action programme, including regulations, will be applied in relation to the whole country and will provide statutory support for the application of established standards of good agricultural practice. The detailed provisions of the action programme and related research and monitoring programmes will be developed as a matter of urgency, in consultation with the main farming organisations and other interests, with a view to completion this year.</P>
    <P>The third case concerns the adoption of programmes for the protection of designated shellfish in waters in accordance with Article 5 of Council Directive 79/923/EEC. The directive has been fully transposed into Irish law, and action programmes have recently been made by the Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources and notified to the Commission. The need for any additional measures is being considered in the Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources.</P>
    <P>The fourth case relates to a number of waste issues, including progress in the licensing by the EPA of municipal waste landfills, and the regulatory control of waste activities by local authorities and the EPA. Ireland's defence, which has been submitted, is based in part on the fact that relevant requirements of Council Directive 75/442/EEC have been fully transposed under the Waste Management Act 1996 and subordinate regulations, and that the process of licensing municipal landfills is virtually completed.</P>
    <P>The fifth case concerns the stated intention by the Commission to refer Ireland to the European Court of Justice, and seek the application of a daily fire, in order to enforce a previous judgment of the Court issued in September 1999 in relation to Council Directive 85/337/EEC on the assessment of the effects of certain public and private projects on the environment, particularly in relation to peat extraction. Environmental impact assessment and planning regulations of December 2001 have addressed the legal implications of the ECJ ruling.</P>
    <P>I announced proposals for the protection of more than 100 raised bogs on 18 December 2002. <Col N="171" /> The Commission press release also acknowledged that this was an important step towards making Ireland's new system of protection fully operational. Public consultation on the designations is at present under way, and when completed it is expected the Commission will not proceed further with the case.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment and Local Government (Mr. Cullen)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 123 and 324 together.</P>
      <P>The Government has been concerned to increase housing supply to meet demand and to improve affordability, particularly for first time purchasers. There is clear evidence that this strategy is proving effective. Total new housing output in 2002 was 57,695 units, an increase of 9.7% on 2001 and the eighth consecutive year of record housing output. The effects of this increased output are being reflected in moderating house price trends. Average year on year house price increases have been reduced from a peak of around 40% per annum in 1998 to more moderate levels currently. When combined with Government measures and other factors, including high levels of economic growth, lower tax levels, increased disposable incomes, increased employment, lower mortgage interest rates and low inflation, this moderation in house price increases has impacted positively on housing affordability.</P>
      <P>Our approach has included the major expansion of both the local authority and voluntary housing programmes. Last year it is estimated that more than 12,600 units of social and affordable housing were provided compared to just short of 8,700 units in 2000. Local authority housing output of more than 5,000 units was achieved in 2002 and the voluntary housing sector continued to play an increasingly significant role in the provision of social housing with output of close to 1,400 units, the highest level ever recorded. Activity is also increasing significantly under the affordable housing and shared ownership schemes. An estimated 860 affordable housing units were built in 2002, about three times the output in 2001, and some 1,675 households benefited under the shared ownership scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="172" />Demographic changes continue to drive the demand for housing, including social housing. The Government therefore remains committed to continuing with measures to boost the supply of housing and in this way seek to bring moderation to the rate of house price increases and to assisting low income groups and those with social housing needs by means of the range of targeted social and affordable housing programmes. The total capital funding for housing this year, at &euro;1.7 billion is up almost 7% on the amount provided in 2002. It is anticipated that this funding will enable the needs of about 12,000 households to be met this year. The provisions under Part V of the Planning and Development Act 2000, as amended, will assist in the delivery of social and affordable housing and the housing initiative included in the new national partnership agreement Sustaining Progress also seeks to increase the supply of affordable housing.</P>
    <P>The current level of public investment in housing is significant and the need to ensure that we are making best use of the available resources to meet housing needs, is reflected in the new partnership agreement Sustaining Progress which provides for a review of the effectiveness of programmes designed to assist low-income groups, including those with social housing needs and special housing needs, such as elderly, disabled and homeless persons and Travellers. The Government will continue monitor housing developments and review policies as necessary to ensure that the demand for housing is met in a sustainable manner.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment and Local Government (Mr. Cullen)</NameTxt>
      <P>The National Hazardous Waste Management Plan &ndash; NHWMP &ndash; relates to the period 2001-06. It makes recommendations in respect of four main areas, namely, implementation of a national hazardous waste prevention programme; improved measures for the collection of hazardous wastes from households, small and medium enterprises, agriculture and other sources of &ldquo;unreported&rdquo; hazardous wastes; provision of requisite infrastructure to attain national self-sufficiency in relation to the recovery and disposal of hazardous wastes; and identification, risk assessment and, where necessary, remediation of sites where hazardous wastes were disposed of in the past.</P>
      <P>Under section 26 of the Waste Management Act 1996, relevant public authorities are required to have regard to the plan and, where they consider it appropriate to do so, to take measures to implement or otherwise give effect to, recommendations contained in it. Improved collection and reception services for hazardous waste from household and commercial sources are already being put in place by local authorities, and capital grant assistance is available from my Department in respect of the reception facilities concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to infrastructure, the plan identifies a requirement for landfill and thermal treatment capacity for hazardous waste requiring disposal, so as to achieve self-sufficiency and reduce reliance on export outlets. In principle, this infrastructure could be provided either by local authorities or the private sector, though local authorities have no statutory responsibility in this regard. As an exceptional measure, notwithstanding the polluter pays principle, grant assistance is available under the national development plan to incentivise the early provision of landfill capacity for hazardous wastes. With regard to incineration, a private company has announced proposals to develop a hazardous waste incineration facility at Ringaskiddy, County Cork, as a wholly <Col N="174" /> commercial venture with adequate capacity to meet current national needs.</P>
    <P>The NHWMP outlined a methodology for the identification and risk assessment of closed waste disposal sites. This methodology has since been developed further by the EPA and applied as a pilot project undertaken by Laois County Council. Following the completion of this project towards the end of last year, the EPA is expected during 2003 to develop and publish more detailed guidance for local authorities in this matter. The plan recommended the establishment of an implementation committee to co-ordinate its overall implementation.</P>
    <P>In the policy statement &ldquo;Preventing and Recycling Waste &ndash; Delivering Change&rdquo; published last year, a range of organisational and policy initiatives were outlined in support of more effective waste management. These include the establishment of a core prevention team within the EPA to implement a major national waste prevention programme that will encompass both hazardous and non-hazardous waste, focus on the elimination of waste from manufacturing, and improvements in the environmental performance of products. This initiative will be advanced as rapidly as possible. I am also establishing a separate committee to oversee the implementation of the non-prevention aspects of the NHWMP. My Department has invited a range of business, agricultural and environmental organisations, as well as relevant Departments and State agencies, to nominate representatives to participate on this committee, which is expected shortly to commence its work.</P>

      <P>As indicated previously, my Department has been actively engaged with the Society for the Irish Motor Industry, the Irish Motor Vehicle Recyclers Association, the Metal Recyclers Association of Ireland and other parties concerned with a view to developing a producer responsibility initiative to implement the main provisions of European Parliament and Council Directive 2000/53/EC on end-of-life vehicles, ELVs. Under the directive, member states must ensure that the last holder or owner can deliver the end-of-life vehicle to an authorised treatment facility free of charge and that the relevant economic operators meet all, or a significant part of, the costs of implementing these measures. The directive also requires member states to introduce a system whereby certificates of destruction are notified to the competent vehicle registration authorities on foot of the deposit of vehicles for scrapping.</P>
      <P>Agreement in principle has been reached by the economic sectors to establish a not for profit company to operate an ELV recovery scheme which will be subsidised by a fund generated by a levy on imported new and used vehicles. The Government has recently approved my proposals on an ELV recovery scheme which includes the introduction of a levy of &euro;150, net of VAT, on the importation of new and used vehicles to ensure that the ELV treatment requirements and the recovery targets under the directive can be met. The timing of the imposition of the levy and the commencement of free take-back of ELVs will be determined in light of progress in finalising legislation and the necessary regulations. The detailed mechanisms for the imposition and operation of the levy are under consideration in the context of preparation of the enabling primary legislation which is required for the purpose of implementing the directive. It is intended that the necessary legislative provisions to implement the directive will be incorporated, at an appropriate stage, in the Protection of the Environment Bill 2003, now before the Seanad.</P>

      <P>The Building Control Act 1990 assigns responsibility for complying with the building regulations primarily to the owners, designers and builders of the buildings involved. Under the 1990 Act, the role of local building control authorities is to monitor buildings for compliance with the building regulations.</P>
      <P>My Department and the City and County Managers Association have adopted a target of inspecting a representative sample of buildings, currently equivalent to at least 12% to 15% of buildings covered by valid commencement notices served on each building control authority. Within that overall target, priority is given to building works that are the subject of any complaints and buildings used by large numbers of people, including: buildings of public resort, including offices, hotels and cinemas; multi-storey buildings, including apartment blocks; and institutional buildings, including hospitals and nursing homes. I intend to ask the City and County Managers Association to give higher priority to inspecting new houses, within the overall target level of inspections, in the interest of first time purchasers.</P>
      <P>Local authorities also issue fire safety certificates for new non-residential buildings and new apartment blocks certifying that, if the relevant buildings are constructed in accordance with the plans lodged with the authority, they will comply with Part B &ndash; fire safety &ndash; of the building regulations.</P>

      <P>The Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland has been advised by the UK regulator, the Nuclear Installations Inspectorate, that progress in the dismantling of this structure has been slower than envisaged. Originally the operator appointed a commercial enterprise to plan, oversee and execute the dismantling work on this pile. However the contract <Col N="179" /> foundered when, at a late stage, the proposed engineering solution was deemed unacceptable. The United Kingdom Atomic Energy Authority then took back overall control of the project and is now working with a consortium of contractors. The current situation is that UKAEA and the consortium are re-considering the options for decommissioning pile 1. They are due to present their latest position and options to the Nuclear Installations Inspectorate shortly.</P>
      <P>Britain is establishing a new Government agency, the Nuclear Decommissioning Authority, NDA, which will be responsible for managing its nuclear waste legacy. The NDA will be charged with funding decommissioning projects and ensuring that this work proceeds. While the partial continued existence of the pile is clearly undesirable, it is not believed to constitute a serious hazard in terms of its potential for giving rise to an incident with off-site consequences.</P>

      <P>The EU Directive on waste electrical and electronic equipment will require the producers of electrical goods to put in place systems to ensure that electronic and electrical waste is collected and recycled to the greatest extent possible. To this end I have established a taskforce, representative of relevant industry interests and public authorities, to develop proposals for a producer responsibility initiative for this waste stream, which should enable the producers of electrical and electronic goods to put in place cost effective systems for collection and recycling, to the greatest extent possible. I expect delivery of a comprehensive set of recommendations by the end of the year and will transpose the directive into Irish law by the due date in August 2004.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In accordance with the directive, by August 2005, holders of electronic and electrical waste will be entitled to leave that waste back free of charge, either to the place of purchase or to other authorised collection points. Fridges and freezers are included within the scope of the directive. However, as set out in the reply to Question No. 129 of 4 February 2003, separate EU regulations affected the disposal of fridges and freezers with effect from 1 January 2002. In response my Department, within the co-operative framework <Col N="180" /> of the North-South Ministerial Council, has developed an all-island approach to the disposal of waste fridges and freezers in co-operation with the Department of the Environment in Northern Ireland.

      <P>The lead Department for the implementation of greenhouse gas reduction measures in the transport sector is the Department of Transport with other Departments, including my own, responsible for certain measures. In so far as my Department is concerned the progress report identified that reductions of 380,000 tonnes of CO2 are achievable by 2010 from fuel economy labelling for new cars, implemented by my Department in 2001. My Department is currently examining the relationship of car tax to CO2 emissions and is addressing the issues of equality, real emissions reduction and revenue safeguarding in this regard. At international level, car manufacturers in Europe, Japan and Korea entered into voluntary agreements with the European Commission to reduce average emissions of CO2 from new cars to an average of 140g CO2/km by 2008 and 2009, reductions of 25% below 1995 levels.</P>
      <P>I am committed to promoting the use of environmentally clean fuels and my Department liaises with the Departments of Finance and Transport in this regard. However, information available to my Department suggests that while LPG fuelled vehicles may have the potential to reduce NOx and particulates, the main components of urban pollution from vehicles, CO2 emissions from LPG fuelled engines are only marginally lower than emissions from petrol engines and may be no lower than emissions from diesel engines. Continuing emissions increases due to volume growth in the economy mean that implementation of the strategy must be intensified, and I have initiated a review in that regard which I expect to finalise by mid-year. I am satisfied that full implementation of the national climate change strategy over the remainder of the decade, together with any additional measures which may be identified in the review, will ensure that our Kyoto obligations are fully met by the 2008-2012 period.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Mr. Fahey)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 151 to 153, inclusive, together.</P>
      <P>Garda Síochána members, like all other workers, are covered by the provisions of the Safety, Health and Welfare at Work Act 1989 and supplementary regulations, such as the Safety, Health and Welfare at Work (General Application) Regulations 1993. Under the 1993 regulations an employer is required to report to the authority all workplace accidents which result in workers being unavailable for work for more than three days.</P>
      <P>The authority uses the NACE system, the common statistical classification of economic activities within the EU, to classify and record reported accidents and inspection visits. The Garda Síochána is covered by the overall classification &ldquo;public administration and defence and compulsory social security&rdquo;, which is sub-divided into other classes, including &ldquo;justice and judicial activities&rdquo; and &ldquo;public security, law and order activities&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The authority's records, as at 28 March 2003, show that 2,609 accidents were reported to it under both these NACE classes between 1995 and 2002. However, as these classifications also include employees in the Prison Service, the Court Service and the Coroner's Court, it is not possible to further break down this figure into its individual components. The authority's records do not show the number of accidents which have been investigated by the Health and Safety Authority since 1995 involving Garda Síochána members. However, as a general rule, the authority each year investigates between 5% and 10% of all accidents reported to it, based on the severity of injury.</P>
      <P>Between 1997 and 2002 the authority carried out 203 inspections under the two NACE classes to which I referred. Of these, 121 were of Garda stations. During this period 40 improvement notices under section 36 of the Safety, Health and Welfare at Work Act 1989 were served in the same NACE classes, of which 18 were served as a result of inspections of Garda stations.</P>

      <P>The management of the industrial property portfolio is a day to day matter for IDA Ireland and not one in which I have a direct function. I have not received any requests for funding from IDA Ireland in relation to the remedial works for the sewer and services at Ballybrit. I understand the services in question were constructed by IDA Ireland in the mid 1970s and involved bringing foul sewer-surface sewer and water services from the then existing services at IDA Ireland's Ballybrit industrial estate to service new lands acquired by the agency at Parkmore, located to the west of Galway city. These services are owned by IDA Ireland and are the sole means of providing these services to the Galway Business and Technology Park, Parkmore East and West. At the time of construction, all costs attributed to the development of these services were borne by IDA Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While IDA Ireland has indicated it has no objection in principle to the taking in charge of these services by Galway County Council, it must be noted that this would not represent a strategic benefit to the agency in its industrial development remit. Thus, it is the view of IDA Ireland that, in any such transfer, a proportion of the remaining capacity in both the foul sewer and the <Col N="186" /> water supply must be available to industry locating in the Galway Business and Technology Park, Parkmore East and West. This remaining capacity is vital for the future marketing and development of the Galway Business and Technology Park, which is dependent on having a water supply and foul disposal capability that meets with the potential needs of IDA Ireland client companies.</P>
    <P>Galway City Council has informed IDA Ireland that it requires the agency to undertake approximately &euro;391,000 of remedial works to the services infrastructure prior to Galway City Council taking the services in charge. The works in question relate to parts of the infrastructure which may need future replacement in the short to medium term due to its age. It is the view of IDA Ireland that this level of expenditure is not warranted at present and that the services infrastructure does not require remedial work of the magnitude envisaged by Galway City Council. IDA Ireland has no plans to fund the costs of any remedial works over and above the level of works it envisages. In the event of agreement being reached between IDA Ireland and Galway City Council regarding the scale of remedial works necessary in order to have the services taken in charge, funding for the works could be provided from within IDA Ireland's property budget.</P>

      <P>It is not policy to release detailed particulars of individual foreign aircraft landings at Casement Aerodrome, Baldonnel. The purpose of training flights to Ireland is pilot or flight training. I understand these flights involve routine flight proficiency training, including instrument approaches. The United States authorities indicate that it is customary to use a variety of different locations to practice these landings and take offs in order to broaden pilot experience. Such flights would consist of flying crew only. No Irish military personnel were involved in these training flights as participants. The Air Corps undertakes similar training flights to foreign airport facilities as part of their own training programmes. There were two flights involving conveyance of a VIP to Ireland and three flight touchdowns for refuelling and crew rest. No landing charges are levied by the Air Corps. There were no emergency landings.</P>
      <P>These individual landings have prior approval from the Department of Foreign Affairs and take place with the prior agreement of the Department of Defence and the Air Corps. The civil aviation authorities are also informed in advance. None of the aircraft involved was armed or was of the type that can normally be armed. While the Department of Defence reserves the right to inspect aircraft landing at Baldonnel, searches of aircraft would not be consistent with the accepted and long established international diplomatic practice in the circumstances described.</P>

      <P>The unsatisfactory age and fitness profile of the Permanent Defence Force was commented upon by the Gleeson Commission in its report in 1990 and had been of serious concern to the military authorities for a number of years. The age profile was also the subject of severe criticism by Price Waterhouse Consultants who had been engaged by the efficiency audit group, EAG, to conduct an in-depth study of the Defence Forces. One of the key areas identified for urgent action by the EAG was the development of a manpower policy with an emphasis on lowering the age profile of Permanent Defence Force personnel. The EAG's report was accepted by Government in 1995.</P>
      <P>In an effort to alleviate the situation, the Government had already decided in 1993 to enlist personnel on a five year contract basis with a Reserve Force commitment of seven years. The recruitment of personnel on five year contracts was introduced following consultation with the Permanent Defence Force Other Ranks Representative Association, PDFORRA.</P>
      <P>In 1997 agreement was reached with PDFORRA on a new manpower policy for the Defence Forces. This policy, applying to personnel enlisted after 1 January 1994, provided that service for private soldiers would initially be for five years with the option to be extended to a maximum of 12 years. Any extension was subject to the individual soldier meeting certain criteria to include standards of medical and physical fitness and conduct. Longer periods of service were envisaged for junior and senior non-commissioned officers. The new policy represented a substantial improvement for personnel who would otherwise have had to leave after five years' service while continuing to address the issues of age profile and fitness levels in the Defence Forces. I am satisfied with these existing arrangements.</P>
      <P>PDFORRA recently submitted a claim under the conciliation and arbitration scheme for a further review of the terms of service applying to personnel enlisting in the Permanent Defence Force after 1 January 1994. As discussions on issues raised under the conciliation and arbitration scheme are confidential to the parties concerned, the Deputy will appreciate that it would not be appropriate for me to comment further at this time.</P>
      <P>The Defence Forces pensions schemes provide for the grant of superannuation benefits in the form of pensions and-or gratuities to retired members of the Permanent Defence Force, PDF. All members of the PDF are automatically covered by the terms of those schemes from the date they join the force. All benefits under the schemes are payable immediately on retirement after relatively short service and regardless of age. In the case of enlisted personnel, the minimum service to qualify for pension and gratuity is 21 years, while a minimum of three years' service is required to qualify for a service gratuity only.</P>

      <P>A new double taxation convention between Ireland and the United States entered into force in 1998, replacing the existing convention which was in force since 1951. Under the provisions of the new convention, pension payments made from one country to a resident of the other country are taxable only in that other country. However, with respect to US citizens, the US reserves its right in the convention to tax its citizens, despite the provisions of the convention.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a different treatment for pensions paid in respect of Government service and US social security pensions. Government service pensions are generally taxable only in the country that pays the pension. US social security pensions are taxable only in the country of residence of the payee even if the payee is a US citizen. As a result, US pensions paid to Irish resident individuals are taxable in Ireland. Normal Irish tax exemption limits will apply. Where such individuals are non-US citizens, they are exempt from federal income tax. For US citizens, that exemption only applies to social security pensions. Where pensions are taxable in the US, a credit is given in the US for <Col N="193" /> Irish tax paid. If the pension is paid in respect of US Government service, it will be taxable only in the US.</P>

      <P>I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that health boards are obliged under section 888 of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 to complete an annual third party return known as the Form 8-4 detailing payments made in respect of rent subsidy in relation to any premises. From the Form 8-4 returns the Revenue Commissioners have been able to identify a number of unregistered landlords and to bring them into the tax system. For example, for the year of assessment 1999-2000 in the Dublin area, 692 of the 3,772 Dublin based landlords extracted from the information supplied by the health boards were either not registered for tax or not declaring this source of income on their income tax returns. These cases and sources of income were pursued by the Revenue Commissioners with the result that the defaulting landlords identified are now tax compliant.</P>
      <P>Subsequently in the year of assessment 2001, as a result of ongoing discussions between the health boards and the Revenue Commissioners, there was a significant improvement in the way returns were made. This enabled the information provided by different health boards to be merged and facilitated the easier identification of landlords who were operating in the shadow economy.</P>
      <P>As part of the consultation process between the Revenue Commissioners and the health boards, it was agreed that information would be exchanged electronically in a standard format for the year of assessment 2002 and subsequent years. This further facilitates the Revenue Commissioners in detecting defaulters as part of their ongoing commitment to achieving maximum compliance with tax legislation as outlined in their statement of strategy 2003-05.</P>

      <Quest>the Government's position on whether any state has a right to manufacture, stockpile, use or threaten to use nuclear, biological, or chemical weapons, otherwise known as weapons of mass destruction; if so, the states, and under which circumstances; and if not, the actions the Government has taken, is taking, or will take to promote comprehensive multilateral disarmament among present weapons of mass destruction states.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>Ireland is a state party to a number of multilateral legal instruments which relate to nuclear, biological or chemical weapons. With regard to nuclear weapons, the primary multilateral regime to prevent proliferation is the nuclear non-proliferation treaty, NPT, which came into force in 1970. The NPT does not prohibit the possession of nuclear weapons by those states which had manufactured and exploded such weapons prior to January 1967.</P>
      <P>Article VI of the NPT requires those states parties with nuclear weapons to pursue negotiations in good faith on effective measures to end the nuclear arms race at an early date with a view to nuclear disarmament, and on a treaty on general and complete disarmament under strict and effective international control.</P>
      <P>The Geneva Protocol for the Prohibition of the Use in War of Asphyxiating Poisonous or other Gases, and of Biological Methods of Warfare of 1925 banned the use of both biological and chemical weapons. The Biological and Toxin Weapons Convention, BTWC, which came into force in 1975, prohibits the stockpiling, production and development of biological weapons. The convention has more than 146 states parties and 17 signatories. States parties meet on a regular basis to review the implementation of the convention, most recently in Geneva in November 2002, at which states parties agreed to hold annual meetings until the sixth review conference to be held not later than the end of 2006. Ireland has been a state party since October 1972 and will continue to advocate the necessity of compliance with, and the strengthening of, the convention, in particular its mechanisms of verification.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Convention on the Development, Production, Stockpiling and Use of Chemical Weapons, CWC, was agreed in 1993 and came into force in 1997. The convention has over 170 signatories. The convention bans the development, production, stockpiling and use of chemical weapons, and provides for the destruction of existing chemical weapons stockpiles and related facilities <Col N="197" /> within a specific timeframe. The CWC established the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons, OPCW, with primary objectives of achieving universal adherence to the CWC and the destruction of all remaining chemical weapons stockpiles held by states parties by April 2007. The convention requires states parties to make declarations on their domestic chemical industry and to open that industry to international inspection. Five states have declared possession of chemical weapons stocks to the OPCW and are engaged in a process of their destruction under OPCW supervision. Ireland has been a state party since June 1996.</P>
    <P>Ireland has played and will continue to play an active role in these multilateral fora in an effort to ensure compliance with all the obligations contained in these legal instruments. The Government will also be active in seeking to encourage international efforts to develop instruments designed to prevent the further proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and to eliminate existing stockpiles of such weapons.</P>

As reported in some newspapers, during normal inspection work carried out recently by the security services of the Council secretariat, some suspect electronic devices were discovered in the EU Council building in Brussels. These devices were directed at various locations in the building, including some delegation rooms. The security services have assured us that the Irish delegation room was not affected. The devices in question have been disconnected and the Council secretariat is carrying out investigations into their source. With regard to Irish delegates attending the UN Security Council during our two year term on that body, national delegation rooms are not provided at UN headquarters.</P>

      <P>Decisions on the allocation of funds to Irish emigrant welfare agencies in the USA and Australia are based on specific needs rather than statistical considerations. In the USA the welfare groups submit grant proposals to the consulates in New York, Boston, Chicago and San Francisco, setting out their estimate of the level of demand for their services. The embassy in Washington and the consulates submit recommendations on these proposals taking into account their local knowledge of the needs of the Irish community.</P>
      <P>In the case of Australia, recommendations are submitted by the embassy in Canberra and the consulate in Sydney on the basis of requests from the welfare bureaux in Melbourne, Sydney and Wollongong. These recommendations are considered by my Department in the context of available resources and are submitted for my approval. The number of Irish-born people born in the US was approximately 220,000 in 1990 based on US census figures. The CSO estimates that approximately 61,000 people emigrated to the US in the period 1990 to 2001.</P>
      <P>In 1996 the Australian census recorded that 74,494 people born on the island of Ireland reside permanently in Australia. In addition, approximately 11,000 Irish citizens are in Australia on the working holiday programme at any one time.</P>

      <P>All children with special education needs within the primary school system, including children with attention deficit hyperactive dis<Col N="200" /> order, ADHD, have an automatic entitlement to a response to their needs.</P>
      <P>The special educational needs of children with ADHD can be addressed in special dedicated schools, in special dedicated classes attached to ordinary schools or on an integrated basis in ordinary schools. Decisions regarding the most appropriate model of response in each case are based on the professionally assessed needs of the individual child.</P>
      <P>Many children with the condition in question are capable of attending ordinary schools on an integrated basis with the support, where necessary, of the resource teacher and-or special needs assistant services. Where the level of the condition is of a more serious nature, provision is made by way of special schools or special classes attached to ordinary schools. All such facilities operate at a maximum pupil-teacher ratio of 8:1 and special needs assistant support is provided where required.</P>
      <P>My Department allocates additional resources to individual second level schools to cater for special needs pupils enrolled in those schools. Applications for resources are referred to the national educational psychological service and each case is considered on its merits. It is my intention to continue to build on these developments to ensure that all children, including children with ADHD, receive the support they require.</P>

      <P>In October 2000 my Department introduced an annual physical education grant for all primary schools. Since the introduction of the scheme, my Department provided in excess of &euro;5.5 million in grant aid to primary schools under this scheme for schools to provide coaching or mentoring in connection with physical education or for the purchase of resource materials associated with the provision of physical education. Materials and equipment purchased by schools in previous years will generally be available to them for the current year.</P>
      <P>Under this grant scheme, primary schools designated as disadvantaged schools were entitled to a grant of &euro;1,270 while other recognised primary schools were entitled to a grant of &euro;635. Approximately &euro;2.4 million was allocated to schools in 2002 under this scheme.</P>
      <P>By way of physical education grants, Coolick national school received &euro;212.05 in 2000 &ndash; one third of a full year's grant at the scheme's inception &ndash; and &euro;634.85 in 2001 and &euro;635.00 in 2002. In the light of the current budgetary constraints, I decided to withdraw payment of the grant for 2003. I will keep the position under review for future years.</P>

      <P>The position regarding the grant scheme for minor works is set out in the 2003 school building programme, which was published in January. The programme shows that &euro;18.1 million has been provided for the payment of the full grant. The programme also identifies explicitly that there are two parts to the grant &ndash;&euro;12.5 million for payment of the standard grant of &euro;3,809 to each school and &euro;5.6 million for payment of the <i>per capita</i> element at &euro;12.70 per pupil.</P>
      <P>The published programme also made clear that an expenditure review of the scheme, involving inspections of up to 300 schools, would be undertaken in the early part of the year. The purpose of the review is to ensure that the best use is being made of these funds by schools and to adjust the scheme in line with any recommendations that arise from the review. The review is about ensuring best practice and making the scheme as effective as possible. The published programme unambiguously states that the review is in the context of maintaining overall expenditure on the scheme at the same levels as in previous years. Arrangements for this review are being finalised at the moment. It is intended to complete it before the end of the current school year.</P>

Not all of these would be included in any one programme. Rather, the choice of game would be influenced by the balance of the programme, resources and facilities.

      <P>A range of studies and surveys has been undertaken to identify the optimum location of new facilities at Cromane. During 2002, a cost benefit analysis was undertaken and my officials are examining some issues raised by the council in the context of the cost benefit analysis. The next step in the process is to pursue the necessary statutory permissions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="211" />My Department has sought clarification from Kerry County Council that it is prepared to meet the 25% of the estimated &euro;10.5 million cost of the project. Confirmation of the council's position is still awaited. It is not possible to provide funding for the Cromane project in 2003. However, the position will be kept under review in the context of the funding available in the 2004-06 period for fishery harbour development projects and overall national priorities.</P>

      <P>An application has been made by Fingal County Council for a foreshore lease to allow the provision of an amenity access area and car park at the entrance to the coastal walkway on the southern side of the causeway at Broadmeadow Estuary. The county council has indicated that the development is intended to facilitate visitors wishing to study the ecology of the estuary and observe wild birds. Public notice of the application was published and the proposals were put on public display at the Fingal County Council offices in Swords and the Malahide public library. Some objections to the proposed development have been received and will be considered carefully in my Department's examination of the application.</P>
      <P>It would not be appropriate to express any views on the application at this point. The Deputy may be assured that all issues, including the conservation status of the area in question, will be considered fully before a decision is made on the application.</P>

The primary purpose of the prohibition is to protect the health and safety of workers and the public from toxic environmental tobacco smoke. This prohibition is based on recommendations contained in the Report on the Health Effects of Environmental Tobacco Smoke in the Workplace, prepared by an independent scientific working group commissioned by the Office of Tobacco Control and the Health and Safety Authority. It was published on 30 January 2003. There has been no formal assessment of the impact of the ban on the tourism sector.</P>

      <P>General practitioners are paid annual capitation fees for the patients on their GMS lists. These rates are based on the age, sex and location of the patients. The latest published figures, for the year 2001, indicate that an average of &euro;177.06 per patient was paid to doctors in that year.</P>
      <P>A uniform figure of &euro;462.16 per annum is currently being paid to doctors in respect of all patients who live in the community and received their medical card for the first time as a result of the Government decision to grant automatic medical card eligibility to persons aged 70 and over with effect from 1 July 2001. A capitation rate of &euro;669.79 is payable for all patients in this age group in private, health board approved nursing homes for a continuous period in excess of six weeks. The higher capitation rates reflect the outcome of an industrial relations process between management and the Irish Medical Organisation, the representative organisation of the doctors involved.</P>
      <P>Patients aged 70 and over who were medical card holders on 1 July 2001 do not attract the new higher capitation rate. The rates applied to these patients vary and depend on their age, sex and location.</P>
      <P>Doctors who hold GMS contracts also qualify for other payments, including out-of-hours consultation fees, for all categories of patients I have mentioned, and a range of practice support allowances which are based on their patient panel size. A ratio of 3:1 is being applied to doctors' panels in respect of the newly eligible over-70s for the purpose of the calculation of such allowances.</P>

      <QRef>[8713/03]</QRef>
    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>Severe acute respiratory syndrome, SARS, is a severe form of pneumonia or infection of the lungs which appeared recently in South East Asia. In mid-March I established an expert group to monitor the situation as it developed and to advise me of the measures required to deal with this syndrome. This group meets regularly and continues to monitor the situation.</P>
      <P>The National Disease Surveillance Centre, NDSC, and my Department have developed guidance for hospitals and health professionals which describes the syndrome and provided advice on how suspect cases should be managed. To date, two probable cases of SARS in persons who have recently returned on flights from South East Asia and who have shown symptoms similar to those of the disease are being investigated.</P>
      <P>The symptoms of SARS are a temperature of over 38ºC, &ldquo;flu-like&rdquo; symptoms and a cough. This is relevant only to people who have been in the affected areas. The advice to the general public remains as before: people travelling to affected areas in Singapore, Hanoi, Toronto and parts of China &ndash; i.e., Beijing, Guangdong, Hong Kong, Shanxi and Taiwan Province &ndash; should be aware of the symptoms and seek medical advice should they become unwell during their trip or within 10 days of leaving the area.</P>
      <P>With effect from Friday 28 March, individuals are advised not to undertake non-essential or elective travel to the SARS-affected areas. This advice follows the serious health threat identified by authorities in areas affected by SARS and the stringent disease control measures now being employed as a result.</P>
      <P>In addition, the Infectious Disease Regulations 1981 have been amended in order to designate SARS as a notifiable infectious disease.</P>
      <P>At one stage, Cherry Orchard had 231 beds for infectious diseases and had become by custom and practice a hospital where people with infectious diseases were accommodated. However, over the past 15 years the majority of its work has concerned other patient services.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In recent years it has become the practice to refer and treat patients with infectious disease in <Col N="216" /> acute general hospitals. It is now generally agreed by the medical profession, including the Irish Medical Council, that an acute general hospital is the appropriate setting for the delivery of this service. Therefore, the number of patients with acute infectious diseases admitted to Cherry Orchard has significantly reduced.</P>
    <P>Cherry Orchard does not have a range of back-up services and staffing to manage patients with acute illnesses. These are more appropriately treated in acute general hospitals where specialist expertise and facilities are present.</P>
    <P>In light of the small number of referrals and admissions of cases of acute infectious diseases to Cherry Orchard Hospital, and in view of the general agreement that it is most appropriate to treat these patients in acute general hospitals, all cases of acute infectious diseases have been, and will continue to be, managed in acute general and paediatric hospitals with effect from 1 January 2003.</P>

      <P>As the Deputy is aware, the Eastern Regional Health Authority is charged with responsibility for commissioning health and personal social services on behalf of the population of the region, and on behalf of those outside the region who are referred for specialist treatment.</P>
      <P>I met recently the New Crumlin hospital Group, which is composed of parents of children who regularly attend Crumlin Hospital for treatment. It was this group that commissioned the Pollock report into facilities in Crumlin.</P>
      <P>I am pleased to inform the Deputy that, on foot of an acknowledgement by all parties of the need for an overall development of the facilities at Crumlin hospital, last year I approved the establishment of a project team to plan for the future development of the hospital. The team includes representatives from the hospital, the Eastern Regional Health Authority and the Department of Health and Children.</P>
      <P>Many of the buildings comprised within the hospital are approximately 50 years old and have not been upgraded in any significant way over that period. As a result, they do not now generally meet contemporary standards for paediatric hospital facilities.</P>
      <P>The first stage of the planning process involves writing a brief for the preparation of a development control plan which will set the context for future capital developments on the site. Work on the preparation of the development brief has commenced, and it is expected to be completed by the end of 2003.</P>
      <P>It is intended that a phased approach to new development and the upgrade of facilities will be taken. The plans will allow for the prioritisation of developments according to the service needs of the hospital and the ERHA. A phased approach will ensure that services continue to be provided at the hospital during the redevelopment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A number of additional major developments, funded by the Exchequer, are currently being put in place at the hospital. These include a &euro;30 million investment in the new operating department which will provide two additional theatres, increasing the capacity of the hospital to five <Col N="222" /> major theatres and two minor theatres. Included in this development are new recovery beds, a day surgery unit and a modern central sterile supplies department. This development is expected to increase the capacity of the hospital to meet the additional surgery demands at both inpatient and outpatient level.</P>
    <P>In addition, on the basis of the volume and complexity of cases being dealt with at the hospital, I have approved the provision of an MRI facility in Crumlin which will significantly enhance the level of diagnostic services provided for children. The project team is currently engaged in the process of identifying the most appropriate location for this service in the context of the overall development plan for the hospital.</P>

The Western Health Board is projecting an outturn of &euro;674 million approximately, giving a surplus of &euro;6.347 million to carry forward to 2003. My Department had made provision for a further &euro;2 million to be allocated, however, given the financial pressures elsewhere in the system and the projected outturn for the board, it was considered appropriate that an allocation of &euro;680 million be approved. Final accounts will be available shortly which will indicate the definitive position. This carried forward surplus is available to assist service provision in 2003.</P>

      <P>The drugs payment scheme, DPS, which replaced the drug cost subsidisation scheme, DCSS, and drugs refund scheme, DRS, schemes in 1999, was initially introduced on an administrative basis, with the intention that regulations to underpin its operation would be introduced at a later date, following amendment of the relevant section of the 1970 Health Act. However, amendment of the Act was delayed, and, following further consideration and legal advice obtained from the Attorney General's office in October 2000, regu<Col N="223" /> lations made under the existing section 59 of the 1970 Act, fixing the threshold for the new scheme at &euro;53.33, came into effect on 1 March 2001. Given that, as has been pointed out previously, claimants derived greater overall benefits under the new scheme, as reflected in the significant increase in spending, the issue of possible refunds was not addressed at the time.</P>
      <P>Following a review by my Department of the position in relation to this issue, it has now been decided that a process should be put in place for assessing applications for refunds from persons who may be owed money arising from the introduction of the DPS.</P>
      <P>There are significant administrative issues to be resolved before a process can be put in place, and my Department is addressing these issues in consultation with the relevant bodies. When an appropriate procedure is agreed, applications will then be invited through public notice, and each application for refunds will be considered under the terms of the agreed procedure. The final cost and the numbers qualifying for reimbursement will not be known until all applications are received and processed.</P>

      <P>The Births and Deaths Registration Acts 1863 to 1996, as amended by the Status of Children Act 1987, include provisions for the entry of paternity details in the register of births in respect of children born to parents not married to each other. Section 46 of the Status of Children Act 1987 provides that where a woman gave birth during a subsisting marriage or within 10 months of the termination, by death or otherwise of a marriage <Col N="224" /> to which she was a party her husband was presumed to be the father of the child unless the contrary was proved on the balance of probabilities.</P>
      <P>The Status of Children Act 1987 provided a number of mechanisms for the rebuttal of the husband's paternity including, a statutory declaration by her husband stating that he is not the father of the child, or a statutory declaration by the mother stating that she has been living apart from her husband under, a decree of divorce <i>a mensa et thoro</i> or a deed of separation, as the case may be, for more than ten months before the birth of the child. The declaration must be accompanied by the decree or deed as appropriate. A decree of divorce issued under the Family Law Divorce Act 1996 ten months prior to the birth of the child also suffices to rebut the paternity of the husband of the child. In circumstances where the mother is unable to avail of these provisions the birth may also be registered at the written request of the mother or the putative father of the child, on production of a certified copy of any court order in respect of proceedings to which section 45 of the Status of Children Act 1987 relates, naming that person as the father of the child.</P>

      <P>The road traffic Acts provide the legislative basis for the determination and provision of traffic signs. In particular, the Acts provide that responsibility for the provision of traffic signs is vested in road authorities and regulations made under the Acts determine the range of signs that fall within the general parameters and categorisation of traffic signs established in the Acts. These include directional traffic signs.</P>
      <P>The current policy on directional signs in respect of places in Gaeltacht areas was established through regulations made in 1970. The regulations provided that in an area determined to be a Gaeltacht area, the names of places in such an area must be shown in Irish only. The general policy in relation to the use of Irish and English text is set out in the traffic signs manual, which was published in 1996. A copy of the manual is available in the Oireachtas Library.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The manual presents clear instructions to road authorities that they must ensure that that the correct forms and spelling of place-names are used on traffic signs. To ensure that this policy is pursued, road authorities are specifically requested to consult with the Place-Names (Irish Forms) (No. 1) (Postal Towns) Order 1975 (S.I. No. 133 of 1975); or if the place-name is not <Col N="225" /> included in the place-names order, to consult the Gazetteer of Ireland. This was published in 1989 by the place-names branch of the Ordnance Survey and provides a bilingual list of the principal geographical names of Ireland.</P>
    <P>Where the correct Irish form of a place-name is not provided in either of the publications referred to, road authorities should consult with, and obtain advice from, An Coimisiún Logainmneacha. However, before consulting with An Coimisiún, road authorities are advised to ascertain through local consultation whether specific place-names have a particular local significance or what traditional local usage may exist.</P>

      <P>The average waiting times and numbers awaiting a driving test at each test centre, as at 31 March 2003, are set out as follows. The average waiting time nationally for candidates undertaking a test is 12 weeks. The numbers waiting do not include some 6,500 applications for driving tests received since 21 March 2003 which remain to be entered on the driver testing computer database. Under the Road Traffic Act 1961 and the Road Traffic (Licensing of Drivers) Regulations, 1999 to 2001, it is a matter for the appropriate licensing authority to determine the eligibility of a person for a driving licence, and to issue licences.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Transport (Mr. Brennan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 247 and 248 together.</P>
      <P>Under the existing public service vehicle regulations responsibility for the grant of a licence to drive a small public service vehicle, which includes a taxi, rests with the Garda Commissioner. Applicants must satisfy the commissioner that they are a fit and proper person to hold a licence, that they have an adequate knowledge of general traffic regulations, the public service vehicle regulations and the area in which they propose to make services available as a driver of a small public service vehicle.</P>
      <P>I am advised that the introduction of tax clearance certification requirements is a matter that would require primary legislation and, accordingly, this is a matter to be considered in the context of the preparation of legislation to support the establishment of the commission for taxi regulation, which is proceeding as a matter of urgency in my Department. Pending the enactment of the proposed legislation, the regulatory powers relating to the operation and licensing of taxis, hackneys, limousines and their drivers will remain a matter for my consideration. However, I have already indicated that I am prepared to act on any recommendations proposed by the interim chairman of the commission for taxi regulation for urgent changes to the current regulations on standards. It is intended that the proposed legislation will address issues relating to the licensing of drivers and operators of all small public service vehicles including the standards that will apply to the grant of such licences and the operation of such vehicles. </P>

      <P>Private bus operators are licensed to provide public transport services in accordance with the provisions of the Road Transport Act 1932. The Act does not make specific reference to the provision of accessible buses. This Act is currently under review. It is proposed to replace it with a new statutory framework for the independent regulation of bus services. I am committed to a policy of making public transport accessible for all categories of people who have mobility impairment, such as the physically disabled, the sensory impaired, the elderly, parents with children and so on.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is therefore my intention that the provision of accessible buses by bus operators will be addressed in detail in the context of the proposed new regulatory regime for bus services. When licences are being issued under the Road Transport Act 1932, my Department requests private <Col N="228" /> operators to use low floor buses with accessibility features where possible in the provision of licensed bus services. Where new vehicles are being purchased for licensed services, my Department requests that the buses accord with appropriate accessibility standards.</P>

      <P>The pass rate covering the year 2002 at all test centres is set out in the following table. As in other EU countries, there is a variation in the pass rate among test centres. The pass rate may be influenced by a number of factors, including the number of lessons taken by the candidate, the standard of instruction available and demographic factors. Our pass rate is consistent with the experience in other countries.</P>
      <P>As regards consistency in the standard of the driving test, my Department undertook a comprehensive training programme for all driver testers in 2002 covering procedures for carrying out the test, guidelines to assess faults and training to enhance customer service in the delivery of the driving test. The work of all testers is monitored on an ongoing basis by his or her supervisor.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="230" />The Employment Equality Act 1998, which prohibits discrimination in relation to employment on nine grounds and the Equal Status Act 2000, which prohibits discrimination in relation to the provision of goods and services on the same nine grounds, are currently being examined in the context of the implementation of Directive 2002/73/EC, Race Directive, Directive 2000/78/EC, Framework Employment Directive, and Directive 2002/73/EC, Gender Equal Treatment Directive. The three directives provide a general framework for combating discrimination on grounds of racial or ethnic origin in both the employment and non-employment areas, Race Directive, as well as a general framework for the prohibition of discrimination in relation to employment on grounds of religion or belief, disability, age or sexual orientation, Framework Employment Directive, and on the ground of gender, Gender Equal Treatment Directive.</P>
    <P>In the second half of 2002, my Department consulted Departments, the Equality Authority, the Office of the Director of Equality Investigations, the Labour Court and the social partners in relation to the implementation of the employment aspects of the directives. Observations received in the course of this process will, where considered appropriate, be taken into account when amending the legislation. With the Equal Status Act being relatively compliant with the Race Directive, a major consultative process was not thought necessary. However, written submissions have been received and have contributed to the process of drafting the submission to Government in relation to the non-employment area.</P>
    <P>I intend to implement the directives in an integrated manner by way of primary legislation amending the Employment Equality Act 1998 and the Equal Status Act 2000. It is hoped to publish the legislation by summer 2003, with a view to its implementation at the earliest possible date. It is intended to ensure that the provisions of the directives will apply to all nine grounds covered by the 1998 and 2000 Acts. The drafting of the legislation addressing the equality aspect of occupational pensions is a matter for my colleague, the Minister for Social and Family Affairs.</P>

I under<Col N="231" /> stand that due to the complicated nature of these type of applications, which require a detailed examination of the applicant's entitlement to registration as owner of the property concerned, it is not possible to estimate a date of completion at this time. I confirm to the Deputy that the Land Registry has received a reply to the queries which issued to the lodging solicitors and I am further informed that the matter has progressed to the stage where notices of the application were served on parties who might have a valid interest in the property on 13 March 2003. I assure the Deputy that on expiration of the notice period in this case, this application will receive further consideration in the Land Registry.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 256 and 260 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As the Deputy is aware, the Government decided in September 2001 to accept the thrust of the package of reforms recommended by the Commission on Public Service Pensions and to establish a working group to advise on implementation as provided for in the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness. Parallel structures with the same remit were established in the case of An Garda Síochána and the Defence Forces. The <Col N="232" /> operational details of the implementation of the commission recommendations will be agreed by Government following receipt of a report from the implementation working group. The report is in the process of being finalised at present.</P>
    <P>The position in relation to the issue of parity of pensions for members of An Garda Síochána who retired prior to 1993, who do not receive the unsocial hours element in their pensions, and those who retired prior to 1982, who do not receive the rent allowance element in their pensions, is that the commission examined the specific issue of the pensionability of allowances for members of An Garda Síochána and others as part of its deliberations, but, having assessed the arguments involved, did not recommend any increase in pension for the groups involved. Having regard to the commission's report, I have no plans to introduce amending legislation at this stage.</P>
    <P>The number of retired members of the Garda Síochána from garda to chief superintendent rank who retired prior to 1 October 1982, the effective date of the pensionability of rent allowance, and who are in receipt of Garda pensions is 164. The number of retired members of the Garda Síochána from garda to chief superintendent rank who retired prior to 1 January 1993, the effective date of the pensionability of unsocial hours allowances, and who are in receipt of Garda pensions is 1,564. The current additional annual cost to the Exchequer based on these figures would be &euro;236,160 and &euro;5,395,800, respectively. There are also a number of Garda spouses pensions in payment to the spouses or children of deceased members who retired prior to the dates in question which would give rise to a further annual Exchequer cost.</P>
    <P>In addition, the extension sought in relation to the Garda allowances could not be confined to retired members of the Garda Síochána. There could be considerable additional costs with regard to allowances in other areas of the public sector, notably the Defence Forces, teachers and prison officers. A concession in these areas could impose a significant cost on the State &ndash; in excess of &euro;12 million a year and an accrued liability of about &euro;152 million, based on 1997 costs for Garda and Defence Forces pensioners outlined in the final report of the Commission on Public Service Pensions.</P>

      <P>I am not aware of complaints about the behaviour of gardaí who were on duty outside this House during the anti-war demonstration on 20 March 2003. I am informed by the Garda authorities that during the protest, which lasted for most of the day on the 20th, a number of protesters staged a sit down protest outside the Kildare Street entrance to Leinster House by chaining themselves together. They were asked to discontinue their protest to allow vehicular access and egress to the House. The protesters refused and a decision was taken to physically remove them using minimum force. I am also informed by the Garda authorities that one person, who they believe was not involved in the protest, collapsed and was required to be taken to hospital for treatment. I understand he was discharged shortly after admission.</P>

      <P>As I indicated in my reply to Parliamentary Questions Nos. 25 and 42 on 6 February 2003, I am considering availing of the provision which has existed in Irish immigration law since 1946 for the fingerprinting of non-EEA nationals during the course of the registration process.</P>
      <P>The Garda National Immigration Bureau has become aware of a large number of incidents of identity fraud related to foreign nationals. For example, since 1 January 2003, a total of 369 documents have been seized. These documents fall into the following categories: counterfeit/ forged foreign passports, counterfeit/forged identity cards, counterfeit Irish work permits, counterfeit Irish immigration stamps and counterfeit Irish visas. In addition, computer hardware for the production of such false documents has also been seized. It is not possible to state the extent of the consequent loss to the Exchequer or the cost of the proposed fingerprinting scheme.</P>
      <P>There is no evidence in the possession of the Garda Síochána that non-EEA nationals are more likely to commit fraud than EEA nationals or Irish citizens. In general, it is certainly easier for the Garda Síochána to establish information leading to the identification of an Irish citizen without recourse to written documentation. Furthermore, it is the case that non-EEA nationals are required to supply certain information to the Garda Síochána at present, not alone upon arrival in the State but also after three months residence in the State and periodically thereafter depending on the circumstances of the case. It is not my view that the fingerprinting of such persons would treat them as potential criminals, no more than the current registration process does. If that were the case then many facets of immigration control, which in the main is applied only to non-EEA nationals by virtue of our membership of the European Union, could be construed as such.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. McDowell Mr. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. McDowell)</NameTxt>
      <P>I assume that the Deputy is referring to the recently launched political equality strategy document and the photographic exhibition Put More Women in the Picture. As regards the strategy document the Government is committed to improving the position of women in decision-making and in public life.</P>
      <P>The photographic exhibition was funded by the NDP gender equality unit of my Department. A tour of the exhibition to local authorities around Ireland during 2003 is also being organised by the unit. The unit will, in addition give talks to the county development boards of counties in which the exhibition is being displayed to underline the importance of increasing women's participation in decision-making bodies.</P>
      <P>In relation to women in politics the equality for women measure, which is funded under the national development plan, is supporting projects involving three political parties, Fianna Fáil, Fine Gael and Sinn Féin to develop initiatives to increase the number of female electoral candidates and representatives. A grant of approximately &euro;254,000 has been awarded among the parties to develop their separate project proposals over a three year period. In addition, a representative of the Labour Party is on the management committee of a project on decision-making which is being led by Trinity College, Dublin, and funded under the equality for women measure.</P>
      <P>In relation to the position of women on state boards, the Government has set a minimum target of 40% representation of both women and men. Our commitment to achieving this target has been set out in An Agreed Programme for Government and the new partnership agreement, Sustaining Progress. Significant progress has been made towards achieving the target with ministerial nominations reaching the 40% target in recent quarters. Nevertheless, there is still an overall imbalance in representation which we are committed to eliminating.</P>
      <P>In July 2002, the Minister of State with special responsibility for equality, Deputy O'Dea, contacted all Ministers with a request to review the gender balance of the State boards under the aegis of his or her Department and to take measures to redress the gender imbalances where the 40% target has not been reached. To ensure progress, the Minister of State intends bringing a six-monthly report to the Government on the gender composition of boards for each Department broken down between boards newly appointed during that period and boards already in existence. The first progress report is being prepared and will be submitted to Government shortly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It should be noted that the Government's commitment to improving the position of women in decision-making is one element of a comprehensive programme aimed at the promotion of <Col N="239" /> equality of opportunity between women and men. The Government sees the involvement of significant numbers of women on State boards and in politics as an important contribution to the achievement of equality of opportunity.</P>

      <P>The Reception and Integration Agency, RIA, is responsible <i>inter alia</i> for meeting the accommodation needs of asylum seekers under the system of dispersal and direct provision which was introduced in April 2000. Prior to the introduction of direct provision the Eastern Health Board, now the Eastern Regional Health Authority, was responsible for the provision of accommodation for asylum seekers.</P>
      <P>Under the direct provision system, the RIA provides full board accommodation to asylum seekers in a number of settings, including hostels, guesthouses, a former holiday camp, mobile home sites, former hotels and system built accommodation, while their claims for refugee status are being determined. On their arrival at the Office of the Refugee Applications Commissioner at Mount Street, Dublin 2, all applicants for asylum are offered accommodation under the system of direct provision. New applicants are provided with accommodation initially at one of the seven reception centres currently used by the RIA in the Dublin area. When their initial needs have been determined in the reception centre &ndash; generally within two weeks of making their application &ndash; they are assigned to a regional accommodation centre.</P>
      <P>The RIA currently uses 50 accommodation centres in 23 counties for this purpose. When making placements to these centres, the RIA has regard to a number of factors which include the general availability of accommodation, marital status, family size, age of children, medical and other special needs, cultural background and so forth.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Asylum seekers who are not granted refugee status can remain in their accommodation centres until arrangements are made for their repatriation to their countries of origin. Persons granted refugee status are entitled to access housing of every tenure on the same basis as Irish citizens. Non-nationals who entered the State as asylum seekers and who were subsequently allowed to remain in the State on foot of being the parents <Col N="240" /> of an Irish born child were also entitled under social welfare legislative provisions to rent supplements &ndash; on the same basis as Irish nationals &ndash; to enable them to acquire accommodation in the private rented sector.</P>
    <P>The Social Welfare (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill currently before the Oireachtas when enacted into law will henceforth prohibit asylum seekers and certain other non-nationals from accessing rent supplement payments.</P>

      <P>Section 3(1) of the Immigration Act 1999, as amended, provides that, subject to the provisions of the section 5 concerning prohibition of refoulement of the Refugee Act 1996, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform may by order require any non-national specified in the order to leave the State within such period as may be specified in the order and to remain thereafter out of the State. Section (2)(<i>f</i>) of the Act specifies that one of the categories of persons in respect of whom such an order may be made is a person whose application for asylum has been refused.</P>
      <P>Where the Minister proposes to make a deportation order, section 3(3)(<i>a</i>) of the 1999 Act requires the person concerned to be notified in writing of the Minister's proposal and be given the options of making representations within 15 working days setting out the reasons why they should be allowed to remain temporarily in the State; leaving the State before the order is made; or consenting to the making of the deportation order.</P>
      <P>If the person does not leave the State voluntarily, and irrespective of whether or not representations are made, section 3(6) of the 1999 Act requires the Minister to have regard to a range of 11 different factors, including humanitarian considerations, in determining whether or not a deportation order should be made in respect of persons who have been notified under section 3(3)(<i>a</i>) of the Act.</P>
      <P>A deportation order is therefore made only after a detailed consideration of each individual case. Nonetheless, it is essential that the integrity of our asylum and immigration processes is maintained and that those persons who have no basis for remaining in the State are deported in accordance with the statutory requirements.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The following is the breakdown of deportations in the years 1999 to date. Although the vast majority of these removals were in respect of persons refused refugee status in the State, some of <Col N="241" /> the removals were in respect of other categories of persons &ndash; illegal immigrants, for example :&ndash;</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 282 and 292 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am aware of the importance of protecting hedgerows and avoiding the disturbance of wildlife during the nesting season. Hedgerows form an important feature for maintaining wildlife diversity, particularly for birds. The rural environment protection scheme, administered by the <Col N="243" /> Department of Agriculture and Food, makes specific provision for the protection of hedgerow habitats. Section 40 of the Wildlife Act 1976, as amended by section 46 of the 2000 Act, provides protection for hedgerows by providing that it is an offence for a person to cut, grub, burn or otherwise destroy hedgerows on uncultivated land during the nesting season from 1 March to 31 August.</P>
    <P>The Acts do provide for hedgecutting during this period in a number of circumstances, however. These circumstances include cutting during the ordinary course of agriculture or forestry; the cutting or grubbing of isolated bushes or growths of fern in the ordinary course of agriculture; cutting for reasons of public health or safety by a Minister or a body established or regulated by or under a statute; the destroying of any noxious weed to which the Noxious Weeds Act 1936 applies; the clearance of vegetation in the course of fisheries development works by the central fisheries boards or a regional fisheries board; and the clearance of vegetation during road or other construction works or in the development or preparation of sites on which any building or other structure is intended to be provided.</P>
    <P>A person who witnesses illegal hedgecutting should bring the matter to the attention of the local conservation ranger of my Department's heritage service, or the Garda Síochána for consideration of possible enforcement action under the Wildlife Acts 1976 and 2000. On summary conviction for illegal hedgecutting, a person may be liable to a fine not exceeding &euro;635 or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding three months, or both. In the case of a second offence, a person may be liable to a fine not exceeding &euro;1,270 or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding six months, or both. In the case of a third or subsequent offence, the fine is &euro;1,905 or imprisonment for a term not exceeding 12 months, or both.</P>
    <P>My Department is contributing &euro;50,000 over a three-year period to support Networks for Nature, an initiative co-ordinated by the Heritage Council and aimed specifically at the conservation of Ireland's hedgerows. The range of actions supported by Networks for Nature includes education and training on hedgerows for local authorities, planners and landowners. A certification scheme is being established for hedgecutting contractors to raise the standards of mechanical hedge maintenance. A wide range of awareness raising activities are being undertaken, including the publication of booklets on all aspects of hedgerows, the creation of a website, engagement with the media and community groups and a hedgerow exhibition in ENFO later this year. Networks for Nature commenced a pilot survey of hedgerows in 2002 to develop a methodology which can be applied to a national survey of our hedgerow resource. A national survey is expected to commence shortly to assess the <Col N="244" /> composition, structure, condition and management of hedgerows in Ireland. The survey will also provide data on the extent of hedgerow removal.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 283 and 326 together.</P>
      <P>The key objective of Government housing policy is to enable every household to have available an affordable dwelling of good quality, suited to its needs, in a good environment and, as far as possible, at the tenure of its choice. The Government has implemented a balanced range of measures to increase overall housing supply and to afford greater access to the housing market to first-time buyers. It has also tried to develop the private rented sector and to advance social and affordable housing programmes specifically targeted at low income groups and those with social housing needs.</P>
      <P>These measures have led to record levels of housing output, with 57,695 houses completed in 2002, up almost 10% on 2001 levels, representing the eighth consecutive year of record output. Although the Department does not have a breakdown of new house completions by first-time buyers or other owner occupiers and investors, market evidence indicates that many investors returned to the housing market in 2002, thereby increasing the supply of private rented accommodation and leading to moderation in the rate of increase of private rents. This is a positive development for those seeking accommodation in the private rented sector. At the same time, indicative data available to the Department confirms that first-time buyers remained a strong presence in the housing market, representing approximately 40% of the market in 2002.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>By continuing to support increased housing supply, the Government will maintain its efforts to ensure moderate price increases and improved affordability, particularly for first-time buyers. The Government supports first-time buyers through a range of targeted measures, including the increase in the mortgage tax relief available to them by over 25% in budget 2003; the extension of the period for which relief is available by a further two years and the rebalancing of stamp <Col N="245" /> duty rates to favour first-time buyers. The Government remains committed to pursuing the balanced range of measures which are providing access to home ownership for large numbers of people, as well as ensuring a good supply of rented accommodation.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 285 and 286 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Two species of hare are found in Ireland: the brown hare, which was introduced in the 19th century and the mountain hare, which is one of Ireland's longest established mammals. Under Action 26 of the national biodiversity plan, the Government is committed to identifying species of highest conservation concern in Ireland and to preparing and periodically revising species action plans for them. Officials from my Department recently met their colleagues from the Environment and Heritage Service of Northern Ireland to discuss conservation matters of mutual interest. The possible joint implementation of a number of species action plans and research <Col N="246" /> initiatives for a number of species, including the hare, were discussed. It was agreed that a joint project to establish hare numbers throughout Ireland should be undertaken as a first step in an all-island action plan for the species.</P>
    <P>There is no evidence that hare coursing or hunting adversely impacts the conservation of hare populations, the main determinant of which is likely to be the availability of suitable habitats. These issues will, in any event, be informed by the completion of the project described above. It is my view that the proposed all-Ireland hare survey will provide worthwhile data on the current status of Irish hare populations and identify factors impacting on population numbers. This will enable strategies to be developed, by way of an all-island species action plan, to ensure the continued protection and well-being of the hare in Ireland.</P>

      <P>The Law Reform Commission published a report on gazumping in October 1999, which examined the practice of taking booking deposits on the sale of new residential properties. The commission found that gazumping occurred in only a handful of cases &ndash; less than 5% &ndash; and almost always on the sale of new houses. The commission concluded that the current legal position, which does not confer any interest in property upon the payment of a booking deposit, generally benefits the purchaser more than the vendor, allowing the purchaser flexibility to conduct the necessary preliminary investigations before committing to an irrevocable agreement. Among the recommendations of the Law Reform Commission report was the initiation of, and adherence to, voluntary codes of practice in the industry such as the home purchase protection pledge established by the Irish Home Builders Association.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under the IHBA code of practice, members must not increase the price of the property or accept any offer from any other party for the property for a seven week period following payment of a booking deposit during which time contracts should be exchanged and signed. The code stipulates that IHBA members are only entitled to increase the price of properties in circumstances where VAT rates have changed or as a result of newly enacted legislation which directly affects the price of a property. In the event of non-compliance by a member of the IHBA in <Col N="247" /> relation to this aspect of the code, the IHBA may take appropriate sanctions.</P>

      <P>Ireland has participated annually in European car-free day since 2000 and the number of participating cities and towns has doubled in the interim. The purpose of the event is to promote more sustainable modes of transport and to provide urban dwellers with an opportunity to experience their city or town in a car free environment each 22 September. My Department works closely with Sustainable Energy Ireland and the Department of Transport to encourage and support local authorities and transport operators to participate in the event. In 2002, European car-free day events were organised in Cork city, Dublin city, Dun Laoghaire, Galway city, Greystones, Kilkenny city, Limerick city, Newcastle West, Portlaoise and Waterford city. In 2002, some 1,500 cities and towns participated in events across Europe and further afield.</P>
      <P>European mobility week took place for the first time in 2002 and some 300 cities and towns participated across Europe. Involved was a series of events aimed at promoting sustainable modes of transport over a full week commencing on 16 September and culminating on European car-free day on 22 September. Participating cities and towns are required to organise at least one themed event each day dedicated to sustainable mobility. Ireland did not participate in European mobility week 2002 as efforts to date have concentrated on building up participation in European car-free day and consolidating that day as an annual national event. Decisions on whether to extend participation to European mobility week in 2003 are a matter for individual participating cities and towns in the first instance, but such extended participation will be encouraged by my Department where possible and appropriate.</P>

      <Quest>the reason there has been no drop in the homeless numbers in the past three years, with almost 3,000 adults and 1,200 children counted as homeless in Dublin in March 2002, with their current spell of homelessness typically exceeding one year.</Quest>

      <P>According to Counted In, 2002, the joint ESRI-Homeless Agency study on the number of homeless people in Dublin, there were 2,920 homeless adults (2,560 households) in the Dublin area in March 2002 compared to 2,900 (2,690 households) in March 1999. This figure includes people in a range of homeless accommodation, including bed and breakfast and hostel accommodation, as well as people who reported that they were sleeping rough. The figures indicate the number of homeless people at a point in time, but do not reflect the flows into and out of homelessness. The ESRI-Homeless Agency study was carried out at a time when there was pressure on the availability of housing and the Dublin action plan was one year into its three-year cycle. While the results of the study show an increase of 20 in adult homelessness, the overall decrease of 130 households presenting as homelessness shows that progress has been made in tackling the problem. The implementation of the action plan by the Homeless Agency has meant that significant progress has been made in tackling homelessness. A range of new emergency, transitional and long-term accommodation has been provided and settlement services have been developed to assist people out of homelessness.</P>
      <P>In relation to the very visible form of homeless, which is people sleeping rough, a number of initiatives have already been undertaken. Outreach services to assist people on the streets have been developed and accommodation aimed specifically at rough sleepers has been provided. Accommodation for homeless young drug users opened in the city centre in late 2001 and a low threshold shelter aimed at those with alcohol addictions opened in late 2002. Plans are also well advanced for long-term supported housing for street drinkers which should open later this year.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">

      <P>As set out in the policy statements Changing our Ways (1998) and Preventing and Recycling Waste: Delivering Change (2002), the Government is committed to a major reduction in reliance on landfill and a sustained expansion in national recycling performance across all waste streams. The recycling of post-consumer plastic beverage containers and other types of plastic packaging is generally more problematic than the recycling of other packaging materials due to the light weight to volume ratio, sorting and pre-treatment requirements, high-end market specifications and the associated costs involved. Accordingly, the recycling rate for plastic packaging is generally lower than for other packaging materials.</P>
      <P>The local and regional waste management plans being implemented provide for a significantly increased network of bring facilities to facilitate increased collection of recyclables, including plastic beverage containers. Receptacles for the deposit of such containers are already in place in a number of areas. I am aware of one indigenous company which has limited facilities for the sorting, washing and pre-treatment of used plastic beverage containers. The local and regional waste management plans also provide for the progressive introduction of segregated household collection of dry recyclables. Approximately one third of all households already have these services. The collection of plastic beverage containers under such arrangements is contingent on the availability of material recovery facilities at which dry recyclables are sorted and baled for onward delivery to reprocessing outlets.</P>
      <P>In November 2002, I announced the allocation of &euro;15 million in grant assistance to help provide waste recovery infrastructure as the first round of allocations under the waste infrastructure capital grants scheme announced earlier last year. This scheme supports the development, <i>inter alia,</i> of bring banks, civic amenity sites and the expansion of an existing material recovery facility to facilitate increased collection and recovery of plastic beverage containers and other recyclables in the years ahead. I intend to announce a second round of allocations and additional financial measures in the near future.</P>

      <P>I am aware of media references to security at the Sellafield nuclear installations and I am concerned that the strictest possible measures should be in place there at all times. I assure the Deputy that there is regular high level contact with the UK authorities regarding security around Sellafield and I have recently written to the responsible Minister expressing Ireland's concerns in this regard. As the UK feels constrained for security reasons in what it can say, it does not take Irish authorities into its confidence in relation to security measures to the extent we would wish. The level of security information available to Irish authorities is one of the matters involved in the current legal action under the United Nations Law of the Sea Convention (UNCLOS). While we recognise and respect legitimate security concerns, there is greater scope for higher quality exchanges.</P>

      <Quest>the position of Ireland in the index of countries based on hydro-criteria announced at the World Water Council at Marseilles, France, in terms of efficiency of use; and the way in which Ireland needs to become more efficient.</Quest>

      <P>The water poverty index published in December 2002 by the World Water Council grades 147 countries by reference to five separate water-related criteria to illustrate where the best and worst water situations exist. The five measurements are resources, access, capacity, use and environmental impact. The composite water poverty index places Ireland in overall eighth position in the league of water-rich countries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Ireland is placed second in relation to &ldquo;capacity&rdquo;, which reflects a country's level of ability to purchase, manage and lobby for improved water, education and health. We are placed sixteenth in relation to &ldquo;environmental impact&rdquo;, which reflects ecological sustainability and takes into account issues such as water quality, environmental strategies and regulation and numbers of endangered species. Ireland is 22nd in relation to &ldquo;access&rdquo;, which reflects a country's ability to access water for drinking, industry and agricultural use, 46th in relation to &ldquo;resources&rdquo;, which reflects the <i>per capita</i> volume of surface and groundwater resources that can be drawn upon and 66th position in relation to &ldquo;use of water&rdquo;, which is stated to reflect how efficiently a country uses water for domestic, agricultural and industrial purposes. The last-mentioned measure, relating to use, appears to reflect the economic efficiency of water use <Col N="251" /> which is the amount of water used in comparison with the income generated by that use. The data available to my Department does not indicate breakdown of economic efficiency by sector, however, as water resources are abundant here, such a measure of economic efficiency has less significance than, for example, environmental sustainability.</P>
    <P>The United Nations world water development report Water for People Water for Life was published in Paris on 5 March 2003 and was accompanied by two tables ranking countries according to water availability per person per year, in which Ireland is ranked 57th out of 180 countries, and water quality indicator values, in which Ireland is ranked 17th out of 122 countries. An economic analysis of water use will be carried out and completed by end 2004 in the context of the implementation of the Water Framework Directive. The economic analysis will inform the further development of water policy generally and will support the application of the &ldquo;polluter pays&rdquo; principle in water services provision.</P>

      <Quest>if he will report on progress to designate natural heritage areas and special areas of conservation.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment and Local Government (Mr. Cullen)</NameTxt>
      <P>The EU's Habitats Directive (92/43/EEC) requires member states to protect wildlife areas and important ecological habitats of European interest. The directive was transposed by the European Communities (Natural Habitats) Regulations 1997 which enables the designation and consequent legal protection of the most important areas as special areas of conservation, SACs. The Wildlife (Amendment) Act 2000 provides a mechanism for formally designating important ecological areas of national significance as natural heritage areas.</P>
      <P>Under the habitats directive, 364 candidate special areas of conservation, SACs, have been publicly notified and formally transmitted by Ireland to the European Commission. These sites are listed in Table 1. In December 2002 an additional 24 SAC sites were proposed in respect of their raised bog habitat; these sites are listed in Table 2. Raised bogs constitute a rare habitat in Europe and one that is becoming increasingly scarce and under threat in Ireland.</P>
      <P>Protective mechanisms in respect of SAC sites are effective from date of initial notification of these sites. The legal provisions are set out in the European Communities (Natural Habitats) Regulations 1997 as amended by section 75 of the Wildlife (Amendment) Act 2000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In addition, the EU Commission is now seeking to finalise a candidate list of special areas of <Col N="252" /> conservation, except for offshore sites, for the Atlantic region of Europe, in 2003. Preparations are well advanced to complete Ireland's list of candidate SACs, following the evaluation of the existing list, along with those of other member states in the Atlantic region, at a meeting in The Hague in June 2002. I intend to publish further proposals in this regard during 2003. There will be a particular focus on rivers to support the conservation of salmon and other aquatic species. Under the terms of the habitats directive, formal designation of special areas of conservation must take place as soon as possible after the adoption of the list at European level, and within six years at most.</P>
    <P>There is no set timetable for designation of natural heritage areas, NHAs, under the Wildlife (Amendment) Act 2000. In March 2002, my Department publicly advertised and notified known landowners of intention to designate seven sites in respect of their wild bird interest; these sites are listed in Table 3. In December 2002 an additional 75 natural heritage areas were publicly advertised and known landowners notified, in respect of their raised bog habitat; these sites are listed in Table 4. It is planned that designation of other NHAs meeting appropriate scientific criteria as sites of ecological or geological interest, or both, will take place in the course of the next year or two.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment and Local Government (Mr. Cullen)</NameTxt>
      <P>The 1998 EU Drinking Water Directive (98/83/EC) reduces the parametric value for lead from 50 micrograms per litre under the previous directive to ten micrograms per litre. A 15 year timeframe to the end of 2013 is specified for achieving compliance with the new standard with an interim value of 25 micrograms per litre to be achieved by the end of 2003. Compliance with the interim standard is generally achievable through appropriate treatment at water treatment plants. Limited sampling of houses in Dublin, known to have lead services, indicates that up to 80% may already be in compliance with the 2013 standard. More comprehensive data will become available under the drinking water national monitoring programme now being developed by my Department.</P>
      <P>Full assessment of any actions required to meet the new lead standard, and the associated cost, must await determination of a recommended sampling method for lead. Proposals in this regard are awaited from the EU Commission. I am not aware of any specific EU proposals in regard to the replacement of lead services.</P>

      <P>Tuam main drainage scheme, stage 2-Ballygaddy Road, was approved for funding under my Department's serviced land initiative in 1998 at an estimated cost of &euro;1.15 million. However, the approved proposals were subsequently modified by Galway County Council in favour of a larger and more expensive scheme. The revised proposals are being examined in my Department in light of additional information received from the council last month.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment and Local Government (Mr. Cullen)</NameTxt>
      <P>My Department issued extensive design guidelines for the provision of social housing in September 1999 which set out recommendations for target floor areas and minimum room sizes. These were subsequently increased having regard to amendments of building regulations (Part M) coming into force in January 2001. Local authorities were advised of these increased recommended minimum room sizes in May 2002.</P>
      <P>Space requirements and room sizes are primarily determined by the proposed uses of individual rooms and spaces. Accommodation should allow for free circulation within each area, while accommodating appropriate furniture and equipment. The following table sets out the recommended space provision and room sizes for a range of typical dwellings having regard to the number of persons in a household. Minimum floor areas are specified in terms of the area of the main livingroom, the aggregate area of all shared living spaces including kitchens, and the aggregate area of bedrooms. It is recommended that the area of a single bedroom should be at least 6.5m² and that of a double bedroom at least 10.2 m².</P>

      <P>The Electoral (Amendment) Act 1996, provides that local authorities, in making polling schemes, shall endeavour to appoint polling places where at least one polling station is accessible to wheelchair users. The Act also requires that the returning officer shall, where practicable, provide polling stations which are accessible to wheelchair users. The returning officer must, in addition, where practicable, give public notice of all polling stations which are inaccessible to wheelchair users not later than eight days before polling day. If an elector has difficulty gaining access to his or her polling station, he or she may apply in writing for authorisation to vote at another polling station in the same constituency.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="268" />If a person has a physical disability or illness which prevents him or her from going to the polling station, the person can vote by post if he or she applies to be included in the postal voters list which is drawn up each year as part of the register of electors. In order to be entered on the postal voters list a disabled person must apply to the appropriate registration authority by 25 November each year. Under the Electoral Act, 1992, the selection of buildings to be used as polling stations at an election or referendum is a matter for the returning officer. Costs incurred in relation to the holding of an election or referendum are recouped through the Department of Finance from the central fund.</P>

      <P>The national develop<Col N="269" /> ment plan provides for expenditure of &euro;4.9 billion over the period 2000-2006 on water services infrastructure, the bulk of which will be incurred on the treatment of waste water. This is approximately three times the total comparable spend during the 1994-1999 period. Exchequer expenditure this year is expected to exceed &euro;470 million.</P>
      <P>My Department's current Water Services Investment Programme 2002-2004 is the second phase of a rolling three-year strategy that will be advanced progressively up to the end of the NDP in 2006. Funding for waste water infrastructure under the programme is focused on meeting the requirements of the urban waste water treatment directive. A number of significant waste water schemes have already been substantially completed under the programme in locations such as Drogheda, Dundalk, Leixlip, Osbertstown and Loughrea. The increase in waste water treatment capacity produced in 2000 and 2001 alone was sufficient to meet the requirements of a population equivalent, PE, of 448,000 persons, greater than the entire increase of 394,000 PE during the full period of the previous national development plan 1994-1999.</P>
      <P>The provision of new waste water treatment facilities is now well advanced in locations such as Dublin, Cork, Limerick, Waterford, Wexford and Galway. The programme now incorporates all the remaining waste water schemes for specific agglomerations requiring secondary treatment or better under the urban waste water treatment directive.</P>
      <P>The waste water schemes included in the Water Services Investment Programme 2002-2004, which is available in the Oireachtas Library, were drawn mainly from the assessments of needs produced by local authorities in response to my Department's request to all authorities to prepare and submit prioritised proposals for dealing with their capital water services requirements. The assessments have helped to quantify the amount of investment needed to augment existing schemes and to provide new facilities.</P>

      <P>The national development plan, which included housing for the first time, is ensuring that the housing needs of an expanding and changing population are met in a comprehensive fashion. There have been record levels of overall housing supply in recent years, with 57,695 completions in 2002 up almost 10% on 2001 levels. There has also been significant progress made in delivering the social and affordable housing targets under the NDP. It is estimated that more than 12,600 units of social and affordable housing were provided in 2002, a 45% increase on the 2000 figure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There has been a good response from local authorities and voluntary housing associations in increasing housing activity under relevant programmes, including those targeted at low income groups and those with social housing needs and special housing needs, such as the elderly, disabled and homeless persons and Travellers. The National Development Plan 2000 to 2006 sets targets at a national level for most of these programmes and they are generally progressing well. <Col N="271" /> As targets are already in place, together with processes for the allocation of resources and the monitoring of activity under these programmes, I do not consider that my Department needs to issue individual directives on these matters to local authorities.</P>
    <P>Furthermore, local authorities have particular responsibilities in the development of housing strategies under Part V of the Planning and Development Act. These strategies assess housing need, including social and affordable housing, in the particular local authority area, and set out measures to address these needs. I am confident the amendments made to Part V of the Planning and Development Act 2000, which are contained in the Planning and Development (Amendment) Act 2002, will contribute to the increase in the overall supply in the housing market and, in particular, to ensuring a continued good supply of social and affordable housing.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 316 and 317 together.</P>
      <P>The national development plan provides &euro;4.9 billion for investment in water services infrastructure up to the end of 2006, approximately three times the amount expended during the 1994-1999 period. Expenditure by my Department on water services will exceed &euro;470 million this year. Substantial increases in water treatment and storage capacity are being achieved as a result of this increased investment. Schemes completed since 1997 have produced additional drinking water treatment capacity equivalent to the needs of a population of 586,000. The increase in water production capacity in 2000 and 2001 alone was sufficient to meet the requirements of a population of 378,000 people and was equal to 45% of the corresponding figure for the entire period of the previous National Development Plan 1994-1999. The increase in storage capacity produced during 2000 and 2001 was sufficient to meet the requirements of a population of 437,000, representing 50% of the corresponding output in the 1994-99 period.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="272" />Details of currently approved proposals for major new and upgraded water supply schemes are set out in my Department's Water Services Investment Programme 2002 -2004, which is also available in the Oireachtas Library. A significant number of new water supply schemes are included among the 129 schemes worth &euro;726 million introduced to the programme for the first time when it was published in April 2002. The schemes contained in the programme are drawn mainly from the results of local authority assessments, which have helped to inform the overall strategy for meeting additional capacity requirements.</P>
    <P>Earlier this year I announced a record allocation for 2002 of &euro;100 million for rural water services. The main focus of this allocation programme is on the provision of water treatment facilities in privately sourced group water schemes serving some 5% of households nationally. Overall I am satisfied that the resources being put in place will ensure that we continue to meet all demands for water services.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment and Local Government (Mr. Cullen)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Question Nos. 318 and 319 together.</P>
      <P>The current national development plan, NDP, provides for a total investment of approximately &euro;30 billion in the development of economic and social infrastructure over the period 2000-2006. Of the total planned investment, approximately &euro;17.5 billion is for programmes coming within the remit of my Department, including housing, water and waste water, non-national roads, waste management, urban and village development, habitat protection and conservation, and heritage conservation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Focusing on the principal measures, progress on housing, water and non-national roads has been satisfactory. Funding for housing has to date exceeded the projected figures set out in the NDP. A total of &euro;1.6 billion was spent under the five housing measures in 2002, exceeding the NDP forecast by &euro;122 million or +9%. Housing output has generally increased for 2002 in comparison with 2001, although it has not been poss<Col N="273" /> ible to achieve the end-of-year NDP targets in all cases. However, the Government has been responding actively to the increased level of social housing demand need by expanding social and affordable housing output very significantly. Last year saw the delivery of the highest level of output under the range of social housing measures for more than 15 years.</P>
    <P>As to NDP investment on water and sewerage schemes, the position at the end of 2002 was that &euro;1.509 billion had been spent over the first three years of the NDP, slightly ahead of the projected spend of &euro;1.485 billion. The primary focus to date has been on large infrastructural projects required to meet EU and national water and wastewater treatment standards. As a result of the advancement of these large projects, which are producing very substantial increases in water and wastewater treatment capacity in the early part of the NDP, the overall number of schemes to be completed at the mid-term stage is down on that projected. However, the Water Services Investment Programme 2002-2004 contains more than 600 individual water and sewerage schemes at various stages of development, which will be progressed over the NDP period. I am satisfied with the level of progress being made and that the overall objectives will be achieved.</P>
    <P>With regard to the rural water programme, the bulk of resources is directed towards the improvement of drinking water quality. While expenditure to end 2002, at 79% of forecast, is behind forecast, it is anticipated that expenditure will be ahead of forecast for the period post 2003. The prime indicator for this measure is the number of rural households with an improved water supply. To end 2002, 145,000 households have benefited in this regard. This figure represents 55% of the final 2006 target.</P>
    <P>Cumulative expenditure on non-national roads to the end of 2002 amounted to &euro;1186.6 million, which represents 114% of the estimates set out in the NDP in 2000. An Evaluation of Investment in the Road Network, August 2002, carried out independently by Fitzpatrick Associates, economic consultants, confirms that good progress has been made under this measure. This report is available in the Oireachtas Library.</P>
    <P>Due to delays experienced in finalising the waste management planning process, the waste infrastructure capital grants scheme was launched in March 2002. The scheme provides financial assistance to both public and private sectors for the provision of waste recycling and recovery infrastructure. On 7 November 2002, I announced the first round of grant allocations to local authorities totalling &euro;14.3 million towards the provision of waste infrastructure. These grants will support the development of bring banks, civic amenity sites, composting facilities and the expansion of existing material recovery facilities, which will facilitate increased collection and <Col N="274" /> recovery of recyclable materials in the years ahead. I intend to announce further tranches of allocations shortly to assist local authorities in operating recycling and recovery facilities. I am satisfied that rapid progress will be made in realising the NDP investment targets for waste management over the coming years.</P>
    <P>Under the urban and village renewal measure of the NDP, good progress has been made so far as a total of 188 projects have been completed. Expenditure amounted to &euro;28.4 million to the end of 2002, representing approximately 49% of the expenditure profiled for this measure to the end of 2002. This programme was not launched until 2001, and experience would suggest that there is a long lead-in time before such programmes gather momentum.</P>
    <P>With regard to the habitat protection and conservation and heritage conservation measures, expenditure to end 2002 amounted to &euro;38.23 million, of which &euro;6.98 million has been spent on habitat protection and conservation and &euro;31.25 million on built heritage conservation. The latter provision represents nearly 50% of the initial NDP allocation, while the former represents just over 16%, reflecting slower than expected progress on certain visitor centre facilities. These measures are now under review with a view to optimising their impact over the remainder of the NDP period.</P>
    <P>I look forward to the outcome of the mid-term review of the NDP, which is expected in the latter part of 2003 and will provide an independent analysis of progress and make appropriate recommendations for programme adjustments, where necessary.</P>

      <P>At national level, Homelessness, An Integrated Strategy and the homeless preventative strategy acknowledge that the causes of homelessness are complex, including social, behavioural and health problems, and that they extend beyond accommodation issues alone. The integrated strategy is providing an integrated and co-ordinated response to all of these problems. A wide range of Departments and agencies at national level and local authorities, health boards and voluntary bodies at local level are actively involved in tackling homelessness. The preventative strategy addresses the needs of people leaving institutional care, whether custodial or health related, and young people leaving care to ensure that they do not become homeless. In Dublin, the homeless agency has developed a number of initiatives to target specific groups of people such as street drinkers and drug users.</P>
      <P>According to Counted In 2002, the joint ESRI-Homeless Agency study on the number of homeless people in Dublin, there were 2,920 homeless adults &ndash; 2,560 households &ndash; in the Dublin area in March 2002 compared to 2,900 &ndash; 2,690 households &ndash; in March 1999. This figure includes people in a range of homeless accommodation, including bed and breakfast and hostel accommodation, as well as people who reported that they were sleeping rough.</P>

      <P>The assessment of local authority housing need was undertaken by all local authorities in March 2002. As part of this assessment a further separate assessment of the total number of homeless people, whether seeking local authority housing or not, was also carried out by local authorities in co-operation with the voluntary housing organisations. These figures are currently being finalised and will be published shortly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As part of the homeless strategy, local homeless fora have been established in every city and county to oversee the provision of all homeless <Col N="276" /> services to homeless people and to draw up three year local action plans to tackle homelessness. Most of these plans have now been completed and work is well under way on implementing the measures in them. As part of the plans, a range of new accommodation and related services, ranging from emergency accommodation to long-term sheltered accommodation, as well as settlement and outreach services have been developed and funded. At national level, the cross-departmental team on homelessness is monitoring the activity of the homeless fora and progress in the implementation of the action plans.</P>

      <P>Information on average prices paid for new and second-hand properties both nationally and in selected areas are set out in my Department's Housing Statistics Bulletin, copies of which are available in the Oireachtas Library. Data are not provided to my Department on house prices to the greater Dublin area. In September 2002, the average price paid for a new and second-hand house in Dublin city and counties was &euro;266,742 and &euro;300,599 respectively.</P>
      <P>Indicative data available to the Department shows that on average, a first time buyer paid 11.5% less than the average price for a new house in Dublin and 22% less than the average price for a second hand house in Dublin. Therefore it is estimated that in September 2002, first time buyers paid on average approximately &euro;235,000 and &euro;236,000 for a new and second-hand house in Dublin.</P>

The Environmental Protection Agency Act 1992 (Ambient Air Quality Assessment and Management) Regulations 1999 designate the agency as the competent body for assessing ambient air quality in Ireland including responsibility for ensuring the accuracy of measuring devices, in particular by internal quality controls carried out in accordance with the requirements of European quality assurance standards and the analysis of assessment methods and co-ordination within Ireland of community-wide quality assurance programmes organised by the European Commission. In this context I understand that the agency participates in an expert group on quality assurance under the aegis of the Joint Research Centre, the Commission's scientific body. My Department has no role in assessing the accuracy of recordings by individual air quality monitors.</P>

      <P>The rural-agri-tourism advisory group was established in February 2003 and its functions include: To identify and consider opportunities for the development of the rural/agri-tourism sector and related employment activity; to enable the bringing forward of coherent guidelines on the expenditure by Leader groups on the rural/agri-tourism measure; and to provide guidance on consistency of practice within Leader groups in relation to rural/agri-tourism issues. Membership of the group includes the farming organisations, rural organisations, the Department of Arts, Sport and Tourism, the Irish Sports Council and tourism promotion groups. Membership reflects the views of recreational users of the countryside through the National Waymarked Ways Advisory Committee which represents the Irish Sports Council.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the question of outdoor recreation, the advisory group is currently focusing on the situation in relation to the waymarked ways. I addressed the inaugural meeting of the rural-agri-tourism advisory group and made clear my desire for a community-based solution to the issue of access to walkways. Following the inaug<Col N="278" /> ural meeting officials from my Department are to meet with interested parties and draw up a discussion document on the issue of access to such walks in advance of the next meeting of the group. The various groups who have signalled an interest in the issue, including bodies representing recreational users of the countryside, will be invited to participate in the process.</P>
    <P>Against this background, I am not convinced that it would be desirable at this juncture to extend the remit of the group to cover all aspects of access to the countryside. However, my Department will keep the matter under review and will consider the matter further when the issues in relation to waymarked ways have been resolved.</P>

      <P>The back to education allowance scheme is a second chance educational scheme designed to assist unemployed people and other disadvantaged groups who are being held back in their search for employment by a lack of qualifications.</P>
      <P>A review of the basic purpose underlying my Department's back to education provisions was carried out recently. In light of this, and in the light of the expenditure constraints facing us this year, the scheme has been revised. In framing proposals to change elements of the BTEA scheme I was conscious of the need to ensure that payments were focused on those who most need training or qualifications in order to gain a foothold in the labour market. In line with this aim payments under the scheme for the summer period have been discontinued, as people who had been previously unemployed often find work opportunities either at home or abroad during the summer months.</P>
      <P>Of course, participants in the scheme who fail to find employment during the summer may be entitled to an unemployment payment, subject to satisfying the usual qualifying conditions.</P>
      <P>Regarding changes in the scheme as it relates to post graduates I am satisfied that people in possession of a third level qualification have already achieved a good level of academic attainment, which should impact positively on their employment prospects. In a time of financial constraint I want to ensure that supports are directed to those with most pressing needs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="282" />However, I have recently instructed my officials to liaise with the relevant bodies to identify specific post-graduate courses, such as the higher diploma in education which add significantly to a person's employability and to which the back to education allowance should continue to apply. I expect these courses to be identified in the near future.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that the new arrangements will ensure that the back to education scheme continues to provide support to those people who are most in need of assistance in accessing the labour market.</P>

      <P>The person concerned was refused a carer's allowance on the grounds that full-time care and attention was not required in this case. This decision was subsequently appealed and an <Col N="284" /> oral appeal hearing was heard on 13 January 2003. The appeals officer upheld the decision and disallowed the appeal. Notification issued to this effect to the person concerned on 28 January 2003.</P>
      <P>Further correspondence regarding the case was subsequently forwarded to the appeals officer. The appeals officer did not consider that there was any fresh facts or evidence which would warrant a review of his decision. The person concerned was notified accordingly on 6 March 2003.</P>
      <P>Under social welfare legislation decisions in relation to claims must be made by deciding officers and appeals officers. These officers are statutorily appointed and I have no role in regard to making such decisions.</P>
