      <P>As this is the last appearance the Taoiseach will make in the House this week, I would invite him to clear up the confusion for thousands of commuters as a result of Iarnród Éireann's decision to close stations at weekends until mid-2004. The Minister for Transport, who is not here, said he was only informed of this decision on Monday night. A spokesman for Iarnród Éireann confirmed this morning that the Minister's Department and office were briefed on a continuous basis about the plans for closure of lines and works to be carried out.</P>
      <P>How can the Taoiseach, as leader of the Government, stand over a position where paying customers &ndash; up to 100,000 per week &ndash; are treated in this disdainful and contemptuous fashion by a major State agency? This morning customers on every DART line were circulated with a full colour glossy brochure, the first information given to customers by the company. How can the Taoiseach stand over this? Is this proper treatment of fare-paying customers?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2" />Was the Minister, Deputy Brennan, excluded, like others, from relevant and vital information about the plans of this company? Will the Taoiseach confirm whether the Government has made a formal request, through the Minister for Transport, to put these works off until after Christmas when lines will not be so busy? The retail sector and customer are being put last by this company.</P>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>As Deputy Kenny has asked me to try to clear up some of these matters, I will. At the outset, I will repeat briefly what I said yesterday. In the springtime the DART and commuter rail services stated that they were spending &euro;176 million on upgrading the facilities. There were four issues, including the operation of eight carriage DART and commuter trains, accessibility mobility for impaired customers and delivery of 40 new DART carriages. The idea was to achieve an increase in the peak passenger capacity of over 30%. I gave the figures on that yesterday, so there is no need to go over them again.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The work is due to commence on the southern section of the line this weekend and will continue until at least next June. Work will then com<Col N="3" /> mence on the northern line and it will take a similar period to complete. The work is scheduled to avoid affecting customers on busy weekdays when the maximum number uses the DART. Work will commence on Friday nights after the last DART and work will continue around the clock until early Monday morning &ndash; in other words, a week's work in one weekend, which is a reasonable plan. The most efficient and value for money option is to close a large chunk of the network at a time as the power has to be shut down to undertake work on the overhead lines.</P>
    <P>The question the Deputy asked me to clear up was when did the Minister for Transport get the information on this. I understand the DART company is issuing information to its staff this morning. I have also been told it put up signs over the last few days. It was on the evening of 6 October that the chairman of CIE and Irish Rail arranged to meet the Minister to brief him on the proposed works and to give the time schedule of the works. That is what is at issue. I can confirm that the Minister asked them to put off the work until after the Christmas period. At the Minister's request and after the meeting the other evening, the chairman of CIE looked at the arrangement in Irish Rail for the work on the DART upgrade and he has reported within the last hour that the DART works will be put on hold over the weekends in December &ndash; in the run up to Christmas &ndash; and that the work will pick up in the valley periods in the new year. I assume the work will start now but the work will not continue in December when it would be most inconvenient to customers and to businesses; they will try to catch up over the Christmas period.</P>
    <P>The work is to be welcomed. Quite frankly, the communications strategy could have been a bit better. They said in the springtime that they were going to do this work but, unfortunately, they did not tell the Government, the Department and, most importantly, the customers until the last few days.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny" hpid="Mr. Kenny Mr. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>This is an astonishing revelation by the Taoiseach that a major semi-State agency did not see fit to inform the Government or the Minister in charge of the Department of its plans to carry out these works in this fashion. This smacks of bad planning and inefficiency.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Yet this document circulated this morning took a degree of planning itself. It carries the logo of the NDP and the EU in respect of the fare-paying customers who are now to be treated in this fashion. It states clearly that work will be done every weekend from 11 October. Irrespective of the formal request made by the Minister on behalf of the Government that these works be put off until the new year, when they would cause less trouble for everybody, this company has effectively given a two-fingered gesture to the Government and the Minister. It treats the fare-paying customer with sheer contempt. It excludes the Minister for Transport, Deputy Brennan, from <Col N="4" /> vital information which the public should know in their interest.</P>
    <P>Despite the concession that the chairman of Iarnród Éireann has made following his meeting and briefing on 6 October, this begs the question as to who is in charge. Is the Government in charge of running the country? Is the Minister for Transport in charge of running his Department? Is Iarnród Éireann entitled to say to the Government that it will not take on board the Government's request in respect of the fare-paying customers? Will the Taoiseach instruct the Minister for Transport to call in the chairman of Iarnród Éireann again to instruct him of the Government's formal wish that these works be put off until the New Year when they will cause less disruption for the fare-paying customer who again is being put at the end of the queue?</P>
    <P>I find it contemptible that the first information that the public is given is handed out to them this morning as fare-paying customers on the DART line. It is not good enough.</P>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>If the resources were not there, this work would not take place. We all want to see the work done because for the fare-paying customer it will give a 30% increase in capacity. We welcome this work as it will take cars off the road and is good, overall, for public transport.</P>
      <P>Iarnród Éireann will argue that it made it clear it was going to get on with this work. The difficulty is that it did not tell the Department, the Government or, more importantly, its customers so that alternative arrangements could be made, particularly for those in business. It did not communicate the bus arrangements, though some work has been done and it has been stepped up in the last few days. There will be alternative arrangements. However, from a communications viewpoint, it was not best handled. The Government and the DART line customers want to see the work undertaken.</P>
      <P>They will start the work now, as they are scheduled to go. To change the schedule would probably create more difficulties than it is worth. However, in December there is huge use of the DART with Saturdays and Sundays seeing far higher volumes of traffic than at any other time of the year. CIE has, therefore, agreed to the Minister for Transport's suggestion that it will not do any work during the weekends prior to Christmas. This will be made up for in the slack times over the new year period. It will obviously lose a few weekends and the June deadline will go back due to this.</P>
      <P>From the communications viewpoint, there is a lesson to be learnt from this. However, we still want to see this work undertaken. It is a considerable investment in the DART line and will bring significant improvement to the service.</P>

    <Title>Leaders' Questions (Resumed).</Title>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>All parties in the House were happy to support the Residential Institutions Redress Act 2002 to enable awards to be made to claimants who suffered abuse in residential institutions. An entirely separate scheme between 18 religious congregations and the State was concluded without ever being debated in the House. This agreement involved the taxpayer underwriting the full liability of the religious congregations arising from court cases, even where complainants never went to the redress board. The Comptroller and Auditor General has estimated that the liability will be between &euro;869 million and &euro;1.04 billion.</P>
      <P>The Taoiseach told us that the then Attorney General and his officials were involved throughout the entire period. That was not true. The Taoiseach told us that all meetings were documented and on departmental files. That was not true. The Taoiseach told us that the indemnity was worked out in February. That was not true. The Taoiseach told us that the terms of the indemnity were fully and repeatedly debated in the House. That was not true. The Taoiseach told us that proper Cabinet procedures had been followed. That was not true.</P>
      <P>The truth was that the then Attorney General and his officials were excluded from the critical meetings. The truth was that no record was kept of those critical meetings. The truth was that the indemnity was not worked out in February. Negotiations did not start on it until 19 April, one day before the House was dissolved. No memorandum was put to Cabinet in January. It was approved on a verbal report from the then Minister for Education and Science. Where does the former Minister for Education and Science think he derived his legal capacity to bind the State into such an agreement?</P>
      <P>I want to draw the Taoiseach's attention to the public financial procedures from the Department of Finance. They state:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the absence of specific legislation covering the issue of a particular indemnity, any letter issued should indicate clearly that the assurance contained therein is not an unqualified <Col N="6" /> promise to pay but rather an undertaking by the Minister concerned to take the appropriate steps to seek the necessary authority of the Oireachtas to ensure payment.</P>
    <P>When did the Taoiseach get that necessary authority from the Oireachtas?</P>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad Deputy Rabbitte has acknowledged we all agree that we wanted to provide redress for the victims, because he has declined to do so before. On all the other questions and propositions he made, I disagree with the Deputy.</P>
      <P>There was proper consultation with the Cabinet throughout. Of the 16 meetings that took place, the then Attorney General personally attended 12. He was aware of two of the other meetings, but neither he nor his officials attended. He had not got full information and he made that point clear. At the other two meetings, the only two people who attended were the then Minister for Education and Science and the Secretary General of the Department. The reason was that the talks had broken down, the Laffoy commission wanted to get on with its work and the then Minister wanted to resolve the issue.</P>
      <P>Deputy Rabbitte is correct that I said it was resolved in February 2002. I should have said 31 January, which was the day before February. It was noted at the Government meeting that the then Minister for Education and Science had reached agreement with representatives of the religious orders on the contribution to be made by them to the compensation fund in respect of victims of abuse in institutions. That contribution was in cash and property to be valued at &euro;128 million. There would be property transfers, the date of the Taoiseach's apology in 1999 being reckoned for that purpose. That still is the position. On that same day, a statement was made to all and sundry that the Government had on that day agreed, in principle, to set proposals that the religious congregations contribute &euro;128 million to the scheme for people who suffered while in institutional care.</P>
      <P>The statement is already in the public domain, so there is no need for me to continue. It is dated 30 January 2002. That was the policy decision made by the entire Government. Then the details had to be worked out legally and finalised. That went on until June 2002, but did not change the substance of the original position. I contend that things were done properly in all aspects of this matter, the Department of Finance from an accountability viewpoint, the then Government and the then Attorney General's involvement, other than the period when he was unhappy that he was not getting sufficient details of the discussions, which is in the public domain in reports of last year and the Comptroller and Auditor General's report.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is the position. I reiterate there was an urgency on the then Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Woods, to conclude these issues since the work of the Laffoy commission was <Col N="7" /> being held up because we had not given agreement to go ahead with the other issues. That is contained in endless letters that have been put into the public domain. There was pressure on the Minister so that we could move forward to get agreement.</P>
    <P>The other substantive point is that if the religious had never contributed &euro;1, the Government was committed to a redress system. We would have gone ahead anyway. They are the facts.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>What is the answer to my one question: from where did the Minister and Government derive the legal authority? What is the answer to that question? The Taoiseach has rambled on and confused the issues. The Labour Party, like every other party in the House, supported the redress Act. I do not know what the Taoiseach muttered under his breath, but it will be on the record as him implying that this party did not. Every party in the House supported the redress Act. There is no point in the Taoiseach twisting what I said about February. As he admitted, he is the one who said the terms of the indemnity were worked out in February. They did not start to be negotiated until 19 April and what was reported&mdash;</P>

      <P>Perhaps it is also a school in which the plans for their extension have been frozen, permanently it seems, by the Department of Education and Science. It may also be a substandard school, of which there are many around the country. It may also be a school in which the overcrowded classrooms make it very difficult to get through the day or it may be a school in which the teacher does not have the qualifications required for the job.</P>
      <P>On top of all that, is the Taoiseach aware that the ESRI is not pulling any punches in its budget prospectus of 2004, when it says that Irish children at pre-school or primary school &ndash; and these are its words &ndash; get a level of funding that is very low by European standards? I know the Taoiseach has a briefing that tells us that he has doubled spending on primary level in the past decade, but the reality is that we still invest far less than many EU states and as a country we still have a very young age profile. When will the Taoiseach address his Government's failures which have clearly been set out by the ESRI? It stated that the identification of best practice in countering disadvantage in the Irish context has been hindered by the lack of systematic evaluation of the effectiveness of existing measures. In other words, we do not have a co-ordinated coherent, competent Government. It is all over the shop when it comes to education and children are suffering for it. It is a damning assessment of the Taoiseach's platitudes on disadvantage. It is a strange and classic contrast that he is able to arrange cosy chats with the head of Shell Oil&mdash;</P>

      <P>On the OECD indicators for this year, Ireland ranked fifth of the 32 OECD countries in reading literacy in primary schools, we ranked ninth in overall literacy and 15th out of 27 in mathematical literacy. In disadvantaged education we have now targeted provision and this year there are resource teachers in almost 2,300 schools. We now have 3,500 more teachers at primary level &ndash; we will leave out post-primary because Deputy Sargent did not raise that; we now have a pupil-teacher ratio at primary level that is down to 19:1, a historic figure which helps children in disadvantaged areas.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, I am. It is an enormous achievement, as is the fact that we are spending about &euro;300 million a year improving our schools. When I came into Government there were four contracts for education in the whole country, now there are several hundred. A large number of new schools opened last September. We now have proper resource teachers, and teachers dealing with disadvantage. We have more walking principals and school liaison principals. Things have improved dramatically since Deputy Sargent was in a classroom and he should acknowledge that. They are the facts. We will continue to do this.</P>

      <P>I expected the Taoiseach would paint a picture of expenditure without referring <Col N="12" /> to the essential criticism made by the ESRI which is that it is money that has not been well spent. The expenditure was not co-ordinated and it has not produced the results that it ought to have produced. That is an issue the Taoiseach will make more difficult because I ask him whether he is going to proceed with the estimated 1,000 cuts in education as part of 5,000 job cuts in the public service. Based on the ESRI report, is that his intention and, if so, how does he expect to address the damning figures of 90,000 children living in consistent poverty and the increase in relative poverty from 15% in 1994 to the present level of 22% as outlined by the Combat Poverty Agency? Does the Taoiseach accept that if he goes ahead with these cuts &ndash; 1,000 in education &ndash; politically he will be a dead man walking going into the next election? Nearly ten years after the UN Year of the Family and with the advent of the Irish Presidency of the European Union, is he prepared to see education further disadvantaged in real terms?</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 1 to 6, inclusive, together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government has no proposals at present for the conduct of a referendum to change the Constitution. The position will be held under review in the light of developments, in particular, the outcome of the examination of property rights issues by the All-Party Oireachtas Commit<Col N="14" /> tee on the Constitution; the outcome of the study being conducted by the Sub-committee on Seanad Reform and the outcome of the Inter-Governmental Conference on the Draft Constitutional Treaty which commenced in Rome on 4 October.</P>
    <P>Although at this stage it is difficult to judge when the Intergovernmental Conference will conclude, it is likely that work will continue into the Irish Presidency next year and be concluded during the Irish term of office but this is not yet clear.</P>
    <P>The Government has acted on most of the key recommendations which have emanated from the All-Party Committee on the Constitution. In all, the previous Government brought forward nine referenda. The Government will avail of appropriate opportunities to take forward further recommendations of the All-Party Committee on the Constitution.</P>
    <P>The complexities involved in holding a referendum require that careful consideration be given to the frequency with which referenda can realistically be held and the significance of the issues in question.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny" hpid="Mr. Kenny Mr. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>Assuming that the work of the Inter-Governmental Conference is finished during the Irish Presidency which begins on 1 January 2004, what is the timescale envisaged for a referendum to give effect to that? Will the Taoiseach confirm that such a referendum is necessary?</P>
      <P>In view of the continuing difficulties experienced by young couples in the matter of rising house prices, does the Taoiseach consider that the Oireachtas committee should expedite its work on the issue of property rights and possibly report to the House within six months?</P>
      <P>Arising from the Sheedy affair a number of years ago, the Taoiseach will recall that he published proposals for a constitutional referendum to provide for judicial accountability. What is the status of that proposal?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I reiterate to the House that I do not know when the Intergovernmental Conference will finish. It depends on how many issues arise during the discussions. There is normally a two year period after the signing to allow every country to ratify the treaty.</P>
      <P>I am informed by the Minister that the NESC report which is a major study of the property and housing issue is expected to be completed by Christmas. It is hoped that the all-party committee report will be available in January. That is a little quicker than I thought it would be. The Minister has informed me that is the factual position and that will help matters. We will then have to examine the recommendations of both reports. NESC has looked at the last 30 years and undertaken a nationwide examination of land use. The All-Party Committee on the Constitution has done a good job over the summer and it has listened to the opinions of many groups.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="15" />On the other issue, the Deputy will recall that we have not been able to reach agreement. The judicial oversight was not passed in the Dáil but it remains there. If it was the will of the parties in the House to revisit this matter I would agree to that proposal.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny" hpid="Mr. Kenny Mr. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>I note that the Leader of the Seanad, Senator O'Rourke, is anxious to attend Cabinet meetings again. Now that the Seanad reform committee has received submissions, does the Taoiseach consider that it might be appropriate at a future date to have a referendum on a proposal to reform the composition and functions of the Upper House? Whether the Leader of the Seanad will be in a position to avail of the outcome of any deliberations is, I suppose, a matter of timing. Depending on its recommendations, is the Taoiseach considering holding a referendum on the more effective reform of the Seanad ?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot be sure but from an examination of the papers and some of the issues that have been debated, such as the change in the composition of membership as it affects Northern Ireland, I think it probably will be necessary. There seems to be agreement on a number of issues even though I am sure there will be plenty of disagreements. All parties, including the Deputy's party, seem to be in agreement on the extension of the size of Seanad membership to allow for Northern representation on a more permanent basis and to put it on a proper footing. I am fairly certain that to increase the membership of Seanad Éireann to over 60 would require a constitutional referendum. There are also some issues about its structure. There seems to be agreement that the university representation will have to change. It ultimately will require a constitutional referendum.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach referred to a NESC report being with him at Christmas and to the constitutional committee having its recommendations on the capping of the price of land with him by Christmas. Has the Government any view on the issue? The question is to the Taoiseach about his Government. Does the Government have any view on whether a referendum is necessary and desirable to cap the price of building land? Did the Taoiseach hear Deputy Gilmore's introduction of the Labour Party Bill in the House last night where he pointed out that the average price of a house in Dublin when the Taoiseach took office was &euro;97,00? It is now &euro;297,000. Did he hear Deputy Gilmore mention the report from the Casey bulletin which, having surveyed land in Fingal, found that the price of a site just immediate to the boom made up 10% to 15% of the cost of the house, but that it is now between 40% and 50%?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>I am asking the Taoiseach if he is aware of these matters, given that he might not have heard Deputy Gilmore explain them to the House last night. I proceeded by way of question and I am perfectly in order. Does the Government have any view other than what the committee might report? Can the Taoiseach think of any other instance where the Government has made policy based on what a committee of the House recommended? This is the Taoiseach's seventh year in power. Has he asked the Attorney General at any stage for his advice on whether a constitutional referendum is necessary to intervene in the common good to cap the price of land?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I have done all the things Deputy Rabbitte said. I did not get a full report of what Deputy Gilmore said, but I heard some of his comments. I accept many of the points he made. I subscribe to his efforts, although I understand the Bill has many flaws. I asked the All-Party Committee on the Constitution to examine all aspects of this issue. I also asked NESC to undertake a study and to examine in particular the issue of land use and capping. The Attorney General has undertaken an amount of work in this area. He has a lot of expertise in this area as a result of his previous work. I am sure Deputy Rabbitte knows that a number of lobby groups are against this. Their advice and the advice I have been given is that we would be unlikely to get away with such a move because a Bill would be quickly challenged. I do not believe we would get away with it.</P>
      <P>Part V of the Planning Act and the constitutionality protection it provides would allow us to do certain things. However, it is unlikely that we will be able to cap development and agricultural land. We will see what the constitutional review group recommends. The advice I have is that it would be difficult to do this in legislation alone and that it would almost certainly be challenged. That was made clear by a number of organisations recently, including the farm organisations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy is right about the price of land. However, as regards supply, we were only building 25,000 houses in the period the Deputy mentioned, but we are now building 62,000. We have managed to get the supply side of housing nearly right. It is a matter for argument in the industry as to whether supply and demand will go one way or the other over the next year or two; it depends on to whom one speaks. I am sure Deputy Rabbitte has spoken to as many people as I have. We have moved it from historically high figures to figures that were not conceived. Back in the mid-1990s people believed we could build 35,000 <Col N="17" /> houses a year, but we have brought that figure to 62,000, which is an enormous achievement by the Government.</P>

      <P>I know the Taoiseach loves swapping gossip on this question and he is good at it. Did he seek advice from the Attorney General and does he have advice to the effect that a constitutional referendum is necessary? He said the farming organisations and others recommended it. However, what is the Government's view? Is it contemporary best legal advice that the Government should introduce a law in this House, like Deputy Gilmore sought to do last night, and that its constitutionality be tested? Seven years have passed and during that time the spiral in house prices has continued. When the Taoiseach says he subscribes to Deputy Gilmore's effort, what does he mean? Deputy Gilm<Col N="18" /> ore's effort was to cap the price of building land.

It is almost three and a half decades ago since much of the work was done on that report.

      <P>Before the summer recess the Taoiseach pledged to the House that he would take personal ownership of the project to secure representation in the Dáil Chamber for people in the Six Counties. During the intervening period, what steps has he taken to implement the commitment he gave in the House and further afield? For some considerable time there has been a continual effort to ensure real and effective accommodation of the right of people north of the Border to participate in appropriate debate within this Chamber. Where stands the project of which the Taoiseach has taken personal ownership? Does he agree that it would be appropriate at this time for the various leaders of the political groupings in this House to meet, at his invitation, to consider the actual steps to be taken to give effect to this recommendation of the All-Party Committee on the Constitution, which has been warmly embraced by all representative voices here?</P>
      <P>I listened carefully to the Taoiseach's responses earlier on the review of the Seanad. Will he not recognise that this is not about token representation but about participation, not only for people north of the Border in terms of access to the Seanad but for the electorate.</P>

Does the Taoiseach not agree with the recommendation of the All-Party Committee on the Constitution that election to the Seanad should be by common franchise for all the people?

      <P>There are two parts to the Deputy's question, dealing with the overall question of Seanad reform and the proposals that have already been made for reform, but I do not think the answers to either of them will give the Deputy what he requires. We must consider the report of the committee on Seanad reform and see what the parties of the House want to contribute. We cannot ignore the views of those who have made up and worked in the Seanad through the generations. As I already replied to Deputy Kenny, we will require a constitutional referendum to provide for Seanad reform. I have also stated that we should build into the Seanad representation from the North in increasing numbers. I have already given my views, as has my political party, to the committee which sat over the summer in full session.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy asked whether I would try to finalise arrangements for representation from the North. Since the signing of the Good Friday Agreement and the establishment of the North-South Ministerial Council and the all-Ireland Implementation Bodies, it was agreed by all parties in the last Dáil to arrange for representation on a more formal basis. Arrangements should be put in place to allow representatives to contribute appropriately to debates in the Oireachtas on Northern Ireland and the Good Friday Agreement. I am in total favour of that and the Whips are ready to do it, but we have a slight difficulty at the moment in that we do not have any North-<Col N="21" /> South ministerial bodies because we cannot obtain the necessary trust and confidence to set up the institutions again. If we could do that, perhaps I could get on with the rest of it. If Deputy Ó Caoláin could help me with the latter, I could help him with the former.</P>

      <P>There are a number of questions arising from the issue of amendments to the Constitution. There has been considerable questioning of the provision in the Constitution under which Members of the Oireachtas can claim immunity from prosecution when travelling to or from this House. Does the Taoiseach feel the time has come to remove that provision? According to many commentators, it does not seem to have any basis in modern Ireland, whatever its origins at the time of publication of the Constitution.</P>
      <P>On the subject of addressing the democratic deficit, is the Taoiseach aware of the facility that exists in other countries to nominate the President, for example, based on the collection of a number of signatures? In the USA it is called a recall initiative. Due to the election of Governor Schwarzenegger, it has been in the news.

It was envisaged that it could operate in committees of the House or in a session of the House itself when Northern matters were being discussed. It was not envisaged as applying to general debates.</P>
      <P>The other provision formed part of the Seanad reform proposals whereby instead of appointing members of both Northern communities to the Seanad, as has continued for 30 years, the number of Senators would be increased to allow for representation from Northern Ireland. It was not agreed how that would be done but we were to work out a basis whereby at least four or five Members of the Seanad would be from the North. That was not agreed but the concept was certainly there. That has now become part of the Seanad reform discussions but no agreement has yet been reached on it.</P>
      <P>During the last Dáil, agreement was reached by the Whips on the first proposal but I do not see how we can do it unless the North-South Ministerial Council is re-established. It would have to be linked into that council but hopefully it will be re-established at an early date.</P>

I hope everyone is doing their utmost to achieve a resolution of the current difficulties concerning the Northern Assembly and related matters. Does the Taoiseach not recognise that, given his commitment to move forward to accommodate the participation of elected members of parliament from the North of Ireland in this Chamber on specific debates, this is a matter he must progress with <Col N="25" /> urgency? I ask again what steps are being taken. The Taoiseach's reference to Whips' meetings is but a kicking to touch &ndash; a response that he has given on a number of occasions.</P>

      <P>As I told Deputy Rabbitte, the committees and the Whips put forward a view, to which we agreed, that it would be particularly valuable from time to time, in the context of the North-South ministerial bodies, to have the expertise and experience of politicians from Northern Ireland in appropriate debates. That has been agreed but it is necessary for the House to agree the procedural arrangements to deal with that. I do not believe the House can move on those procedural arrangements until the institutions have been re-established because the House made that agreement, back in 2001 or 2002, on the basis that the North-South Ministerial Council would be operating. We cannot, therefore, make the procedural agreements.</P>
      <P>As regards Deputy Rabbitte's last point, the House will have to decide where those debates take place &ndash; in a committee of the House or a full sitting of the House when it is reviewing Northern Ireland issues. Those procedural arrangements will have to be made through the Whips but I cannot see how that can be done now. We have made the decision in principle but we cannot make such arrangements until the North-South bodies are re-established. The House has indicated that it is prepared for this, in principle, and I have no doubt that the Whips will discuss the procedural arrangements but they cannot do so until&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>In fairness, I do not think that is the position. The House agreed to a committee report and we stated that when the institutions were re-established we would examine how we could deal with that procedurally. When it comes around, we will have to look at whether it will be done through a committee of the House or otherwise. However, those are procedural issues which were not agreed at the time and which, I am sure, the Whips will readily agree as soon as the institutions are operational. We will have to decide on the appropriate way of doing that, but I have not put my mind to it; we will have to work <Col N="26" /> that out. I am ready to do that whenever we will be in a position to do so. They have agreed to the principle, but I cannot ask them to agree to the procedures until we have the North-South institutions up and running again. I do not see how I can do that.</P>

      <P>The Ceann Comhairle will agree with me that the previous Government Whip, now Minister for Transport, Deputy Brennan, circulated a report of the All-Party Committee on the Constitution to the Whips, who were to examine it and respond. The present Whip has raised it once or twice as well. There was no response from any of the Whips that I am aware of, except from Sinn Féin. The reason there was no urgency about it and that the Whips could not proceed was that we were operating in a vacuum in the absence of the institutions. Can the Taoiseach confirm that is the case?</P>

      <P>Has the Government any intention of addressing the anomaly whereby citizens who are aged 18 years can vote for Members of this House but cannot be Members themselves? That is surely an anomaly which should be tackled. I seek clarification of the reply the Taoiseach gave earlier regarding immunity from prosecution for Members travelling to and from this House. He appeared to indicate it would not hold up in a court of law. My understanding is the Constitution would take precedence and the provision has been used as a precedent for a Member of the Oireachtas in the past. The signal should be sent out that this is a constitutional provision whose time is past. Will the Taoiseach make a strong statement along those lines?</P>

      <P>In view of what he said this morning does the Taoiseach accept that an essential part of the report from the All-Party Committee on the Constitution was the requirement that any representation or presence in the Oireachtas would be on a cross-community basis? This is not about one party having representation. It is about cross-community presentations that require that principle to be established. It is not simply about procedures &ndash; it is about trying to deal with an issue that has been discussed by the committee. The requirements of the committee are very plain.

      <P>I will not rise to that, a Cheann Comhairle. On Deputy McManus's point, yes, the basis of what the Whips agreed is set down in the report. The procedures have to be worked out as to how we operate it, but it was cross-community. There is no doubt about that.</P>
      <P>On the 18 to 21 age question raised by Deputy Boyle, that was agreed on one of the earlier reports. It was agreed that it will be changed in a future referendum. It was agreed under the &ldquo;National Parliament&rdquo; to reduce the age of eligibility from 21 to 18. It has therefore already gone forward as a recommendation which the Government has agreed to. It is a matter of just getting a suitable opportunity to put it forward.</P>
      <P>I agree that the provision preventing a Member being stopped or arrested going to or from the Houses of the Oireachtas is superfluous. I do not know when someone tried to use it last. Personally I do not believe it would hold up now if anyone tried to use it. It had a very distinct purpose. It was about a very different time and it had a value in those days.

      <P>I wish to object to the way we are being asked once again to adopt a very important element of EU law, without full scrutiny of this House. The referral to committee in my view is absolutely unacceptable, given the major implications for judicial harmonisation between this State and other member states. I believe that during the course of the Nice treaty debates the Taoiseach gave a commitment in this House that such important EU matters would not be deflected into committee &ndash; where following deliberation this House gets no report back. There is no report back procedure whatsoever. It will return to the Order Paper in a number of weeks and we will be asked to rubber-stamp it without any indication to the membership of this House of the import, concern, reservations or whatever of the participating committee members. This may be a motion which, with the full detail and exposure, my colleagues and I would support. It is the procedure to which I am objecting. This point has been validly addressed here before and in line with the commitment already given, I am asking that this approach not to be adopted in this instance or in any other such instance in the future.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
      <P>Like other speakers, I would be interested to know what we are being asked to approve. In endeavouring to find that out, what is contained in the Order Paper is mysterious. We are being asked to approve an option, provided by Article 3 of the fourth Protocol set out in the Treaty of Amsterdam, to notify the President of the Council of the European Union that it wishes to take part in the adoption and application of proposed measures such as a proposal for a Council Regulation (EC) on the law applicable to non-contractual obligations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="30" />It could have been phrased in a way that would make sense. This is a legal paraphrase designed to be as inaccessible as possible. I ask that we be given the basic information and that the report be placed before us before we approve it rather than afterwards in the hope that it might not be as damaging as we might fear.</P>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with what Deputy Stagg has stated. It is important that we try to get the workings of the procedure right whereby we can get reports back from committees. I know the view has been held that we have conveners at these committees and these conveners should report back. I know this issue has been looked at by the Whips. While there are conveners, they do a job of trying to ensure attendance and other issues, but to get reports from conveners does not seem easy to achieve given their parliamentary position. Maybe it should be so in theory, but I do not think it is likely in practice. The Whips are pursuing that so we will continue to try to find a satisfactory outcome on that point.</P>
      <P>In reply to Deputy Kenny and others, the objective of the regulation is to harmonise the rules on the applicable law for non-contractual obligations, both civil and commercial. The Commission argues this will ensure that courts in all member states will apply the same law to cross-border disputes involving non-contractual obligations, thereby facilitating mutual recognition of court rulings in the European Parliament. Apparently the reason for all this is the initial focus on the question of civil liability for damage caused to others by for example defective products, unfair competition, violation of privacy or violation of the environment. Member states do not at present have common rules for deciding which law should apply in cases concerning non-contractual obligations so each court applies its own national rules. This is an effort to have one ruling for all cases.</P>
      <P>As regards dealing with issues in the full House, not just this issue but others also, they are technical issues. They are legalistic &ndash; I do not disagree with Deputy Sargent's point. At many times it is difficult reading these, but then that applies to most legal matters wherever they come from. I accept that is a difficulty. It is necessary to read them three or four times, but the idea of putting these kinds of technical issues on to the floor of the House would not do much for the House and certainly would not help attendance in the House. I do not agree with the concept that they should not go to committees. I say to Deputy Ó Caoláin that people have the right to speak on these issues at committees, but that is not the difficulty we are having.</P>

We have spent considerable time discussing the fact that about 400 people per year die as a result of motor accidents, which is an enormous tragedy, but I believe we should give more focus to the fact that 8,500 people die from causes directly related to smoking.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Broughan</NameTxt>
      <P>I generally welcomed this Bill last night on behalf of the Labour Party, which closes significant loopholes in the 1996 legislation, and I also welcomed the proposed amendments which the Minister of State at the Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources has said he will table on Committee Stage.</P>
      <P>This legislation will address certain key issues which should be closely monitored with a view to their development in the future. A major problem in coastal management has been the ongoing discharge of sewage into waterways and streams and, finally, into the sea. At surfing competitions last year, particularly in County Donegal, many competitors referred to the problem of sewage damaging the wonderful coastal areas in that county.</P>
      <P>I commend, therefore, the Dublin city manager, Mr. John Fitzgerald, and the Fingal county manager, Mr. Willie Soffe, for the magnificent Dublin Bay project, most of which is now complete. In the past five years, Dublin city and Fingal engineers have constructed a major pipeline across the bay to take the bulk of the sewage from the north side of Dublin across to the new secondary and tertiary treatment processing plant in Ringsend. The last leg of the project remains to be completed in the Howth peninsula, where a certain amount of sewage is still being discharged. One more major pipeline is needed to reverse the sewage from the peninsula and join it to the new pipeline.</P>
      <P>It is, however, a wonderful achievement that Dublin Bay will soon be in a position where beaches such as Dollymount and Sandymount will reclaim blue flags, establishing the bay as a key area that has managed to put an end to the dumping of sewage that has gone on for generations. I commend everyone who has been involved in that project.</P>
      <P>The local authorities in Dublin city and Fingal are also carrying out major studies into the management of our streams and rivers, such as the River Mayne, and the flooding caused by changing tidal conditions due to global warming.</P>
      <P>I call on the Minister, Deputy Dermot Ahern, to introduce the full coastal management programme. There should be no part of the country where sewage is discharged straight into the sea. Under the EU water framework directive and the EU port waste management directive, the State has the opportunity to embark on a programme that will see a massive reduction of pollution in our seas, particularly areas vulnerable to nitrites and other harmful effluents.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister has promised that new legislation will be introduced next week to address the prob<Col N="40" /> lems with the management of the huge amount of shipping traffic around Ireland. As I speak, at least 30 major ships are transporting cargoes, some of which are very dangerous, up and down the busy shipping lanes of the Irish Sea and along our western coast. On a day like today, there will be 100 of our smaller fishing vessels busy at sea. We have seen a litany of disasters, including the significant oil spills involving the <i>Exxon Valdez</i> in March 1989, the <i>Aegean Sea</i> in December 1992 and the <i>Jessica</i> in January 2001. Very often the vessels involved in great discharges of oil are ancient, single-hulled ships which get into grave difficulties and break up before causing major environmental damage in the surrounding seas. In our country we have had the episodes involving the <i>Betelgeuse</i> in 1979 and the <i>Kowloon Bridge</i> in 1986, the latter of which represented an important stepping stone in the creation of the Department of the Marine. As a number of speakers mentioned in the Seanad, a disaster involving the <i>Prestige</i> occurred before Christmas off Spain's famous Costa da Morte. The Spanish authorities behaved extraordinarily when they prevented the vessel being brought closer to shore, thereby exacerbating an already very serious disaster.</P>
    <P>All this raises the question of how we would cope in the event of a similar disaster around our coastline. There have been stringent criticisms. My Green Party colleague recently mentioned Ireland's deficit in terms of not having a significant tug which would be capable of towing large vessels which have been stricken while carrying oil, gas or other possible pollutants. In that context, I congratulate everyone involved in the incident off the coast of Donegal in which Donegal County Council, the Irish Coast Guard and the Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources worked closely together to ensure that the <i>Princess Eva</i> did not cause major pollution.</P>
    <P>I congratulate the Minister for bringing this Bill before the House, but I regret that it has taken almost three years to bring it from the Seanad to the Dáil. I hope the Minister will consider a couple of the amendments the Labour Party intends to bring forward on Committee Stage.</P>

      <P>Like my colleagues, I welcome this Bill which has finally made it, three years on, from the Seanad to the Dáil. In the context of the debate on Seanad reform, it is interesting to see in this legislation the good work the Upper House can do. An amendment proposed in the Seanad three years ago to provide that information about dumping would be published electronically was accepted. This positive step is worth noting in the context of the contro<Col N="41" /> versy this summer involving dumping and its possible consequences in the constituency of the Minister of State present, Deputy Gallagher. It was very useful this summer for me or any member of the public to be able to find clear information on the Department's website detailing the reasons materials were being dumped and the locations and amounts involved. It is regrettable that there has been such a long delay before we could continue the useful work of the Seanad and enact this legislation.</P>
      <P>In his speech, the Minister of State, Deputy Browne, suggested that he will make two particular amendments to the Bill though it is difficult to address them specifically as we do not have details. I wish, however, to take up some of the issues raised by the proposals. It is proposed to begin to recognise the implications of dumping for biodiversity and to end the exemptions of fish processing plants from the dumping provisions of the 1996 Act. I welcome very much both proposed amendments. In regard to the latter, a hugely important factor is the polluting influence of nutrients in our water which is something that may be of interest to the Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Gallagher. The environmental programme of the United Nations produced a millennial report on the environment which states that the problem of nutrient pollution in our sea water has global implications comparable to those caused by the destruction of the carbon cycle. We have a huge issue in our marine environment of nutrient enrichment and we must consider it in the context of the problems of dumping. It is right, therefore, that the fish processing exemption is to end.</P>
      <P>There are other implications which are slightly broader than the particular implications of this Bill. Like most of us, the Minister of State will be concerned with finding out what exactly happened to cause the salmon kill in Inver Bay and McSwynes Bay in Donegal this summer. Increasing evidence is being put forward by scientists that aquaculture itself is leading to nutrient enrichment which may in turn be leading to formation of toxic bloom. Was it a form of dumping by the aquaculture industry that led to the problem which has wiped that industry out in the area in question?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I refer the Minister of State to a very interesting report prepared by Dr. Malcolm MacGarvin for the World Wildlife Fund examining the Scottish experience of nutrient enrichment from aquaculture. Dr. MacGarvin is a very eminent scientist who has done extensive work for the European Commission on the issue. If one applies to Ireland the figures he applied to Scotland, one sees that the salmon farming industry here is releasing, or dumping, 1,500 tonnes of nitrogen and 250 tonnes of phosphorus in selected coastal areas. In terms of nitrogen, that is the equivalent of the sewage outflow from 650,000 individuals and, in terms of phosphorus, of the sewage outflow of 1.9 million people. The level <Col N="42" /> of nutrient enrichment being caused by this industry is equivalent to that of the entire population of the west coast.</P>
    <P>While I await the findings of the Department, in a complex marine environment in which toxic blooms are increasingly caused by a combination of factors, the incident in Donegal may have been part caused or influenced by dumping by the Department from the Killybegs site. I do not give huge credence to the theory that this was the main factor, though it may have been contributory. High water temperatures may also have been a factor as may nutrient enrichment from the aquaculture plants themselves.</P>
    <P>I am sure the Minister of State watched the &ldquo;Prime Time&rdquo; programme this summer which addressed this issue. The sentence which stood out came from a Government scientist, Dr. Ken Whelan, who hit the nail on the head in terms of the future of the aquaculture industry or any other activity in our marine environment. On the programme, Dr. Whelan said it is only when we are in tune with nature that anything can have a long-term, sustainable economic or environmental future. With the Bill before us, we should try to achieve a scenario in which our dumping is in tune with nature. For that reason, I welcome the amendment proposed to end the exemption of the fish processing industry and, in particular, the amendment to provide for the recognition of biodiversity as a factor to be taken into account in our dumping activities. It is difficult to accomplish the latter. It requires complex scientific analysis and recognition of the fact that marine eco-systems are complex, interrelated and may be changed by small, imperceptible alterations in circumstances.</P>
    <P>To go back to the start when I mentioned the use of the site where we can see the level of dumping, even in 2003 we can see that the five or six licensed dumpings which have occurred have involved very significant volumes of material. If my recollection is correct, 1.6 million tonnes of dumped material emanated from Cork Harbour. I am aware that in Dublin Bay, serious volumes of material are taken out of the port tunnel, possibly to be used in reclamation elsewhere. We are talking about massive volumes of materials in some cases and we cannot simply dump them on the sea bed and be blind to the possible consequences to the local and broader eco-systems. The pollution of our marine environment is the most important environmental issue we have to tackle and I welcome the late arrival of the Bill from the Seanad as one part in that battle.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MartinFerrisSF" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>There can be no doubt that the Dumping at Sea Act 1996 has greatly improved the statutory protection of our waters from threats posed by the dumping of dangerous materials and extended jurisdiction by up to 350 miles offshore. It is vital that the State exercises close surveillance over this area, and any measures that strengthen that must be welcomed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="43" />If I were to enter one reservation it would be that the Act does not prevent the ongoing pollution of our waters by a different type of dumping, that which emanates from the British nuclear facility at Sellafield. Indeed, a report on radiological pollution published in May this year proved that Sellafield remains the single major source of pollution of the Irish Sea. While that remains the case, measures such as the 1996 Act can only tackle a small part of the problem. The solution to the Sellafield problem is that this State demands that it be closed.</P>
    <P>Another area of concern in parts of the country is the continued entry of untreated sewage into the sea, despite the ban on the dumping of sewage at sea under the 1996 Act. I appreciate that this problem does not directly relate to the contents of this Bill but as with the Sellafield issue, it illustrates that the good intentions of legislation can be defeated by more basic factors. In this case, it is the absence in many areas of modern sewage treatment systems. My point in raising this issue is that the provision of such facilities would have a much more beneficial effect on the health of our waters than measures such as this Bill, welcome though it is.</P>
    <P>I come from an area just outside Tralee and I spent much of my life involved in the fishing industry. In Tralee Bay we have a natural oyster industry which was almost lost in the mid-1980s as a result of the inadequacy of a sewage treatment facility and sewage flowing into the harbour. Tralee Bay probably has one of the best oyster beds in Europe, and it was almost lost. Addressing that issue has contributed to the regeneration of the industry and in my talks with fishermen from that area as late as last week, it is fair to say the oyster bed has been saved and is almost back to its original condition. That was down to putting in proper treatment facilities so that the natural oyster could flourish and grow.</P>
    <P>Ballyduff is another area not far from where I live which I know intimately. Ballyduff is a village which has a sewage treatment facility originally designed for fewer than 50 houses. It is currently servicing up to 400 houses without any upgrading. The consequences of that are that raw sewage is flowing into the River Feale and making its way out through Ballybunion into the sea. That is a major problem which needs to be addressed, perhaps not in this Bill but in conjunction with it, in Ballyduff and throughout the country. Wild salmon come up the River Feale to spawn each year but there is a decline in the salmon stocks along the west coast. I am sure the Minister would be <i>au fait</i> with that and also the effects of a lack of proper facilities on the future of the salmon industry.</P>
    <P>I welcome the fact that the Bill provides that the Minister with responsibility for our archaeological heritage will be consulted in regard to any application to dump at sea. I am aware that the archaeological heritage of our coast is far less well known to people than that of inland areas. Much <Col N="44" /> of that has to do with simple geographical facts such as erosion but we must also recognise that much of it has been lost through the development of ports, harbours, marinas and the necessary dredging that is carried on in areas.</P>
    <P>Until this proposal there has been no attempt to subject any of this work to the same level of monitoring or regulation as that which is applied to construction projects in towns where developers must take cognisance of the fact that areas of major archaeological and historical importance may be disturbed. I am aware from my county that much of the heritage of the harbours along the Kerry coast has been lost over the years and any measure that will preserve what remains or at least allows proper evaluation prior to development has to be welcomed.</P>
    <P>There are other issues which I am not certain can be adequately addressed under the 1996 Act or through suitable amendments. These include the dumping of rubbish from ships which may not appear to present as great a threat as those addressed under the 1996 Act but which clearly are an ongoing problem. That is clear to anyone who visits many of our beaches which are strewn with all manner of debris which I assume does not grow naturally in the areas. This summer I had the luxury of spending some time on Banna beach, in Inch and all along our coastline, and much of the debris coming in is from refuse being discarded at sea. That fact has to be taken on board.</P>
    <P>In general there is a heightened consciousness of the importance of our seas. As a former fisherman I am aware that we have had to become far more aware of the sea, not only as a source of food and our livelihood but also as a territory, the demarcation and regulation of which has become much stricter over recent decades. Again, the growing levels of pollution in the Irish Sea and the ongoing threat from Sellafield contributed to this heightened awareness on the part of people whose livelihood is based on the sea.</P>
    <P>The level of control over our waters has had particular implications for Irish fishermen since we joined the European Union. They have had to deal with what can be fairly described as, and which was admitted to me by an EU official in Brussels earlier this year as being, an inequitable distribution of the fish quotas in Irish waters. However, fishermen will also admit that they have to become more aware of the need to conserve stocks and in general there is a broader understanding of the sea as a valuable natural resource which needs to be protected.</P>
    <P>When I visited the sea ports during the summer it was commendable to see fishermen coming home with their refuse bags after a day fishing for lobster or salmon or some trawling and putting their refuse bags into skips that were available on our piers. That is an indication of the seriousness with which the fishermen are taking this problem. In that spirit, measures such as this Bill are to be welcomed by everybody connected with the sea.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="45" />I hope that strict surveillance is maintained over ongoing future oil and gas exploration off our coast. The need for this has been emphasised by the decision some months ago by An Bord Pleanála to reject the application by Enterprise Energy to build an onshore facility at Ballinaboy in County Mayo. It is heartening to know that the board exercised suitable vigilance regarding the environmental aspects of the proposal, to say nothing of the devastating critique made by the board inspector, Kevin Moore, of the lack of economic and social benefits to the region.</P>
    <P>I am aware that this application was for an onshore facility but that only makes it all the more important that where oil and gas exploration is being conducted offshore, it, too, is subject to proper surveillance to ensure the protection of the surrounding sea area. I appreciate that, as with Sellafield, this strictly concerns factors outside the remit of the 1996 Act but I cite them to indicate that sea pollution is far more prevalent and insidious than can be dealt with by addressing the issue of dumping as defined in the Act. Having said that, I welcome the proposals contained in the Bill and trust that the heightened consciousness of the health of our seas will continue to be reflected in future legislation and Government action regarding developments which impinge upon it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FinianMcGrath" hpid="Mr. F. McGrath Mr. F. McGrath">
      <NameTxt>Mr. F. McGrath</NameTxt>
      <P>I am grateful for the opportunity to speak on the Dumping at Sea (Amendment) Bill 2000. I welcome this debate as I believe sea pollution and the destruction of our bays are not often given enough political attention. I am also extremely fortunate to live in a constituency which is beside our beautiful Dublin Bay and, in today's debate, I will be highlighting this serious issue as it affects the people in Dublin North-Central, particularly in Clontarf. I also pay tribute to people who have worked tirelessly to clean up our bays and who have tried to keep our seas clean. The great Sean Dublin Bay Loftus comes to mind and it is essential that we carry on his tradition. As a former Member of the Oireachtas and a former Lord Mayor of Dublin, he had a tremendous record in dealing with sea pollution, dumping at sea and the protection of Dublin Bay.</P>
      <P>It is nonsense to talk about a dumping at sea Bill while ignoring any proposed destruction of Dublin Bay. Looking at the present situation we must ensure vigilance in regard to the protection of our seas and bays. In October 1999 the Dublin Port Company Limited applied to in-fill 52 acres. This application was rejected in March 2000 after the independent consultants found that the environmental impact statement was inadequate. On 7 March 2002, Dublin Port Company Limited reapplied to in-fill the same 52 acres. The independent consultants reported on the EIS in September 2002 and this application is still current. There is a history of attempts to destroy and dump in our sea.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="46" />Since 1972 the Dublin Port Company has tried further in-fills. In 1972, Dublin Port published a long-term plan for Dublin Bay which proposed the in-filling of 2,870 acres. In 1980, Dublin Port published notice to apply to in-fill 94 acres of our bay. In 1988, Dublin Port applied to in-fill 52 acres of our bay and in 1999, the port again applied to in-fill 52 acres of the bay. Finally, in 2002 Dublin Port applied to in-fill 52 acres of our bay. The signs from the Department responsible, the Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources, are not encouraging. If the Minister gives the go-ahead, then the application will be published for public comment. This is a classic example of one section of Irish society trying to dump in and destroy our bay. We will need to defend Dublin Bay and defeat this in-fill attempt.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State, Deputy Michael Ahern, may remember that last year there was extensive flooding around Dublin Bay. A recent Environmental Protection Agency report recommends no further reclamation of estuary lands to address the reality of rising sea levels, and this includes Dublin Bay. In other words, it is a danger to the broader communities in Dollymount, Clontarf and East Wall. The Minister of State will see that when talking about dumping at sea, it is important we keep our eye on the ball to protect and preserve what remains of the lovely amenities of Dublin Bay. It is essential that I put these facts on the record. I urge the Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources to listen to the people on this important national issue. Dublin Bay belongs to the people of Dublin and Ireland and not just the port company.</P>
    <P>The purpose of this Bill is to update the definition of &ldquo;harbour authority&rdquo; in section 1 of the Dumping at Sea Act, 1996, to include port companies to which the Harbours Acts, 1996 and 2000, apply. Section 2 provides for an amendment of section 5 of the Dumping at Sea Act, 1996, to include the Minister for Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands in the list of Ministers who must be consulted by the Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources in relation to all applications for dumping at sea permits. I welcome section 4 which removes doubt that any likelihood of interference with important natural or archaeological heritage should be considered before a decision is made on an application for a dumping at sea permit.</P>
    <P>Sections 3 and 5 are progressive sections which I welcome. The public has a right to know and to have their observations listened to in relation to any applications. Again, this is all relevant to Dublin Bay as the Minister must always listen to the thousands of people who object to the 52 acre in-fill. It is an environmental, public health and, above all, a citizens' rights issue. If he does not listen to sensible voices who care about our seas and bays, the Minister is turning his back on the democratic wishes of the people. Let this debate be a wake up call to show the people that damaging our seas and bays is really not an option. May <Col N="47" /> I say it is great to see a member of the Technical Group in the Chair.</P>
    <P>In section 3(3), the Minister can consider urgent cases involving navigational safety as quickly as possible. He is obliged to allow sufficient time for the applicant. In relation to staffing and the financial implications, I note the Bill does not require additional staffing or involve any net additional costs to the Exchequer. I have a concern about this section as we need to ensure the maximum health, safety and protection of the environment. One cannot do this on the cheap. It is important that the Minister takes my views on this legislation on board.</P>
    <P>When talking about dumping at sea legislation, it is essential that we do not forget the people, our fishermen and women who use the sea for their livelihood. We all have a duty to ensure their quality of life and that their livelihood is protected. We should never forget the tragedies of those who have lost their lives at sea. At all times the sea must be protected and respected. Safety, ship safety and proper life saving equipment must be top of any agenda.</P>
    <P>When it comes to the detail of the Bill, dumping, polluting or destroying our fish stocks must be dealt with in a strong manner. Let us remember that not only are we protecting our national resources but also the resources for the future. Vested interests, like the port company, cannot be allowed to dominate this debate. We have a role, as does the Dublin Port Company Limited, but the bays and seas of Ireland belong to the people and are not for sale. It is as simple as that. We have seen excellent projects, such as the recent Dublin City Council project, attempting to clean up the bay. I welcome these developments as a member of Dublin City Council since 1999. I was involved in pushing that agenda and it was an excellent project and I commend the Minister and Dublin City Council in that regard.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. F. McGrath</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware of that. We have also seen community and residents' groups involved in clean-ups. Groups like Dublin Bay Watch and the Clontarf Residents' Association are to the forefront in ensuring that we have clean and safe seas. I wish to thank them for their magnificent voluntary work. Many people would not be aware that groups like Dublin Bay Watch and the local residents' association in Clontarf have done magnificent work over 20 years on this issue. They are involved in clean-ups in different parts of the bay on a regular basis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We must also remind ourselves in this debate that we are an island economy and we need to protect our seas and bays. Dumping at sea is not an option. We need to protect and preserve what remains of the amenities of our seas and bays. This Dumping at Sea (Amendment) Bill reminds us all of the need to protect our seas and a great national asset &ndash; and it is a national treasure. I <Col N="48" /> hope we do not take our eye off the ball and that we defend our marine and natural resources.</P>
    <P>For a long time we have listened to the debate on Sellafield and the dumping of nuclear waste in the Irish Sea. This type of dumping is simply not acceptable. I challenge the pro-nuclear groups in Ireland and in the EU. They must be challenged; they cannot have it both ways. Nuclear powers and nuclear interests should never be allowed to set the political agenda. Many of us believe they have got an easy ride over the last number of years. Let us remember that they tried to bring nuclear power to Ireland but the people stopped them at Carnsore. These are the types of issues which should be covered in this legislation. We must constantly be on our guard as there are still nuclear supporters around in Irish society; I am told they are even in the Government parties. However, the Minister of State, Deputy Michael Ahern, will be glad to know I do not include him in that rump.</P>
    <P>While dealing with dumping at sea, it would be remiss of me not to mention our Oireachtas colleague, Deputy Joe Higgins, who has been dumped in Mountjoy Prison because of his efforts to ensure Fingal County Council did not dump rubbish and collected all the bins of the PAYE workers involved in the bin tax protests. Will the Minister of State use any power and authority he has to seek the release of Deputy Joe Higgins and Councillor Clare Daly? We cannot allow them to be dumped in Mountjoy Prison. It is a disgrace that a Member of the Oireachtas is locked up in prison while criminals and tax dodgers are walking the streets.</P>
    <P>I welcome the legislation and the fact that the Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources will accept progressive amendments. It is now up to all of us to ensure that we have clean seas and bays.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BeverleyCooperFlynn" hpid="Ms Cooper-Flynn Ms Cooper-Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Ms Cooper-Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>I, like other Members, welcome the opportunity to speak on this Bill as I come from the coastal constituency of Mayo. The Bill is relevant to County Mayo because many of the fisherman on the Mayo coast rely on the quality of our seas for their livelihood. It is important that we maintain that quality by being careful with the type of dumping that takes place at sea. There are many fish processing facilities in the county. Sadly, we still have the discharge of raw sewage into the sea. However, I welcome this year's investment of &euro;303 million by the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government in upgrading water and sewerage facilities within the county. Areas such as Achill Sound and Belmullet, where currently raw sewage is discharged into the sea, will not see this practice continue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Mayo is also one of the counties that is affected by exploration companies. The story of Corrib Oil is not news to the House. As many Members will be aware, there has been an accidental dumping into the sea in Pollathomas, very near where <Col N="49" /> Corrib Oil is carrying out its offshore work. Thousands of tonnes of bog, farm animals, debris and, sadly, a graveyard were accidentally dumped into the sea with drastic consequences for a local community. I am raising this matter in the House because not enough has been done to help and assist those people affected in Pollathomas. I recognise that there will be a clean-up operation in due course. However, I am anxious that there should be no delay whenever something of this magnitude happens. It is a national issue which has been reflected in the media reports.</P>
    <P>I am also concerned about the impact of the Sellafield plant on our environment. I welcome the legal action taken by the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government and the Attorney General in this regard. We would all love to see the closing of the Sellafield plant because of the consequences and the danger it presents to those on this island.</P>
    <P>This Bill is a regulatory measure that ensures only material that is adjudged on scientific advice to be suitable for disposal at sea will be disposed of in an appropriate manner and location. This is an important development. In 1996 I welcomed the original Dumping At Sea Act when it was brought before the House by a Member of another party. I now welcome the proposed amendments to the Act. The Dumping at Sea Act 1996 replaced and strengthened considerably earlier legislation for the control of dumping at sea in line with updated international obligations of the State. These were set out in 1992 by the OSPAR Convention for the Protection of the Marine Environment of the North-east Atlantic. It extended the limit of the Irish jurisdiction for dumping at sea from 12 miles to 200 miles.</P>
    <P>I welcome the amendments proposed by the Minister with regard to the changes of responsibility in various Departments so that those relevant Departments will be consulted for these particular permits for dumping at sea. It is important that all relevant Departments would be consulted and the widest possible consultations take place to ensure that no permits would be granted incorrectly without every Department being properly informed.</P>
    <P>Section 2 of the Bill deals with the electronic publishing of applications for permits. This is an important proposal in the Bill despite the fact that there was already provision within the Department where applications for dumping were kept in book form and available for free inspection at the Department. However, the key issue here is access to information. It is not always possible for people to view documents based in the Department. That all this information will be based on websites is an important development. It allows people more knowledge of what is going on with regard to applications. I welcome this amendment which I note came from the Seanad. It is good to see the Seanad doing some worthwhile work in this area. Anything that improves access to information has to be widely accepted.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="50" />I note there is a proposed statutory obligation, as opposed to a non-statutory one, to advertise such applications in local newspapers. This is about empowering local people in getting the best possible information that nothing is happening in an underhand way. At least, they will feel it is not happening in an underhand way. They will be fully informed of what exactly is happening, particularly for those living on coastal areas where such activities will affect them in their livelihoods and quality of life. It is proposed that they will have 21 days to respond when they see these particular advertisements placed in local newspapers. We know we cannot hold up progress, but it is important that people get an adequate length of time for appeals. This proposed 21 days allows people an opportunity to put in objections or make submissions.</P>
    <P>Under section 3 of the Bill, it is proposed that submissions made by people with regard to these permits are also published electronically so that people have access to them. While this Bill makes a number of technical amendments, it proposes to do much for access to information. In this House, we have debated access to information on many occasions. We cannot do enough to ensure that people are adequately informed.</P>
    <P>Never was this more relevant than in County Mayo where we had public consultations with regard to the Bellanaboy facility for Corrib Oil. Deputy Ferris referred to a report which stated that it was of no economic benefit to the county. I reject this assertion, as does everyone in County Mayo. Any sensible person would recognise that bringing natural gas through County Mayo can only have economic benefits in the years to come. Sometimes, the economic benefits are not apparent immediately. It is when one looks to the long-term future, they become apparent.</P>
    <P>However, no one wants such a facility to proceed without adequate safety requirements being put in place, without all the necessary laws being adhered to and the EPA requirements being met. We still hope in County Mayo that the facility can be put in place and that we will reap the economic benefits. I am not only talking about County Mayo but other counties, as I see Deputy Connaughton from County Galway on the opposite side of the House. There are benefits for everyone, but particularly for the Connacht region.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Minister's proposals in encouraging all the relevant ports to draw up five-year plans. It is important that we do not manage our ports and harbours in a haphazard way or that these permits are applied for without adequate thought. That many of the harbours have already submitted and agreed five-year plans with the Minister is to be commended. We hope that this progress will continue in ports and harbours around the country so that we will know what will be happening in the next five years.</P>
    <P>The Bill also provides for penalties, which is particularly critical. While one can put in all the rules and regulations with regard to dumping, unless there is an adequate penalty those people <Col N="51" /> will unfortunately ignore the laws and dump, and they must be punished appropriately. In the closing remarks of the Minister of State for Communications. Marine and Natural Resources, Deputy Browne stated that he will be bringing forward further amendments on Committee Stage to deal with penalties and the issue of fees. People who apply for permits to dump at sea are imposing a huge cost, particularly if it is an elaborate application, on the Departments concerned. It is only right and proper that those costs be recouped so that the Government is not out of pocket as a result of an application. I welcome those proposed amendments and look forward to seeing them on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>The Bill is slightly overdue in coming before the House. However, it is better late than never. Much thought has gone into it and it goes a long way to improving the rights of individuals and hearing the comments of local people who are affected directly by this legislation. I commend the Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaulConnaughton" hpid="Mr. Connaughton Mr. Connaughton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connaughton</NameTxt>
      <P>I am delighted to revisit the Dumping at Sea Bill. I recall contributing to this Act five or six years ago when it was before the House. The Fine Gael Party welcomes the Bill. Anything that aims to ensure the well-being of the sea around our coast will get the support of everyone in the House.</P>
      <P>There are, however, a number of aspects to the Bill I wish to highlight. The Minister said that early enactment is desirable. I will return to this point later. This is an example of enabling legislation which ties up many loose ends, such as the incorporation of those Departments which were not included in the 1996 Bill. It is one thing to legislate for something but it is an entirely different matter to police it. How well will the legislation be policed? In five or ten years time will we be able to say that the seas are more environmentally friendly as a result of these provisions? What policing measures will be available to the Departments involved in this area to ensure that what we legislate for today will become a reality?</P>
      <P>The Bill is primarily a regulatory measure which will decide that only material which is adjudged on scientific advice &ndash; that is an important aspect &ndash; is suitable for disposal at sea. Material that arises from port dredging must be disposed of in the proper place and manner.</P>
      <P>In regard to the protection of important natural and archaeological heritage, the Bill includes reference to the Minister with responsibility for this area. The relevant Minister will be consulted when the need arises by the Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources. It is reasonable to assume that the office of the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government will be included since the heritage brief has been added to his portfolio.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The consultative process also involves the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government in relation to water quality <Col N="52" /> and radiological protection matters. The Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment will be involved in so far as this relates to industrial matters.</P>
    <P>The remit of the heritage and planning division of the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government is now more important, or is as important, as that of the Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources so far as sea permits are concerned. The Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources will issue the sea permits in concert with the heritage and planning division of the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government. I hope there will be an appeals mechanism for applications concerning natural heritage and archaeological projects. It is extremely important that a balanced approach is taken.</P>
    <P>One can readily see the great commercial value of our ports and harbours. If a particular harbour has to be extended, it is not just a case of a few lorry loads of soil; we are talking about thousands of tonnes. There are only two options for the disposal of such soil; it can be sent to landfill or put out to sea. There is no other process for handling it. One would hope that every help will be given to the harbour authorities so that if they need to get rid of huge volumes of earth, debris and so forth, they will be given an opportunity to put it in landfill, if that is that most appropriate course of action. While I am not a scientist, I would question the environmental impact of thousands of tonnes of clay, stones and other debris on the seabed. I assume the scientists will be examining such issues before any permits are granted. While I accept that the ocean is vast in comparison to the land mass, one has to consider the effect on marine life.</P>
    <P>It goes without saying that our ports and harbours are extremely important to us from a commercial point of view. As an aside, I was delighted to see from its financial returns last week how well Dublin Port is doing. It is prospering, which is hugely important for our industrial well-being. The more activity generated by the port, the greater the volume of traffic using the ports which brings us back on the merry-go-round to the M50, but that is not the primary purpose of today's discussion.</P>
    <P>One would hope that common sense would prevail. While huge volumes of debris would inevitably impact on the seabed, it would probably rehabilitate itself over a period of time. This is something which needs to be done to make way for urgently required commercial entities. Many of our harbours and ports, with the exception of Dublin, are in areas that need extra business. It is important that we have good ports and harbours around the country, from the point of view of decentralisation and regionalisation .</P>
    <P>A number of technical matters come to mind in regard to the Bill. Having to put prior notice in the paper is a good idea. People are used to <Col N="53" /> doing this due to the various planning laws in regard to houses and other structures.</P>
    <P>As regards the five year dredging plan, I do not have much experience of dredging other than that I spent some time as a Front Bench spokesman on fisheries over the years. I accept that all harbours and ports should have five year plans. I hope it does not necessarily mean that because, for instance, in the case of some substantial development that would not have been envisaged earlier and was proposed within the remit of the five-year plan as laid out, there would be nothing to stop a harbour commissioner or port and docks board from introducing it within the five years. I presume that is the case because it would make no sense if it were not the case.</P>
    <P>The policing of the regulations is very important. Many colleagues have spoken of matters that are not within the remit of the Bill and I am sure the Acting Chairman will allow me mention some such matters. Sellafield is a serious problem. While I acknowledge that this Government and every other previous Government has tried unsuccessfully, unfortunately, to have it closed down, it does not appear at the moment that the British authorities have the slightest inclination to do so. It is most important that the pressure is maintained because it is a serious problem on our doorstep. It always was a problem and it always will be one. From a policing point of view it is important that the proper levels are taken and that tests are conducted at regular intervals.</P>
    <P>On the matter of nutrient enrichment in the seas around our shores, nobody will deny that for the last ten or 12 years there have been significant contributions made by all Governments. Anything to do with effluent and sewage disposal is extremely costly. The engineering facilities are available and there is no problem in that regard, but there is a problem with money. Until recently it was nothing short of a disgrace and there are still disgraceful spots around the country. Now that the Celtic tiger seems to be almost in the coffin will it mean that over the next nine or ten years there will be a significant slippage again and many of the areas that are simply pumping raw sewage into the sea will take a long time to see the expenditure on investment in the infrastructure?</P>
    <P>One's own area always comes to mind. A few months ago I was brought on a tour of beautiful Kinvara in south Galway which is on Galway Bay. It is a small town which prides itself on attracting many thousands of tourists every year. Every bit of sewage created in that town goes straight into Galway Bay. That cannot be good for anybody. While this issue is outside the remit of this Bill, I believe it is important to highlight that fact on this occasion.</P>
    <P>There needs to be a planned investment programme for the future in order to cope with good and bad times. This business of stop and go investment where if things are going well the investment is made and if they are not going well <Col N="54" /> then investment is forgotten about, will not be good enough in the future.</P>
    <P>As Fine Gael spokesman for regional development I was very upset to observe the problems which have beset the Corrib oil business in County Mayo. Irrespective of where the gas came ashore, it could always be expected that if it did not come ashore in Connacht it would be a very long time before either our big or small towns would be supplied with natural gas. Everybody says it was because Connacht is so far away and that has always been our problem in the west of Ireland. Even when it arrived on our coast we still have problems getting it ashore. It has caused a lot of disruption to those who live in the area. Speaking from a regional point of view I can inform the House that we want the gas and it is needed in our community for industry, particularly to give small towns a chance. I hope the matter will be taken care of eventually.</P>
    <P>It is very important for the general public to have an appreciation of the concept of safety at sea and the concept of ensuring that the sea does not become a cesspool. The model of the tidy towns competition could be used. People should be encouraged to take a genuine interest because the sea is for everybody and it is very important. There are many people, it could be nine out of ten people in this country, who do not regard themselves as having any connection with the sea and they are mistaken. We all have a vested interest in ensuring that the seas are clear and unpolluted.</P>
    <P>I wish to take my cap off to a man and a programme, Tom MacSweeney of RTE, the &ldquo;Seascapes&rdquo; man. Many people who have nothing to do with the sea, other than cross over to Holyhead a couple of times a year, and who have no clue about the issues, listen to that radio programme. Some people tell me they do not know whether it is to listen to the programme or to the signature tune but one way or the other it is a very beneficial programme. I compliment Tom MacSweeney on an excellent job carried out over many years. It is not just a thought that came into his head and was gone in a season. Many people have a genuine interest in that programme.</P>
    <P>Deputy Gilmore steered the 1996 Act through the House. The limit of the Irish jurisdiction for dumping at sea was increased from 12 nautical miles to 200 nautical miles. That had a significant effect. I assume it took a year or two for the 1996 legislation to get into top gear. What type of policing was there? Were any companies or individuals found to be causing pollution and, if so, what legal or other action was taken?</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister of State to give the House an indication of how the policing arrangements are synchronised. Many people have said to me that this is the best Parliament in the world for bringing in laws but that we seldom if ever see them through. I ask the Minister of State to give the House an indication of the sort of people or groups who broke the 1996 law and the extent of the lawbreaking. I do not condone anyone throw<Col N="55" /> ing a plastic bag into the sea but I am referring to a substantial fracture of this law. How did the courts and the policing bodies react to this law? Was the impression given that we meant business? That is most important. When talking about the attitudes towards dumping in a big bad world such as this, it has been represented to me that there are no fewer than 80,000 different types of chemicals in use worldwide.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Mr. O'Donoghue Mr. O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Arts, Sport and Tourism (Mr. O'Donoghue)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 61 and 63 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At my request, the IRFU and the FAI, supported by Arup consultants, set out their prioritised proposals for stadium development in which they considered five locations, including <Col N="56" /> Lansdowne Road, Newlands Cross and Abbotstown, as to their suitability to meet requirements for a modern stadium to host major international rugby and soccer fixtures in the greater Dublin area. This report has been subjected to detailed examination by the Office of Public Works, which acts as my technical adviser on the project. The Office of Public Works engaged international private sector construction consultants, Davis Langdon PKS, to ensure that all matters relating to the proposal were thoroughly evaluated.</P>
    <P>I received the Office of Public Works report in the middle of September and I am now reflecting on the issues highlighted by it in conjunction with the response to the earlier initiative to secure stadium facilities with the assistance of private sector funds. When I have considered the matter fully, I will present my assessment to Cabinet for decision. Until the Government has decided on the further action to be taken, I do not intend to make any new policy statements on this matter.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JackWall" hpid="Mr. Wall Mr. Wall">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wall</NameTxt>
      <P>This issue is of major concern to the IRFU and the FAI. What is the Minister's view of the recent statement by the FAI that if a decision on a stadium was not forthcoming, home internationals might have to be played in UK stadia? That totally unacceptable situation would have a major effect on our standing in terms of soccer in the EU and on the world stage where we have made good progress.</P>
      <P>If I remember correctly, during a previous Question Time we seemed to rule out any involvement by the private sector. It seemed to be the case that the Government and-or the two associations would provide the funding. The associations would do so by selling advance tickets and the Government would do so through capital funding. Are we moving away from that position or are we avoiding making a decision? Other spokespersons and I have given the Minister our full support for the stadium. However, we seem to be avoiding making the decision about when it will happen. Will the Minister state when a decision will be made? This matter has been ongoing since I became spokesperson. When will we be in a position to tell the FAI and the IRFU that a decision has been made? I understand the Minister's point that each application must be processed to ensure we make the right decision. However, it is time to make that decision. We know about the disappointment of the associations. We have seen many reports on this issue, but we do not seem to be able to make a decision.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Mr. O'Donoghue Mr. O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate Deputy Wall's support for the stadium and that of the Fine Gael Party. The FAI has expressed great concern on the basis that it has been informed by FIFA that it is not a tenable situation in the longer term to have temporary seating placed in Lansdowne Road. At present, 11,000 bucket seats must be brought into Lansdowne Road for international <Col N="57" /> games. The FAI has been informed by FIFA that it will not tolerate that in the longer term or perhaps in the medium term. Meanwhile the IRFU is in a difficult situation. The Lansdowne Road stadium has outlived its age and is no longer an appropriate stadium to host major international events.</P>
      <P>As regards the involvement of the private sector, the 23 expressions of interest which arrived in on the last occasion were, for the most part, unsatisfactory. Unacceptable conditions were attached to some of the general expressions of interest. As regards a decision, I have outlined that I received the Ove Arup report. I asked the Office of Public Works to examine that and it did so in conjunction with the internationally renowned consultants, Davis Langdon PKS. We are now evaluating the situation within the Department. I hope to be in a position soon to go to Government with a memorandum seeking a decision. A number of options will be put before the Government. My view is well known. I strongly favour the construction of a new stadium. It is required in the interests of our sportsmen and women and in the interests of the sporting public, not to mention our international standing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BernardAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>I apologise for being absent for the first question. I was in my office writing and did not notice the time.</P>
      <P>Does the Minister accept that Government actions over recent years &ndash; years before his time, in some cases &ndash; have undermined the GAA's democratic process, caused divides in the FAI and left the IRFU sidelined? Does he accept that having had the report since early April, he has no option but to proceed with a stadium now? Will he make a decision as quickly as possible? How much of taxpayers' money has been spent so far on the Abbotstown project?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Mr. O'Donoghue Mr. O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>The suggestion that the actions of the Government have resulted in the sidelining of any organisation is complete nonsense. That simply did not happen &ndash; quite the opposite. The GAA has been assisted in all its facilities across the country and &euro;70 million was made available to the organisation by the Government for the wonderful development of Croke Park. The objective of the exercise all the way through has been to make progress on obtaining a consensus. It is necessary in the short-term that we reach a decision and, as I have outlined, I have been doing everything possible to prepare the most comprehensive memorandum possible for the Government with a view to obtaining a decision. The decision is one for the Government to make, as Deputy Allen knows. I provide the memorandum but the decision is a collective one. The memorandum will set out a number of options from which the Government will choose.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JackWall" hpid="Mr. Wall Mr. Wall">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wall</NameTxt>
      <P>We know from press releases and so on that the current uachtarán of Cumann Luthchleas Gael, Mr. Seán Kelly, is in favour of opening up Croke Park and we are also aware of the problems that exist in the democratic process involved in making a decision on the issue. The serious nature of the matter is reflected in the Minister's answer about the possibility of international matches being played on foreign soil. Could a meeting be arranged between the Minister and the uachtarán to consider these problems? Goodwill is no use unless we try to make use of it. We must make contact and move things forward.</P>
      <P>Have there been or will there be any meetings with Mr. Kelly on this matter? I fully understand the problems involved &ndash; the Minister and I have spoken in the House about democratic processes in the GAA on previous occasions and it is clear that the council must make some progress on this. Where there is goodwill we should use it. Has the Minister spoken officially or unofficially to the GAA about the opening up of Croke Park? Everybody is committed to providing a stadium &ndash; the Minister is obviously committed &ndash; we are only talking about an interim measure to overcome the current problems.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BernardAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister did not give a response to my first question about the expenditure to date on the Abbotstown project. Does he agree that the Taoiseach's intervention on the eve of the GAA's vote on Croke Park was gross interference and denied the organisation the opportunity of opening Croke Park? The torpedoing of the FAI project and fracturing of the structures within the FAI was the result of gross interference by the Government and the sidelining of the IRFU was an example of interference with that association. Does the Minister agree that due to this undermining of the democratic structures of the different sporting organisations, which took place before his time, it his now his responsibility to make a decision?</P>
      <P>The Ove Arup report has been with the Minister since last April. What discussions have taken place at Cabinet level since then? What discussions have taken place with Deputy Harney and her party representatives about this project?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Mr. O'Donoghue Mr. O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>From June 2000 to September 2003, &euro;85 million has been spent by the Exchequer on the Sports Campus Ireland project. Of this amount, &euro;71 million was spent on the construction of the National Aquatic Centre and &euro;11 on administrative and ongoing costs of CSID, most of which relate to the National Aquatic Centre, including executive services, project management, consultancy costs and VAT payments, although some of the VAT payment may be recouped. The balance of &euro;3 million relates to planning and site survey work in preparation and development of the campus site. A total of &euro;8.4 million was provided in 2003 for the completion of the National Aquatic Centre, to cover both capital and current costs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="59" />In answer to Deputy Wall's question about the GAA, I have had a number of unofficial contacts with the president of the GAA about a national stadium and about the position of the GAA on Croke Park. It is my intention to have a more formal meeting in the near future and Mr. Kelly has indicated that he would be quite happy to come to such a meeting to discuss the various issues.</P>

      <P>All I know is that the question of a national stadium was first put on the agenda by the Taoiseach because he supports the idea of having one. Energy has been expended not on misguiding anybody or trying to interfere but on seeking to bring the idea to fruition. The decision is a collective one for the Government, which has not discussed the issue in recent months for the simple reason that the memorandum has not been ready. It should be ready in the near future and the Government will then make a decision, which will become public.</P>

      <P>The national lottery-funded sports capital programme administered by my Department allocates funding to sporting and community organisations at local, regional and national level throughout the country. The main objectives of the programme, which is run on an annual basis, are: to develop an integrated and planned approach to the development of sport and recreational facilities; to assist voluntary and community organisations with the development of appropriate facilities in appropriate locations which will maximise use in terms of participation in sport and recreation; to encourage the multi-purpose use of facilities at national, regional and community level by clubs, community organisations and national governing bodies of sport; and to prioritise the needs of disadvantaged areas in the provision of facilities. In the last three years alone, a total of &euro;97 million has been allocated under the sports capital programme to more than 1,000 projects in respect of the provision of facilities in disadvantaged areas. My Department continues to evaluate how best to provide for the <Col N="60" /> needs of disadvantaged areas by providing sporting and recreational facilities and increasing participation under the programme.</P>
      <P>For the 2003 programme, at the initiative of my Department and in consultation with the Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs and Area Development Management, the agency with responsibility for the administration of the RAPID programme, it was decided that only those areas that have been designated by Government for special support through the schemes administered by the Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs &ndash; RAPID 1, RAPID 2, the local drugs task forces and CLÁR &ndash; should be treated as disadvantaged areas. My Department is already involved in consultations with ADM and the Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs on the prioritisation of sporting and recreational facility requirements in disadvantaged areas for the 2004 sports capital programme.</P>
      <P>Under its expenditure review programme, my Department is currently conducting a review of the sports capital programme for the period 1999 to 2002. In the course of this review, which is nearing completion, an analysis of the allocation of grants was carried out, along with a survey of a proportion of those who applied during this period. The Deputy may also wish to know that the preliminary findings of a review of the sports capital programme for the period 1999 to 2003 being carried out by my Department show, <i>inter alia,</i> that many of the projects located in disadvantaged areas which were awarded grants under the programme, would not have been successful without the specific measures included in the sports capital programme to help prioritise such projects. It has also established that the high level of funding provided for this programme from 1999 to 2002 &ndash;&euro;205 million &ndash; was a catalyst for securing funding under other social inclusion measures to ensure the provision of essential sports and recreational facilities in areas of disadvantage.</P>
      <P>In 2001 and 2002 alone, more than &euro;77 million was allocated to 815 projects located in areas of disadvantage, representing 58% of total funding provided. A survey conducted as part of the review revealed that 70% of respondents stated that support under the sports capital programme had made a difference in attracting participation from disadvantaged people. The improved targeting of RAPID projects under the sports capital programme has recently been singled out for praise by ADM and also by the RAPID national monitoring committee.</P>

      <P>Does the Minister agree that the criteria for applicants, such as the one that rules out grants for clubs to purchase premises or sites, should be relaxed? In many instances, applicants from disadvantaged areas in the RAPID 1 and 2 and CLÁR programmes do not have the facilities available to them to act as collateral to secure a grant. The Shanakill and Rathoane estates in <Col N="61" /> Tralee, on behalf of which John Mitchell's GAA club has applied, comprise 312 houses in which more than 500 young children are living. The Spa Road-Baloonagh estate, on behalf of which the Cumann Iosaif GAA club has applied, includes over 200 houses, with more than 500 children living there. These areas are disadvantaged and all qualify under the RAPID programme but their applications for the latest round of grant allocations were unsuccessful.</P>
      <P>It beggars belief that the areas I have mentioned, which comprise the largest population centres in County Kerry, were unsuccessful in their applications. The same areas were successful when they applied for grants from other Departments. Part of the success is that an on-the-spot assessment was done by officials from the various agencies from which they had sought grants.</P>

      <P>In this instance, however, no practical assessment was done by officials from the Minister's Department. A proper practical assessment should be carried out, rather than reviewing written applications. Does the Minister agree that for areas that are unable to meet the criteria &ndash; primarily because they are disadvantaged, such as the areas to which I have referred, and because they do not have the 20% necessary to secure grants &ndash; the criteria should be relaxed so that such areas, which are most in need, can benefit? Given that the Minister is from County Kerry, I am sure he will appreciate the points I am making. He should consider relaxing the criteria so that the areas I have mentioned can qualify for grants in future.</P>

      <P>I am aware of the areas to which Deputy Ferris has referred. I certainly agree with him that they come within the RAPID programme. As I understand it, there were three applications from Tralee under the RAPID programme, one of which was successful and the remaining two were not. My Department wrote to the unsuccessful applicants outlining the reasons their applications did not succeed. There are criteria to guide them in making the relevant assessments. I regret the two organisations in question did not receive grant aid on this occasion. They will have received letters from my Department setting out the reasons they may have been less helpful to their own cause. I hope they will be in a position to correct whatever errors may have been made and I hope they will reapply. I hope to announce the 2004 sports capital programme in the not too distant future. Their applications will receive every consideration when they arrive. Unfortunately, the assessment went against them on this occasion. I hope that whatever corrections need to be made will be made and that they are successful on the next occasion.</P>

      <Quest>the actions he proposes to take on foot of the report of the tourism policy review group; his views on the need identified in the report for the tourism industry to offer more value for money and address the issue of the lack of competitiveness in the industry; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>
      <QRef>[22455/03]</QRef>

    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Mr. O'Donoghue Mr. O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pleased to inform the House that on Tuesday, 30 September 2003 last, the chairman of the tourism policy review group, John Travers, presented me with the group's final report entitled New Horizons for Irish Tourism: An Agenda for Action. I can confirm that copies have been lodged with the Oireachtas Library for the information of Members.</P>
      <P>The report is the most important and authoritative document on tourism policy and performance in over a decade. It includes an overview of tourism worldwide, an assessment of the economic contribution of the tourism sector to the Irish economy, an analysis of recent tourism performance, a detailed assessment of tourism in Ireland today and an outline of the challenges and opportunities facing the industry. More importantly, however, it presents a challenging but achievable vision for the development of Irish tourism over the next ten years though a set of high level macro goals backed up by 70 action-focused recommendations.</P>
      <P>I am determined that the excellent work of the review group will be capitalised upon and that the momentum generated by the focus on the tourism industry will gather force. The review group has put the emphasis on an agenda for action, highlighting 70 individual concrete proposals, which will be the cornerstone for the development of the tourism sector over the next decade. Its recommendations are directed not only to my Department, the tourism State agencies and other Departments but, perhaps more importantly, to representatives of the tourism industry and individual tourism enterprises.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="63" />Not surprisingly, one of the key messages in the report is the need for the industry to restore competitiveness and ensure a high level of quality in the Irish tourism experience if it is to maximise the opportunities for future growth. There is no easy or single solution. The competitiveness of Irish tourism is influenced by a huge range of factors and experiences for customers, from initial inquiries about visiting Ireland right through to travelling here, where they go when they get here, where they stay, who they meet, what they do, what they see and their perceptions about price and quality.</P>
    <P>Having identified competitiveness and value for money as one of the key strategic drivers of success for Irish tourism, the review group listed ten integrated actions aimed at the industry, Government and State agencies, to translate the strategy into action. These require a holistic approach to addressing the issue and focus, in particular, on responsibility, anti-inflation actions, benchmarking competition, capability within the industry and upgrading standards as a competitive response.</P>
    <P>To ensure that the implementation of the action plan is given the priority recommended by the review group, I will establish shortly a high-level implementation group to drive forward and monitor the plan.</P>
    <P>I welcome the significant contribution to the development of tourism policy represented by the report of the review group and I will take action to forward the policy approach embodied in this report not only within my Department and the State agencies under my remit, but also with industry representative bodies and, where appropriate, my ministerial colleagues.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JackWall" hpid="Mr. Wall Mr. Wall">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wall</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for forwarding the report to me, which I received on the morning it was released. The high cost of insurance is one of the main problems facing the tourism industry and has been identified as such by people working in the sector. What contact has the Minister had with the Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Harney, about this matter?</P>
      <P>As regards the report of the review group, will the new high level implementation group the Minister is putting in place be in charge of its own action plan to create the necessary initiatives? It is stated that there was to be a rolling action plan over the first two years of the ten-year programme. Will the new group which he is going to initiate have control of that particular section of the report? The other item of major significance which has been highlighted in the media is renegotiation of the US-Ireland air agreement. Has the Minister spoken to the Minister for Transport, Deputy Brennan, on that aspect as well?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>Insurance has been discussed at Government on several occasions and it is a matter the Government is extremely concerned about. That is why the Government set up the personal injuries assessment board on an interim basis. It will initially deal with claims in respect of employers' liability and later on will take over the role of assessment as regards personal injuries as well. In addition, the Government is anxious to introduce a greater degree of competition into the insurance industry in Ireland. It is fair that a combination of measures, taken on foot of the MIAB report, and the report of Ms Dorothea Dowling, will help to bring insurance costs down. I am aware of the pressure that high insurance premia cause within the tourism industry.</P>
      <P>The implementation group will be charged with overseeing the implementation of some 70 plus recommendations included in the report. It will have the opportunity to report on progress every six months. Every year there will be a forum where there will be discussion on progress in relation to the implementation of the group's recommendations and whether methodologies should be changed in achieving the report's objectives. The report recommends that the bilateral US-Europe agreement be renegotiated and in this context the Transport Ministers of the European Union have mandated the Commission to enter into negotiations with the American Government. In the interim, the recommendation in the report is that Ireland unilaterally discussed the bilateral agreement with the United States of America. The Minister of Transport, Deputy Brennan, has made it clear that&mdash;</P>

      <P>I propose to answer Questions Nos. 65, 69 and 76 together.</P>
      <P>I refer the Deputies to my response to Priority Questions on this issue early this afternoon. As regards location, Abbotstown is among the options that remain under consideration as a site for the provision of stadium facilities.</P>

      <P>What specific options will be going to Cabinet in the memorandum? How many are there and what will the specific ones be? We want to know exactly what is ruled in and ruled out. We know from the Minister's answers that he favours the Abbotstown option. Have studies been carried out in support of this favoured option in terms of transportation infrastructure? Has the Minister received any correspondence from the IRFU, GAA or the FAI on their concerns and any potential threats to proceed themselves with previous options? I could certainly see the FAI seeking to resurrect Eircom Park.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Mr. O'Donoghue Mr. O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>Obviously I cannot go into any great detail about the options to be put before Government, other than to say that they will include the various geographical locations under consideration in the event that it decides to construct a new stadium. The costings will be put before the Government as well as options as regards the private and public sectors. With regard to infrastructure, where this is required it will be brought to the notice of the Government in the context of the memorandum. We have the Ove Arup report and now the Office of Public Works report, so there is plenty on which to base the memorandum for the Government's consideration.</P>
      <P>I have not heard from the FAI, nor the IRFU for that matter, that they intend to proceed on their own with the construction of a stadium. I know the GAA has indicated that it intends to complete Croke Park, one of the finest stadiums of its kind in the world.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
      <P>Could the Minister inform the House what is happening in reality on this issue which had taken on a life of its own a couple of years ago and seems to have stalled currently? The same urgency does not seem to be in evidence as was the case a couple of years ago. For <Col N="66" /> instance, has the Minister initiated any discussions with the various sporting bodies? Perhaps he would inform the House which bodies he has had discussions with in the past 12 months, and what the outcome was, and when, or if, he intends to have talks with the other sporting organisations involved in the meantime.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>I have had discussions with the IRFU, the FAI and the GAA on this and other issues over the last 12 months. It is my intention to have further talks with the three main field sports organisations in the coming weeks and months. The conclusion we require is a decision by the Government as regards the stadium. That is what I am pursuing. As I outlined to the House earlier this afternoon, while I strongly believe a stadium should be constructed &ndash; and I believe this view is shared by the sporting public which represents a considerable number of people in Ireland &ndash; I am only one member of the Government and in the final analysis it is a collective decision.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>Could the Minister confirm that the estimated cost of the project at Abbotstown excludes further development costs &ndash; infrastructural costs &ndash; which were put at &euro;353 million and can he give us a firm indication that we will not have serious cost over-runs? Could he give an estimate of the cost of the much needed infrastructural work that would be required to service the Abbotstown site and compare that with the cost of the Lansdowne Road site, which would be approximately &euro;350 million, on top of which there would be contributions from the FAI and the IRFU? In his opinion, what would be the overall cost of Abbotstown in today's terms? That would be the combination of the cost of the construction of the stadium and the development of all necessary infrastructural work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Mr. O'Donoghue Mr. O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>My estimate for the construction of a 65,000 seat stadium at Abbotstown at September 2003 costs, which would include construction, essential infrastructure, inflation and planning, would be of the order of &euro;381 million. The FAI and the IRFU have indicated that if the project does proceed at Abbotstown, between them they would be able to contribute &euro;118 million. Most of this, if not all, would arise from the sale of corporate boxes and so on. There is also the question of the sum of money offered by Mr. McManus, IR£50 million. That is a matter which will be discussed with Mr. McManus in the context of any new proposal that comes forward. It is important to note it would be possible to front-load the construction of a stadium with receipts from the IRFU and FAI in the shorter term. Major funding for the stadium would not be required until the third or fourth year. In other words, if one were to begin planning it now, I would envisage that the major funding of it would not become a drain on the Exchequer for about three to four years. The fourth, fifth and perhaps <Col N="67" /> sixth years would be the most expensive periods for the project. It is contingent on a Government decision. We are completing the memorandum and will see where we go from here.</P>

The essential infrastructure will obviously be road and rail network, otherwise people would have to walk a couple of miles across a field, which would not be very edifying given the much vaunted structure about which we have heard.</P>
      <P>Has the Minister established a price for the structure as opposed to what has been the norm here in recent years whereby the propensity to overrun is greater than the propensity to stick to the estimate? Will he take steps to ensure there are no overruns in this case?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish I could get to that stage first. I do not want to pre-empt the position. Obviously, every possible step will be taken to ensure the costs are minimised to the greatest extent possible. In that respect there will be contractual requirements, which will follow a very competitive tendering process regardless of whether the public or private sector is involved. The difficulty I have at the moment in making predictions into the future is that I do not have a Government decision on how this will proceed. Obviously I will not have such a decision until the Government discusses the memorandum, which is in the course of completion. When this is done I will bring it to the Government, which will take it from there.</P>

      <P>Last night's &ldquo;Prime Time&rdquo; programme, which covered the issue of Celtic and Rangers, mentioned that some people believed that Celtic was an Irish club that happened to play in Scotland. We have already heard that the international soccer team might start to play its matches outside this country. Given the possible <Col N="68" /> three or four year timeframe to get the stadium operational, would the Minister agree the decision should be taken as soon as possible to avoid the necessity of the national team having to play in another country for any length of time if at all?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>This difficulty arose as a result of FIFA informing the FAI that it could not tolerate the use of temporary seating in Lansdowne Road in the medium to long-term. While the current capacity of Lansdowne Road is 49,000, there are only 24,000 seats. Some 11,000 temporary seats are brought in for every home international, which is untenable. In addition, many games hosted by the FAI in Dublin could command crowds of between 60,000 and 80,000. The best the FAI can hope for is a crowd of 35,000. We have reached the stage where the sporting public and particularly the soccer supporters who are there in large numbers have given up hope of ever getting a ticket for a home international because they feel the capacity is not there.</P>
      <P>The IRFU made its position clear. It has a stadium with a capacity of 49,000, including those who stand. In its games against England up to 80,000 could wish to attend the games. The FAI and IRFU are losing massive revenue. People argue that Croke Park is the answer. It may form part of the answer, but it is certainly not the solution to the problem. There are several difficulties with Croke Park, including residents' objections, the need for floodlighting, midweek games, overlapping of fixtures and several others. The truth is that Ireland needs a new stadium, but the question is whether we can devise a method for doing so.</P>

      <P>The Arts Council is now a smaller body than was previously the case, with the emphasis placed on the ability of members to work for the arts sector as a whole rather than to represent any particular sector or art form. I have introduced a &ldquo;rolling&rdquo; membership, whereby half of the members will be changed every 30 months, instead of potentially having a complete change every five years. The Arts Plan, prepared by the Arts Council, is based on principles that I accept, and I will continue to support the council in pursuing these principles.</P>
      <P>The Government has recognised that the existing premises of the National Theatre are inadequate for its long-term needs and in this regard I have received Government approval for the invitation of expressions of interest from private sector developers who may wish to participate in the project on the basis of a public private partnership. My Department is working with the Office of Public Works and the Department of Finance to implement this decision.</P>
      <P>An Agreed Programme for Government gave a commitment to finalise the long-term strategic development of the National Concert Hall. My Department, together with the Office of Public Works, is engaged in exploratory discussions with the Dublin Docklands Development Authority regarding the availability and potential suitability of a site in the Grand Canal Dock area of Dublin to which the National Concert Hall might be relocated. These discussions are ongoing.</P>
      <P>In the area of sport, the National Aquatic Centre has been completed on time and on budget. I have continued to facilitate the provision of sport and recreation facilities on a nationwide basis through the operation of the sports capital programme and the delivery of the local authority swimming pool programme.</P>
      <P>I am currently examining a report received from the Office of Public Works in mid-September on a joint IRFU-FAI proposal for major a stadium development in Dublin and will bring my proposals to Cabinet for decision shortly.</P>
      <P>I have met the chairmen and boards of Horse Racing Ireland, Bord na gCon and the Irish Sports Council to discuss aspects of policy formulation for their respective sectors for the next few years.</P>

      <i>Additional Information</i>Last week, I launched the most comprehensive review of Irish tourism policy carried out in more than a decade. It sets out a new strategy for the development and growth of Irish Tourism for the next ten years plus an action plan to implement that strategy. I provided increased funding this year to enable Tourism Ireland Limited expand marketing overseas of Ireland as a tourist destination.</P>
    <P>The National Tourism Development Authority Act 2003 was signed into law by the President on 13 April 2003 to provide for the establishment of the new National Tourism Development Authority, under the terms of which Bord Fáilte and CERT were dissolved and the new authority known as Fáilte Ireland put in place. In May 2003, I announced the membership of the authority, designating 28 May 2003 as its establishment day. Fáilte Ireland is focusing on the experience of visitors when they get here, by working closely with the tourism industry to provide a one-stop-shop for strategic and practical support to develop and sustain Ireland as a high quality and competitive tourist destination. It is doing this by, <i>inter alia,</i> building capability at all levels within the industry, continuing to develop and promote the critically important home holiday segment and providing support for the six regional tourism authorities.</P>
    <P>In light of the commitment in An Agreed Programme for Government and following a consultative process with promotional, tourism industry and other bodies and consideration of various financing operations, the Government agreed in principle to the provision of a national conference centre by way of a leasing arrangement through an open competitive procurement process. In accordance with the terms of the Government decision, I established a high level steering group in July 2003 comprising representatives of my Department, the Office of Public Works, Fáilte Ireland, the Department of Finance and the National Development Finance Agency to oversee this procurement process. The work of the steering group is ongoing and it is expected that a notice, seeking expressions of interest in the provision of a centre, will issue before the end of the month.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that I have made significant progress on the development of the sectors for which I have responsibility and that I will have delivered on Government policy commitments by the end of the Government's term of office.</P>

      <P>I thank the Minister for his comprehensive reply. I was beginning to get worried by his replies to parliamentary questions. He seemed to feel that the Department of Arts, Sport and Tourism was a detached body over which he had overall authority, but no influence. Of the various programmes the Minister has just listed, which ones are active and which are dormant, and what are the reasons?</P>

      <P>All the strategies I outlined to the House are active at present. In the cultural and institution side, the Abbey Theatre and the National Concert Hall are both being advanced. In tourism, the national conference centre is being advanced and earlier I outlined my proposals on the national stadium. They would be the four major capital projects under the Department's remit. For at least some of these there is agreement that they will not form part of the public capital programme, but will be built by the private sector. For example it is intended to ask the private sector to tender for the national conference centre and the same is true of the Abbey Theatre. There has been no decision on how the National Concert Hall or the National Stadium might be funded.</P>

      <P>As the Cathaoirleach of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Arts, Sport, Tourism, Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs, I congratulate the Minister on the new Arts Act and the developments on the aquatic centre. The provision of the lottery grants around the country is making a major impact. While there are distinctions between tourism, sport and recreation there are also several interlinking areas. Has the Minister looked at the possibility of tying up the cross-departmental aspect of the many policies in his Department? For example, we sell films, theatre and arts events as important tourist destination points and we sell cultural tourism to people who want to experience Ireland, but these are actually the arts. Is the Department doing enough to link what is going on in tourism with arts and sports and to tie the three aspects together? Would that be a worthwhile policy development within the Department? Can we hope that the arts plan will gain the funding this time around that it possibly did not receive in the last Estimate?</P>

      <P>There is a very active management advisory committee within the Department implementing the Department's strategy whose meetings I attend. We are achieving the kind of synergy to which the Deputy aspires. Money for the arts in the coming year is part of the Estimate process which is continuing between me and the Minister for Finance. The Minister for Finance has been relatively kind to the arts. The budget for the Arts Council has increased by 80% since 1997 which is a considerable increase. There was a decrease last year of 7.5% which was <Col N="72" /> regrettable and did cause difficulties. I hope we can do better this year.</P>

      <P>We are conducting an audit of the national sports facilities to see where there are gaps, how they can be filled, to ensure that there is a transparent process on expenditure, and that the money granted is spent on the projects for which applications were made. I agree with Deputy Wall that there are areas of disadvantage which require more attention and this is why RAPID and CLÁR areas receive special attention. As I said earlier, 58% of funding went to areas of disadvantage and the disadvantaged status of the region in question is now a criterion for the provision of grants to given areas. It is important that we try to build as many sporting facilities as possible for young people in areas of disadvantage and I accept Deputy Wall's sentiment in that respect.</P>
      <P>The construction and improvement of waterways is a function of the Office of Public Works and of the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government. I do not have any direct say in these matters. I agree, however, that it is desirable from the tourism perspective that these waterways are improved to the greatest extent possible because they are an attractive feature of our tourism infrastructure.</P>

      <P>The interim Music Board worked extremely hard on the report to which the Deputy refers, and the measures proposed therein are a sincere attempt to devise a system of supports that would bring the Irish commercial music business forward.</P>
      <P>However, I am not yet in a position to agree either to the establishment of the board on a statutory basis, or to the long-term establishment of the kinds of programmes and services that are proposed, pending further consideration of the key issue of whether the input of taxpayers' money that is proposed will yield benefits commensurate with the costs arising. I must also take cognisance of the many other demands for support from the arts sector at a time of budgetary stringency.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CeciliaKeaveney" hpid="Cecilia Keaveney Cecilia Keaveney">

      <P>Does the Minister agree that we need to create performers and audiences for the future to ensure that, as that Shaping the <Col N="73" /> Future document states, we have an employment intensive export-oriented industry which I assume will have a vital role to play in tourism development? It can only be developed if we invest in the development of performers and thus of audiences. Does he agree that we sometimes abdicate responsibility for the advancement of the arts and the proven holistic development of children because this falls between arts and education? We cannot afford to let it fall between those two stools because we have to have practical music tuition at primary and secondary levels brought up to a stronger base than exists in some schools at present, not to underestimate the good work going on at different phases.</P>
      <P>In the context of the upcoming Estimates can we advance the Music Network report to at least initiate the pilot projects mentioned there because it is talking about a 15 year roll-out of that encouragement and support for practical music in the primary and secondary school sectors? Otherwise, another couple of generations of children will go through the school system without the advantage of music as the only subject which is proven to be able to develop the entire brain. I refer the Minister to a recent report completed by our committee. We will be developing that topic further.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>I greatly respect the expertise of the board and I respect Deputy Keaveney's perspective too but I have to address this from a slightly different perspective. I have to take account of a broader canvas than that of this particular industry. To date unfortunately no one has been able to demonstrate that the proposals would not impose a net cost on the Exchequer, rising to a substantial net cost over several years. I remain to be persuaded but on the basis of what I have seen I am somewhat cautious. When we fund the Arts Council or the Irish Film Board we do not look for an overall positive return but the idea of the Music Board was to focus on the commercial sector and this implies that we must apply commercial approaches to assessment.</P>
      <P>I accept that there is a danger of the music industry falling between two stools and the Cork School of Music comes under the remit of the Department of Education and Science. The respective Departments need to work out a coherent approach to music in this context. I intend to set up an education sub-committee of the Arts Council with terms of reference to look into how there can be greater integration and synergy between my Department and the Department of Education and Science on the arts generally. Specifically, it should be in a position to examine the question of how to advance the cause of the music industry in that respect.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CeciliaKeaveney" hpid="Cecilia Keaveney Cecilia Keaveney">
      <NameTxt>Cecilia Keaveney</NameTxt>
      <P>I very much welcome the suggestion of setting up a sub-committee of the Arts Council for education. It is badly needed and overdue. The Minister might also look at the Music Network report and come back to me with <Col N="74" /> his thoughts on that. I used the Shaping the Future document to outline the fact that it proves that music offers intensive employment potential and a significant role in tourism development. I used that as a catalyst for a discussion of how music is seen to be of great advantage, yet there is no investment at primary level to produce the performers of the future. Music education has the spin-off effect of giving a child a good holistic development at primary school level.</P>

      <P>The termination of section 481 relief with effect from the end of 2004 was announced by the Minister for Finance in his 2003 Budget Statement as part of a programme of tax base broadening measures. In view of the likely implications of this measure for the film sector, I commissioned PricewaterhouseCoopers to carry out an analysis of the economic significance of the section 481 scheme. I have recently received their report and will draw on its evaluation of the economic significance of the tax relief in my discussions with my colleague, the Minister for Finance, on future support for the film industry in Ireland. As these discussions must, of their nature, remain confidential, I do not propose to make any public statement for the present on the PWC analysis and conclusions.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PaulNicholasGogartyGP" hpid="Mr. Gogarty Mr. Gogarty">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gogarty</NameTxt>
      <P>Could the Minister publish certain findings of the PWC report indicating, in broad general terms, whether it favoured the Government's current plan to abolish section 481, recommended an alternative scheme or recommended no alternative? This might either relieve some of the industry's fears or give it an opportunity to put forward its own alternative proposals. Given that there are over 4,000 full-time and over 3,000 temporary employees in the film industry, does the Minister agree that the cost of approximately &euro;12 million in relation to the implementation of section 481 &ndash; I refer to the real cost, not the &euro;25 million overall cost which is reduced by certain benefits &ndash; provides advantages to the country to a far greater extent than that figure might suggest? Does he agree that, through employment and other off-shoots, the section 481 incentive is a positive revenue filter rather than a negative one?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Mr. O'Donoghue Mr. O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>I have received two reports, including one from Screen Producers Ireland which set out a very cogent case for the retention of section 481. I have also received the PricewaterhouseCoopers report, the contents of which I am not prepared to divulge at this stage as they are the subject of my ongoing discussion with the <Col N="75" /> Minister for Finance. On a number of public occasions, the Minister for Finance has stated &ndash; and I agree with him &ndash; that the present section 481, as constituted, is open to abuse and has been abused in the past. There is more than anecdotal evidence of this. Any Minister for Finance must ensure, in the interests of Irish taxpayers, that a situation is not tolerated whereby a section can be abused by a minority. Accordingly, I considered it incumbent on me to bring forward concrete proposals to the Minister for Finance to show him that we could continue with section 481 and, at the same time, eliminate to the greatest possible degree the opportunity for abuse of the system.</P>
      <P>Undoubtedly, section 481 has been of enormous benefit to the Irish film industry. It is true that when it was first introduced in this country it was a pioneer of its kind. Unfortunately, other countries followed suit and even improved on the incentive we were offering. It is true that some countries now offer a greater incentive than we do to attract film makers. The cap on the present section 481 seems to cause difficulty for the industry. The figure is approximately &euro;10.5 million and the industry is of the view that it needs to be increased. It is also argued that the cap on the amount which an individual taxpayer can contribute should be increased from &euro;38,000.</P>
      <P>I believe the fact that the cap is at &euro;38,000-odd illustrates section 481 relief is not a haven for the very wealthy &ndash; it is not a tax shelter in that sense. It is my fear that if section 481 goes, we will not be in a position to attract the type of films we have been able to attract in the past. That, in turn, has serious consequences not only for those involved in the industry but for the country's overall image. One of the best ways to sell the attractions of one's country is through film, as evidenced by several examples which I need not mention.</P>
      <P>The current position is that the Minister for Finance and I are getting on with our discussions in relation to section 481 and other matters relevant to my Department. I will not divulge the contents of the PriceWaterhouseCooper report and it would be quite wrong to do so until the current discussions have been completed. I hope we can achieve a fair balance, on the one hand addressing the concerns of the Minister for Finance and, on the other hand, retaining a system which will attract film makers to Ireland, assisting the film industry and the country's general image into the future.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Wall</NameTxt>
      <P>I fully support the Minister in his representations to the Minister for Finance on this matter. Many constituencies, including my own, have benefited enormously from film making, whether on a large or small scale. Many Deputies have had representations from organisations and individuals in relation to the film industry, all seeking to retain section 481. While no one wishes to tolerate tax evasion and related problems, it is the Labour Party's view that the <Col N="76" /> section should be retained. We fully support the Minister's efforts in that regard.</P>

      <P>Section 481 has been very beneficial to the film industry and rural development. I would be concerned that its removal would discourage film making in Ireland and result in the loss of spin-off benefits to many in rural areas. Ultimately, the loss would be to the country and the Exchequer.</P>

      <P>I am pleased to say that the final report of the Tourism Policy Review Group, New Horizons for Irish Tourism, an Agenda for Action, was published on Tuesday 30 September 2003. Copies of the report are available to Members in the Oireachtas Library.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PaulNicholasGogartyGP" hpid="Mr. Gogarty Mr. Gogarty">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gogarty</NameTxt>
      <P>I have a copy of the report. A couple of questions arise from it and there are quite a number of recommendations. Will the Minister indicate how the vision outlined in the report will be made a reality? With regard to the task force being established, what powers will it have to influence other Departments, semi-State bodies and others involved in promoting the tourism industry? Will it have any real clout? Many questions which I have put down to the Minister have been disallowed or transferred on the basis that they were not within the remit of his Department. For example, a recent question about a rip-off in relation to car parking at the cliffs of Moher was rejected. Deputies are unable to raise such issues with the tourism authority and obtain a proper answer and a commitment to follow up the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In that regard, should the task force put a ques<Col N="77" /> tion to the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government about the quality of rivers and the state of the angling industry? The report states that angling is in decline as a pastime, one of the reasons being a poor product. Reading between the lines, that suggests a water quality problem. Walking and cycling activities have declined. In relation to walking activity, does the Minister believe the problem is attributable to land being barred? What powers would a task force have to ensure the findings of the report are implemented?</P>
    <P>In the executive summary of the report, the section dealing with tourism and the environment states that a lead role should be played by tourism industry representative bodies to ensure proper environmental management. Is that passing the buck or should the Minister's Department or the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government also take a lead role to ensure that management?</P>
    <P>As long as there is no proper transport infrastructure in place, the report will be long on vision but short on specifics when it comes to implementing measures that will benefit the tourism industry for years to come.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Mr. O'Donoghue Mr. O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not agree that the report is long on vision but short on implementation measures. In the report the recommendations are clearly set out and, unusually for a report of this nature, the methodology whereby each of them can be achieved is also set out. I am grateful for that to Mr. John Travers, the former chief executive of Forfás who chaired this group in an outstanding manner. I am also grateful to the group as a whole, whose members proved themselves expert in this field.</P>
      <P>The intention is to set up an implementation group with a chairman charged with implementing the recommendations set out in the report. There will be a progress report every six months and a forum every year, meaning we will be in a position to examine progress in implementation of the recommendations.</P>
      <P>It is true that if the report is to be implemented, it will require co-operation from a number of Government Departments. The implementation body itself will not have enforcement powers. Accordingly, I expect the implementation body to make recommendations on the structures that will be required to ensure implementation. I also expect the body to require my Department to become involved formally with other Departments to implement some of the recommendations.</P>
      <P>I will ensure recommendations applying to my Department will be implemented and that State agencies under my remit will pursue the wider agenda with industry representative bodies and my ministerial colleagues. My Department has already started to re-organise its own structures in line with the approach outlined in the report.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Ireland's green image abroad is of immense importance in attracting tourists and it is crucial <Col N="78" /> that we continue to conserve and improve the environment as far as possible. The beauty of our land and seascapes is a major draw and it is of immense importance that the environment remains unspoilt. In that respect, the product development committee, under the remit of Fáilte Ireland, has been examining applications to see if it can grant-aid some environmental proposals that have been put forward. I hope it is in a position to do that because it is of considerable importance.</P>
    <P>This is not a question of passing the buck, it is a question of everyone recognising that they have responsibilities. Staying in some hotels in Ireland, a person will see recycled paper and there will be a sign detailing contributions to the environment but in other hotels there will be no such sign. It is true that the industry itself can help as well. It is a partnership.</P>

    <Title>Dumping at Sea (Amendment) Bill 2000  [  Seanad ]  : Second Stage (Resumed).</Title>
    <P>Question again proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>I welcome the chance to contribute to the debate on this Bill. It is often only those of us who come from a coastal community who stand up to express our thoughts on such an issue. That should not be the case because, as an island, what happens to the sea affects us all and we can all play a role in product development and make a contribution to issues covered by the Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources &ndash; dumping at sea in this case. The Bill was first introduced in 2000 and refers back to the 1996 Act. It is a pity it has taken so long to make its way through the House but if it has been improved in that time that is an acceptable excuse.</P>
      <P>The Bill is an important regulatory measure and will ensure that only material judged by experts to be suitable will be disposed in the sea. That mainly relates to port dredging and it is important that anything that is allowed to be dumped will be disposed of in an appropriate location and in an appropriate manner. That sounds simple but such locations may not be easily found. People see the ports and port dredging coming to the fore and many think they are in for a windfall to develop dredging. I can give a list of those who would be interested to the Department if it is inclined to accept it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="80" />I am glad Government Departments are now involved in the licensing process. It is an indication of the slow pace of the Bill that the Department for Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands has been replaced by the Department of Arts, Sports and Tourism and the heritage portfolio has been taken on by the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government since its publication. The sooner we bring this Bill to a conclusion, before having to start again, the better it will be.</P>
    <P>It makes sense that there is now a Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government. The Department was already responsible for water quality and now covers natural and archaeological heritage and radiological protection. Those dealing with the various areas must co-ordinate their work because although issues under the remit of one Department can be interrelated, that does not always mean there is co-ordination at all levels. From what I have heard about this Bill, that level of co-ordination can and should exist. The fact that the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment is incorporated to address the implications for industry is also to be welcomed.</P>
    <P>It is important that people come forward as soon as they intend to make an application to dump for whatever reason. In terms of rivers and lakes, people sometimes underestimate the reaction an action can cause. Sometimes people fail to realise that putting something in one part of a river can have a knock-on effect in another part of it. If people plan to dredge or dump, it is very important that they avail of the expertise of the Department's heritage and planning division as early as possible. I agree wholeheartedly with the provisions in this regard.</P>
    <P>Electronic publishing of permits is provided for under section 2. As public representatives, we often hear from people who have only discovered that something was planned after it has happened. People may not know where certain applications stand. In the interests of the openness, transparency and accountability to which we aspire, it is very important that the Department's website has been up and running since 1 January 2001. I am glad that those who are not electronically minded will have the facility to acquire information free of charge. This is an issue in terms of many freedom of information requests. This means that those who are not computer orientated or electronically literate are not excluded.</P>
    <P>The fact that there is a statutory obligation to advertise applications is also important. When I read the provision that the advertisement must be made in a local newspaper, I think of my area. When things are advertised in a local paper, people often remark that the paper chosen is not particularly local to them. It might be local to the county, but not to the particular area in question. I would like to see the provision amended to refer to the &ldquo;relevant&rdquo; local newspaper which should be ascertained on a geographical basis. The best <Col N="81" /> selling papers in a particular area should be determined as those are the local newspapers. People have come to me in respect of advertisements, not necessarily for permits but other things, which have appeared in local papers with limited sales in the most relevant geographical areas.</P>
    <P>It is important that people have the chance to say what they think about applications. The 21 day period provided for in the Bill is necessary to provide everyone with the right to have his or her say. A person's opinion should be considered and accommodated and just concerns must be dealt with and be seen to be dealt with. I am therefore pleased that even the commentary will be made available under section 3 of the Bill. Not only will the comments be posted to applicants for a response, they will be put on public display to demonstrate the manner in which decisions are made. This means there will be a great deal of openness on the issue of permits. If, as the Minister said, things are working satisfactorily at the moment, I trust they will work even more satisfactorily once this Bill's provisions are implemented.</P>
    <P>There have been no delays in the awarding of permits and we should ensure that no delays result from the enactment of this legislation. Dredging in Buncrana would be in the interests of the RNLI, the proposed car ferry and marina and many other activities on Lough Swilly. However, the lack of a foreshore licence has delayed dredging. On one side I hear the promise that there will be no delays, but on the other I listen to those in the marine sector of the local council explaining how they are treated. We do not expect delays, yet no progress has been made a couple of years after the process was started.</P>
    <P>It is important that port and harbour plans are in place in respect of dredging and dumping at sea. The Minister has referred to five year plans in relation to which Greencastle and Buncrana both spring to mind. There are major plans for the development of Greencastle which incorporate dredging, but they are pointless if the finance to realise them is not forthcoming. The dredging moneys for Greencastle are the responsibility of the Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources and those for Buncrana, Donegal County Council. While there is a slight difference, I assume the money will come ultimately from the same source, the Department of Finance.</P>
    <P>It is great to be aspirational in terms of making five year plans. People often come to me seeking multi-annual funding and a facility to allow them to budget multi-annually. If the money is not there to carry out five year plans, it is better to be honest and to tell people to forget about dredging and plans for the future. This is not to ignore the fact that significant money has been available in the Department responsible for marine matters in the recent past. When I entered the Oireachtas seven and a half years ago, pitiful amounts of money were available to the Department of the Marine for pier development, har<Col N="82" /> bour strengthening and boat building programmes. I have been very proud to see the development work on wrecked structures right around the peninsula on which I live and boats and major craft are now able to land there. While investment in this regard has been very important, there are ongoing issues in relation to dredging. If there is a five year plan of work, there must be a five year programme in terms of the allocation of money.</P>
    <P>Section 1 of the Bill updates the definition of &ldquo;harbour authority&rdquo; in the 1996 Act for enforcement and related purposes. The new definition takes account of the Harbours (Amendment) Act 2000. I would like someone to explain how things stand in respect of Buncrana Harbour where there is an issue in relation to the harbour authorities. Who is in control and what are the plans in respect of the harbour and the old harbour authority?</P>
    <P>The 1996 Act banned incineration at sea and the dumping of radioactive substances, toxic, harmful and noxious substances and materials. The Act also extended the limit of Irish jurisdiction in relation to dumping at sea from 12 nautical miles offshore to 200 nautical miles in line with the continental shelf. It is important to penalise any person who dumps without a permit and the Bill provides for a monetary penalty and-or imprisonment.</P>
    <P>One cannot look at the issue of the acquisition of dumped material, particularly of a highly toxic nature, without considering Sellafield. It would be good to think we could impose a fine or prison sentence in regard to some of the activity there. Those of us on the northern and eastern coasts have concerns about Sellafield. We would like to see continuing efforts to expedite the closure of the facility.</P>
    <P>On the issue of the days at sea and the argument presented about area six off the north-west coast, because of depleting cod stocks many fishermen are not allowed into a certain box. There is a blanket ban in that regard.</P>
    <P>Coming back to what I said about dumping in appropriate locations and in an appropriate manner, according to the Minister dumping will not be allowed where fisheries, important resources or natural or archaeological sites might be damaged. Sites will be monitored before and after the dumping takes place. An &ldquo;appropriate location for dumping&rdquo; assumes an individual knows about the location in the first place. How much work went into ascertaining the location of these appropriate locations? We are saying that dumping cannot take place where fish stocks are present, yet we are only now starting to work out officially where the cod stocks are located with a view to presenting our case to Europe to ensure the ban on the days at sea can be lifted. Fishermen know from their own local knowledge that some of the areas they are not permitted to enter never had and never will have cod. Their knowledge of the appropriate location of fish stocks <Col N="83" /> has not been properly documented and the crude instrument that is the number of days at sea arose out of that. I am concerned about how we define an appropriate location and I would like to know the work that went into that. If somebody has that information, perhaps they would let the fisheries section in on it so that it can assist us to help our fishermen in respect of the current days at sea argument in Europe.</P>
    <P>I was interested to read that there will be a policy of not allowing the dumping of ships or aircraft at sea. Obviously such dumping is not a good idea because it must have an impact on the marine environment. They are not just wonderful locations in which fish can swim. There are obvious environmental impacts from such material being dumped at sea. I am aware also that much work has already been done in regard to First World War and Second World War boats and planes that now rest at the bottom of our seas. I understand there is a chart showing them but do we know the location of all those boats and planes? Are we considering the damage currently being caused by them?</P>
    <P>When we talk about dumping at sea we are really talking about the environment and trying to improve water quality for all life in the sea. We cannot turn a blind eye to the fact that raw sewage continues to flow into many of our rivers. I recognise that significant moneys have been spent by the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government but my home town does not have a sewerage scheme and most of the sewage from the towns on the Foyle continues to flow into the Foyle estuary. That is not uncommon along the rest of the coast and it is a problem that must be addressed. I am not blaming the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government in that regard but I encourage people in these towns to work with the councils and the Department on identifying sites as soon as possible to ensure the progress being sought by the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government can take place. The rows about where facilities should be located prevent the resolution of the desperate problem of raw sewage flowing into very good rivers. I am under the impression that it is not always a case of the Department not having the money. I am aware that in relation to Donegal significant moneys are earmarked for this purpose.</P>
    <P>I want to refer to a particular type of dumping being imposed on us in the Foyle region, namely, wind turbines. There are 85 30-storey wind turbines in the middle of the Foyle region and I reiterate my objection to them. I am not against wind energy; there are wind turbines on hills in front of my house. These wind turbines will be a possible disaster for the Foyle, not only in terms of the visual impact but in terms of our marine environment. We do not know the impact they will have on our very successful salmon fishery. I object to the fact that the Crown Estates Commission thought it had the right to give away the <Col N="84" /> licence and allow these facilities to be put in place. I trust that will be parked for some considerable time, possibly indefinitely, but should one of these wind turbines fall down, the issue of decommissioning, which is talked about in relation to most parts of Ulster, will also have an effect on Donegal. I do not want wind turbines to be dumped in the sea in front of my house. I am declaring an interest in that regard.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelRing" hpid="Mr. Ring Mr. Ring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ring</NameTxt>
      <P>As a Deputy from a coastal region I am delighted to contribute to this debate. I wish this Bill could be called the dumping at sea and on land Bill because many boats dump at sea and there is a good deal of dumping from the land to the sea. There is also a lot of industrial dumping from one county to another, which I will refer to later.</P>
      <P>It is important that the Bill is before the House to regulate dumping at sea. When the Minister and his officials next go to Brussels I hope they will try to get agreement with their counterparts in Europe, which will not be easy, in regard to material that has already been dumped at sea. I am told reliably by fishermen that nobody knows what material has been dumped. All forms of dumping have taken place over the past 50 years and many coastal communities throughout Europe are now paying a price. Perhaps Ministers and their EU counterparts could discuss that issue at European level.</P>
      <P>There is much talk about what was dumped in the seas around Europe over the past 50 years but it might be a step in the right direction if Governments put some fund in place to investigate what has been dumped, either by using divers or whatever. Fishermen in particular are concerned about what has been dumped there.</P>
      <P>I welcome the fact that there will be public advertisements in the newspapers but there is little point in somebody making an observation to the Department which will be forwarded to the people making the application because they will rubbish it straight away. Ministers are pro-big business, like the local authorities. They know that businesses have money, money pays taxes and Governments have vested interests. Has an appeals mechanism has been put in place in respect of this legislation? There is no point in people going to the trouble of writing to the Minister only to have him send it to the person making the application for the permit. They will respond, the Minister will simply rubber-stamp it and the dumping will be allowed to go ahead, even though those people may have major concerns. Is there any appeals mechanism for people like that?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I saw what happened in north Mayo in relation to the gas pipeline. I want to see gas coming into Mayo but not at any price. The people of north Mayo who objected to the gas pipeline had concerns about whether it would be located onshore or offshore. We were then told it was too expensive to have it offshore and it would be brought onshore. The first proposal was exactly where the <Col N="85" /> tragedy occurred last week. If the Government and certain Ministers had their way, that gas pipeline would have gone over Dooncarton Mountain and there would have been a serious tragedy. It is a pity the same Ministers who fought and pushed so hard for that gas pipeline have not visited the people of north Mayo to see how the State and the Government can help them. That is why they are concerned about their livelihoods, property and homes because they know the Government and Ministers will shout about the gas but if anything goes, they have seen what happens. We have not seen a Minister in north Mayo in the last three weeks since the tragedy. That is why the people are concerned and believe nobody is representing and listening to them. That is why they are concerned about the gas coming in.</P>
    <P>There is much dumping at sea and on land. We have another problem in north Mayo where industrial waste is being brought from Cork, a big city, a long way from Mayo and Geesala. The waste is being driven from industries in Cork to Mayo passing by many fine towns, motorways, airports and so on. The people of north Mayo were concerned but the county council allowed the waste to be dumped. The people of north Mayo did not matter. They had to collect money and get a judicial review from An Bord Pleanála which they won. Industrial waste continues to be brought from Cork even though those concerned have been told by An Bord Pleanála they need a planning application and that there is a review to the High Court. Do the officials from the Department not think that should stop until the review is held in the High Court? These lorries are flying in&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelRing" hpid="Mr. Ring Mr. Ring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ring</NameTxt>
      <P>I am talking about dumping on land. This is what is happening &ndash; dumping on land and dumping on the people of north Mayo.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle An Ceann Comhairle">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>Unfortunately, that is not included in this legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelRing" hpid="Mr. Ring Mr. Ring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ring</NameTxt>
      <P>I will come back to that in a minute but I would like to finish this point. Do the officials not think this dumping should cease given that the people of north Mayo went to An Bord Pleanála and won? That has not happened. Big business has won out again. The officials of Mayo County Council have not seen fit to bring the operators to the High Court to stop them operating.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The State is the biggest polluter of the sea. Sewage is going into the sea on a daily basis because proper sewerage schemes have not been put in place in coastal towns. The law in this country is set up for law-abiding citizens. If one cannot get the people who break the law, one gets the people who sometimes just step on the right <Col N="86" /> side of the law and who are penalised. Who will police the sea? The only time we see Naval Service boats off the north coast of Mayo is on the day the salmon season starts because the salmon have to be tagged. It is a wonder they cannot tag the waste being thrown off boats from all over the world. Spanish fishermen come in, destroy lobster pots, dump what they want and the people on the west, north, south and east coasts must pick up what has been washed up on shore, sometimes a few years later. Who will police this legislation? How will it be policed and do we have the resources to police what is going on at sea? I would like the Minister to respond to that.</P>
    <P>It is important that policing is put in place. There is no point passing legislation if there are not people to police it. I was going to say I did not want a police state but we have one already in that it appears one cannot drink, smoke, drive and walk down the street because of crime.</P>
    <P>The Government has an obligation to ensure there are proper sewerage schemes in place in all coastal communities. I hear people talk about Sellafield and I, like everybody else, want to see it closed. When on this side of the House, Members lecture those on the other side but when they move over to the other side, they do not lecture anybody. We lecture Sellafield and we are worried about radioactivity regarding what is being dumped at sea and about our people, and rightly so. I would like to see that place closed but let us see what we can do regarding our industrial waste and sewage going into the sea.</P>
    <P>If we are so concerned about the sea, why are we not actively fighting for money for coastal communities to guard against coastal erosion? That is a big issue. The coast is being washed into the sea. Private property is being flooded by the sea but people do not own the sea or the shoreline. They should be protected but they are being told that private property cannot be protected. This is not an issue for central government or for the county councils. The funding is not in place to deal with coastal erosion because of its high cost. It is time to get commitments from Europe because this is happening all over Europe. Last Christmas I watched Sky television and saw the high tides all over Europe and some of the coastlines being washed away. It is important that we stop the coastlines being washed into the sea. It is dumping at sea and it is something we should protect against. The local authorities have done their best with limited resources in many coastal areas in this country. I would like to see more resources being put in place.</P>
    <P>The Bill is welcome. We want to know what people who make an application for a permit are dumping at sea. If waste is being dumped, it should be supervised and registered. I hope the Minister and the Department will monitor it and put the people in place. I am worried about one aspect of the Bill which states that a number of Ministers and Departments must be contacted. If the Ceann Comhairle wrote to the Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources <Col N="87" /> tomorrow morning asking it a serious question, wait and see how long he would have to wait to get a reply. It is not the quickest or the brightest Department for writing back. I wrote to the Department last November and I got a reply last week. If genuine people who want to dump waste must go through a number of Departments, this Bill will be successful because there will not be dumping at sea &ndash; the waste will all be dumped in the Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources and the Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs. Since it will take them so long to reply, I would not have any worries about dumping at sea.</P>
    <P>There is enough red tape and there are enough people who find it difficult enough to survive in life and in business without sending them to three or four Departments. One Department should have responsibility. If one Department writes to another, even if they are only across the road from each other, it will take them a number of years to reply. It is difficult enough to get a decision from any Department without having two or three Departments involved. I hope that issue will be looked at on Committee Stage because I am worried about it.</P>
    <P>Where somebody makes an application, I have no problem with another Department making an observation but I do not want to see the Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources state, as a stalling tactic, that it must write to the Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs. If an advertisement appears in the newspaper, a Department should, by all means, make an observation. If each Department has to be contacted, I foresee all sorts of problems with this Bill. I hope this issue will be dealt with on Committee Stage. Why can a Department, like the public, not make an observation? The Minister could then consider that observation which could be passed on to the person making the application. That would be a reasonable request. Otherwise, if there is red tape, we will have major difficulties.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources and the Government will take this up at European level. There are major concerns about dumping at sea over the past 50 years. People are concerned that the sealed containers used for dumping materials are now beginning to leak. However, we do not fully know. It is no wonder that certain things happen on the coastline. One day, one sees beautiful clear water and the following day, it is polluted. No one can say what the pollution is, but it must come from the sea.</P>
    <P>Our seacoast has been taken over by Spanish fisherman with massive vessels which pollute the coastline and take from the local fish stocks. I will conclude, a Cheann Comhairle, though I would like to say more on gas exploration and dumping in north County Mayo and Glancre Teoranta. County Cork, as a thriving economy should be able to deal with its own industrial waste. As a <Col N="88" /> colleague of mine, Councillor Gerry Coyle, said, when Mayo did not get any part of the Celtic tiger, we do not want its dung.</P>
    <Speaker pid="KathleenLynch" hpid="Ms Lynch Ms Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Ms Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a very short Bill, an extension of the Dumping at Sea Act 1996. As for Deputy Ring's comments, the way we deal with our waste, whether at sea or inland, should not be a county by county issue. We must have a clear-cut national policy on it. It is not fair for one county to deposit that which it cannot deal with in someone else's backyard. It has to be dealt with somewhere but it should not be on a county by county basis. People should not have to go to the High Court&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="KathleenLynch" hpid="Ms Lynch Ms Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Ms Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;to address a fear they have. The 1996 legislation was comprehensive. There was much consultation with fisheries organisations and industrial interests before the original Bill was put in place. Coming from Cork city, I welcome the proposal that harbours be defined and included in the legislation. Cork is a harbour city divided by the river so it impinges on all aspects of city life. When one comes from a harbour city, one sees the clear link between the sea and the harbour. To define harbours and their control in this Bill is essential and long overdue.</P>
      <P>Deputy Ring spoke of the offshore gas and oil industries. County Cork has been the beneficiary from offshore exploration for the past 25 years. The offshore industry was the mainstay of Cork Harbour and many families in the area during that time. It is a good industry and if well run, it can be an exceptionally clean industry. It is an industry that gives a good livelihood to the people who work in it.</P>
      <P>However, there are difficulties in the industry. Last summer was one of the busiest summers for offshore exploration off the Kinsale Head. Over recent years we had been told that the gas supplies were running out. However, there are now new successful exploration wells, but despite this, there is no training programme for people working in the industry. I call on the Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources to take a serious look at this. The majority of workers in this industry, whose lifespan one can predict, are now foreign workers. I know we are in the EU and I have no objection to foreign expertise coming in. However, I am talking about people who with a little training and certification in the Irish industry could do the job well. It is a huge loss, particularly in revenue, that there is no training scheme for this industry in which there are huge tax write offs. The only financial spin-off from gas and oil exploration is through the buying of goods onshore and long-term employment. I ask the Minister to take a serious look at what can be put in place for the offshore gas and oil industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to dumping at sea and the notion of five-year dredging permits, I accept that dredg<Col N="89" /> ing is an essential part of any harbour activity. Anyone who lives in a harbour city realises that dredging is vitally important. Mapping of the harbour is equally important to ensure that one does not interfere with a sensitive system. People talk about ecosystems but when one is dealing with the sea, rivers, harbours or coastal areas, one is talking about a sensitive landscape. If an area is dredged in November 2002, it might not necessarily be ideal to dredge it two years later. Work on a tidal harbour must be delicately balanced and we need to be careful in that regard. This is why I have concerns with the five year dredging permits. Such permits are acceptable if there are regular reviews.</P>
    <P>In the 1990s, before the Dumping at Sea Act 1996 was introduced, certain industries in Cork Harbour had their own ships to dump at sea. The materials dumped included chemicals and liquid water. The permits stated that dumping had to be done from beyond a 12 mile radius. Those who knew anything about the harbour knew that as soon as these ships hit Roche's Point, the pipes were opened and the dumping started. By the time they got to the 12 mile limit, they simply turned around and came back into port. The legislation introduced in 1996 and public outcry at what was happening in the harbour put a stop to that practice.</P>
    <P>Legislation such as this Bill is essential. Not alone can it be effective in terms of monitoring and the imposition of penalties, but it can also make us aware of the damage we are doing to the environment. There is a problem with dumping at sea. Deputy Ring referred to tracking polluters, policing the system and implementing sanctions. There is a tracking system in place that deals with sea traffic. That is how ships in trouble are pinpointed. However, it is centrally European led. Deputy Ring is right that the difficulties with this legislation concerning implementation, monitoring and penalties must be dealt with on a central European basis.</P>
    <P>What shipping does at sea gives rise to problems. We have all seen polystyrene cups coming up on the beach because they do not sink. At least we can pick them up &ndash; it is the stuff that sinks which worries me. One day the sea is clear for miles around and the next day a pool of oil is floating on it. This is due to the fact that ships have to clean out their tanks and this is usually done at night. If the will is there, it can be monitored by satellite. Deputy Ring referred to this phenomenon of the sea being clear one day and polluted the following day, which is probably due to the ship cleaning process.</P>
    <P>Detergent is used to wash out the tanks or bilges. This is done to prevent corrosion and to stop shellfish getting into pipes or pumps. The process, therefore, is hazardous to shellfish. When tanks are emptied the detergent also comes out, resulting in polluted water and a threat to shellfish. It is possible to police this area and control it so that those responsible are penalised.</P>
    <P>In the past, for the most part, we have relied <Col N="90" /> on European directives to ensure the safety and pollution-free status of our seas. All of the major issues have been addressed. I am pleased to note the inclusion of harbours in the legislation. This legislation is easy to deal with because Deputy Gilmore addressed a comprehensive element of it in 1996. Difficulties still exist, however, but they can be easily resolved if the political will exists.</P>
    <P>The sea is not a sponge. It will not take everything we throw at it. Marine life will become ill and die in some areas. Plant life will die off, which will affect fish stocks. There will also be an effect on our harbours and shorelines, as there will be on us. If legislation does nothing more than make us more sensitive to what we are doing to the sea, then it is a good thing.</P>
    <P>I have concerns in regard to the five-year dredging permit. While I agree that a five-year plan in respect of dredging for the harbour is a good idea, we should be conscious of the fact that harbours by their very nature constantly alter.</P>

      <P>The many contributors to this discussion have added much to the consideration of the legislation before us. Whether we call it rubbish, toxic or non-toxic waste or refuse, we are dealing with what we discard. It is a by-product of the economic activity of a First World country. The greater the economic activity, the greater the amount of waste that is created. Unfortunately we do not know what to do with this waste; whether to dump it at sea, put it in landfill or incinerate it, as some people would like to do. We have to get rid of waste somehow. This issue needs to be considered with the utmost care.</P>
      <P>This legislation may help to stop the current abuse, in the same way as dumping on land has been abused for so long. We have a cavalier attitude to dumping all kinds of waste. We have allowed landfill sites to leach into waterways. We have seen people who should know better dumping things such as creosote into waterways. As has been pointed out by many Members, I am sure the same type of behaviour happens at sea where ships wash out their tanks and dump waste indiscriminately into the oceans as if it can take it all. It is important that we improve on the current position.</P>
      <P>An international commitment is required, or at the very least, an EU-wide commitment, so that countries work together to resolve this issue. Economic issues are difficult to deal with because countries compete with each other. If we try to impose a higher standard regarding waste disposal or the quality of ships, our contribution will not be as great if we work alone. An opportunity exists when we take over the Presidency of the European Union in January. We could initiate an EU-wide policy in regard to waste disposal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are two main issues in regard to waste disposal, whether it is at sea or anywhere else, namely, the effect on the environment and the immediate and long-term effects on our coastline, waterways and land. We have a very poor record <Col N="91" /> in regard to environmental protection, in spite of the setting up of the Environmental Protection Agency and the legislation that is coming through.</P>
    <P>A potential disaster for the environment is the towing across the Atlantic Ocean of warships from the United States that have been languishing in ports there for the past 50 or 60 years. These ships could easily break up as they cross the ocean, regardless of the number of tugs available. That would not really bother those that are getting rid of them, as it would do the job that is to be done on Teesside anyway. It is a further example of the cavalier attitude we have towards the environment that we would move these rusting hulks of disintegrating metal across a rough ocean and expect that they would safely reach their destination.</P>
    <P>Reference was made to the amount of sea traffic that passes our coast. Many of these ships travel our seas under flags of convenience, which is nothing more than an opportunity to ignore workers' rights, environmental controls and the rights of all citizens where these ships ply their trade. Flags of convenience is another issue which needs to be tackled but, again, it must be done in a much larger forum than Dáil Éireann. It needs to be done on an EU-wide level. We allow these ships to dock in our ports. I accept that there is an economic argument to the effect that we cannot go too hard on these ships because we would lose the economic advantage to China or the United States which will allow these ships to continue working and, therefore, traverse the oceans more cheaply.</P>
    <P>Some Deputies have even received deputations from people who work on these boats. There is a health and safety dimension to this issue. People on board these ships have been involved in numerous disasters, some of which were mentioned in the course of the discussion today. Many other disasters have occurred because these ships literally fell apart while at sea. As a result, seafarers lost their lives. These seafarers usually come from poorer countries and are dependent on the meagre wage they get on board these ships. We have chosen to ignore their plight because it suits us from an economic point of view to see somebody else working on these dangerous ships. We should also remember that when these ships fall apart, especially if they do so near our coastline, they add to the environmental disasters which affect the country.</P>
    <P>Most of the important issues have already been discussed at length by speakers today. It is difficult for the Ceann Comhairle to ensure that we stay at sea and refrain from coming to land with the issues we discuss. It is important that we take on board many of the things that have been said by different contributors. As a national assembly we should decide to move this issue into a bigger arena, in this case the European Union, and enact legislation that is enforced evenly across the EU. We could also possibly use our influence in fora <Col N="92" /> such as the World Trade Organisation where Mr. Peter Sutherland, a former EU Commissioner and an Irishman, is proof that Ireland's influence is international. We should use our influence to ensure the environment is protected.</P>
    <P>We have good laws governing the movement of goods and ships on our oceans, but we should not forget the human aspect. The lives of many seafarers are put at risk daily simply because we choose to ignore the danger which many of these ships pose to both their lives and to our environment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ArthurMorganSF" hpid="Mr. Morgan Mr. Morgan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morgan</NameTxt>
      <P>I regard this Bill with amazement for a number of reasons. I agree with much of the sentiment of the Bill. The explanatory memorandum states that the Bill will not require any additional funding from the Exchequer. That suggests that this Bill will probably join the many other Acts on the Statute Book where it will sit waiting to be pulled out and acted upon in the distant future.</P>
      <P>If additional funding is not available, who will police dumping at sea? If it is to be merely a passive process involving the issue of permits, that will leave much to be desired. Those who are the greatest offenders when it comes to dumping at sea have absolutely no intention of ever seeking a permit for their activities. I hope this is not merely legislation that will sit there.</P>
      <P>It is common knowledge that through the late 1940s, 1950s and even into the early 1960s, the British Ministry for Defence was using the Beaufort Dyke in the Irish Sea as a dumping ground for its toxic waste such as munitions left over from the Second World War. Who was policing that activity and how will it be policed now if it is still happening? Nobody can say if this is so. I wonder if General John de Chastelain is not misplaced in his present activities and whether he should instead be examining how British weapons are currently being disposed of. I have many reservations about their activities. I suggest a mini peace process between our Government and the British Government for the purpose of curtailing their wayward activities in the Irish Sea and other areas.</P>
      <P>I question why the issue of radioactive emissions is not included in the Bill. Many other contributors to the debate have referred to Sellafield. We know that British Nuclear Fuels is constantly spewing out radioactive material into the air and also into the sea. We are aware that it has a serious adverse effect on marine life, not just in the Irish Sea, regarded as the most radioactive sea in the world, but right around the Irish coast and as far north as the Nordic countries. It is unfortunate that this Bill does not seek to deal with that type of activity. That is why I have described it as an amazing Bill because it deals with many issues and completely omits some important areas of concern.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I readily accept that in response to people pressure the Government has acted more positively on the Sellafield issue than any previous <Col N="93" /> Government and I hope it will continue to do so. I hope that the people pressure will continue. I welcome the fact that the Sellafield issue has been raised on a regular basis. We should use every available opportunity to fight British Nuclear Fuels on the Sellafield issue. The health of those who live on the eastern seaboard is adversely affected by Sellafield.</P>
    <P>In the context of the value of the marine to the Irish economy it is unfortunate that the Government is considering the abandonment of the marketing division of Bord Iascaigh Mhara and moving it over to Bord Bia.</P>
    <P>The Bill refers to dredging and dredging activities but it does not define what dredging is or refer to dredging and acquaculture. Where does dredging fit in relation to aquaculture activity? Aquaculture dredging is big business all around the coast and provides a livelihood for many people. Will the Bill exempt mussel dredging, cockle dredging and razor fish dredging, which is increasing? These issues must be considered or certainly tightly defined in the Bill.</P>

      <P>No. If people have beards it is probably not relevant at all.</P>
      <P>Sewage emissions into the sea have been alluded to by other contributors and I will not dwell on the matter, but local authorities and the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government have a responsibility in that regard. We cannot point a finger at other people and issue warnings, fines and penalties against dumping at sea if this Government and successive Governments since the foundation of the State have simply authorised the unmitigated pouring of raw sewage into the sea. I look forward to contributing on Committee Stage of the Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Perry</NameTxt>
      <P>Fine Gael fully supports this Bill, which is sensible, logical and uncontentious. It represents part of a body of legislation passed in this House designed to create a better natural environment and also through its provisions protects a vital indigenous aquaculture industry which is growing.</P>
      <P>Ireland is an island nation and I am often amazed at the lack of development of the potential of aquaculture. Sligo has an extensive coastline. For the development of aquaculture it is critically important to deal with marine environmental concerns to protect the foundation on which this fine industry can be built.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill passed all Stages in the Seanad but is only now reaching the Dáil. It amends the Dumping at Sea Act 1996 which strengthened and <Col N="94" /> replaced earlier legislation for the control of dumping at sea in line with updated international obligations of the State. That Act widened Irish jurisdiction in the waters around the island from 12 miles to up to 350 miles in relation to what can be dumped in the sea. This has provided more scope and potential but the commitment to police this area of sea will be a significant undertaking. Illegal dumping on land can be well policed but I have no doubt that some people will avail of dumping at sea without seeking permits.</P>
    <P>A previous speaker referred to the financial implications of this Bill and the fact that there is no contingency for further funding. I ask the Minister of State to explain how this will be policed and his policy regarding the powers of the coastguard on this issue. The obligation to obtain permits is to be welcomed but I do not foresee self-regulation being effective without stringent controls.</P>
    <P>One of its main provisions is the inclusion of port companies in the definition of &ldquo;harbour authorities&rdquo;. That is long overdue. It will help to ensure our modern and constantly changing marine infrastructure is included in the Bill's remit.</P>
    <P>The Sligo Harbour and port authority has huge development potential. There is an agreement in principle that Sligo Harbour will be taken over by Sligo County Council. I know that permission has been sought from the Department to authorise that under the Harbours Act 1946. That would entitle the county council to take control of Sligo Harbour. Sligo Harbour and the adjoining property, which is part of the remit of Sligo Harbour Commissioners, is a huge resource. It is critically important that a clear mandate is given for the potential development of Sligo Harbour. I am sure the area could be developed through private enterprise and joint ventures, particularly when one considers the level of port activity in other regions. Sligo Harbour offers great potential for investment. However, little or no Government support has been given to Sligo for many years. Certain dredging work was carried out. There is an ambitious plan to develop the port from a commercial and tourism point of view. However, it is currently in limbo due to the lack of a clear response from the Minister about Sligo County Council's entitlement to take control of this critical asset. The county council has agreed this will happen. I ask the Minister to accelerate that application and to clearly indicate to Sligo County Council when that will take place. This delay is affecting potential investment not only by the State but by private enterprise which is critically important to develop Sligo Harbour.</P>
    <P>Sligo is a spatial growth region. We all speak about the infrastructural deficit. We have a port and facilities, but we need a licence to develop it. Sligo has an airport and a port, which has historic connections. During the Famine thousands of people from the north-west left Sligo Port on their way to America. It was a prominent port in <Col N="95" /> past decades. The time has come to re-establish Sligo Port not only as a commercial port but as a tourism amenity. It is underdeveloped. It should be developed as a matter of urgency.</P>
    <P>As regards the marina at Rosses Point, Government funding has been secured for its development as a tourist amenity. It is critically important that this funding is spent in Rosses Point. It is one of the biggest tourist attractions in the north-west. Many people take a coastal tour of Ireland on boats and yachts, yet there is not a major tourist amenity at Rosses Point. I am glad the funding has been put in place in partnership with the county council. That issue must be dealt with decisively so that we can develop Sligo's tourism potential. We should work to improve such assets as Sligo Harbour and the marina at Rosses Point.</P>
    <P>This Bill also extends the list of Ministers who must be consulted about permits for dumping at sea. It is unfortunate that we must debate this issue. Perhaps we could have a system where such changes could be made in the Dáil. It is important to debate this issue in the House because we are all aware of Ireland's potential as a tourist destination. Our coastal waters are important not only for aquaculture but also for tourism. We all know about the blue flag system. I come from a region with some great coastal attractions, such as Mullaghmore, which has blue flag status, Rosses Point, Strandhill and Enniscrone. All these areas have potential. However, it is critically important that we retain our blue flag status. Strandhill is internationally acclaimed as one of the finest surfing beaches in Europe. We must promote the development of the area.</P>
    <P>There is an obligation on the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government to ensure that adequate funding is provided. There is an obligation on the Government to invest in sewerage systems and proper facilities to ensure that sewage and other material does not go into the ocean and into our rivers and lakes. A big investment is needed in Enniscrone. We had a debate during the summer about the lack of sewerage and treatment facilities in Enniscrone and the discomfort caused to people who visit a major coastal town which does not have proper State investment. We need investment to guarantee total blue flag status for the region. We must ensure that the Department and other relevant Departments are given the necessary finance to put the proper infrastructure in place to prevent pollution at sea.</P>
    <P>I can speak on this subject with a certain degree of knowledge as I come from a county which has an extensive coastline. The people of Mullaghmore have been seeking funding for some considerable time from the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government to ensure that proper sewage treatment facilities, waste water units, etc., are provided. Unfortunately, the treatment facilities along Sligo's coastline leave a lot to be desired. It would <Col N="96" /> be remiss of me if I did not mention the urgent need to deal with these issues when discussing this Bill.</P>
    <P>Those who seek permission to dump at sea must make public their applications through newspaper advertisements. That is the most important provision in the Bill because it allows for a public consultation period during which the merits of any decision can be debated. It is important to clarify where that will be debated, who will be entitled to attend and if it will be widely advertised. Perhaps the Minister could explain how and in what centres throughout the country that public consultation will take place and if it will pertain to the coastal areas nearest to a land mass.</P>
    <P>The Bill also states that the Minister must consider any likely interference with our important natural or archaeological heritage when considering whether to grant a licence to dump at sea. It is extraordinary that that is not already the case. Fine Gael is delighted that measure has been included. It allows for the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government to be responsible for the natural heritage of the area and the water where dumping is proposed in the same way as it would be responsible for such an area of land. It is critically important that was included. The famous Armada collection is located off the coast of Sligo at Streedagh. It is one of the biggest attractions in the area, but, unfortunately, it is at the bottom of the sea. My predecessor, the former Deputy, Ted Nealon, has discussed on many occasions the possibility of raising that ship which contains cannons and many other important artefacts. There are a number of ships off Streedagh, which is outside Grange on the coast of north Sligo.</P>
    <P>It is critically important that we identify the rich archaeological heritage that exists and create a database of the major artefacts in view of the possibility of future funding from the State. They should be given priority when funding is available from various Departments and marked out as areas that need further study in view of the possibility of bringing these treasures to land. Nothing is impossible and they are very near the coastline. I appeal to the Minister to make sure that efforts are made to raise the major treasure of the Armada collection off the coast of Sligo at Streedagh.</P>
    <P>It is worth noting in the context of this Bill that five-year dredging and dumping permits have been granted to the Dublin Port Company, the Drogheda Port Company and the Port of Cork Company. The Port of Waterford Company submitted a five-year dredging and dumping plan for consideration but is currently in the process of carrying out a detailed monitoring programme in connection with its proposal. Shannon Foynes Port Company is expected to submit its five-year plan soon for approval. It is all about planned projections and careful analysis of possible future developments. It is important that the obligation is on <Col N="97" /> the State, using its regulatory powers, and those in the waste business to ensure that permits are in place.</P>
    <P>As the Minister of State said yesterday, dumping is not allowed where fisheries, important resources or natural or archaeological heritage would be damaged. Dumping sites are monitored before and after dumping takes place, as the Department requires, to ensure that any dumping is properly carried out. It surprises me that no resources are provided to deal with this aspect of the Bill, although it will cost money to police this. It is hard enough to police illegal dumping on land but when it comes to the coastline we are dealing with highly skilled, highly trained personnel. Increased powers will be needed by the authorities because those who are dumping waste 50 miles off the coast will be masters of their art. This legislation is important but it is also important to ensure adequate policing in this area. The Minister might explain his plans in this regard. What powers will he have and what penalties will be attached?</P>
    <P>Permission has been, and will continue to be, refused for the dumping at sea of any harmful materials found on the seabed of any port or harbour. Non-dumping at sea treatment is insisted upon in such cases, in consultation with the Environmental Protection Agency. This should also be considered for dredging. Where does the Minister intend that the material be placed? How are harmful materials dealt with at the moment if they cannot be brought out to sea? The Minister will be aware of the controversy surrounding the shredding of beef and the facilities for storing up to 90,000 tonnes of beef in the south of the country when it was found that it could not be exported or dumped. Could the Minister tell me whether any of that beef was dumped at sea? I do not envy the Minister his job &ndash; policing the coast is a big job but policing and monitoring dumping at sea is a bigger one still.</P>
    <P>It is important that the sentiments behind this Bill are acknowledged. It is a much-needed Bill, although I do not envy the Minister's task, or that of the Department, in ensuring that the law is upheld. People who are law-abiding will do their business correctly and obtain permits, but those who want to get rid of their waste without going through official channels will represent a difficulty. The Department must have on file the names of those who have participated in illegal dumping in the past. It is important that these companies and bodies be carefully monitored. One could hardly argue with such a provision and this should act as a reminder that dumping cannot be a <i>fait accompli.</i> Perhaps such sanction will act as a deterrent to anyone thinking of dumping such material.</P>
    <P>Perhaps the most important aspect of this Bill is the message it sends out. Ireland's waters are not for sale and this House is fulfilling its obligations in protecting them. We sold our oil rights many years ago &ndash; at least we are now claiming environmental rights over our waters. It is <Col N="98" /> important that we consider Ireland's potential for aquaculture, tourism and related growth industries. Anybody who comes from Ireland or another jurisdiction into the area of 355 square miles surrounding Ireland should be aware that we are now policing the area and will be taking action if anybody from another country is caught breaking Irish law within it.</P>
    <P>As my party's deputy spokesperson on communications, marine and natural resources said yesterday, many Ministers have been in office since this legislation was introduced, including Deputy Fahey and former Deputy Hugh Byrne, and it is very disappointing to have to wait this long to see it come before the House. Nevertheless, I thank the Minister for introducing it. He also raised the important issue of the Sellafield plant. People living on the coastline from County Louth to the south-east are concerned about the possibility that the plant is polluting the sea. The Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government and the Attorney General are trying to obtain some answers from the authorities at Sellafield. On a recent visit, members of a Fine Gael delegation were frightened to see what went in and out. If an accident happened we would be in serious trouble because of the closeness of our coastline.</P>
    <P>Fine Gael would like to ask a number of serious questions of the authorities at Sellafield, but they will always give a political answer. They will only give an answer that suits them, not an honest one. This is regrettable. An accident is waiting to happen and the public is very concerned about this. Families are concerned about the health of their children and we are all concerned about the health of marine life in the Irish Sea. Surely, at a time when we are discussing dumping at sea, we cannot ignore the greatest threat to our environment &ndash; one that lies across our waters but threatens them every day. The Government has acted forcefully on this issue, but I appeal to the Minister of State to keep up the pressure. I welcome the Bill and commend it to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanBoyle" hpid="Mr. Boyle Mr. Boyle">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boyle</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to share my time with Deputy Connolly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Like most other speakers in this debate, I welcome the intent of this Bill. Any concerns my party and I have are about how the intent can be turned into reality. My first concern is the Bill's very long gestation &ndash; Second Stage of the Bill is taking place three years after the Bill was introduced. As a result, the Bill has become slightly anachronistic. The Bill includes on a list of Ministers to be consulted. It includes the Minister for Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands &ndash; a Minister that no longer exists. Also mentioned is the Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources, a position which also no longer exists. There is a possibility that all Stages of the Bill will not have been completed before the next Cabinet reshuffle, during which there may be more <Col N="99" /> changes in designation for members of the Government.</P>
    <P>This Bill is a sincere attempt to produce legislation that ensures better respect for our marine environment. Our history in this regard is not something of which our country can be proud, despite the fact that this is an island nation. Many of the advances that have been made in this regard have been foisted on us &ndash; possibly through embarrassment &ndash; by European directives. At last we are beginning, through our legislative process, to adopt the means by which we can make clear statements as to what can, or should not, take place in the marine environment.</P>
    <P>During the 1970s and early 1980s, as an assist to industrial development, there was encouragement, almost on a nod and wink approach, for large-scale dumping of materials at sea that should never have been permitted. Many high-risk industries producing much unwanted waste are located in the Cork south central constituency, which I represent. In the past, much of this waste was disposed of with the tacit acceptance of State authorities, in a way that was unacceptable then and which is now illegal. When the legislation is enacted, however, to what extent will we be able to prevent those practices, even if they are illegal? </P>
    <P>We have a method of monitoring waste and through the various EU directives and our domestic legislation, restrictions have been placed on the types of material that can be disposed of. We are now talking largely about silt or earth materials but even they carry a high risk. The permit system allowed 1.6 million tonnes of material to be disposed of by the Port of Cork company last year, which I find astounding. Much of that material concerned the ordinary ebb and flow of port business, including dredging because much of Cork Harbour has had to be reclaimed. In addition, the aftermath of infrastructural projects, such as the construction of the Jack Lynch tunnel, involved a lot of material that had to be disposed of eventually. Particular diligence and proper controls will be required in future concerning sites, such as the former Irish Steel-ISPAT one, where there were earth movements in the past and where much of the ground is contaminated. A similar argument could be made about the IFI plant at Marino Point.</P>
    <P>Silt or earth materials can look the same in any one container but there is no proper system of ongoing monitoring to ensure it is tested before disposal. I am dubious as to whether the resources exist to ensure such monitoring can take place and will be ongoing after the enactment of this legislation. The Minister should examine how such mechanisms can be devised. In saying that, I am repeating the argument made by other speakers that the Bill does not put in place resources to ensure the implementation of its legislative provisions. That is a mistake.</P>
    <P>We are well served by the Naval Service, albeit a small one, that has environmental protection as <Col N="100" /> part of its remit. It may not even be a first priority, however, because its remit also includes fishery protection and national defence. I am not convinced that the necessary expertise can be found within the Naval Service to provide the required level of environmental protection. Such expertise can only be provided through additional resources, although there is a potential source of expertise that should not cost the State that much money. In this regard, the Minister and the Department should examine the voluntary coastguard service, whose expertise has served us well. The men and women of the coastguard service know their local environment intimately and even though it is a voluntary service we do not use it to the extent that we could.</P>
    <P>These people know about the most recent movements in the general marine environment and they can identify anyone who has been involved in illegal dumping, as well as the type of material being disposed of. Legislation such as that before the House could have a greater effect given an enhanced, strengthened and better resourced coastguard service. The Minister should investigate that suggestion, which could be applied more generally to include the involvement of coastguard personnel in applying recent regulations from the Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources governing the wearing of lifejackets by all boat users. That oversight should be corrected.</P>
    <P>The suggested change in the law requiring advertisements to be placed in local newspapers concerning permits for dumping at sea is a welcome development. It is something we have already seen within the planning system but I suggest the change should be taken further. One problem with on-site notices for general planning &ndash; I suspect it will apply also to notices concerning dumping at sea &ndash; is that they may not be seen by those directly concerned. The onus should be placed on those seeking to dispose of waste to make those most likely to be affected aware of what is happening. In the Scottish planning system, for instance, as well as there being an onus to place newspaper advertisements and on-site planning notices, there is also a requirement to inform those who are directly involved in a planning application, within a 250 yard radius. The legislation should list those who must be directly informed of dumping at sea, such as fishery boards, other maritime bodies and residents on the coast and elsewhere who may live near the transit route of the waste material to be dumped. Such a provision would ensure that the public is kept informed of developments.</P>
    <P>I do not have a direct criticism of the general legislation, other than the improvements I have suggested. My colleague, Deputy Eamon Ryan, has indicated a willingness to address these matters in committee. I hope the Minister will be willing to accept those suggested improvements.</P>
    <P>While we have reduced dumping at sea largely to inert material, such as silt and earth, we should not take it for granted that they are not damaging <Col N="101" /> the environment in their own right. Because these silt and earth materials contain nutrients, one is running the risk of upsetting the ecosystem around the dumping ground by putting a large amount of such material on a new site. That is another obvious omission from the Bill. Even though the issue of biodiversity has been included in some of the Seanad amendments, the fact that one ecosystem is interfered with by waste material means that such effects should be measured to see whether they are benign or negative. We have a responsibility in this regard, not only for the existing environment but also for generations to come.</P>
    <P>The Bill has been welcomed by all sides of the House but I sense a willingness by the Government to improve it. The Green Party is prepared to play its part by making whatever helpful suggestions it can to improve the legislation further.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaudgeConnolly" hpid="Mr. Connolly Mr. Connolly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connolly</NameTxt>
      <P>The Bill is to be welcomed since it further amends the 1996 legislation which streamlined and strengthened our laws on sea dumping. It also conforms to the OSPAR Convention on Dumping at Sea. The sea is one of the finest natural resources and we must ensure that a structure is adopted to allow us to preserve, protect and utilise it to the country's optimum benefit. In recent years local authorities have devoted a considerable amount of time and effort to the development of waste management policies. It is ironic that waste management policies have resulted in the detention of one of our colleagues, Deputy Joe Higgins, in Mountjoy jail. Local authorities are now required to include a waste management programme as part of their development plans but it is also vitally important to provide for waste disposal at sea.</P>
      <P>The Bill provides for the publication in newspapers of a public notice of application for a dumping permit to dispose of waste at sea. It is only right that the public should be kept informed of such developments and be permitted to respond accordingly, as is the case in the planning process. Ireland's responsibility in this regard will extend under the legislation along the continental shelf, and also extends our coastal jurisdiction from 12 to 350 miles. It is difficult for us to know what is being dumped in international waters, over 350 miles off our coastline. Toxic and nuclear waste have frequently been dumped at sea without much concern for the effects of erosion on sealed containers.</P>
      <P>The Irish Sea has long achieved notoriety as one of the most radioactive seas in the world, largely because of Sellafield and its disposal of nuclear waste in these waters. British Nuclear Fuels Limited has long played down the significance of this, and has sought to allay public fears on both sides of the Irish Sea. Any measure that can be instrumental in preventing such disposal is to be welcomed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The disintegration of the former Soviet Union and the dispersal of much of its nuclear capacity <Col N="102" /> between the USSR's former constituent republics has increased the likelihood of nuclear waste being dumped indiscriminately in seas off their coasts. The effects on marine life and ultimately on the food chain would be catastrophic &ndash; infinitely greater than the effects of the radiation which emanated from the Chernobyl reactor some years ago. The involvement of the Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs, Deputy Ó Cuív, is also to be welcomed as well as the fact that due attention will be given to sites of natural and architectural heritage before any application for a dumping permit can be entertained.</P>
    <P>The Bill also involves Dúchas in the preservation of archaeological heritage around our coasts. This appears to be an eminently sensible proposal, since it will enable Dúchas to document, catalogue and preserve any valuable artefacts. Who knows what the underwater world may reveal at some future date &ndash; lost cities, Spanish galleons, rock formations, etc.? </P>
    <P>I am glad the Bill also prohibits ships from flushing their tanks or disposing of waste within Irish waters. The possibility of fish stocks being decimated is very real, a situation we could not possibly have envisaged a few years ago. The continual and haphazard practice of dumping waste at sea cannot be permitted to continue indefinitely, since fish stocks are in real danger of drying up. The dumping of untreated sewage at sea also poses a major threat to marine life. Many of our local authorities do not have sewage treatment plants, and we do not have an impressive record in this regard.</P>
    <P>The next Law of the Sea conference should adopt a global resolution to ban dumping at sea, because of its indiscriminate nature and because the effects are so far-reaching for marine life and for humanity in general. In a single generation overfishing and poor management have devastated fish stocks in the North Atlantic and other regions around the world. Some 13 of the world's major fishing regions have seen a decline in total catch, putting an estimated 100,000 fishermen out of work, and threatening the food supply of millions in developing countries.</P>
    <P>The deterioration of the world's fisheries is just the tip of the iceberg. There is growing concern about the decline in marine life worldwide, as many ecosystems and entire seas falter under the combined effects of a wide range of human activities. Overfishing, habitat destruction, climate change and the indiscriminate dumping of sewage, fertilisers, oil and other wastes into rivers and seas are exacting a terrible toll on marine life.</P>
    <P>Vast &ldquo;dead zones&rdquo; of oxygen-less water have spread across highly polluted estuaries and seas. Fish stocks have deteriorated or collapsed around the world. Important habitats like wetlands and coral reefs are rapidly disappearing, while changes in sea temperatures are altering ocean currents that drive world weather patterns, possibly due to global warming. The cumulative damage to marine life is most clearly seen in the <Col N="103" /> world's semi-enclosed seas. Such seas generally have fairly dense human populations on shore, as on the west coast of Ireland, and a low rate of seawater flushing to the open Atlantic.</P>
    <P>Pollution, coastal development pressures and fishing demands are concentrated with increasingly dramatic effects. A sobering example is the Black Sea. Over the past two decades 20 of the 26 commercial fish species have vanished. In their place are monstrous algae blooms which feed on human waste and the North American jellyfish that prey on them. These are one of the so-called &ldquo;alien&rdquo; species that are transported across the world everyday in the ballast water of cargo ships.</P>
    <P>Romania and Bulgaria have already sold their entire state-owned fishing fleets and tourism is faltering as raw sewage washes on to the beach resorts that ring the Black Sea. In the longer term and in the light of these experiences a decision to ban dumping would have major repercussions in terms of quality of life, the marine environment and sustainability. I welcome the Bill and feel it is a worthwhile extension to the Dumping at Sea Act 1996 in terms of preserving the treasure that is around our coast. I commend the Bill. Go raibh maith agat.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatBreen" hpid="Mr. P. Breen Mr. P. Breen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Breen</NameTxt>
      <P>Like the previous speakers I welcome the opportunity to speak on this very important Bill which was passed in the Seanad back in 2000. It amends the Dumping at Sea Act 1996 which was introduced by a former Fine Gael Minister for the Marine, Mr. Seán Barrett. As some of the previous speakers have noted, Ireland is an island with a long and beautiful coastline. It depends a great deal on the tourism industry. It is important, therefore, that we protect our waters and our coastline. I come from the constituency of County Clare, which has a long coastline. It stretches from Fenore, north of Galway Bay, right down to Loop Head and into the Shannon Estuary. I live on the estuary and I would like to talk, first, about domestic dumping before putting this into perspective with regard to dumping at sea. It was a common occurrence when I took a walk on the estuary banks to see bottles, fridges with CO gases and old cookers, and recently farm plastic from bales, even carcasses, being washed up on our shores. Thankfully, much of that has now come to an end. First, farmers have to pay a contribution when they buy the plastic &ndash; where a contractor comes along and collects the used plastic. That has put an end to it. In addition, with the traceablity by the Department of Agriculture and Food of farm animals, the dumping of carcasses, thank God, has almost come to an end. That is what was happening in the past, and thankfully things have changed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Much of the dumping took place at sea over the decades, most of which we knew nothing about. Formerly it was believed that if dumping took place away from the shoreline the sea's power of dilution would render it harmless. That theory no longer holds, thankfully, and people &ndash;<Col N="104" /> and countries and governments &ndash; have become more conscious of traffic and dumping on our seas. Irish people, too, have become conscious of this. We want to protect our beauty spots for bathing and other recreational purposes. We have all seen pictures on television of oil tankers cleaning out their hulls as they enter international waters. We have seen pictures taken by the Air Corps and the British and other navies of oil streaks along the seas. Ship captains assume these oil streaks will break up by the time they get to the coastline. That practice was common over the decades and I am delighted to see it will now be stopped.</P>
    <P>The Irish coastline is no stranger to abandoned shipwrecks &ndash; ships that have been caught in storms and bad weather as they crossed the Atlantic Ocean. We had a wreck off the coast near Dingle some years ago. It was lodged there for years and was most unsightly for tourists or anyone to look at. I was on the small island of Inis Oírr some time ago and I saw a ship abandoned, which was most unsightly.</P>
    <P>Even in my area the small village of Kildysart on the Shannon Estuary a person bought a shipwreck, the <i>Matricia,</i> which had been caught in a storm off the coast of Waterford, thinking he could repair it. He towed the ship to the Shannon Estuary, but unfortunately costs prohibited the ship from being repaired and it was left abandoned at the public port. The owner sold off the valuable parts of the ship, which was abandoned and remains there today. This has been the source of much discontent among people in the area. A few years ago some birds nested on the ship and when the chicks hatched, conservationists were anxious that people would not touch it. All of these things have to be put up with.</P>
    <P>I am delighted the Minister has insisted that port companies prepare a five-year dredging and dumping plan, which must be published as part of the necessary consultation with the public and the statutory bodies when applying for permits to dump at sea. The criteria laid down as part of the OSPAR Convention are quite strict. There must be an alternative land-based disposal option before port companies can dispose of silt at sea. This is important in the interest of land reclamation and beach nourishment. The characteristics and composition of the materials to be dumped must be examined. The potential interference dumping could have on wildlife and shipping routes must be taken into account. The vessel that is disposing of the material must have proper certification. The potential impact dumping the material will have on the marine ecosystem must be considered.</P>
    <P>The Shannon Foynes Port Company is the company closest to where I live. Having listened to the Minister yesterday, I understand that company is expected to submit a five-year plan shortly. I hope the Minister will be in a position to grant its application as he has done for the other port companies around the country. The <Col N="105" /> Shannon Estuary is a very valuable shipping area used by many shipping companies as they ship material to the various ports on the estuary, Limerick Port, Foynes &ndash; which is a very large port, the Aughinish Alumina plant, and Moneypoint &ndash; one of the biggest generating stations in the country which receives large deliveries of coal directly into the plant.</P>
    <P>It is unfortunate that there is only one real port &ndash; a private port used by the ESB &ndash; on the Clare coast. Kilrush with Cappa Pier was a good port in the 1960s but its business reduced because of competition from across the estuary. Some time ago the Department carried out studies on how to utilise the jetty at Moneypoint. Due to the fact that the estuary is very deep there was some investigation of the possibility of using it for transhipment as is done in Rotterdam where ships unload and the goods are then shipped on separately to other destinations in Europe. Cruise ships could also make use of it. I hope that the Minister will give consideration to that.</P>
    <P>Harbours must be dredged on a regular basis as they silt up. It is appropriate that port companies should account for the disposal of gravel and sand. The 1996 Act prohibits the dumping of sewage sludge in the marine environment. As a member of the local authority, I know many villages and towns in County Clare where raw sewage is pumped into the sea. The population of Kilkee swells up to more than 20,000 in the summer. It does not have a proper waste water system and it will be a number of years before it does. Other villages on the coastline like Carrigaholt, Labasheeda and Kildysart have lost their blue flags over the years as a result of not having proper water treatment systems in place. The Government has a responsibility to ensure that these towns and villages have adequate sewerage systems in place in order to protect the waters along the coastline.</P>
    <P>The same could be said of lakes such as Lough Derg, which recently had trouble with high levels of dioxins and algal bloom, which were causing harm to marine life. There is an onus on the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government to get funding from Europe or elsewhere to introduce proper sewerage systems into towns and villages on the coastline and on lakes.</P>
    <P>Many of the previous speakers spoke about the disposal of radioactive waste, which is always a cause of concern particularly for people on the east coast living in counties such as Louth, Dublin, Wicklow and Wexford bearing in mind the close proximity to Sellafield. Deputy Perry said a Fine Gael delegation, which visited Sellafield some time ago, was shocked at what could happen if an accident occurred and there was a discharge of radioactive waste into the Irish Sea. Ireland is noted for its fish, which is also good for people's diet. Recent tests have shown there are chemicals in some marine life and one has to be very cautious.</P>
    <P>Currently there is controversy about a number <Col N="106" /> of US navy ships due to cross the Atlantic to Britain where they are to be broken up. Some groups have threatened to try to block their passage. As they will not be travelling in Irish waters, we have very little responsibility for them. However, what if something happened to some of these ships and radioactive waste ended up in the sea off the west coast? These are all great concerns for us as an island nation.</P>
    <P>There have been several oil tanker disasters resulting in serious spillages in recent years. I was only a young man in 1978 when the <i>Amoco Cadiz</i> went down off the coast of Brittany and did great damage to the coastline there. The <i>Exxon Valdez</i> went down off the coast of Alaska. Less than 12 months ago the <i>Prestige</i> did untold damage to marine life off the northern coast of Spain where I believe some 20 million gallons of oil went into the sea.</P>
    <P>Apart from the issue of dumping at sea, single hulled tankers should be outlawed. Double hulls should be required for the protection of our seas. I understand the <i>Prestige </i>was a single hulled tanker and, therefore, very vulnerable, particularly in bad weather.</P>
    <P>I note from the contribution of the Minister of State, Deputy Browne, to yesterday's debate that dumping of ships and aircraft will be formally banned, in the interests of marine and navigational safety, by 31 December 2004. I welcome this. We cannot have ships or aircraft being dumped in our seas and becoming a danger to navigation.</P>
    <P>Let me conclude on a lighter note as my previous references to aircraft were in a serious context. I welcome the presence of aircraft in the Shannon Estuary provided they land at Shannon Airport, which is currently under considerable threat. The more transatlantic flights we have on the route, the better.</P>
    <P>Again, I welcome the opportunity to speak on this very important Bill which I hope will have a smooth passage. I commend it to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomHayes" hpid="Mr. Hayes Mr. Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to speak in this debate. People may wonder about my interest in this Bill in view of the fact that I come from an inland county. However, those of us who live inland can also greatly appreciate the benefits and attractions of the seaside. Coastal counties are very fortunate from many perspectives, perhaps most importantly in economic terms. A nice coastline is a wonderful benefit. In that regard, we in County Tipperary, which has somewhat similar land to that of the Minister of State's home county, Wexford, might be forgiven for being slightly envious of the latter county's coastline in terms of tourism and other benefits. Perhaps this explains my interest in the protection of Ireland's coastline.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Our rivers flowing from inland counties such as the Suir which originates in County Tipperary and enters the sea through Waterford serve in many ways as a link between coastal and inland areas, including the movement of fish stocks, pro<Col N="107" /> viding the basis for many small industries along our waterways which depend on clean seas. Anybody with an interest and concern for our coastline should welcome the Bill.</P>
    <P>I understand the Bill is to amend the 1996 legislation introduced by the then Minister with responsibility for the marine and which, at the time, was a substantial measure which went a long way towards bringing into the 20th century our laws on dumping at sea, in line with the OSPAR Convention. One aspect of dumping at sea involves the reckless abandonment of vessels on our coastline, thereby creating an unsightly, untended and derelict effect. It is essential that we have effective legislation to deal with such situations.</P>
    <P>I cannot recall any major oil spillage on our coastline. We are very fortunate that such an incident has not occurred, having regard to the untold damage which would be caused and the length of time required to clean up afterwards. Family visits to the seaside are a particular treat for those who live in inland counties. Their enjoyment of that amenity is greatly enhanced by an environment free of litter, oil spillages, water pollution or other debris. Those engaging in such family outings should be mindful of their own behaviour, in terms of avoiding careless dumping of litter and showing respect for our wonderful coastline. From my observations during the past summer, there is considerable room for improvement in that regard.</P>
    <P>Direct comparisons between Ireland and Spain may be somewhat difficult, having regard to the highly developed state of the Spanish tourism industry and the extent to which that country's economy depends on tourism. The manner in which certain parts of the Spanish coastline have been taken care of is particularly impressive, even to the extent of bringing in fresh supplies of sand to provide a more attractive swimming environment. While our normal Irish summers may not be conducive to such elaborate measures, the wonderful weather of this past summer has brought many more to our beaches than usual.</P>
    <P>Residents in many inland areas may still have a choice of seaside locations, within an hour's travel, in counties such as Cork, Waterford, Wexford and Clare, to which Deputy Breen referred. Our coastal villages and towns have benefited greatly, in economic terms, from the attraction which nearby beaches have provided. This underlines the importance of a responsible attitude towards maintaining these amenities properly. Future generations will not thank us for any neglect in that regard. We should appreciate and respect the freedom which our beaches provide to enable people to engage in a wide range of outdoor pursuits of their choice. We should not neglect our important obligations in that regard.</P>
    <P>This Bill will have to ensure that the problems of pollution are being controlled and curtailed. That is welcome and it is important because we are all now conscious of the environment. Those <Col N="108" /> of us who were members of local authorities &ndash; I had to resign from my seat recently &ndash; have seen a major change in consciousness of the environment with the new legislation which was introduced to cover, for example, landfills and pay-by-weight. These strides are to be welcomed and we must continue this process and educate our children with initiatives such as the tidy schools competition. This has helped to make young people more conscious of the environment in which they live. It should extend to our seas and the people who are responsible for them, especially those who can abandon boats because so many lives are at stake on the sea. It is such a wonderful natural asset to have close by and so many people have benefited from it that we cannot but welcome the legislation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JerryCowleyIND" hpid="Mr. Cowley Mr. Cowley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowley</NameTxt>
      <P>Tá mé an-bhuíoch an seans a bheith agam cupla focal a rá ar an mBille seo. Bille an-thábhachtach is ea é, go mórmór dos na daoine atá ina gcónaí in aice leis an bhfarraige, mar atá a lán daoine i gCondae Mhuigheo agus in áiteanna eile sa tír.</P>
      <P>I am very happy to speak on this fine Bill which backs up the Dumping at Sea Act 1996 and makes important amendments to it. We should be very aware of the importance of the sea to us. Nobody realises this more than me, living in a county with extensive coastline. All around the country it provides a wonderful opportunity, heritage and wealth but I wonder how well we have exploited it. We could perhaps have done a great deal more with this asset before we joined the EU. As has been pointed out today, the sea is not a limitless resource and there have been times when we have not treated it as we should have done. The 1996 Act and this Bill help to rectify that as much as possible.</P>
      <P>There is no doubt that we have wasted opportunities. It is often said that the world is a large pond and this is borne out by the effect on us of accidents such as that in Chernobyl. Likewise, we have seen the effect of the waste from Sellafield and will continue to see that in the future. That is for sure. Even if Sellafield did close down we would have that problem for many years to come. We have a major responsibility to grow our asset, like the biblical talents which must be used. Somebody has to account for stewardship of the sea and this Bill moves towards achieving that. We will suffer the effects of radiation in the Irish Sea <i>ad infinitum.</i> The fish there are the hottest fish one can get, in the wrong sense. We are powerless over that as long as things continue to happen in Sellafield.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Common Fisheries Policy is confining fishermen in terms of what they can do and what they can fish. We have the richest of resources yet it was plundered by many other nations. It was our heritage and we could have done a great deal for those people who have lived by the sea and fished for many generations but we failed when it came to exploiting it for our own benefit. Consider what could have been done in the west with a <Col N="109" /> fishing industry that was never properly developed as it should have been. The policy could have been translated into infrastructure in some way if it had been west of Ireland-proofed or BMW-proofed to be of benefit to an area that is now so neglected. There is a lack there of balanced regional development and we should all regret that legacy.</P>
    <P>Most of the licences in this Bill have been for port and harbour dredging and this would be very important for shipping and navigation and so on, and for development. I regret the fact that there is so little development in the western harbours. This is something that we should also have. I welcome the content of the Bill and the openness and transparency that it proposes. It lets people know exactly what is happening so that when they are aware that something is being dumped they can deal with that and make whatever observations are necessary. I note the 21-day period in which those observations can be forwarded to the Minister. That is all to the good and it is democratic.</P>
    <P>The 1996 Act was and is important. Many people today mentioned pollution, and the <i>Kowloon Bridge</i> tanker disaster. There have been many situations in which such things have happened, not just in Ireland but elsewhere, because of the single-hulled vessels that are permitted to operate and which because of commercialism will not be phased out in the short-term. That is a pity because those accidents are preventable. The other problem is the raw sewage that continues to seep into our bays and rivers and in my constituency there are many examples where, due to inadequate investment, pollution continues to happen. That is regrettable because it interferes with fish life. Sewage has a negative effect on fish life, particularly on the string of mussel and oyster farms along the west coast.</P>
    <P>I welcome the fact that the Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs is involved. Island people are very aware of what is happening because they are seafaring people and this will be of use to them. I worry, however, that the extra bureaucracy might interfere with the smooth running of the Act. The converse is that the sea is our heritage and we have to protect that. Our fish have been plundered in the past, what more is to be plundered before we wake up to the fact that we have a resource which needs to be put to full use for the people?</P>
    <P>I welcome the safeguards and the procedures for advertising applications and the necessity to have materials being dumped fully spelt out. This is pointed out in guidelines for applicants, including the obligation to look at options other than the sea for dumping. I am firmly of the opinion that it should be done away with altogether. It is wrong to dump material in the sea, which is a natural resource and with which we should not interfere. There must be other ways to dispose of waste material &ndash; the Dutch and others have done wonders. The sea is advancing on the west coast. Therefore, we should try to prevent this <Col N="110" /> practice. The monitoring of the dumping area before and after dumping takes place is a step forward.</P>
    <P>The 1996 Act extended Ireland's jurisdiction over dumping at sea from 12 miles offshore to between 200 and 250 miles to coincide with the continental shelf. This gives us an extra responsibility. The House is already aware of recent events in Pollathomas, County Mayo, where a mountain ended up in the sea. What effect will this have on it?</P>
    <P>The few drift net fishermen who are left are suffering from over-regulation already. What chances will they now have? I do not know how this will affect sea angling in the area but fishermen have already been put out business by the new regulations that have been introduced with the result that sea angling competitions will not take place on the west coast this year. We are chasing the small people who are catching a few salmon in a season while super-trawlers are hoovering up fish. It makes no sense. What will this Bill do for people in north-west Mayo who are being affected by this? It will not do anything, even though there is an urgent need for something to be done for them.</P>
    <P>When I raised the issue of the Pollathomas landslide on the Adjournment, I was told that because less than &euro;3 billion in damage was sustained, the European Union would not get involved. This places an onus on national Government which the Bill should address. It is a good Bill. I do not want to take away from it but people's heritage in Pollathomas, where the mountain meets the sea naturally, was destroyed when it fell into the sea. In the past I asked for a special tax incentive scheme for the area because it is the poorest of the State. At the current rate, there will be no one left there within 100 years. In spite of this, we have not seen the Taoiseach, the President or any Minister visiting for weeks. This was a major disaster, the effects of which must be addressed.</P>
    <P>The sea is vulnerable and being threatened with every hour that passes. Of the 25 bays regularly monitored by the EPA and local authorities, 12 were eutrophic or enriched. A large proportion of the 446 species of fish in Irish waters, including lampreys and shellfish, are under threat. This is a serious situation that must be addressed. The Bill goes some way to remedying it. That is the reason I welcome it.</P>
    <P>Fish farms in south Donegal have claimed that the &euro;50 million harbour development in Killybegs could be the cause of the fish deaths in two bays. I do not know if that is the case but we must recognise the interaction between action taken on the land and what happens in the sea.</P>
    <P>We have many riches which place an obligation on us. People have mentioned the gas fields in the sea but this resource, worth billions of euro, was given away before it even reached the shore. That is a tragedy. The wonderful resources the sea gives us, the marine life, the gas and oil, are <Col N="111" /> all gone. Norway has made tremendous use of the resources God gave it but although we have the same resources, we did not use them.</P>
    <P>How will drift net and draft net fishermen be policed? GPS technology can indicate a body's position to within a few centimetres. Therefore, we could police the foreign trawlers plundering our waters and those who are dumping. That will, however, require resources, for which there is no provision in the Bill. We have the technology but will we make the resources available in order that we can use them?</P>
    <P>This is a commercial State that produces waste that must be disposed of. The tragedy is that so much of it is dumped in the sea and on the land. In County Mayo, near Pollathomas where the tragedy occurred, the seaside village of Geesala is a dumping ground for the sludge from Cork. It should be benefiting from the sea. This is taking place against the wishes of the people and is totally illegal.</P>

      <P>The plans are that County Mayo will receive waste from counties Galway and Roscommon. It is already dealing with waste from Sligo. Why is the west bearing the cost of waste on land and in the sea?</P>
      <P>We must examine the current situation and think of ways to address the big issues without over-regulating the small person who is trying to eke out a living. I wish the Bill addressed this, examined the dumping that occurred in Pollathomas and investigated the cause of the landslide to ensure it does not happen again.</P>
      <P>The Bill should give the people of Pollathomas the resources they urgently need from the Government, a multi-million euro package. They now have no hope. They know the roads and bridges will be fixed but what about the people themselves? Will their futures be fixed? It does not appear that they will. When this happened in Ringsend, the Red Cross was involved. The Red Cross and the European Union are not involved in County Mayo. It is time the Government got involved.</P>
      <P>I welcome the Bill but ask how relevant it is to the needs of the people of Pollathomas. What are the implications of the landslide? Also, what about the man dumped in Mountjoy Prison, Deputy Joe Higgins? We live in a large pond and everything we do has an effect. In every international forum, including the European Union, we should push our own agenda in respect of the proper protection of our own resources. I welcome the Bill as a step in the right direction.</P>

      <P>Like a number of other speakers, to whom I have listened with some interest, I find nothing wrong with the legislation. It is well meant and represents an attempt to put an official structure on something that has been happening without controls up to now. We have seen on our television screens in recent times the dangers of uncontrolled dumping at sea but that is only to speak of what we have been shown. Given the difficulties we have had in relation to dumping on land, I can imagine how much easier it is to dump at sea with impunity. Once dumped, material tends to disappear downward at a very rapid rate. However, we now know and should have known long ago that while such material may disappear from view, it does not disappear from the environment. It may well cause serious problems at a later stage.</P>

      <P>Indeed, Meath is a maritime county and I have no doubt the Bill will have special meaning for its population.</P>
      <P>My colleague, Deputy Cowley, mentioned the global positioning system, a technology I have in my car. It runs into trouble on some of the road networks in this city due to the levels of traffic congestion but I will be very nice to Members opposite by refusing to discuss that matter. The Minister of State will be glad to know that I make only a passing reference.</P>

      <P>Absolutely. I hope GPS will help the powers that be to identify with some accuracy the locations of abuses which occur. I also hope that in contrast to the problem of traffic congestion, the powers that be will be able to do something about such abuses.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The legislation before us makes provision in respect of what can be seen and controlled. However, there are also things we cannot control such as large ocean-going oil tankers which get into difficulty on the high seas. While I do not wish to refer back to Bills we discussed earlier this year, I worry about the tendency of people to dump what they wish at sea, especially when I reflect on the difficulties we have had controlling <Col N="113" /> dumping on land. The tendency is greater than we have considered previously. Unfortunately, I have serious doubts about the policing of dumping, despite the passage of this Bill and its mention of the Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs, though he will no doubt have a major impact. We have become aware of the dangers we face once pollution takes place but we may not know until many years hence the full extent of the dumping which has taken place at sea already. The dumping which has occurred may yet result in very severe damage.</P>
    <P>Various Members have spoken about the dumping of nuclear waste at sea. It seems to have been the philosophy heretofore that once material was dumped, it was out of sight and, therefore, out of mind. People seem to have thought the sea would absorb what was dumped naturally over time but we are not so sure of that now. Our suspicions have been aroused more than once in recent times. I particularly note the dumping of fish and fish processing materials which appears to have created serious problems for marine life.</P>
    <P>While the Bill's provisions in respect of notices and licences will put the control of dumping on a statutory footing, what will happen if a person who applies for a licence ignores the conditions under which he or she is supposed to operate? Many who have applied for licences in the past have behaved in this way. Will the pollution of our harbours continue to take place?</P>
    <P>I presume provision has been made in respect of refusals to grant licences. In the event of a refusal, the material which was to be dumped will have to be stored, presumably on land. The time has come to face reality in terms of all stored materials of a polluting nature. I would like to hear a declaration of our intention to either store such material permanently or render it harmless. It is necessary to do this to bring the debate further. If this question is not addressed, the residual build-up of pollutants will cause serious problems in the future. This issue does not only affect those living in maritime counties, it affects all of us, our marine life and ecology. It is necessary to deal with it to ensure there is a positive plan to address problems rather than a series of regulations outlining what one cannot do. Some means must be found which makes it clear to those who have waste of which they must get rid that there is somewhere for them to dump or eliminate it. If we fail to do this, we will always have this problem.</P>
    <P>We have had this debate in relation to agriculture. When an animal dies, there must be an incentive for the owner to dispose of it in an orderly way. The solution is to find an orderly way in which to dispose of waste materials and provide an incentive for people to use it. It is not very difficult to do. The Minister knows full well that if a positive incentive to encourage a person in the right direction is provided, there can be no excuse for breaching rules and regulations. We must recognise that industries, including those in <Col N="114" /> the marine sector, will always generate pollutants of one kind or another.</P>
    <P>On the policing aspect, I have a vision of the Minister or the Minister for Arts, Sport and Tourism dressed up in scuba gear heading for the high seas with his iron lung, diving apparatus, etc., as he seeks out these pollutants on the sea bed. I hope it will not come to that. We would not like to see the Minister suffering in that way, nor would we like him to send any other Minister to the sea bed in that quest.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
      <P>Absolutely. I would like to hear more from the Minister about the policing and monitoring aspects. We are often criticised in this House for introducing legislation which is fine in theory but does not have any effect in practice. This is an area where we can arrive at that juncture.</P>
      <P>Another interesting aspect is the fact that no extra staff will be needed to implement the legislation. I cannot understand how the legislation, which is necessary and desirable and which we support, is to be policed without extra staff. Who will do that if it is to be operated in that way? More importantly, how effective will it be? Perhaps the Minister will hand over full responsibility to the Minister for Arts, Sport and Tourism but that Minister is already overworked. The Minister should not expect him to inquire into these matters. I would like to know the practicalities involved. I would have expected further information on that aspect.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan" hpid="Mr. Durkan Mr. Durkan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Bill does not require additional staffing and will not involve any net additional cost to the Exchequer. This is the kind of legislation this House has been seeking for years. It will cost nothing to implement. It is to provide for a licence which will be put up on a port wall or whatever the case may be. No extra staff will be required. I have my doubts about the strength of such legislation but that is a matter for another day. I know the Acting Chairman has a good knowledge of the coastal areas and is fully aware of the dangers of a lack of financing, staffing and so on.</P>
      <P>I welcome the legislation and hope that it will be effective. I hope it will not be parked and that it eliminates the kind of pollution we have seen. It does not address the problem of the unseen polluter on the high seas who can have as big an impact as anything we have seen on our shores and harbours.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent" hpid="Mr. Sargent Mr. Sargent">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
      <P>Tá áthas orm deis a fháil labhairt ar an mBille um Dhumpáil ar Farraige (Leasú) 2000 and like Deputy Durkan, I will not hold my breath in anticipation of enormous changes, although one lives in hope. It is important to have this debate, however, to get a sense of where <Col N="115" /> interests lie in the Oireachtas in regard to maritime matters. That is a revelation in itself because we have only had Deputies from the Opposition benches offering to speak on the Bill. Perhaps the Minister might enlighten us in due course as to the reason there is so little interest from his side of the House. What we see, however, is a reflection of a wider disregard for maritime matters, which is surprising and difficult to understand in a maritime country.</P>
      <P>We all remember the traditional map displayed in our schools, nuair a bhí tusa agus mise ag múineadh, a Chathaoirligh. The map of Ireland on the wall resembled the shape of a teddy bear. That image of the country is imprinted on the minds of many people. The map of our maritime territory, however, is very different. It resembles the shape of a rugby ball, with the map of the land of Ireland looking like a logo on that rugby ball. It is quite a small part of the overall area which includes Irish waters. It would be important going forward if the Department of Education and Science took account of the fact that we are not just a bit of green land on the edge of Europe. We have a maritime territory and heritage and we have responsibilities to ensure we hand that on to future generations in a fit state.</P>
      <P>That is all the more obvious when one considers the way our coastal towns are planned. The Bill refers to the Harbours Acts of 1996 and 2000 but it is clear that many towns are planned with their backs to the sea. They see the sea as nothing other than a repository for whatever effluent they choose to dispose of. One could be vulgar and talk about the town planners organising our towns as if they are mooning at the sea but that is the connotation when one considers the way the towns were planned. Unfortunately, that is reflected in many of the actions taken at Government, local and individual level regarding the sea.</P>
      <P>There are exceptions to that, however, and I think of legends in their lifetime, people like John de Courcy Ireland who, if he was Taoiseach, would have made a significant impact in terms of Ireland realising its potential as a maritime country. He follows a long list of dignitaries and famous people throughout history, going back to Queen Meave and St. Brendan the Navigator who put us on the map as a maritime country. They remind us of our wealth as a nation and our potential.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would also like to pay tribute to a late colleague of mine whom I would list among those who regularly reminded us of our maritime heritage. Councillor Vincent McDowell, who died recently, was a member of Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council. He did not just write books about the tides and the almanac for seafaring. He also built boats and treated the sea as a highway as well as a second home. I recall Vincent arriving at Balbriggan harbour and making a call to my house asking me to come down to the harbour and join him on his boat, <i>Saoirse,</i> which <Col N="116" /> was moored there. He had travelled from Dún Laoghaire in the same way someone else might come by train or car. Taking the sea seriously and making use of it in a way which is almost second nature is an aspect of Irish life, whatever about public representatives, which is all too rare. Dia lena anam uasal, we remember him as a friend, colleague and a great mentor.</P>
    <P>There is still a good deal of unfinished business in respect of the Harbours Act of 1996, with which I was involved. The Minister will recall it also. It is fascinating to read that Act which was supposedly a way of resolving a long-standing maritime stand-off on the part of local authorities in Fingal and Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown over Bullock Harbour, Skerries Harbour and my own home town of Balbriggan.</P>
    <P>Balbriggan Harbour is an indication of the neglect and disinterest shown over the years by the authorities with responsibility for its maintenance and upkeep. Such is the level of disinterest and neglect that even the harbour dues which Dublin Port is expected to collect are not collected. There is a level of indifference which, unfortunately, is all too common in matters relating to the sea. I ask the Minister to act as an honest broker or a peace broker between the local authority and Dublin Port, so there might be some type of settlement. The local authority is obviously afraid of the cost of a liability which has been so long neglected. One could not blame it for that. An independent honest broker is needed to come in and arrange some type of package which would move matters on. As the years and decades go by, the neglect takes a toll, and the sea is merciless in that regard. I ask the Minister to act on that as well as deal with the legislation in due course.</P>
    <P>Deputy Durkan said he did not expect the Minister to don his scuba gear and check out all the problems below the waves but I have experience of working with Greenpeace which is quite adept at donning scuba gear and going about that exact work. I know from living in Cork in the early 1980s how important the activities of those raising the issues, such as Help Organise Peaceful Energy, HOPE, which went on to become EarthWatch, and Greenpeace, were in finally bringing about the end of the dumping of nuclear material off the south-west coast which had been happening there with impunity over the years and, indeed, in the Irish Sea as well. There is still a risk of dumping happening by default. We see that from time to time when oil tankers get into difficulty. My colleagues, Deputy Eamon Ryan and Deputy Boyle, myself and others have raised the issue in this House that Ireland does not have sufficient towing capacity for ships that flounder, particularly large tankers. We talk about the Dumping at Sea (Amendment) Bill as if it will be of some assistance but it will be of little assistance unless we act on the recommendations of the Government that there should be towing capacity which is up to the job of ensuring large tankers &ndash; perhaps single hull &ndash; do not flounder, get <Col N="117" /> washed up or sink to the bottom of the sea leaving an appalling legacy. It will be too late to deal with the situation once the damage is done.</P>
    <P>The Bill mentions the need for policing, empowering the courts and so forth and imposing monetary penalties. This is one area where policing is needed, particularly if one is going to license dumping. I am nervous about the way in which certain unscrupulous individuals will take advantage of any kind of licensing arrangement.</P>
    <P>Although it is a dangerous proposal because it could be abused but for what it is worth, I know from looking at cases off New Zealand and Australia that decommissioned trawlers have been removed of their machinery, engines and oil. What is left is basically a wooden construction which is non-toxic and which will not damage the maritime environment. Such trawlers are allowed to be deposited where a reef will form &ndash; not on a reef, but on a sandy or rocky area which becomes home and a breeding ground for fish stocks. It also serves to protect those stocks from fishing because that activity must stay outside the area. The Minister said that had been looked at but was not possible. That is fair enough in that I would prefer to adopt a precautionary principle. However, if decommissioning of boats takes places that is perhaps one way of redeeming the problem, namely, by helping the breeding of fish and trying to restock areas where over-fishing has occurred. However, I will take advice from the Minister's Department on that given that I assume he has the expertise available to him to assess the pros and cons of any such proposal.</P>
    <P>We have been told the first two of a fleet of 13 merchant ships coming from Virginia in the United States will not pass through Irish waters. We trust and hope that is the case but, nonetheless, even if they do not pass through Irish waters, the sinking, accidental or otherwise, of such vessels would contaminate the sea with PCBs and such persistent chemicals which would not be welcome and would have to be resisted and stopped if at all possible. Will the Minister make strong representations given the Basel and other conventions? It is against the spirit of the Basel Convention that ships sail to a country from which they do not originate, particularly across the Atlantic Ocean, with all the prospects of bad weather associated with such a voyage. What has the Government done other than to say they are not to come near Irish waters? That is not good enough in terms of international responsibilities.</P>
    <P>I live in Balbriggan in north County Dublin where levels of technetium-99 emanating from Sellafield are an ongoing problem, as the Minister knows. That is ongoing dumping at sea. It is insidious and poisonous and it should be stopped. I ask the Minister to take the opportunity of this Bill to push home that point once more with the British authorities and internationally and that the European convention take steps to phase out the EURATOM Treaty which is a creature of a time when nuclear power was seen to be a cure-all. I hope we know better now.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="118" />In the 1950s, 1960s and 1970s thousands of tonnes of radioactive material were dumped in the Irish Sea. The Minister's Department carried out a study to establish whether there was any significance to it. As mentioned in his Department's report, the Minister sought to allay public fear. It strikes me that in rushing to allay public fear, the testing was insufficient because water quality was tested. Nuclear material lying at the bottom of the sea often involves heavy elements which will not be apparent in the water quality. If the Minister and his Department were serious about testing the potential damage and future problems of long-term nuclear dumping, it would be important to test the seabed and to look for the problem which may be stirred up and agitated as time goes on, as happened with plutonium along the coast of Cumbria which was believed would sink into the sediment never to have any environmental effects. We now know it did not sink into the sediment but was agitated by the water movement, became airborne, in part, and was carried back on land with the prevailing wind as sediment. This matter is unresolved. I ask that we look more closely at the seabed of the Irish Sea where those thousands of tonnes of nuclear material were dumped in previous decades.</P>
    <P>There is also the wider issue of the European Union. There was an interesting article on this in the business pages of <i>The Irish Times.</i> The accepted wisdom among many people is that we have been the recipient of much EU moneys and, thereby, owe a huge amount for this to our colleagues in the EU, such as the Germans who pay much in taxation. John McManus, in <i>The Irish Times</i> article &ldquo;So Long and Thanks for all the Fish&rdquo;, states that in terms of transfers from EU coffers since 1973, we have benefited to the tune of &euro;30 billion. We are no doubt impressed with this figure. It has been used in different ways, not all of it to our benefit, but, overall, it has been well used.</P>
    <P>However, in terms of fish taken from Irish waters by mainly non-Irish boats, John McManus estimates the value to be &euro;120 billion, based on EUROSTAT figures. In terms of our maritime environment, it has been generously given and far more generously than people often acknowledge. He says that this surprising figure is arrived at by multiplying the estimate for the amount of fish caught in Irish waters during the period &ndash; some 36 million tonnes &ndash; by the average value of catch when processed over the period. The rule of thumb adopted by EUROSTAT is that the value of the catch is doubled when processed. He admits it is a crude analysis and can be picked apart by anyone determined to do so. However, he continues to state:</P>
    <P>Even assuming that the figures exaggerate the value of the fish caught by even 100%, that still leaves us with &euro;50 billion which is one and half times more than we received in agricultural subsidies and structural funds during that period.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="119" /> It will be assumed by most people from the outside that we would have used much of this money to reinvigorate our fishing fleet and maritime protection. However, this was not the case. As John McManus points out:</P>
    <P>The fishing industry in Ireland has never come close to reflecting the size of the resource available to it and as a consequence fishermen have never equalled the agricultural lobby in terms of clout. This was the case in 1973 and is still the case today. The total catch of fish landed in Ireland last year was just &euro;250 million and the number of people employed in the industry is around 16,000. Compare this to agriculture which contributes &euro;9.4 billion to the economy and employs 110,000.</P>
    <P>There is no doubt that the maritime environment and the fishing industry has continued to be the poor relation. We have much work and catching up to do with regard to the maritime environment.</P>
    <P>We should also be starting this Bill with coastal zone management legislation as well. Lack of such legislation has reflected our ability to turn our back on the marine and not even to require planning permission for drainage of wetlands in maritime areas. The Minister of State for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources, Deputy Browne, coming from Wexford, will know how important wetlands are. I ask that the Minister of State takes this as a call of crisis from the maritime sector. The Government needs to reflect beyond the green island that we live on and go further to include the Irish seas as part of our territory.</P>

      <P>I am surprised that Deputy Sargent compares agriculture with the fishing industry. Agriculture by its very name is a culture. The product of agriculture is cultivated by deliberate human intervention whether in the form of sowing, breeding stock or having them use the land, whereas fishing is basically hunting. Fishing is taking what is already there in nature. It is not reasonable to compare the two.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Those who refer back to Ireland's accession negotiations and claim that agriculture got the better deal than fishing are not really comparing like with like. There are only so many fish in the sea. As we know from what happened in Newfoundland, too much development of the fishing industry can destroy the resource upon which it is based. The cod fishery disappeared completely without trace along the Newfoundland Grand Banks, thanks to people putting an emphasis on and heavily investing in the fishing industry. Through that very investment it destroyed itself. <Col N="120" /> That is not something that can happen in agriculture. Agriculture is a cultivation industry. There is no form of agriculture, other than that which leads to soil erosion, which has the effect of destroying itself. However, there are forms of expression in the fishing industry that do destroy the resource upon which they depend.</P>
    <P>As living standards rise in the world, we will see more people wanting to eat fish. As we are advised that cholesterol is something to be worried about and as the world population ages, the increasing demand will be for fish. The only way that we can satisfy the increasingly strong demand for fish is by introducing the same approach to fishing that is applied to agriculture. In other words, we must move over to fish farming as distinct from fish hunting, which is the current basis of the fishing industry. &ldquo;Industry&rdquo; is probably not the word to use.</P>
    <P>I have quite a knowledge of Newfoundland due to associations. I know the Minister of State for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources is from a part of the country from where many Newfoundlanders came. Currently, in Newfoundland, they are attempting to find a way of creating reservations for fish where they cannot be disturbed by modern trawlers sweeping the bottom of the sea. One of the suggestions to achieve this is to deliberately dump old car wrecks and iron works of various kinds at sea. This would make it literally impossible for the conventional methods of fishing to operate because the fishing tackle would be destroyed by these dumps.</P>
    <P>We should consider using the actual necessity which we have of getting rid of material by dumping it at sea to create fish reservations. I hope this legislation would not in any way interfere with such proposals. Section 4 refers to the general considerations which must be taken into account which include interference with shipping, fishing, recreation, mineral extraction, desalination and fish and shellfish culture. To my mind, in some circumstances, it is going to be desirable to interfere with fishing. A planned system of dumping inert material that will not damage fish stocks is something that we should actively promote in particular coastal zones. I hope this can be taken into account by this legislation.</P>
    <P>If I may avail of the fact that the Chair indulged Deputy Sargent in referring to the EURATOM Treaty, to make a passing reference to it myself. Far from abolishing the EURATOM Treaty, we should recognise that it represents the only legal instrument this country will ever have that will work in stopping some of the activities to which we object at the Sellafield plant. While Britain can ignore UN bodies, it cannot ignore an EU body. The EURATOM Treaty, so long as an adequate emphasis is put on safety in its legal text, is a mechanism whereby, through the European Union, Britain could be commanded to do certain things with regard to its nuclear industry. It is empty symbolism on their part with no real political analysis behind it. People who are interested in combating the risks associated with <Col N="121" /> nuclear power should demand the amendment and enhancement of the EURATOM Treaty to ensure that it puts greater emphasis on safety rather than the current emphasis which is exclusively on research and the promotion of nuclear power. It is a legal instrument that has the capacity to be used to achieve something worthwhile.</P>
    <P>My final point is in regard to coastal erosion. In the past three years, every county with a coastline &ndash; with the possible exception of Leitrim &ndash; has been allocated funds to combat coastal erosion, except County Meath. No money has been allocated in the years 2001-03 to combat coastal erosion in Laytown, Mornington, Bettystown, Gormanstown or Mosney. I have the honour to represent this area. The coast is subject to erosion and I hope the Government Department that is allocating the budget for this subject will take account of the fact that the Meath coastline has been left out of the allocations for the past three years and ought to be included on this occasion in the drafting of the 2004 budget. On that slightly parochial note, I will hand over to Deputy Deenihan.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan" hpid="Mr. Deenihan Mr. Deenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>During the debate on an earlier Bill dealing with hazardous waste, I raised the issue of the custom of oil tankers and coal ships washing out their holds in the Shannon Estuary. As a result, at times the beaches there are affected by oil slicks and other types of waste. In his reply, will the Minister clarify if the Bill covers the cleaning out of the holds of ships in estuaries?</P>
      <P>I welcome the Bill, as I come from County Kerry which is a maritime county. For too long we ignored the great advantages of our coastline. We probably looked more to our land than our marine resources. It is only now that we are beginning to see the vast potential which the marine holds for us. Kerry has some 300 miles of coastline, which with a few exceptions is totally underutilised.</P>
      <P>I read a report recently in a newspaper about a conference in Dingle at which it was claimed that there are grave issues facing the marine environment and that many of our species are threatened. There is a major threat to the biodiversity of our coastline. Of the 25 bays regularly monitored by the EPA and local authorities, 12 bays or estuaries were eutrophic, or enriched, and some 14 of the 444 species of fish in Irish waters were under threat.</P>
      <P>The days of untreated sewage being dumped at sea as a matter of course seem to be coming to an end. Previously it was believed that if the dumping took place far enough from the coastline that the sea's powers of dilution would make it harmless. Irrespective of what is dumped at sea, it will have an effect on some part of the ecosystem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As the party spokesman on tourism, it is my belief that, as yet, we are only in the early stages of capitalising on our vast sea resources from a tourism point of view. Tourists who <Col N="122" /> come here are horrified by the treatment of some parts of our coastline. The bad examples are close to harbours in the big urban centres. I am pleased that harbour boards, in particular, which have jurisdiction over stretches of our coastline, will now have a responsibility to produce five-year plans. I welcome the restrictions on dumping waste material following construction on harbour sites that will, to some extent, be controlled by the Bill.</P>
    <P>The issue of coastal erosion has not been fully addressed. The amount of money in the national development plan is inadequate. An audit was carried out in Kerry, which quoted a conservative estimate of &euro;30 million as the amount required to stem erosion along the Kerry coastline. I do not think there is much more money currently in the fund for the southern region. We are not winning the battle against coastal erosion, we are losing land to the sea on an hourly basis. Unless people live by the sea and represent communities along the seaboard, generally speaking they are not aware of what is happening.</P>
    <P>The management of our coastline is an important issue. Karin Dubsky recently suggested that a coastal management group should be put in place that would include the statutory agencies and also the local voluntary groups. Has the Department taken up that idea?</P>
    <P>In the context of the debate on the tourism Bill last summer, I suggested that there should be a more interdepartmental approach to tourism. Given that there are a number of Departments with responsibility for the protection of our seas and coastline, there should also be an interdepartmental approach to the management of this issue. At present there is too much fragmentation.</P>
    <P>The Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government has a major role to play because of the break-up of the former Dúchas. The Minister referred to the fact that it will now have responsibility for special areas of conservation. While I welcome the Bill, there are a number of issues that have not been addressed by it. The Minister should take on board the type of forum proposed by Karin Dubsky. From time to time, legislation needs to be upgraded.</P>
    <P>The last major Bill on this area was promoted by Deputy Gilmore. Things have moved on since then. I ask the Minister to state whether the custom of merely cleaning out holds and hulls of cargo vessels in estuaries around the country is covered in the Bill.</P>

      <P>I am grateful for the opportunity to speak on this Bill which outlines a method to change the manner in which local authorities pay compensation for the acquisition of land. This Government's housing strategy is to continue to maximise and accelerate housing supply to match existing demand and stabilise prices so that people who desire to own their own home will be able to do so.</P>
      <P>The Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Cullen, and my party colleague, Bobby Molloy, in the previous Government, put in place measures that have seen record numbers of houses built in each of the last eight years. I ask the House to consider that in 1997, approximately 39,000 houses were constructed; 50,000 in 2000 and 58,000 in 2002. The rate of house building in this country is the fastest in Europe and the record number of completions has continued into this year with over 13,000 new houses and apartments built in the first three months of the year. This is phenomenal progress when one considers that the equivalent of a new Cork city has been built every year since 1997. This Government is committed to implementing measures to increase the supply of housing and bring moderation to the rate of house price increases.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="124" />Major advances have been achieved in the provision of affordable housing. Last year over 12,700 units of social and affordable housing were provided and approximately 13,000 units will be delivered this year. Last July the Government launched a new affordable housing initiative aimed at those who cannot afford to purchase a house in the current housing market from their own resources. Through the Office of Public Works programme of transforming State assets I identified two key sites in Dublin, one in Infirmary Road and another in Jamestown Road, Inchicore. I am hopeful that further State sites will be identified in the future to provide quality affordable housing.</P>
    <P>While both this Government and the previous Government have been busy building record numbers of houses every year, all the Opposition parties contribute to the debate is some hare-brained schemes such as the one underpinning this Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BernardAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government came up with some schemes. It is disrespectful to talk about hare-brained schemes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomParlonPD" hpid="Mr. Parlon Mr. Parlon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Parlon</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill discriminates on a very arbitrary basis between a landowner who could sell development land on the open market and one who is affected by a particular decision of a local authority to acquire his land at a much lower current use value. The Bill provides no legal guidance as to how local authorities are expected to operate the provisions. Invariably different local authorities would use the powers to different degrees, which is unfair and would cause trouble.</P>
      <P>The promotion of traditional civil liberties such as freedom of speech and freedom of association thankfully enjoy strong support from all sections of society but unfortunately private property rights rarely receive the same support. I am pleased that since the summer an important debate is emerging on the extension of rights to the socio-economic domain but property rights, as with most economic rights, rarely figure in the debate.</P>
      <P>Article 40.3.2º of the Constitution pledges that the State shall guarantee every citizen's right to private property. Article 43 acknowledges that these rights ought to be regulated by the principles of social justice. Over the last number of months the All-Party Committee on the Constitution has been examining these articles and studying the extent to which they serve the good of both individuals and community. The provision of quality affordable housing to all citizens is the ultimate goal of the State and I support that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I believe that the weakening of private property rights as outlined in this flawed Labour Party Private Members' Bill would be a great mistake. I have said it before and I have no compunction in repeating that such an approach is gift-wrapped in an ideology which is left of Stalin and which has no place in a modern, dynamic, open <Col N="125" /> economy such as Ireland's. What if one's home, business or farm is zoned for development? Should one be allowed to receive the benefits of this? In a democracy I believe one should. The practical implementation of such a measure would be very inequitable and would result in the value of land being taken from the property owner and being passed on to the eventual owners of houses on the site.</P>
    <P>My party, the Progressive Democrats, has worked hard since our foundation 18 years ago to put competition and enterprise at the heart of the Irish economy and a move such as this would be a regression for the country. As we know from experience, in the market place, incentives work far more effectively than sanctions. When the rate of capital gains tax was cut from 40% to 20% the yield went up by 500% and thousands of acres were freed up for housing and development.</P>
    <P>Clearly this success has had no impact on the Labour Party. If the Labour Party had its way, capital gains tax would be hiked back to 40% and the price of land would be capped at the same time. If that is not a plague on the property market and on all your houses, I do not know what is. The common and unchallenged misconception propagated by the Labour Party is that land and property owners are all money-grabbing capitalists who have only selfish motives at heart. Ireland is full of honest hard-working people who own property and penalising their initiatives though putting some extra charge on private property is wrong.</P>
    <P>Any attempt to freeze the value of land would cause more problems than it would solve. This Bill is poorly thought out and is a battering-ram solution and a legally lazy way to solve a very complex problem.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BarryAndrewsFF" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>I oppose this Bill for two reasons. First, a process is already under way to tackle this issue, with which the Labour Party is co-operating through its membership of the committee on the Constitution. Second, it is a little premature to fashion legislation ahead of an all-party analysis of the problem. It is my view that the Bill would not survive constitutional challenge. In the debate yesterday the Minister pointed out the difficulties with the arbitrary discrimination between landowners who sell at market value and those who sell as a result of a local authority decision at the lower current use value.</P>
      <P>There is no question that Ireland is land rich. We have no shortage of land for our population; compared to a place like Holland we are positively overwhelmed with supply. The record house completions of the last few years should also be taken into account. This suggests that the supply of land is good and if supply of houses is also good one would expect the price of houses to be low or at least affordable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The issue before the Constitution committee and NESC is what should be done regarding land policy. The following was part of the Labour Par<Col N="126" /> ty's submission to the Constitution committee of which I was a member:</P>
    <P>The Constitution had acquired a reputation for paying undue deference to property and the rights of property owners. We believe this reputation is largely undeserved and has in fact been relied upon as an excuse for doing nothing, by those who are by and large satisfied with the status quo in terms of legislative intervention for the regulation of property and the enjoyment of property rights.</P>
    <P>The question is whether the Supreme Court is frustrating the wishes of the democratically elected representatives of the people. At first glance this would not appear to be the case. However, two issues are worthy of attention and were brought before the Constitution committee over the last three or four months of hearings. The Employment Equality Bill 1996 was found to be unconstitutional by the Supreme Court on the basis that the concept of reasonable accommodation of employees with a disability was considered an unjust attack on the rights of employers.</P>
    <P>The view of the Supreme Court in the decision on Part V of the Planning and Development Act is worthy of much greater analysis. Most people simply say that Part V got through, therefore there is flexibility within the Constitution to legislate for change. The judgment stated:</P>
    <P>There can be no doubt that a person who is compulsorily deprived of his or her property in the interests of the common good should normally be fully compensated at a level equivalent to or at the least the market value of the acquired property.</P>
    <P>The phrase used was &ldquo;at least equivalent&rdquo; to market price rather than just compensation or fair compensation. While remembering that &ldquo;at least market value&rdquo; could be below just compensation or fair compensation as well as being above it,</P>
    <P>It was for those reasons the Taoiseach chose to apply the All-Party Committee on the Constitution to the issue of land policy. It is for that reason this Bill would not survive a constitutional challenge because it is two steps away from the concept supported by the Supreme Court in that decision. It moves away from the concept of market value and then it takes a further step away from the concept of rejecting the notion of fair or just compensation. One cannot be entirely sure if the Bill would be rejected by the Supreme Court, but it is likely that would happen for the reasons I have given. Market value can often be a function of Government activity, whether it is rezoning or the provision of infrastructure. I note that the Bill recognises that in the Schedule.</P>
    <P>Much of what is contained in the Bill is sensible and is the kernel of what needs to be done. However, the All-Party Committee on the Constitution is involved in a process of trying to bring together all the views and to consult with all the stakeholders. This House can legislate for that <Col N="127" /> once that report, which will be published in 2004, and the NESC report are available. I urge the House to reject the Bill for the reasons I have outlined.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnCreganFF" hpid="Mr. Cregan Mr. Cregan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cregan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad to have an opportunity to make a brief contribution this evening on the Bill. I support what Deputy Andrews said that the All-Party Committee on the Constitution is currently examining the two articles in the Constitution relating to private property to ascertain the extent to which they are serving the good of individuals and of the community and to decide whether changing them would result in a greater balance being struck between the two. The committee has been asked to consider the possibility of placing a cap on the value of development land and is expected to report in early 2004. For that reason alone, the Bill is premature. Pending the conclusion of the report, it would not be appropriate for the Oireachtas to enact measures for such a significant intervention in the housing and land markets, as proposed in the Bill.</P>
      <P>Meeting the strong demand for houses continues to be one of the major challenges facing the housing market. The strong demand has been driven by a range of factors, including demographic changes, growing population, lower interest rates and strong levels of economic growth which have facilitated lower tax levels and increased disposable incomes. With household formation patterns continuing to converge towards EU norms, this strong demand for housing is set to continue for the foreseeable future. However, the record levels of housing output which have been achieved in recent years have helped to meet this demand and have led to moderation in the rate of house price increases. The Government considers that supply is the key to addressing the pressure in the housing market and maintaining moderation in the rate of house price increases. The primary focus, therefore, has been on investing in infrastructure, to bring more serviced land into use and to ensure its effective use through residential density guidelines. The challenge remains to ensure continued high levels of supply to meet demand in the coming years. The Government will continue to support the delivery of an increased supply of housing.</P>
      <P>The success of this approach is evident. We are now realising sustained high levels of housing output which have not been experienced before in this country. Last year was the eighth consecutive year of record housing output with 57,695 completions. That is an increase of almost 10% on 2001 levels and 36% on the number of houses completed in 1998. Ireland is now building houses at the highest rate per head of population in the EU, which is a significant achievement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government's commitment to providing assistance to those who have difficulty meeting their accommodation needs through social and affordable housing also remains a priority, as set out in the national development plan. I am <Col N="128" /> pleased that last year saw the delivery of the highest level of output under the range of social and affordable housing measures for more than 15 years when the social and affordable housing needs of more than 12,700 households were met. Affordable housing options have expanded the choice for those on low incomes. The growth of the voluntary and co-operative sector has brought a new dimension to the provision of social rented accommodation. Specific programmes and plans have also been put in place to assist Travellers and the homeless. I expect the needs of approximately 13,000 households nationally will be met under the social and affordable housing measures this year. The supply of affordable housing in the coming years will also be boosted by the implementation of the provisions of Part V of the Planning and Development Act 2000 and the new affordable housing initiative in Sustaining Progress.</P>
    <P>These targeted measures to assist low income groups and those with special housing needs, together with the broader housing objectives of increasing overall supply, are often the cornerstone of the Government's overall response to meeting housing needs. The implementation of this approach will continue to be balanced with the need to respect the environmental, economic and social aspects of development because delivering housing in a sustainable manner can improve the quality of life of all sections of the community.</P>
    <P>It appears there are legal shortcomings with the Bill, some of which could leave it open to a constitutional challenge. The Bill appears to discriminate arbitrarily between a landowner who could sell development land at open market prices and those affected by a decision of a local authority who acquire their land at the much lower current use value. There is no legal guidance in the Bill on how local authorities would operate the provisions and there is no provision for ministerial guidance. Invariably, local authorities could apply the proposed new powers to different degrees and that could undermine the fair operation of the scheme. It seems to be intended that lands acquired by local authorities could be passed on to private developers at reduced prices as not all developers would receive such lands. There could be a significant impact on competitiveness within the building industry, which could give rise to issues of fairness.</P>
    <P>While I agree with most of what is in the Bill, it is premature. We are speaking about an important issue and we want to ensure we are in a position to provide land at affordable prices, particularly for young families in urban areas. It would be wrong of us to pre-empt the findings of the All-Party Committee on the Constitution. We should wait for its report in early 2004. For that reason, I oppose the Bill.</P>

      <P>It is just as well this issue is being discussed here this evening because it does not excite much comment from the public. This Bill will be an embarrassment to the Members of the House and to a small group of political commentators. The most embarrassing aspect of this Labour Party Bill is not the paucity of the detail, the technical faults or the fact that more time could have been spent in its preparation, but that it has taken so long for this House to introduce legislation on this issue. That is why the Labour Party should be commended. Unfortunately, it is probably too late to do anything because the property speculators have already made their millions. If the legislation was passed now, it would take a further two or three years to be enacted, and that would allow more time for those involved in such speculation to make more money.</P>
      <P>We should not be too worried about such speculation because it has been happening since the foundation of the State. It is not considered illegal unless a county councillor gets involved to ensure that planning decisions go a certain way in property transactions. Unfortunately, as we have seen at the tribunals, power corrupts. However, weak ethical and legislative standards also play an important part.</P>
      <P>The levels of corruption in this country would make the average African dictator blush. We have developed a golden circle of people with inside knowledge, which makes it easy for such people to make millions of euro. If this Bill was enacted tomorrow morning, what would be the result? Hundreds of thousands of angry protesters would take to the streets of all our major cities. The speculators would not protest because their numbers would not fill a bus. The builders would hardly be too concerned because they would continue making a profit. The streets would be full of the very people we are trying to protect by bringing in legislation such as this, because many families have paid huge prices for their average homes in our major cities.</P>
      <P>If any legislation were successfully implemented to reduce the price of sites and consequently of houses, between &euro;40,000 and &euro;70,000 could be knocked off the cost of new houses. However, this amount will also come off the price of a secondhand house, and all the people who have been conned, misled or forced into paying huge prices for houses scattered across this city and its outskirts will see their houses drop in value.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is why we have left it too late even to discuss this issue. Whatever measures were implemented, the very people we seek to protect are those who would suffer the most. The banks and speculators and everybody who has made millions in this area would not suffer &ndash; they might even find themselves with a couple of years' grace. I am not disputing what the Deputies are saying. There is an Oireachtas com<Col N="130" /> mittee discussing possible legislation to deal with this issue, but it will take two or three years anyway. This will give all these people plenty of time to work their way out before the sun sets on this kind of greedy behaviour which has been endemic in Irish political, cultural and economic life for generations, not just in the last ten years. The only difference is that now there is big money involved.</P>
    <P>Good political leadership is about recognising a problem before it becomes a crisis. The issue of manpower in general practice, which is close to my heart, is receiving very little interest. There are huge problems in the education sector, such as those relating to schools and resource teachers. All these problems were predicted a long time ago but nothing was done about them. I commend the Labour Party for belatedly raising this issue but, sadly, the slow progress of legislation through the House will place the present difficulties far beyond political solutions for some time. At least the Labour Party is making a start on the issue.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TonyGregory" hpid="Mr. Gregory Mr. Gregory">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gregory</NameTxt>
      <P>I support this Bill because it is an attempt to address an issue that successive Governments have failed to confront. Most Members agree that the breathtaking cost of houses in this State and the massive price increases that have spiralled out of control in recent years are totally unjustifiable and demand action. The scandal of homelessness is a black mark on the State, as are the huge waiting lists for local authority housing. In the background lurk those who profiteer and racketeer in new house prices and land values. A small number of multi-millionaires control the bulk of development land in the Dublin region. This is unsustainable and unjustifiable and no amount of tinkering with the system will change it.</P>
      <P>The Kenny report in the 1960s demonstrated clearly that radical measures were required but no Government had the courage to implement the recommendations of that report. The present Government has put the issue on the back burner yet again. In the absence of any genuine attempt to confront the problem, I support this Bill as a timely measure that focuses on the urgent need to address the housing crisis and end the motivation for planning corruption.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Since the non-implementation of the Kenny report we have seen corruption on a Sicilian scale. A litany of mafia style activities are being detailed before the tribunals. We have seen how individuals, in their greed to make millions at the stroke of a pen and the redrawing of a line on a map, set out to corrupt public representatives and councillors so that they would do their bidding at meetings of Dublin County Council. All of this was at the expense of the decent PAYE taxpayer who then spent a lifetime working to pay for a home of his or her own, and countless others who will never be able to purchase a house. The price of development land must be taken out of the hands of such corrupt individuals. Even when a <Col N="131" /> mildly progressive measure specifying that 20% of developments should be set aside for social and affordable housing was introduced &ndash; by a Fianna Fáil Minister, to my surprise at the time &ndash; the same obsessively greedy developers and builders banded together to smash the attempt at reform and fairness. This Government capitulated to the developers' lobby just as surely as some councillors did at Dublin County Council. That progressive measure was effectively abandoned, demonstrating the unseemly political influence of builder-developer interests in this country, regardless of the common good.</P>
    <P>One Member of this House did his utmost to expose the planning corruption that has contributed so much to this crisis. I refer to Deputy Joe Higgins who, for the past three weeks, has been incarcerated in Mountjoy Prison for representing his constituents' opposition to the confrontational policy of Fingal County Council in refusing to collect the household refuse of thousands of taxpayers who are boycotting the bin tax and for campaigning to abolish this double taxation. Deputy Higgins spent many years opposing planning corruption and it is an appalling injustice that he should now be imprisoned and denied his right to attend here as he was elected to do.</P>

      <P>Recent comments by the Taoiseach to the effect that the rising cost of housing would lead to problems for the next generation give the impression that we have no problems now but we may have in the future. The Taoiseach might like to feel that he is playing the role of a visionary, looking into the future. The fact is, however, that we do not need a visionary to see this problem; we just need leaders who can look at what is happening and provide solutions. All kinds of people, including builders, planners, the Government and the Taoiseach, agree that the cost of land accounts for a massive proportion of the price of a house &ndash; up to 50% &ndash; but nobody has done anything to solve the problem. For that reason I welcome this Bill and compliment the Labour Party, especially its Environment spokesperson, on its introduction.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Taoiseach has stated that over the past six years the Government has spent an awful lot of time examining the housing market. The reality is that over that period no reduction or stabilisation has occurred in house prices. Instead, the average price of a house has increased by more <Col N="132" /> than 125%. In a study carried out last year it was estimated that more than 30% of new households will not be able to afford to purchase a house. These people will look to the State for accommodation. That puts a strain on public finances and leads to higher taxation for the public. It is not only in the interest of the people who cannot afford to buy a house that this issue should be resolved; it is also of the utmost importance to the entire taxpaying population.</P>
    <P>Of course the Labour Party Bill will not cure all ills, but it is an attempt to introduce some equity. As Deputy Gilmore stated, the details can be worked out on Committee Stage. I have problems rationalising the massive increase in value that zoning bestows on land while lands literally over the fence remain of much less value. There is no balance or equity in that situation.</P>
    <P>Another issue that is not addressed in the Bill concerns lands that will be compulsorily acquired at a reduced rate. Adjoining lands may be similarly zoned, but because they will not be subject to compulsory purchase at a restricted price they can be sold on the open market at a much greater price. There is inequity there, too, but on balance I am supporting this Bill, if for no other reason than it is the only show in town attempting to address this problem.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ArthurMorganSF" hpid="Mr. Morgan Mr. Morgan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morgan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the introduction of this Bill from the Labour Party. A discussion on the need to control land prices is long overdue. The debate on this Bill represents one of the few times since his appointment as Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government that I have heard Deputy Cullen addressing the housing crisis. He usually prefers to relegate the matter to his Ministers of State, who do not attend Cabinet meetings.</P>
      <P>Sinn Féin made clear its views on the control of land prices in its submission to the All-Party Committee on the Constitution. In that submission we made the case for constitutional change, advocating that property rights should be dealt with in a single self-contained article. We also outlined our view that there are currently measures open to the Government to control the price of land. These include the capping of land prices at current use value and a more widespread use of compulsory purchase orders by local authorities to acquire land for housing. Our submission also stated:</P>
      <P>Local authorities are impeded from using CPOs to procure land for the provision of social housing by prohibitive compensation. Local authorities should have the power to acquire land at a price below the market value where this is necessary for the common good.  . . . Land owners must not be allowed to profit from the decisions which were intended to benefit society and address the severe housing crisis. Local authorities should not be put in a position that they are then forced to pay these same landowners outrageous sums of compensation for hoarded land.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="133" /> Sinn Féin also outlined its view to the all-party committee that, in many cases, Governments have used constitutional difficulties as nothing more than a convenient excuse for not introducing legislation. If there are such concerns, the constitutionality of legislation can be tested in the Supreme Court, as was done with Part V of the Planning and Development Act 2000.</P>
    <P>It is not acceptable for the Government to use the deliberations of the All-Party Committee on the Constitution on the issue of property rights as an excuse for failing to bring forward any legislation to control land prices. Regardless of claims to the contrary by the Minister in yesterday's debate, the housing crisis has deteriorated to an astounding degree since this Government took office in 1997. Though the Government's failure on housing is particularly notable, it should be noted that every party in power for the last 30 years has failed to implement the Kenny report on building land.</P>
    <P>Despite the obvious purpose of this Bill, in his speech to the House yesterday, the Minister failed to address the severe problems local authorities have in obtaining land for housing. He did not refer to the fact that this problem has been exacerbated by the nefarious Planning and Development (Amendment) Act 2002, which was introduced by the Minister on taking office. The amended Act allowed developers to buy their way out of the provision of social and affordable housing.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CiaranCuffeGP" hpid="Mr. Cuffe Mr. Cuffe">

      <P>In 1838, some 165 years ago, Thomas Drummond gave the phrase &ldquo;Property has its duties, as well as its rights&rdquo; to the Irish people. His words were addressed to the absentee landlords of Tipperary and a statue of Thomas Drummond stands today in the rotunda of City Hall in Dublin. His words run as true today as they did 165 years ago and, if anything, the problem has become worse. It is now almost impossible for those on low incomes, or even a couple on two average incomes, to buy their way into the housing market in Dublin or other cities and towns. If Thomas Drummond were around today he would be appalled at the price of land in Dublin and elsewhere. Indeed, in an address to the All-Party Committee on the Constitution, Mr. P. J. Drudy felt that even Éamon de Valera would turn in his grave at the kind of prices required to access the current housing market.</P>
      <P>It is not as if many people are gaining from that situation. A small cartel of developers controls the price of land in Dublin, yet Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats have done nothing to attack that cartel. They have stood idly by and watched the price of land go beyond the reach of ordinary people. It is not good enough for the Government to say it is doing all it can to help people to acquire a home of their own, when the price of land has escalated and the price of an average home in Dublin has passed the &euro;300,000 mark.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Why does the Government not destroy the car<Col N="134" /> tel? A recent article pointed out that a mere 25 landowners control the bulk of the building land in Fingal. That is not good enough for people who want to find their way onto the housing ladder, nor is it good enough for a Government that has pledged its commitment to housing, yet lacks delivery. It is not good enough for a previous speaker, the Minister of State, Deputy Parlon, to say he does not want to see the issue of land being addressed. It shows a lack of commitment and follow through in addressing the land issue.</P>
    <P>The Green Party is proud to support the Labour Party's Bill. Indeed, we would have been much happier if everyone in the House had rowed in behind our Bill, which was introduced several months ago. It took a broader approach to this issue but the sentiment and substance of the Labour Party's Bill, which carries on the tradition of the Kenny report, is worth upholding.</P>
    <P>We cannot stand idly by because we have to address the problem of rising land prices. The State must intervene. It took a courageous step in 1963 when it introduced the Planning Act but it must take a similarly courageous step today in addressing land prices. I commend the Labour Party on bringing this Bill before the House. The Green Party will certainly support it in the forthcoming vote.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Stagg</NameTxt>
      <P>In the past seven years we have witnessed a dramatic increase in house prices in Ireland. This has been accompanied by a public wringing of hands by various Ministers. As my colleague, Deputy Gilmore, pointed out in yesterday's debate, the principal hand-wringer has been no less than the leader of this country, the man who has been Taoiseach for the past six years, Deputy Bertie Ahern. That is all he has <Col N="135" /> done about it, however, and that is all he intends to do. With this Bill, Deputy Gilmore and the Labour Party intend to take effective action to deal with the crisis facing up to half the young families now seeking to provide their own homes.</P>
      <P>What has brought us to a situation where the price of a modest home has increased by as much as 300% in this short time? My own home has rocketed in that time from a value of about &euro;50,000 in 1996 to a present day value of &euro;200,000. The answer, I believe, is to be found in the failure of the great sacred cow of our time, the famous market. The unimpeded unregulated free-for-all market in housing has seen large sections of the population excluded from the market for homes. It has seen large scale land purchases by a small group of individuals and companies. It has seen land hoarding and speculation. It has seen notorious option taking and the making of huge profits on the backs of home buyers.</P>
      <P>That untouchable market has seen house sites representing up to 50% of the price of a home and it has seen land values increase from the present use value of £5,000 per acre to a regular &euro;1 million. That has an added value of &euro;995,000 per acre, 10,000% added value. The people concerned certainly hit the jackpot, but at the expense of young families throughout the country who were looking for a home. This is land that is eagerly zoned by a combination of Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael councillors up and down the country. The public does not seem to be aware that Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael and the Progressive Democrats, where they exist, have a near universal zoning pact on practically all our local authorities. This is land that is serviced with water, sewerage and roads from the taxpayers' pocket, with minimal return or claw-back.</P>
      <P>How does the Government use the fiscal tools available to it to regulate this out-of-control market? It removed the threat &ndash; indeed it was an idle threat &ndash; to impose a capital gains tax of 60% and reduced the 40% rate to 20%. It restored the tax breaks to speculators who can thereby compete unfairly with genuine home buyers. It increased the VAT on housing materials and in the meanest cut of all, removed the first-time buyer's grant. In other words, it rubbed the fat pig's arse with lard, while dumping on the young families striving for a home of their own. The present housing market makes overnight millionaires of landlords, speculators and developers while driving city workers deep into the country in search of an affordable house, totally excluding a large section of the population from the possibility of buying a home. It drives the latter into the uncaring hands of unregulated landlords who have no social responsibility and whose only motive is profit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Fianna Fáil has no intention of doing anything about it. Indeed, those who gained handsomely from this failed market are to be found in large numbers in the Fianna Fáil tent at the Galway <Col N="136" /> races. I suppose one could call them &ldquo;the tent people&rdquo;. The Progressive Democrats have been totally assimilated back into Fianna Fail and are powerless to act. Fine Gael has neither the political bottle nor inclination to act against the enthusiastic hoard of zoners in its ranks. That is to be expected.</P>
    <P>Labour is determined to act effectively to bring equity and fairness to the housing market. This Bill is a first step. Labour accepts that competition can be a useful tool in regulating prices, provided there is a level playing pitch. The pitch in the housing market is severely tilted in favour of landowners and speculators. We intend to restore that balance. The market should be a tool for the common good and not a vehicle to serve the few at the expense and to the disadvantage of the many. That is our present model in housing. Labour demands that there be a social market, regulated in the common interest. Yet Labour will intervene in the market. We intend to put a halter on the sacred cow to ensure it operates for the common good. We will intervene to ensure that young families can again aspire to a home of their own, to remove them from the maw of unregulated landlords and let them live in proximity to their place of work. We will intervene to ensure that provision is made for adequate social housing. Some 60,000 families are now on the waiting list. That is approximately 250,000 men, women and children, and it is growing by 10,000 families per year. That is a scandal that must now be tackled in this rich economy.</P>
    <P>To achieve these objectives there must be intervention in this out of control market. There must also be a positive use of fiscal measures and we will pursue an end to the tax bias for speculators and developers and positive discrimination for genuine home seekers. As indicated by our spokesperson, Deputy Gilmore, this Bill is a first step towards achieving our objectives in securing affordable and social homes for our people, and we believe it complies with the strictures of our Constitution. The common good is superior to claims to rights of private property, which damage and oppose the common good. If the courts find that our Bill is at odds with our Constitution &ndash; I am convinced it is not &ndash; let us put the issue to the people. Let the people decide whose side they are on, the speculators or young home hunters. I am confident of the people's response.</P>
    <P>I take this opportunity to call on other like-minded Deputies and parties of the House to come together to support this measure and I welcome their indicated support in this debate. The right wing parties will do the predictable thing. They will wring their hands. They will cry crocodile tears and they will protect their friends, those I have described as &ldquo;the tent people&rdquo;. Let us show them that there is a real and viable alternative.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LizMcManus" hpid="Ms McManus Ms McManus">
      <NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this debate. I welcome the good, substantial work done by the Labour spokesperson on the Environment, Heri<Col N="137" /> tage and Local Government, Deputy Gilmore, in producing this weighty legislation to deal with an issue of major public importance. The fact that this Bill comes from the Opposition side of the House and that it is the Labour Party and not the Government parties that has taken the initiative speaks volumes. It is a product of work that a good Government should have done long ago. That is what a Government is for, to tackle the big issues that affect the lives of its citizens, through the enactment of good law.</P>
      <P>Tackling issues is not what the Government is about, however. This is a Government that tends to look for different ways to deal with issues. It sets up working groups, establishes committees, brings in consultants and prepares endless numbers of reports, rather than being a Government that makes decisions. Nowhere is this more true than in the area of housing. Report after report has been produced by the Government and yet there is no alleviation in the difficulties that beset young people setting out to buy a home or indeed seeking council housing.</P>
      <P>The rise in housing need, housing cost and homelessness continues inexorably. The Taoiseach has talked publicly about land hoarding and the need to tackle land speculation. Even today in the Dáil he said he supports the principles set out in the Kenny report on controlling the cost of building land. He even said he supports the effort of Deputy Gilmore as regards the Bill we are debating now. He apparently, like Deputy Gilmore, considers land to be the key to resolving the housing crisis that has characterised the period in office of Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats. Unlike Deputy Gilmore, however, the Taoiseach refuses to act on that conviction. He refuses to support this Bill and assist its passage through the Oireachtas, even though it is a solid and well thought out approach designed to tackle the spiralling costs of building land and the issue of land hoarding.</P>
      <P>In the face of this Bill the Taoiseach shelters behind the argument that a referendum may be required to change the Constitution before the issue can be confronted. He talked today about the &ldquo;absolute right&rdquo; to private property. Yet again he speaks in double speak. It is not an absolute right. It is a right enshrined in Article 43 of the Constitution, certainly, but one that is clearly tempered by the statement that the exercise of this right ought to be regulated by the principles of social justice. The Constitution goes further in declaring that the State may delimit by law as occasion requires the exercise of the said rights, with a view to reconciling their exercise with the exigencies of the common good.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The principle of protecting the common good could not be more explicit. It has already been instrumental in legislation that permits compulsory purchase by local authorities and in the more recent Part 10 provision, which in ways goes further than the Labour Bill does in capping the price of land. It is difficult to accept the argument that compulsory purchase of land to build a road <Col N="138" /> is constitutional and yet to cap the price of land in order to house a family is not.</P>
    <P>The following question must be put again to the Government and to the Taoiseach, in particular: if the key to meeting housing needs is land &ndash; we are all agreed on that point &ndash; and if in the constitutional provision is made for the common good &ndash; as it is &ndash; why is the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government refusing to accept this Bill or to present his own Bill to be debated in the Oireachtas? Such a Bill once passed could &ndash; and no doubt would &ndash; be tested in the Supreme Court. I would wish good luck to anybody who sets out to do so.</P>
    <P>Government inaction is prolonging unnecessarily the damage being done by the greed of speculators. Spiralling house prices continue to put terrible pressure of young people. Many couples with children are made up of two partners working &ndash; not out of choice but because they are locked into a mortgage, others simply cannot afford to get up the ladder and end up on local authority housing lists instead and some fall off the ladder altogether. Homelessness is a growing feature of the housing crisis but too often it is a forgotten experience.</P>
    <P>Last week a survey was published on the extent of homelessness in my town of Bray, a town of 30,000 people. It was based on carefully measured research and if anything is conservative in its conclusions. It finds that 87 individuals or family groups in Bray alone are homeless &ndash; either sleeping rough or living in hostels, refuges or bed and breakfasts. Being homeless during the years of the Celtic tiger means being squeezed out of the private rented sector because rents are simply too high. More children than ever are being reared without the security of having a home of their own during their early and formative years. What kind of future do they face? The inequality between the prices that are made on land sales and the weekly income of homeless people struggling to survive is obscene.</P>
    <P>Inequality needs to be tackled on many fronts. In order to get to grips with the great housing need that affects so many thousands of people, this Labour Bill is as good a place as any to start. This Bill will, if enacted, relieve the burden of high mortgages for house buyers, it will release land from being hoarded for house building and it will relieve local authorities of having to pay exorbitant prices for land to meet their housing programme requirement.</P>
    <P>This is a visionary Bill that is radical and circumstances demand a bold and radical response. Regrettably we have a Government that is too craven or too compromised to take the necessary steps to ensure that housing is made available that is of a reasonable quality, at a reasonable rate and at a reasonable price. It is an objective that, long ago, would have been central to Fianna Fáil thinking. Today, looking at the record of Fianna Fáil Ministers in Government and the Taoiseach in particular, it is clearly the last thing on their minds.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PadraicMcCormack" hpid="Mr. McCormack Mr. McCormack">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCormack</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the fact that the Labour Party published this Bill because of the debate it is generating both inside and outside the House. The proposals in the Bill attempt to address the issues of availability and cost of land for housing development. In his contribution last night, Deputy Gilmore stated that the cost of land represents 40% of the cost of housing and this theme was taken up by my colleague Deputy McHugh whose estimate is 50%. We need to be very careful about the difference between the reality and the propaganda, which is letting certain people off the hook in this debate.</P>
      <P>I represent Galway city where building land is very expensive, about &euro;300,000 per acre. However, this adds only 5% to the cost of building a house. In other towns in County Galway such as Athenry and Tuam, which Deputy McHugh represents, building land costs about &euro;15,000 per acre and with 15 houses built on an acre, it represents only 0.5% on the cost of a house. We must not lose sight of the real target in our anxiety to say that the cost of building land is the only contributor to the cost of housing.</P>
      <P>The proposed Bill may be of great relevance in Dublin where exceptional pieces of land can make exceptional prices and which may account for 40% of the cost of a house. However this is not the norm for the whole country. If we continue to propagate the notion that the cost of building land is the entire cause for high house prices, developers will have no bother asking whatever prices they like for houses. Let us remove the red herring of the cost of land driving up the cost of housing and allocate blame where it should lie, which is solely at the feet of the Government.</P>
      <P>At the last budget the Minister abolished the first-time buyer's grant adding &euro;3,800 to the cost of a new house. VAT was increased by 1% adding another &euro;2,000. When the planning levies, planning charges, stamp duty, etc., are added to these increases we see the real cost. Responsibility for those increases lies solely with the Government and specifically the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government. Cash strapped councils are now raising their finances by imposing serious charges on planning permissions. Some time ago the Taoiseach hinted that land prices should be controlled, but this is only a smokescreen for the extreme Government tax policies which result in crippling costs of housing for young people trying to get on the housing ladder for the first time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We should not be sucked into the belief that land cost is the real factor in the prices developers are charging for houses. There are Government charges and now local authority planning charges are being imposed at will on planning permissions. Local authorities are now dealing with their estimates and there is no provision made in the support grant for benchmarking or any other extra costs the councils will have to face. What will councils do? They will slap another &euro;100,000 on every planning permission in the county and <Col N="140" /> drive up further the price of houses because the Government is not providing the money for local authorities to deal with the housing crisis.</P>
    <P>Land prices represent only a small factor in the overall cost and we must not let people off the hook. If a developer buys two adjacent sites, one for &euro;5,000 and the other for &euro;50,000, and builds two identical houses, he will offer both for sale at the same price. One will not be &euro;45,000 cheaper than the other. It is supply and demand along with the developers' greed that are causing very high houses prices.</P>
    <P>I take some exception to Deputy Stagg's remarks about cosy cartels and agreements between Fine Gael, the Progressive Democrats and Fianna Fáil on local authorities. I have the privilege to represent my party on Galway City Council and was previously a member of Galway County Council. There is no agreement between the councillors. At the last council meeting on Monday night, I was joined by two Labour councillors in not supporting a material contravention of the plan. In the course of discussing our development plan I did not believe we had the authority to increase the value of land by several multiples, so I voted against the material contravention of the plan. The agreements mentioned by Deputy Stagg do not apply to the council I represent nor do they apply in several other authorities.</P>
    <P>Our amendment is intended to allow us to await the outcome of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on the Constitution, which is a logical step that is supported by the Minister. Last night he said, &ldquo;I do not agree that it is necessary or prudent to pre-empt the considered conclusions of the committee.&rdquo;  On this basis, it is logical that the Government parties would support our amendment.  I am a member of that committee which received 139 submissions, 64 from organisations and 75 from individuals. During July and September we met 50 groups during our oral hearings.</P>
    <P>If we follow the logic of the Labour Bill we would have to take other factors into account. For example, if an auctioneer or an agent is selling two houses, one beside a newly opened DART station and the other one and a half miles away, the one beside the DART station will sell for &euro;50,000 more than the one that is one and a half miles away. Is the Labour Party suggesting that &euro;50,000 must be taken from the person who gets the extra &euro;50,000 for their house? That would not stand up anywhere. The committee is doing excellent work in sorting it out and will be coming back to the Government and the Dáil with a report on its deliberations before the end of the year.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms Cooper-Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sharing my time with the Minister of State, Deputy Gallagher. I also welcome an opportunity to speak on the Bill. I have no doubt that Deputy Gilmore has been motivated by good will and that his intentions in bringing the matter before us are sincere.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="141" />I was delighted to listen to Deputy McCormack's speech because previous speakers gave the impression that this Bill was aimed only at Dublin. There seemed to be no consideration given to the supply of, and demand for, housing in the regional towns and cities. The Deputy might take on board my remarks about my county when we consider this matter again a few months from now.</P>
    <P>There is a problem in the city of Dublin and many other cities and towns with regard to the price of houses for the first-time buyer but we have to acknowledge what the Government has done in this regard already. In his speech to the House yesterday the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government outlined the significant progress that has been made in the number of new house starts and how this has increased from 39,000 houses built in 1997 to 58,000 units in 2002. This is a significant increase and about 60,000 houses will have been built by the end of this year.</P>
    <P>When compared to other countries in Europe our track record is very high at 14.7 units completed per thousand. In the United Kingdom the rate is three per thousand. In addition this Government has taken several measures to help people living on a low income to buy their houses, through the social and affordable housing scheme and the shared ownership scheme which are operating successfully. The schemes have been quite successful in my county.</P>
    <P>Like Deputy McCormack, I have to say that there is no agreement at Mayo County Council between the Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael councillors. We argue measures on their merits and if there is agreement at times it is because great minds think alike. There is no cartel operating between the main political parties.</P>
    <P>Many people here have said that Part V of the Planning Act 2000 was a good measure and operated quite successfully and others have said it has been eroded by amendments.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanRyan" hpid="Mr. S. Ryan Mr. S. Ryan">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BeverleyCooperFlynn" hpid="Ms Cooper-Flynn Ms Cooper-Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Ms Cooper-Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>It has not worked in my constituency but maybe for reasons other than those affecting some of the constituencies in Dublin. There are several options available under Part V, one of which, as we all know, is that 20% of the land will be made available; the second option is alternative sites and the third is the cash option. In my county not one site has been made available to the council since this measure has been introduced. It has been a disaster in County Mayo. Instead of helping to relieve the housing problem, this measure has been detrimental because it has hindered much development.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The emphasis of Part V is wrong. A developer who allocates 20% of the land can negotiate with the local authority that the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government will provide &euro;120,000 to build a housing unit on that site. The cash option, which can be used if <Col N="142" /> the other two options are not suitable, is less than that so the local authority never wants to consider the cash option as an alternative.</P>
    <P>As a result, many planning applications that could have alleviated the housing problem in my county have fallen by the wayside. This is after massive fees have been paid to make the applications in the first instance. We even have the ridiculous situation in County Mayo that Part V is actually being applied to rural areas that are not zoned, which is completely against the legislation. I do not understand how that can happen.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister will address this. He mentioned in his speech that clear guidelines have been given to local authorities for the implementation of Part V. From my information it seems to be implemented differently in every county.</P>
    <P>When Deputy Stagg was speaking he mentioned the &ldquo;tent people&rdquo;. Unfortunately, I did not get to the tent at the Galway Races but I consider myself to be pro-development, although that now seems almost to be a dirty word. Many developers have done excellent work even if it is not popular to say that in the present environment.</P>
    <P>The Government has handed this matter over to the All-Party Committee on the Constitution. The price of land, and how best to deal with the question of capping it, are not new issues. I cannot understand why for the sake of a few months the Labour Party could not allow this issue to be left over until such time as we have examined and consulted various people on the constitutional and legal issues.</P>
    <P>On many occasions in the past when legislation was brought before the House we were shot down for not having had adequate consultation. Here we have an all-party committee looking at this matter and unfortunately Deputy Gilmore feels that he has to jump the gun. It is politically very popular to do so because this is an issue affecting many people. The correct and proper action is to hear what the committee has to say and take the benefit of the consultations and advice. When all of that has been done, let us bring a Bill into the House that will address the issues, not just in Dublin but throughout the country. I do not see why we cannot look at different measures in different areas that would solve the housing problem in a comprehensive manner.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatTheCope" hpid="Mr. Gallagher Mr. Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government (Mr. Gallagher)</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill proposes to amend the existing rules of compensation for land acquisition by local authorities, and move from valuation based on open market value to valuation determined by one of several different mechanisms, including current use value. The underlying focus of this Bill is the availability and cost of land required for housing development, and downstream house prices. Two main objectives were identified. The first is to empower local authorities to acquire development land at lower cost, either for their own use or for onward sale to developers. The underlying objective is to <Col N="143" /> restrict the betterment value accruing to development land as a result of zoning or servicing of land by public authorities. The second is to ensure that all available housing land is brought speedily to the market. Concerns were expressed that development lands were being deliberately hoarded, particularly in Dublin, to artificially inflate prices.</P>
      <P>This Government has already made great strides regarding the availability and price of housing. Unprecedented demand in the housing market has clearly fuelled house price increases. This Government's strategic response is to maximise housing supply to match demand and so stabilise prices and improve affordability. By any objective standard, we have been highly successful. Housing supply has expanded consistently over eight years to the extent that completions this year could exceed 60,000 units. Ireland now is building houses at the fastest rate in Europe. Housing targets in the national development plan are being met or exceeded. However, the radical intervention now proposed not only raises very significant constitutional issues, but also could have major implications for the effective operation of the land and housing markets.</P>
      <P>This proposal is premature, as the All-Party Committee on the Constitution is examining current constitutional provisions for private property, and has been asked in particular to consider the possibility of placing a cap on the value of development land. The committee is expected to report within a matter of months.</P>
      <P>Furthermore, the NESC is undertaking a major study on housing and land policy to be completed by the end of this year. The study will be broad in scope, and will highlight key housing issues and policy problems in the Irish context. Pending the reports of the all-party committee and the NESC, the Government considers it would not be appropriate for the Oireachtas to enact such significant measures as are now proposed.</P>
      <P>In any event, it would appear there are specific legal shortcomings in the Bill, as well as serious questions about the practical impact of the measures intended. In particular, large-scale public intervention in the housing market poses a high risk of disrupting housing construction programmes in the short-term and increasing construction inflation. Prudence dictates that a measure such as this must be based on sound analysis and engender a high degree of confidence as to the consequences. A &ldquo;try it and see&rdquo; approach would be wholly irresponsible. It is hoped that much of the requisite analysis will emerge from the studies currently under way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As to alleged hoarding of development land, the position is that despite anecdotal comment, there is currently no hard evidence of monopolistic hoarding, as distinct from the normal land banking which one would expect. Deputy Gilmore, in suggesting that this is a contributory factor in the slow release of building land in Dublin, cited findings in the building industry bulletin <Col N="144" /> to the effect that over half the development land in Fingal is controlled by 25 individuals or organisations. What that finding suggests is that the market is not concentrated to a significant degree. The same article goes on to state: &ldquo;there is no evidence of a cartel between Fingal developers&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Available information shows that adequate zoned and serviced land is coming through the planning system. By mid-2002, Dublin had approximately 5,700 acres of zoned and serviced land, with a potential yield of 96,700 units. Approximately 13,400 units received planning permission in the greater Dublin area in the first half of 2003, including 10,260 in Dublin, an increase of 32%. Since then, the Adamstown and Phoenix Park developments, involving 12,000 units, have been approved. This does not suggest substantial hoarding. However, let me stress that the Government has an open mind on this issue. If Opposition Deputies have credible evidence of hoarding, I suggest they should supply it.</P>
    <P>Deputy Power indicated that the all-party committee will evaluate the dynamics of the housing market as, no doubt, will the NESC. I hope this work will provide useful new information and perspectives. For its part, the Government has commissioned research in relation to building land in certain development areas, particularly Dublin, to determine whether the delivery of building land is being inappropriately retarded and explore the feasibility of a possible intervention. This work will be completed shortly. If, in light of the all-party committee and NESC reports, further measures are considered necessary to enhance land supply, the Government would consider a taxation-based approach to incentivise the early use of development land for housing.</P>
    <P>The proposed Bill may be well meaning, but it is premature and not well founded. Accordingly, the Government opposes this Bill.</P>

      <P>I thank my colleagues from various sides of the House who supported Deputy Gilmore's Bill. It is subject to the criticism put forward by Deputy Twomey that perhaps it has not come forward as early as it might, but that is not really the fault of the Labour Party. When Deputy Ruairí Quinn tried to bring forward this Bill in 1980, it was voted down in the House. The comprehensive measure now put forward by Deputy Gilmore is an attempt to rein in spiralling house prices before all of us pay a bigger price.</P>
      <P>Having thanked colleagues in the House for their support, I wish to deal with some of the arguments which have been advanced against this Bill. Perhaps the most dispiriting aspect is the response by the Minister with responsibility in this area, the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Cullen. He gave no hope whatsoever that the Government has any intention of taking measures other than letting the market rip. We know where that has left us over the past six or eight years. In his statement, the Minister said:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="145" />This Government's strategy on housing is to continue to maximise and accelerate housing supply to match existing demand and stabilise prices, so that people who desire to own their homes will able to do so. . . . . . .  The overall objective of this Government is to continue to increase housing supply to meet demand and to improve affordability, especially for first-time buyers. . . . .. The Government remains committed to implementing measures to boost the supply of housing and, in this way, we seek to bring moderation to the rate of house price increases. . . . .. Since 1998, almost a quarter of a million new houses have been built. New house price inflation was reduced from about 40% to about 8% at the end of 2002.</P>
    <P>In other words, according to the Minister, everything is fine, Government policy is working and there is no problem. That is the gist of the Minister's speech.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">

    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>That is what the Minister said. The message throughout his speech was &ldquo;Leave it to the market.&rdquo;  As an important matter of detail, that is not the public view of the Taoiseach, although I do not know what his private view may be, and there is usually reason to check. However, his public view is that he agrees with Deputy Gilmore &ndash; that is what he stated today during questions in the House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach agreed with Deputy Gilmore. I am not sure where that leaves the Minister, but this is not the first time he has kicked the Taoiseach and got away with it. That probably says more about the Taoiseach than the Minister. Clearly, the Minister is closer to his former party's contributor to the debate, the Minister of State, Deputy Parlon, than to the Taoiseach. The Minister of State, Deputy Parlon, described the Bill as somewhere to the left of Stalin.</P>
      <P>I have my own views about the Taoiseach and, in my time, I have called him a few things which I believe were richly merited. However, I never described him as being left of Stalin. I regard that as an extraordinary charge on the part of the Minister of State. The Taoiseach went into considerable detail today to say he agreed with the analysis put forward in this Bill. However, that view does not seem to have much support in the present Fianna Fáil-Progressive Democrats Government.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>I quoted what the Minister said. It is interesting, in terms of that analysis, to refer to the <i>Housing Times </i>of summer 2003, in which this argument was discussed by an economist, Dr. Jenny Pollock. Her job is to advise house builders. Her argument was that to the extent that house price inflation may ameliorate, because of the way things are currently organised we can expect to see a fall-off in construction. That was the expert advice of Dr. Jenny Pollock in that edition. She stated: &ldquo;As we have argued before, such a slow-down in housing starts would appear to be vital if the supply of new property is not to exceed demand.&rdquo;  In other words, with regard to the theory that one should let the market decide, Dr. Jenny Pollock, who was retained to advise house builders, said the situation as between supply and demand was coming dangerously into kilter and the only way to keep house prices up was to slow down the rate of construction. That is her proposition and that is inevitably what will happen.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
      <P>We will not accept that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>It will happen because one measure introduced by the Minister for Finance with which the Labour Party agreed, in 1998, would have caused the land that is being hoarded to be put into the marketplace for building. He cut the rate of capital gains tax from 40% to 20%, except in the case of development land that was hoarded for four years, which would attract a rate of 60% if it was not released. Two years later, as soon as that measure was beginning to have an effect, he repealed it.</P>
      <P>That is one of the aspects that is absolutely critical if we are to get land into the marketplace for building purposes. Otherwise it will be hoarded, as is being done. Dr. Jenny Pollock says it ought to be hoarded. Her job, after all, is to advise the builders and that is her view. It is an entirely respectable view but it is counter to the common good.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the result of leaving the market alone.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="147" />The Minister reads his script but the Taoiseach says entirely different things. The Taoiseach has a unique talent to describe a problem and leave the impression that action is being taken &ndash; the more he describes the problem, the more he convinces himself that the Government is acting on it. He will take over the arguments of the Opposition as if they are his own and then convey the impression that he acting on them or, if it is a difficult problem, that he is a helpless bystander merely commenting on events and the received wisdom of the day. During Question Time today, on questions on the proposals for a constitutional amendment, the Taoiseach said, &ldquo;I accept many of the points he [Deputy Gilmore] made. I subscribe to his efforts.&rdquo;  He went on to say, &ldquo;I agree with Deputy Gilmore because he said many of the things I have been saying.&rdquo;  The impression the Taoiseach seeks to give is unavoidable &ndash; he and Deputy Gilmore are of like mind and are resolved on a solution.</P>
    <P>The problem is that the Taoiseach seems blissfully unaware of the fact that he is the leader of the Government and Deputy Gilmore is the Labour Party spokesperson on the environment. One has power to advocate solutions, while the other has power to implement. Our unfortunate Taoiseach does not know to which category he belongs.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
      <P>He certainly does. We would not have Part V of the Planning and Development Act if it were not for him.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>That is why we have had six and a half years of inaction. In his seventh consecutive year as Taoiseach, Deputy Bertie Ahern has used up four years seeming to agree with Deputy Gilmore but nothing has changed except that house prices have got worse. Houses that cost on average &euro;97,058 in 1996 cost on average &euro;297,424 last year, an increase of 200%.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>Indeed, and I congratulate the Government on doing that but the fact is we still have an acute housing crisis.</P>
      <P>I will give the argument put forward by the Central Bank, which was misrepresented on some of the occasions reference was made to it during the debate. The bank said:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The level of house prices along with continuing high rates of increase in prices pose macroeconomic as well as financial stability risks. Even if rising house prices do not seem to have boosted consumption through wealth effects with related inflationary pressures, they have substantial potential to contribute to wage pressures as even relatively well-paid workers find it increasingly difficult to gain a foothold on the housing ladder. As regards financial stability, it is important that borrowers do not <Col N="148" /> assume excessive debt and that lenders maintain prudent lending standards.</P>
    <P>The report continues:</P>
    <P>To the extent that there may be overvaluation present, a continued rise in house prices could be followed by quite a disruptive adjustment as prices revert to their fundamental values.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
      <P>I said that 12 months ago.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>Maybe the answer is that the Minister should be in the Central Bank and the author, Dr. Casey, ought to be Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government. Some have presented this as a comment by the bank that it sees a dip coming in house prices. That is not what it is saying. It is saying that if the Government does not tackle inflation in the housing market, and if there is overvaluation of housing &ndash; which there is &ndash; then there could, as a result of Government inaction, be a disruptive adjustment in prices.</P>
      <P>That is an argument from the Central Bank that has serious macroeconomic implications if we do not address spiralling house prices. There is no evidence this message has been heard, judging by the extreme language I heard from the Minister of State at the Department of Finance, Deputy Parlon, whose last action on this issue was to lead a raid on the Exchequer by his then members that held up the national development plan for 11 months while they made a killing from the taxpayer. If that is the view of the Progressive Democrats, and I am not necessarily saying it is the view of the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform &ndash; I can perfectly understand why he would have a different view from Deputy Parlon &ndash; I cannot see where the Taoiseach will go with this issue.</P>
      <P>Another issue has not been addressed. Our overworked colleagues in the media who do not qualify for benchmarking have not adverted to this debate at all and rarely touch on it when it comes to dealing with the subject. The paucity of coverage the media gave to Jerome Casey's <i>Building Industry Bulletin</i> is remarkable. This traced the ownership of land in Fingal, where the majority of land is in the hands of a small number of people&mdash;</P>

      <P>I cannot help believing that one of the reasons sections of the media do not bother to address the deeper arguments is the relationship between the big five auctioneering companies and the advertising features of the newspapers <Col N="150" /> that have helped to drive this phenomenon even more fervidly that would otherwise have been the case.</P>
      <P>Deputy Twomey made a serious point about an issue that must be addressed. It is important to say to him that the cap would be accompanied by the tax measure that the Minister for Finance advocated himself until supply and demand are in kilter. Local authorities are building very few houses and housing co-operatives are building none because they cannot afford to buy the land. I regret that I see no more evidence in the contributions of Government speakers of an intention to do anything about this now than there was to support Deputy Quinn's Bill in 1980.</P>

      <P>I thank you, Acting Chairman, for the opportunity to raise this important matter on the Adjournment. Many vocational education committees, including County Kerry VEC, have recently been informed by the Department of Education and Science that it will not provide financial support for participants in VTOS, Youthreach and Traveller training centres for child care in the current year. These savage cuts mean that second chance education and training opportunities will be denied to unemployed adults and early school leavers in the 2003-04 school year.</P>
      <P>Equality in education, for which this Minister, Deputy Dempsey, has become the self-proclaimed Messiah, is once again being undermined by that same Minister, especially for the educationally disadvantaged and, in this case, particularly women. The allocation for child care grants this year has been cut dramatically by 37% on last year's allocation. These savage cuts were not announced publicly. Instead the Department of Education and Science informed vocational education committees about their budgets for the new year and vocational education committees had to pass on the news to their VTOS participants. All the VTOS participants and Youthreach schemes in Kerry received was a three line memorandum outlining the changes.</P>
      <P>In County Kerry, for example, 128 students are involved in seven VTOS, four Youthreach and two Traveller training centres. They are based in Tralee, Dingle, Killarney, Listowel, Killorglin, Cahirciveen and Kenmare. What does the Minister have to say to those people who entered their courses on the basis that child care would be available to them? Child care funding will not be available for school going children. What will these participants do when their children are at school? They will have to abandon their classes as they are not in a position to pay for private child care. This will strongly discourage anyone with school-going children from entering education.</P>
      <P>I refer to a letter I received from one participant in VTOS. This group of women tell me they are in the second year of their course and will now be unable to finish it, thus rendering their first year of study null and void. As these students rightly point out, these cuts actively discourage women with children from participating in courses, which is discrimination against women, especially women with children.</P>
      <P>These cuts will undermine the purpose for which the Department introduced child care grants in 1998, which was to encourage women with children to engage in the training courses on offer and to help them to go on to further training and enter the workforce. The cuts will compound educational disadvantage in this State. Many students who have already signed up for courses will not be able to take up these places in 2003 without child care support. Students who commenced courses last year will not be able to continue their studies if vital child care funding is not restored.</P>
      <P>We, as a society, actively encouraged people, particularly women, who could do so to take up places on VTOS courses in County Kerry and elsewhere in the country. The Government is telling them otherwise and is breaching that contract made with them when they began their courses. I ask the Minister to explain to the 128 VTOS participants in County Kerry, whom I represent, why he is preventing them from entering education.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelRing" hpid="Mr. Ring Mr. Ring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ring</NameTxt>
      <P>I am disappointed that the Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Noel Demp<Col N="155" /> sey, is not here tonight. Instead, we have the Minister of State for Health and Children, Deputy Tim O'Malley.</P>
      <P>The women and children of this country are violently sick with the Government. They are sick of the cutbacks and the way in which women and children are being treated by the Government. As Deputy Moynihan-Cronin said, these cutbacks are an attack on women and children. Under the Constitution, we aspire to treat all children equally. Yet, women and children are affected by these cutbacks.</P>
      <P>It is a disgrace. Some of those affected are already on the VTOS courses and have entered into contracts for child care places in the private sector. They have paid for their places and now find they will not get their funding from the vocational education committees. This Government has been lecturing about putting people back into the workplace and into education. Yet what is happening? For a measly few thousand euro they are cutting back on the child care and this will adversely affect women and children throughout the State. If these people have any chance at all at present, they will have no chance if they cannot get some education and they will have no chance at all if they cannot get back into the workplace. These people do not want to be on social welfare for the rest of their lives. They want to be educated and to get into the workplace. All they are asking from the Government is a chance.</P>
      <P>Last week I met women in Castlebar, Belmullet, Swinford, and Ballinrobe who have to give up these courses simply because the Government wants to save a few thousand euro. Why not cut back on the Government jet and the chocolate the Minister has when on it? Why does the Government not cut back on the State receptions we will be having next year for the EU Presidency? Of course there will be no shortage of money then. The money will be found to wine and dine all those foreign dignitaries.</P>
      <P>The Government must immediately find the funding &ndash; they always can find it when pressed &ndash; to provide the child care facilities for the women taking up these VTOS courses. These cutbacks are an attack on women, children and the weakest in society. This is the same Government who cut back on the back to education scheme, the back to work scheme and the summer jobs scheme. Who is it targeting all the time? People on low incomes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Alex Ferguson of Manchester United FC is fighting with his Irish colleagues about the famous horse, Rock of Gibraltar. That horse is making thousands of euro on stud fees and not one cent of tax is charged to Mr. Ferguson. Can Alex Ferguson afford to pay a bit of tax? I suppose he could be on anything from &euro;2 million to &euro;3 million a year. Can Mr. Magnier and all his friends <Col N="156" /> who own that horse afford to pay tax on those stud fees? They can and those taxes should then be used to pay the VTOS.</P>
    <P>There is another way the Government can save money. The Comptroller and Auditor General said the Government has spent &euro;47 million on reports and consultants. The friends of the Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrat Parties should put that money back and give it to the people who need it &ndash; the people on the VTOS courses. I hope the Minister of State's reply will be a positive one for the people in counties Mayo, Kerry, Dublin and Cork. They are not asking for too much. They are simply asking for a small bit help up the ladder.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TimOMalleyPD" hpid="Mr. T. O'Malley Mr. T. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children (Mr. T. O'Malley)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad to have the opportunity to respond to the issue raised by the Deputies on behalf of the Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Noel Dempsey.</P>
      <P>The VTOS was established in 1989 as a special initiative designed to cater for the education and training needs of the long-term unemployed. The current running cost of the programme is approximately &euro;50 million per annum. VTOS has proved to be successful in opening up learning and progression opportunities for people who have been marginalised by unemployment. It has been highly responsive to the current requirements of employers in that it equips participants with a range of general education and vocational qualifications, and a wide range of core transferable skills. For each of the years 1994 to 2002, the percentage of participants who completed the programme and progressed to work or further education was 70% or more.</P>
      <P>In 1998, the European Social Fund made available a certain amount of money to be used for paying child care expenses of people for whom VTOS, Youthreach and senior traveller centre programmes were designed but who were not able to enrol on them because of child care responsibilities. The initial period of funding from the ESF has now ceased and grants to vocational education committees in relation to child care are met from the Exchequer.</P>
      <P>The scheme of grants to vocational education committees for child care costs has always been constrained by the amount of money provided in the annual estimates. The grant from the Department of Education and Science was, and continues to be, a contribution to costs. It is a matter for the vocational education committees to address the issue of child care costs having regard to the grant available.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The initial letter of September 1998 on the scheme of grants towards child care costs set out the parameters of the scheme. It indicated that there was flexibility within the provision as to how best to target and prioritise the needs of eli<Col N="157" /> gible students. However, it also stipulated that the service would be subject to the constraints of the overall grant made available, which could not be exceeded. The process of allocating the general child care fund among vocational education committees begins each year with a request to vocational education committees to complete a form accounting for the previous year's grant, and projecting expenditure for the current year.</P>
    <P>Up to 2002, the amount of money made available annually to each VEC was enough to meet the costs arising. However, the estimates of financial requirements of vocational education committees in this area have been constantly increasing. In 2002, the estimates submitted by vocational education committees for that year exceeded the initial allocation available. However, supplementary funds of nearly &euro;2 million became available towards the end of 2002, which enabled the Department to bridge the gap between the initial amount allocated and the vocational education committees estimated costs. The amount initially made available in 2002 was just over &euro;3 million, but actual final payout was over &euro;4.7 million. The budget provision for childcare in 2003 is nearly &euro;3 million.</P>
    <P>Accordingly, the allocation to each VEC was drawn up in the light of the funding then available. To date, the majority of vocational education committees have made representations to the Department of Education and Science that the grant allocated will not meet their estimate of costs. Arising from this, the Department has asked them to indicate their estimate of minimum requirements for child care services for the rest of the year. The Minister for Education and Science appreciates that a number of vocational education committees are experiencing difficulties in this area. He is also very conscious that this may impact on the options available to adult learners with regard to participation in second chance education.</P>
    <P>The Department of Education and Science is currently in liaison with vocational education committees with a view to providing some special assistance to those vocational education committees that are particularly badly affected. For 2004, the Department and the Irish Vocational Education Association have initiated a joint review of child care provision for VTOS, youthreach and Traveller training centre programmes to explore ways of obviating the difficulties that have arisen this year.</P>
    <P>It is also important to acknowledge the significant commitment the Government has made to addressing child care issues. The Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform has been given responsibility for the co-ordination of the equal opportunities child care programme as part of the national development plan. A sum of over &euro;300 million has been allocated to child care under the NDP. The objectives of this strategy are to <Col N="158" /> improve the quality of child care, to increase the number of child care facilities and to introduce a co-ordinated approach to the delivery of child care services.</P>
    <P>I trust that I have clarified for Deputies the nature and extent of the difficulties that have arisen and the steps being taken to address them.</P>

      <P>In 1997 phase 2A of the Midlands Regional Hospital in Mullingar was built, involving the expenditure of &euro;10 million of taxpayers' money. Among other things, it included a five-storey block. Since it was built, four of the five storeys have remained completely empty, in a warehouse state. Only one of the floors is fully in use. Finance is awaited to kit out the other four and provide the beds that are so badly needed at the hospital. This hospital is regularly over-crowded in the winter period. Four-bed units cater for six or seven patients. Staff are at their wits end trying to look after patients, all because the Department will not provide the additional funding needed to complete the remaining four storeys of the hospital and provide the additional beds and services that are so badly needed.</P>
      <P>Nothing happened for the first five years since 1997. Then, because of the approaching election the Government set up a project team to start designing the new hospital. Ever since, money is being spent on the design. This year a total of &euro;600,000 has been allocated for that purpose, yet nothing has been provided in services for patients.</P>
      <P>At a health board meeting last April, Deputy Cassidy announced that a 12-bed unit would be completed at the hospital within a matter of weeks. Some 25 weeks later no progress is evident on that front. The then chairman of the health board, Senator Glynn, who also indicated that this would happen, supported him that day. The news was splashed across the front pages of the local papers, yet nothing has happened. Money must be provided to kit out this hospital.</P>

      <P>While I am pleased to see the Minister of State, Deputy Tim O'Malley, in the House, I am disappointed the Minister, Deputy Martin, is not present. He has given so many commitments to us on the numerous occasions we raised the matter in the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The people of Longford and Westmeath &ndash; 110,000 people &ndash; believe there should be an inquiry into this issue. A four-storey building has been left idle since 1997. Crows are now nesting on the roof. It is an absolute scandal. Deputy McGrath is correct that there are six or seven beds in a four-bed cubicle. The patients are looking out the window at the finest building in the place with nothing in it. It is time to staff that <Col N="159" /> four-storey unit and provide the additional 100 beds that were promised.</P>
    <P>In his time on the health board, Deputy McGrath took every opportunity to do something about this matter. He was promised 12 beds but it was all a mirage based on promises that were made at election time. We are reflecting the anger of the people of Westmeath. We are not coming in here to engage in acts of tomfoolery. There has been too much back-sliding, foot dragging and setting up of project committees. Why was a design team only put in place in 2001 and why did it take two years and two months from August 2001 to get to where we are now? The people of Westmeath and Longford want to know what is going on. We are here to represent them.</P>
    <P>A low taxation economy has been promoted by the Government and when the money does not come in, services cannot be provided. People do not have much chance of getting hospital beds &ndash; they are left in corridors and other such places. That is an indictment of the Government which has failed the people of Longford and Westmeath, as well as those elsewhere. It is an absolute disgrace and we will not take any more of this.</P>
    <P>People have said to us that there should be an inquiry into why a four-storey building has been left uncompleted. It has been suggested that &euro;57 million is required to complete the work. We will not be fobbed off. We want to know when the work will start, when it will be completed, when the staff will be put in place and when the people of these two counties will get the hospital beds they need. We are speaking on behalf of doctors, patients, attendants and the people who work to the best of their professional ability, as well as those we represent.</P>

      <P>The Deputies will be aware that a comprehensive strategic policy framework for the acute hospital sector is set out in the health strategy, Quality and Fairness: A Health System for You. Central to this policy framework is the decision by the Government to significantly increase bed capacity in acute hospitals over the period to 2011.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A detailed analysis of acute hospital bed capacity needs was conducted by the Department of Health and Children in conjunction with the Department of Finance and in consultation with the social partners. The subsequent report titled, Acute Hospital Bed Capacity &ndash; A National Review, which was published last year, helped to inform the Government in its decision to provide a total of 3,000 additional acute beds for public patients over the period to 2011. This represents the largest ever concentrated expansion of acute hospital capacity in Ireland. In tandem with pub<Col N="160" /> lication of the report, the Minister, Deputy Martin, announced the first phase of these additional beds with the commissioning of an extra 709 acute hospital beds at a cost of &euro;65 million.</P>

      <P>In advance of the bed capacity initiative, the Midland Health Board identified a priority need requirement to commission additional capacity through the new paediatric unit in Portlaoise General Hospital and a dialysis unit at Tullamore General Hospital. The new paediatric unit at Portlaoise General Hospital will have an additional five beds, giving a total of 25 paediatric beds. The new unit was recently opened and I understand that interviews are ongoing regarding the staffing of the additional beds.</P>
      <P>In addition, a new dialysis unit is being commissioned at Tullamore General Hospital which will have six beds funded through the bed capacity initiative. Construction of the unit is almost complete and work is progressing on equipping and staffing of the unit.</P>
      <P>The Midland Health Board is currently finalising the development control plan for phase 2B of the development of the Midland Regional Hospital at Mullingar. This development will significantly enhance bed capacity at the hospital.</P>

      <P>I am grateful for this five minutes of what in some respects is the twilight zone of Dáil Éireann. I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Tim O'Malley.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Sometimes when the Minister, Deputy Martin, is faced with a difficult question or feels that a <Col N="161" /> member of the Opposition is being disingenuous with the facts, his facial expression takes on a complex and worried look. I am surprised he is not more perplexed looking when he sees the huge opposition to the smoking ban from within his party.</P>
    <P>When doing some research in the Oireachtas Library on the debates on this Bill when it came before the Houses last year, I was perplexed to discover that the Public Health (Tobacco) Act 2002 was presented to the Dáil on 30 July 2001 and that it passed through all Stages in both Houses without a vote. It was enacted into law on 27 March 2002. It came as somewhat of a surprise to me that this legislation which is now so contentious was unanimously passed. I was so surprised I contacted the Department of Health and Children through the office of the Oireachtas Library to confirm this fact. It seems that all Stages of this Bill were passed without a vote being called. This Bill went unopposed through both Houses of the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>The Members of the last Dáil mandated the Minister for Health and Children with the task of bringing this legislation into force so he has no choice in the matter. It no longer matters whether I or any other Member of this House agrees or disagrees with the ban on smoking in the workplace. The public representatives have left him with no choice but to implement the Act. All this talk of Ministers and backbenchers opposing the ban is the real smokescreen of this debate. New legislation is required if the majority of Government Deputies are so opposed to this issue. I will not seek new legislation until I see how this legislation works because I believe it is time to give it a chance. That is my political perspective on the issue and the Minister may see things differently.</P>
    <P>The economic issues are way beyond my knowledge or capabilities. I am not an economist and I will leave it to them to deduce the exact outcome of this Act and how many jobs will or will not be lost. There are so many figures thrown around this House that it verges on the ridiculous. One area I know something about is the important issue of the medical perspective of this Act. I have seen too much chronic lung disease, too many strokes and too much cancer debilitate many of our population. Sadly, all this is too close to me. The evidence is there for all to see in the morgues and medical departments of the hospitals where the most unfortunate of those afflicted with this terrible addiction are to be found. There are hundreds of tobacco addicts in every general practice. Most of these have some level of disease which requires my attention or that of other doctors, or medication. We are not getting to grips with the real issues. General practice is going into slow meltdown because of <Col N="162" /> decreasing manpower numbers, which is another issue that Dáil Éireann is politely ignoring. I support any measure that will ease the burden on the existing GPs in general practice.</P>
    <P>When this measure was first proposed I admit that I had reservations on the issue. I was worried that between liquor laws and smoking bans we were going in the direction of a nanny State. I do not have to worry about that anymore because it is the law and there is no discussion. It is a smokescreen. This law was enacted by Dáil Éireann on 27 March 2002.</P>
    <P>The publicity stunt of the chairman of the Western Health Board shedding crocodile tears all over the place and resigning his post on a matter of principle that the Minister refused to discuss the ban on smoking with him would be laughable if it was not so tragic. The Minister should at least have informed him that it was the law already. The lack of orthopaedic, rheumatology and cancer treatment services in the Western Health Board region would be a much more appropriate reason for resignation.</P>
    <P>I do not have legal training but there seems to be little scope for not complying with the legislation. There may be some possibility in the case of small family-run pubs which do not have even temporary employees, but not where there are workers employed. Workers do not have the rights that we like to think they have. Their pay is low in many cases.</P>
    <P>I await the Minister's reply and perhaps in 12 months' time, the Minister of State, Deputy Fahey, will tell the House about the progress made.</P>

    <P>The ban on smoking in the workplace announced by the Minister on 30 January 2003 at the launch of the report on the health effects of environmental tobacco smoke in the workplace will be brought into effect during January 2004 and it is not proposed to make any changes in relation to this matter. The Minister announced the prohibition a year in advance of the starting period to allow a reasonable time for employers, businesses and the public to adapt to the changes required. There will be a period of adjustment and some people will take a little time to adjust. The Minister is encouraged by the level of public support that this health initiative has received since January this year and continues to receive. He welcomes in particular the support which has been publicly expressed by a range of bodies, including health professionals, trade unions and many voluntary groups actively involved in promot<Col N="163" /> ing good health. The Minister's primary concern in introducing a ban on the smoking of tobacco in all workplaces is to protect workers and the public from exposure to carcinogenic <Col N="164" /> environmental tobacco smoke which is an avoidable cause of disease and ill health.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 73 and 83 together.</P>
      <P>I am well aware of the problems that have arisen for those in the arts sector because of the unavoidable reduction in funding this year. However, I would point out that although the Arts Council's allocation for 2003 of &euro;44.1 million is down by around 7.5% on the 2002 figure, that 2002 figure was the culmination of steady year-on-year increases since 1997. Indeed, Arts Council funding increased by over 80% between 1997 and 2002.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>No decisions have as yet been taken by Government on the funding of the Arts Council for 2004 or later years. These decisions are made in the context of the annual Estimates process which is under way at present. I can assure Deputies that I intend to make the best possible <Col N="166" /> case for the funding of the arts in the course of the estimates discussions.</P>

      <P>While the level of green fees charged by golf clubs in Ireland is the responsibility of the individual clubs concerned, I am aware of concerns in our overseas markets that Ireland is becoming increasingly expensive for golfing visitors. Some golf clubs, I have been told, are charging very high green fees that bear no relationship to the level of service provided.</P>
      <P>Fáilte Ireland, which is responsible for the overseas marketing of golf holidays and which monitors the value of golf tourism to Ireland through its survey of overseas tourists, has raised these concerns about value for money with individual clubs and with the various marketing groups around the country. There is no doubt but that excessive green fees pose a serious threat to the sustainability of our valuable golf tourism sector and I had no hesitation in supporting Fáilte Ireland's efforts in this regard by calling on golf clubs to exercise restraint in the green fees charged to non-members.</P>

      <P>The National Concert Hall, NCH, is the premier venue for classical musical performance in Dublin. It was built within the Earlsfort Terrace complex and shares its accommodation with University College Dublin. From the outset it was recognised that there were inadequacies in relation to the overall space allocated to it and that backstage accommodation in particular was limited.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On foot of Government consideration of the report of the high level group comprising the Secretaries General of the then Department of Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands, the Department of Education and Science and the chairman of the Office of Public Works, established in July 2000 to examine and report on all the issues involved in relation to the NCH at Earlsfort Terrace, the Office of Public Works was asked to put together, in consultation with the management of the National Concert Hall, a full brief setting out the accommodation and ancillary requirements of <Col N="167" /> the National Concert Hall for the foreseeable future.</P>
    <P>In light of the requirements as identified in this brief, my Department, together with the Office of Public Works, has been in discussions with the Dublin Docklands Development Authority to establish the availability and suitability of a site in the Grand Canal Dock area of Dublin as a possible alternative location for the National Concert Hall. Specific proposals which have emerged from these discussions are being examined by my Department, the National Concert Hall and the Office of Public Works.</P>

      <P>In accordance with the terms of the Government decision, I have established a high level steering group, comprising representatives of my Department, the Office of Public Works, Fáilte Ireland, and the Department of Finance, supported as necessary by professional expertise, to review the specification, including operational requirements, for a national conference centre, and to agree the parameters of a procurement process. The work of the steering group is ongoing and it is envisaged that a notice, seeking initial expressions of interest in the provision of a centre, will be published in the near future. The responses received will then be evaluated with a view to drawing up a short-list of applicants who will be invited to participate in a detailed tendering process.</P>

      <P>Under the action plan to which the Deputy has referred, my Department is committed to continuing to progress and develop the various strands of the Civil Service modernisation agenda as set out in Sustaining Progress. Within that context, my Department has identified three main priority areas. These are: the need to ensure more efficient use of resources; a greater emphasis on human resource development; and the maximisation of technology to deliver better services to customers.</P>
      <P>As the Department moves forward, a key focus will be on ensuring maximum efficiency in the use of the resources through implementation of expenditure review and internal audit programmes as well as ongoing reviews of the operations of the Department to ensure effective targeting of resources to meet Government priorities and to deliver quality services to customers. The efficient management of the Department's resources will be underpinned by the development of a management information framework, MIF, relevant to the Department's needs.</P>
      <P>In order to ensure effective and efficient delivery of the mission and goals of the Department, significant attention will be given to human resource development. This will be done through the implementation of an integrated human resource strategy aimed at enhancing both the performance of the organisation and of individual staff members. The embedding of the Civil Service performance management and development system, PMDS, and the provision of training for staff through targeted training programmes which will be subject to ongoing evaluation and review will underpin the delivery of the strategy.</P>
      <P>While the central Department has limited involvement in the direct provision of services to the public, an important focus for the three cultural institutions which are part of my Department &ndash; the National Museum, the National Library and the National Archives &ndash; which have a significant level of direct interaction with customers, will be the development of new ways of meeting the needs of their customers through greater use of technology-based services over the period to June 2005. A number of specific objectives to achieve this are set out in the plan.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As the Deputy is aware, my Department was formed in June 2002 &ndash; less than 18 months ago &ndash; bringing together functions and staff from the former Departments of Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands and Tourism, Sport and Recreation. In that context, it is important to recognise and acknowledge the significant progress which has already been made by my Department in meeting the various challenges associated with the establishment of a new Department and, at the same time, in managing to make substantial progress in implementing the civil service modernisation pro<Col N="170" /> gramme. The logistical challenges associated with the bringing together of new functions and a new group of staff have been addressed with considerable flexibility and goodwill from the staff of my Department, including the internal reorganisation necessary to support the three sectors within its portfolio &ndash; arts, sport and tourism &ndash; and to deliver a quality service to its customer base.</P>
    <P>My Department now has in place a robust framework for the progression of the civil service modernisation programme in accordance with the requirements of Sustaining Progress and the benchmarking process and the Secretary General will be making his report on progress under my Department's action plan to the public service verification group in the coming weeks.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Arts, Sport and Tourism (Mr. O'Donoghue)</NameTxt>
      <P>Government support for the international marketing of Ireland as a tourist destination has never been higher. In 2003, I increased the Irish Exchequer contribution to Tourism Ireland's tourism marketing programme by &euro;5 million to &euro;22.8 million, which has enabled it to mount and sustain a highly-targeted marketing campaign in all our key markets this year. Over the remaining months of 2003, Tourism Ireland is injecting &euro;8 million into the largest ever autumn-winter campaign in our key overseas markets to capitalise on the late booking trend which is increasingly a feature of the international tourism market and to ensure that the 2004 season is given a vital kick-start. Even at this stage of the season, there is still a lot to play for and despite the fierce global competition, the latest market intelligence suggests that Ireland retains its appeal as a tourism destination.</P>
      <P>Allied to Tourism Ireland's core marketing programme, substantial funding &ndash; of over &euro;16 million &ndash; has also been made available this year for niche marketing campaigns and the international sports tourism and the festivals and cultural events initiatives which are designed to maximise the international tourism potential of major sports and cultural events.</P>
      <P>For my part, I have led a series of tourism promotional events in the US and in Europe and lent whatever political weight I can to Tourism Ireland's marketing campaigns in these markets.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The indications from the markets are that the unprecedented level of marketing activity this year appears to be producing results in a very testing international climate. The tourism figures for the <Col N="171" /> first six months of this year indicate commendable performance by Ireland in the face of stiff competition. Overseas numbers grew by over 3% with revenue increasing by over 2%. Ireland's performance in key markets particularly North America and mainland Europe suggests that it has made significant gains in market share over the period in question. These results are particularly encouraging in the context of war in Iraq and slower than expected growth in the global economy. I also recognise, however, that this performance has not been experienced to the same degree by all sectors of the industry and across all regions of the country. It is also evident from reports from the agencies and the industry that this intense competition, with its focus on value for money, has put increasing pressure on margins in the industry but our over-riding objective must be to strengthen our competitive position in a rapidly changing marketplace.</P>
    <P>Looking ahead, the final report of the tourism policy review group recommends a number of specific actions in relation to our marketing efforts which my Department and the tourism agencies, along with the industry itself, will take forward in order to sustain the strong momentum achieved over recent years on the marketing front.</P>

      <P>The only possible suitable funding for this project directly available from my Department is under the sports capital programme, which allocates funding to sporting and community organisations at local, regional and national level throughout the country. Funding under the programme is available towards capital development of sports facilities and purchase of non-personal sports equipment only. As such it could potentially only be used as a means to fund any sports related elements of the development.</P>
      <P>I have recently announced all allocations under the 2003 sports capital programme. Any application for funding under the 2004 sports capital programme would have to considered based on its merit following assessment, in accordance with the published guidelines, terms and conditions of the programme. It would be open to Scouting Ireland to apply for funding for any sporting element of the project under a future round of the sports capital programme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy might also note that up to &euro;55 million has been made available in grant aid from the European regional development fund to support investment in tourism product over the period 2000 <Col N="172" /> to 2006 through the tourism product development scheme. The core objective of the scheme is to improve the spatial spread of tourism in Ireland. This will be done by helping less developed tourism areas realise their potential in stimulating new centres of strong tourism growth. It also seeks to promote the better management of the relationship between tourism and the environment with a particular focus on established tourism areas and, generally, to stimulate the industry to be a positive player in the management of resources and the environment. The scheme is administered by Fáilte Ireland and decisions in respect of individual grant applications is a matter solely for independent management boards set up for this purpose.</P>
    <P>I have no plans to visit the site but I will consider such a visit when next I am in the area.</P>

      <P>Under the local authority swimming pool programme, which is administered by my Department, there are four stages in a swimming pool project, following the submission of a feasibility study. These, in order of progress, are: preliminary report; contract documents; tender <Col N="174" /> and construction. My Department's technical advisers, the Office of Public Works, evaluates each stage and local authorities cannot proceed to the next stage of a project unless prior approval issues from my Department. Grant aid is allocated only when tenders have been approved for the project and will be capped at the time of allocation.</P>
      <P>Under the programme, grants of up to a maximum of &euro;3.8 million are available towards the refurbishment of existing pools or the provision of a new pool subject, in either case, to the total grant not exceeding 80% of the eligible cost of the project or, in the case of projects located in designated disadvantaged areas, 90% of the eligible cost. Support is available towards the cost of the swimming pool, toddler pool, sauna and steam room. </P>
      <P>As I indicated in my reply to a parliamentary question on the same subject by the Deputy in June 2003, applications under the current programme closed at the end of July 2000. However, in February of this year, in view of the special circumstances involved arising from the enforced closure of Monaghan's only local authority pool, I decided to allow the local authority submit a proposal in relation to a swimming pool under the current programme. A feasibility study, representing the initial phase in the process, has been submitted by Monaghan Town Council and is under consideration in my Department. </P>
      <P>My Department has recently received a letter from Monaghan County Council stating its intention to apply to the Monaghan task force under the PEACE II programme for funding in respect of the tourism and recreational aspects of the swimming pool project. However, my Department has been advised by the Special European Union Programmes Body, SEUPB, that an application constituting an expression of interest will be accepted by the task force without prior planning approval having first been obtained for the project. Consequently there would not seem to be any reason why the county council cannot pursue this course independently of the application under the local authority swimming pool programme.</P>

      <P>The Programme for Prosperity and Fairness committed the Government to the introduction of local sports partnerships to help promote and develop sport at local level. In its first strategy document A New Era for Irish Sport (2000-2002) the Irish Sports Council included the establishment of local sports partnerships as one of its main priorities.</P>
      <P>The Irish Sports Council, following the receipt of proposals from local bodies approved and funded the establishment of eight partnerships in May 2001 and a further four were established in early 2002. These are located in Clare, Donegal, Fingal, Kildare, Laois, Roscommon, Sligo, Tipperary north, Cork, Limerick, Meath and Waterford.</P>
      <P>At the Department's request the Irish Sports Council commissioned consultants to carry out a review of four of the original eight partnerships. Following the completion and consideration of this review the Irish Sports Council will extend the network of local sports partnerships by a further four in 2003, bringing the total number of LSPs to 16. A further independent appraisal and review of the entire local partnership process will be carried out by my Department next year to obtain confirmation that this element of sport policy continues to have an impact at local level.</P>

      <P>The National Concert Hall is the premier venue for classical musical performance in Dublin. It was built within the Earlsfort Terrace complex and shares its accommodation with University College Dublin. From the outset it was recognised that there were inadequacies in relation to the overall space allocated to it and that backstage accommodation, in particular, was limited.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A high level group comprising the Secretaries General of the then Department of Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands, the Department of Education and Science and the chairman of the Office of Public Works, was established in July 2000 to study future options for the development of the National Concert Hall in the context of planned future use of the Earlsfort Terrace premises and site. Their report recommended that approval should be given for the construction of a modern 2,000-seater concert hall facility at a greenfield site. When this report was discussed by <Col N="176" /> the Government in March 2002, it asked the three Departments involved to examine further its implications. Pursuant to this request, the Office of Public Works, in conjunction with the National Concert Hall, compiled a comprehensive brief setting out the physical accommodation and ancillary requirements to meet the needs of the National Concert Hall for the foreseeable future.</P>
    <P>Drawing on the assessment of needs set out in this brief, my Department and the Office of Public Works have had exploratory discussions with the Dublin Docklands Development Authority regarding the availability and potential suitability of a site in the Grand Canal Dock area of Dublin for the National Concert Hall.

      <P>The 2003 area aid application for the person named cannot be processed due to a problem regarding commonage evidence on a parcel of land declared by the applicant. My Department is involved in ongoing communication with the named person to enable the applications to be processed.</P>
      <P>Payments under the 2003 ewe premium are scheduled to commence on 16 October and the person named should receive her payment shortly after that date. However, the supplementary premium element of the ewe premium cannot be processed for payment until the area aid application is found to be in order. Payment under the 2003 area-based compensatory allowance scheme will issue when the 2003 area aid application is found to be in order.</P>
      <P>The person named applied for premium for 22 animals under the 2002 suckler cow premium scheme. Payment of the 80% advance instalment amounting to &euro;3,945.04 issued on 30 January 2003 and a balancing payment for &euro;986.26 was made on 1 May 2003.</P>
      <P>The herdowner is also an applicant under the 2003 suckler cow premium scheme. Advance payments under this scheme are due to commence later this month.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The person named participated in 2002 extensification premium opting for the simplified system for the purposes of determining eligibility. On participating she chose to observe a stocking <Col N="180" /> density of less than 1.40 livestock units per hectare for each and every day of 2002. Under the terms of the relevant regulation, prior to payment, the Department is required to carry out stocking density cross-checks against the CMMS animal database to ensure that the stocking densities as chosen were not breached. Cross checks were carried out at 19 May and 15 September 2002 at which dates respective stocking densities of 1.5923 and 1.6361 livestock units per hectare were established. These stocking densities were calculated taking into account the 22.35 livestock units attributable to the 149 ewes that qualified for payment of 2002 ewe premium on the holding, which itself consisted of 27.35 hectares. Within the past week, CMMS based herd profiles issued to the person named. The profiles detailed by livestock unit value the eartag number and date of birth of each bovine animal over the age of six months present on the holding on the two dates at which the cross-checks were carried out. If the person named disputes the accuracy of the herd profiles she should proceed as indicated in the letter which accompanied the profiles.</P>

      <P>Under the relevant EU Commission regulation, census dates must be distributed throughout the year in such a way as to be rep<Col N="181" /> resentative of the entire year. The regulation also stipulates that census dates must be changed annually and that they cannot be announced until at least two weeks after their passing.</P>
      <P>In order to ensure that farmers are made aware of each census date within the earliest possible time after its passing, while at the same time complying with the two weeks' waiting time, I issue a press release immediately after the two-week period has passed. The press release is widely covered in the farming press both in newsprint and on radio.</P>
      <P>The changing of the extensification premium systems from 2003 is in line with the Government's commitment to the farming social partners in Sustaining Progress to use the CMMS to the greatest possible extent with the aim of simplifying procedures and facilitating farmers in marketing their product. My Department was also encouraged by the EU Commission to make greater use of the CMMS animal database in determining eligibility for the various livestock premia schemes. The CMMS database will be used to establish stocking densities for 2003 for all farmers who have indicated that they wish to participate in the extensification scheme. The stocking densities will be based on the livestock unit values of the ewes entered for the ewe premium scheme, the forage area of the holding for extensification premium purposes, plus the average number of bovine livestock units on holdings at five census dates according to the CMMS database. These new arrangements eliminate the necessity for the old simplified system and will also eliminate the necessity in the old census system for extensification premium of filling up census forms and lodging them with the Department.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 104 and 105 together.</P>
      <P>In 2002, a total amount of 144,000 tonnes of meat and bonemeal was produced in Ireland, which works out at an average of 2,769 tonnes per week. At present, the total amount of MBM in storage is 210,000 tonnes. Of this, my Department has responsibility for 172,000 tonnes which gives rise to an annual storage cost of &euro;3.75 million. The balance, though stored under controlled conditions, is the responsibility of the private sector.</P>
      <P>In the period January 2001 to date this year, close on &euro;146 million will have been spent by the Exchequer on the production, storage and disposal of MBM. The subsidy ended on 31 May 2003 and any expenditure arising after that relates to a carry over of payments from before the ending of the subsidy and to the storage and disposal of product built up during the period of subsidy.</P>
      <P>There are currently no domestic disposal facilities for MBM produced in Ireland. A number of proposals for the use of MBM in industry or energy generation in this country are at various stages of consideration by the relevant regulatory authorities including the Environmental Protection Agency.</P>
      <P>I established an interdepartmental agency/ committee to examine the best available options for the use of MBM in industry and in non-feed uses here. I expect to have the report from that committee submitted to me in the near future.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture and Food (Mr. Walsh)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Prospectus report which examined the existing structure of the Irish dairy processing sector made a number of recommendations on actions to improve the efficiency and long-term competitiveness of the industry. The main findings included the need to increase scale and reduce costs in order to position the sector to withstand international competition and increase our penetration of high value EU consumer markets. This would include improving the product mix to meet the demands of these markets and would in turn demand increasing the expenditure on research and development. At production level the need to achieve increased scale was also a clear requirement.</P>
      <P>Since the launch of the report, I have met with the various processing groups and Enterprise Ireland to discuss the implementation of the report and identify any areas where I may be able to assist or facilitate with the changes required in the Irish dairy industry. While I have made it clear that my Department and other State agencies will help in any way possible, discussions in relation to the best processing structure and the type of product mix best suited to Irish conditions and market requirements are a matter for the management and boards of the individual undertakings.</P>
      <P>The need for increased scale at production level has also been identified. I will, in conjunction with all of the interested parties, be examining quota restructuring systems with a view to improving the access to quota by active committed producers who require additional quota to remain competitive into the future.</P>
      <P>Last month, I convened a dairy forum at which all of the main organisations, representing both producers and processors were present. The purpose of that forum was to afford an opportunity to all sections of the industry to give their views in relation to the present state of the sector, the changes necessary for the future and how these changes might be achieved. The contributions of the various parties at that forum were very constructive and I would hope that they will act as a stimulus to the industry to embark on the changes necessary to secure its future and development in the medium and longer term. One of the views which came forward was that it would be beneficial to the industry if the dairy premium could be decoupled as soon as possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="184" />Having confirmed with the Commission that this was permissible under the regulations, I decided that Ireland would proceed to decouple at the earliest possible date, namely, 2005. This should contribute positively to restructuring at farm level by providing a clearer perspective for producers wishing to sell quotas. Such producers will retain entitlement to the decoupled premium even if they exit from milk production after 2005.</P>
    <P>As regards the beef processing sector, I support the objective of that sector to rationalise its own structures and bring about a closer alignment of slaughter capacity with cattle throughput. However, rationalisation at slaughter capacity is a matter primarily for the industry itself and I hope that it can be expedited in a manner that respects competition policy while also improving the competitiveness of the entire beef processing sector. I might add that the export performance of the sector, particularly to the UK market, has been extremely effective this year.</P>

Discussions are currently at a preliminary stage at EU level with member states expressing different views on a number of contentious issues. As with many Commission proposals, it is likely that the detailed provisions will change prior to final agreement.</P>
      <P>There are a number of aspects of the current draft proposal which are of concern both from an animal welfare perspective and from the point of view of the continued economic viability of the live export trade to Europe. These include, in particular, the abolition of staging posts, the proposal to rest animals on-board road vehicles and changes in stocking densities and journey times. My Department has expressed its general reservations on these aspects in the discussions.</P>

      <P>Under current legislation, competence for licensing animal medicinal products is divided between my Department and the Irish Medicines Board. Hence, this reply relates only to veterinary vaccines where competence rests with my Department. Since licences in respect of animal vaccines which had been granted under the Therapeutic Substances Act 1932 no longer met current scientific or EU legislative requirements, it was necessary to review all such licences on an individual basis. Under the review, which has been ongoing since 1999, the Irish Medicines Board carried out the detailed examination of application dossiers submitted by sponsoring companies. On this basis, the board makes a recommendation to my Department as competent authority which makes a final decision on the grant or otherwise of a licence and on the conditions, including route of supply, accompanying such licence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="186" />In terms of designating routes of supply for individual vaccines, my Department does not have a general approach which would as a matter of policy necessarily exclude any of the categories provided for under the Animal Remedies Regulations 1996. Rather, the decision is taken on the basis of the characteristics of each individual product taking account of the relevant recommendation of the Irish Medicines Board and the objective criteria laid down in regulation 13 of the Animal Remedies Regulations 1996.</P>
    <P>Since the licences which were in place under the aforementioned Therapeutic Substances Act did not specify a mandatory route of supply, re-classification in this regard does not arise. However, the following is a list of vaccines in respect of which licences have been issued following review, and which now specify a mandatory route of supply, by my Department since 1 January 2003.</P>

      <P>The mission referred to by the Deputy was undertaken as part of the European Commission's programme to evaluate animal health controls, in particular over foot and mouth disease, public health control systems and certification systems operated in Brazil for the export of meat to the EU. During the visit the FVO assessed an application by the Brazilian authorities to extend approval to another four other regions in that country for the purpose of export of meat to the EU.</P>
      <P>The report noted improvements from the previous mission in the level and operation of controls with respect to exports from the regions already approved for export to the EU. However, in some cases, the findings indicate that controls were not being applied satisfactorily. Some deficiencies in respect of animal identification, movement control and in the maturation processes were noted. However, a new system for identifying and certifying the origin of bovines and their products has been introduced and this is being applied to cattle that are destined for export to the EU and will be fully implemented throughout the country in 2007.</P>
      <P>A number of recommendations were made by the FVO to the competent authorities of Brazil arising from this mission with a request that an action plan be provided to address the recommendations. In an addendum to the report, the FVO has indicated that it is satisfied that the Brazilian authorities have implemented or are in the process of implementing the bulk of the recommendations including the on the spot suspension of approval to export to the EU of one establishment which was found by the FVO as not meeting the required standard. In relation to the application to extend approval to new areas on that country, the FVO has indicated to the Commission that its findings have not been able to establish that these regions satisfy EU requirements for export of meat to the EU.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The report of the FVO was discussed at a meet<Col N="188" /> ing of the Standing Committee on Animal Health and the Food Chain on 1 July 2003. At that meeting the European Commission indicated that it has kept in close touch with the Brazilian authorities and it is satisfied that the most serious issues are being addressed.</P>

      <Quest>if a change from the present BSE culling policy to a limited cull similar to Denmark would be consistent with the opinion of the scientific steering committee which advises the European Commission on BSE and other issues; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>
      <QRef>[22610/03]</QRef>
    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture and Food (Mr. Walsh)</NameTxt>
      <P>When BSE is confirmed in a herd, Council Regulation 999/2001 as amended, requires as a default position, for the slaughter of all other bovine animals in the herd, the progeny of infected female bovine animals born within two years before or after the clinical onset of the disease, and cohort animals on the infected holding or other holdings which may have been exposed to the same feed or contamination as the infected animal.</P>
      <P>The regulation also provides that member states may, where the epidemiological circumstances allow, decide not to slaughter the entire herd in which the infected animal is present at the time of confirmation, but must, as a minimum, slaughter the progeny and cohorts of the infected animal. In drafting this regulation the EU Commission had regard to the views expressed by its scientific steering committee which has stated that while herd culling is having some effect both in terms of eliminating otherwise not identified pre-clinical cases, and in terms of preventing future cases from appearing, largely the same effect can be achieved with a more limited culling strategy.</P>
      <P>Against this background member states, including Denmark, are at liberty to adopt a partial depopulation approach subject to the minimum requirements laid down in Council Regulation 999/2001.</P>
      <P>In assessing its approach to dealing with herds in which BSE has been confirmed, Ireland in common with other member states, must have regard to a number of factors, including the public health dimension, the effect on individual farmers of allowing them to retain herds in which a BSE animal has been confirmed and the possible economic and trade consequences for the agri-food sector of a revised approach. </P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As a country which is heavily dependent on the export of beef and dairy produce, Ireland must approach any revision to the current arrangements with extreme caution. In Ireland, whole herd depopulation has, over time, along with the full spectrum of BSE controls, become a critical element in providing reassurance to consumers and on mar<Col N="189" /> keting Irish beef and dairy produce at home and abroad. Political and diplomatic efforts to regain third country markets are continuing, and BSE numbers, and therefore the costs, are falling.</P>
    <P>I am nonetheless acutely conscious of the cost of the current BSE depopulation approach and, while the time may not yet have arrived where I can recommend any change in the policy, I am keeping it under ongoing review having regard to the various sensitivities I have outlined above.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Question Nos. 113 and 115 to 118, inclusive, together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The remit of my Department's special investigation unit is to assist various areas of my Department in the operation of various schemes and regulations and in particular to investigate suspected breaches of legislation governing animal disease control, animal medication, the production, processing, trading or otherwise handling of animals, carcasses or meat intended for human consumption or the manufacture or trading of feeding stuffs. Some investigations are conducted jointly with the Garda Síochána and the SIU also <Col N="190" /> complies with inquiry requests under international mutual assistance arrangements from other national enforcement agencies.</P>
    <P>In addition, the activities of the SIU involve the provision of support to other areas of my Department and advice to the relevant operators. In many cases, prosecutions would not arise from the work of the SIU while in other cases prosecutions may be initiated by the Director of Public Prosecutions and staff.</P>
    <P>The SIU has a staff of 14 people. Officers involved are authorised to carry out a range of functions under the relevant legislation and a code of practice reflecting these provisions is currently being finalised. The procedures followed by the SIU are in accordance with the law and comply with the requirements in regard to the taking and presentation of evidence.</P>
    <P>In the period since 1 January 2002, a total of 78 farmers and 87 non-farming entities have been investigated. A breakdown of farm investigations by county follows. Some 39 cases arising directly from investigations carried out by the SIU during and prior to that period were successfully prosecuted since 1 January 2002. Two such cases were not successful and one of these is under appeal. At present, another 42 cases are expected to come to a court hearing in due course. A further 78 cases which may result in prosecutions are at various stages of investigation.</P>
    <P>With regard to the SIU investigations conducted since 1 January 2000, High Court injunctions were taken out against my Department in three cases, one of which was unsuccessful, the other two were subsequently withdrawn. Legal action by other farmers against my Department has been initiated in two cases.</P>
    <P>Breakdown of farm investigations by county as follows:</P>

      <P>All meat imports must come from third countries or areas of third countries approved for export to the EU. In addition, they may only be sourced from establishments in those countries that are approved and must bear an EU approved health mark. The Food and Veterinary Office, FVO, of the EU carries out inspections to ensure that only establishments that meet hygiene and health standards equivalent to those operating within the EU are approved. Where the FVO is satisfied that public health requirements are not being met by an approved establishment in a third country, the establishment may be removed from the EU approved list. If outbreaks of animal diseases occur in a third country approval to export to the EU is suspended for the infected regions of the country, or the whole country, as appropriate, until the disease risk has been eliminated.</P>
      <P>Meat being imported into the European Community may only enter through a border inspection post, BIP, that has been approved by the FVO. That office also carries out monitoring and inspection of each member state's BIPs to ensure that the conditions for import of animal products into Europe, provided under harmonised EU legislation, are being correctly applied. In Ireland the border inspection posts approved for administering checks on direct imports of meat from third countries are Dublin Port &ndash; frozen, chilled and ambient temperature animal products &ndash; and Shannon Airport &ndash; chilled and ambient only &ndash; which are staffed by officials from my Department.</P>
      <P>Importers of meat must be registered with my Department. Importers must give advance notice of the arrival of meat. Imported meat must be accompanied by the appropriate commercial documentation showing country and approval number of the establishment of production as well as a health certificate conforming to the models set down in EU legislation. The meat must also be labelled. All consignments undergo a documentary and identity check and physical checks are carried out at frequencies laid down in EU law. Where required, sampling for laboratory analysis for the purposes of safeguarding human and animal health is carried out. Once imported meat has met all the required conditions it is released for free circulation within the community. Copies of the BIP clearance document and the health certificate must accompany the consignment to its destination.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Imports failing to comply with these veterinary control checks may be detained for further exam<Col N="192" /> ination. If non-compliance is established they are returned to the exporting country or destroyed.</P>

      <P>Tax relief for the film industry was first introduced in 1984 under the business expansion scheme and has continued in various forms for the past 19 years. This makes it one of the longest running sector specific tax reliefs in the economy and has seen an Exchequer contribution, in terms of tax foregone, of the order of some &euro;265 million in the last ten years alone. It should be noted that this relief has continued over time against a backdrop of the widening of the tax base and the reduction of rates generally. In budget 2003, I referred to the generally accepted principle that such reliefs narrow the tax base and that a widened tax base is the price that must be paid to retain the current low tax rates. Consequently, all tax reliefs must be subject to ongoing review. In that context, I announced in the budget that a number of these reliefs across a range of sectors, including film relief, would not be extended beyond 31 December 2004.</P>
      <P>I am aware of the views of many in the film sector which have been expressed either directly to me by way of representations or indirectly through the media with regard to the economic and social impacts of the termination of this relief in December 2004. The Minister for Arts, Sport and Tourism recently forwarded to me a copy of a study reviewing the relief which was commissioned jointly by his Department and the Irish Film Board. I have asked officials from my Department to examine this study. However, as things stand, the position with regard to the 31 December 2004 termination date for this relief remains unchanged.</P>

I initiated this review in order to develop a cohesive national flooding policy and to clarify the roles and responsibilities of the various agencies involved, including the Office of Public Works. The final report of the review group is due for <Col N="194" /> completion in the next few weeks and will contain recommendations on the preferred approach to flood management, including criteria for the prioritisation of expenditure. In the circumstances, the Office of Public Works considers it prudent to await the completion of the review groups work before deciding how the proposed scheme for Ennis might be progressed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>A round of internal talks involving the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam, LTTE, constitutional affairs committee is currently taking place, from 6 to 10 October, in the Glencree Centre for Reconciliation in Wicklow. These talks follow on from an earlier round of internal LTTE talks held <Col N="196" /> in Paris in August 2003 to discuss the ongoing peace process in Sri Lanka. I discussed these talks with Prime Minister Wickremesinghe and Foreign Minister Fernando of Sri Lanka during our bilateral meeting which took place in the margins of the United Nations General Assembly on 25 September. Facilitating these talks is of course fully in consonance with the joint statement issued following the EU Troika-Sri Lanka ministerial meeting on the same day, which I also attended. The statement expresses hope that the result of LTTE's internal consultative process on the Sri Lankan Government's proposal for an interim administration will lead to their resuming the peace talks at an early stage with a view to ensuring that the peace dividends reach people in all parts of the country.</P>
      <P>In the 1980s, the LTTE resorted to violence to achieve a separate state, Tamil Eelam, in the north and east of Sri Lanka. A peace process was initiated between the Government of Sri Lanka and the LTTE in December 2001, under Norwegian Government facilitation. The two sides subsequently negotiated a ceasefire which came into force in February 2002. Six rounds of peace negotiations have taken place to date. However, in April 2003, the LTTE withdrew from negotiations, claiming it was not receiving adequate dividends from the peace process. It claimed that not enough was being done to rebuild war-ravaged parts of the north-east and demanded more of a role in the administration of reconstruction funding. The LTTE has continued to honour the terms of the ceasefire. Following intensive negotiations involving the Sri Lankan Government, the LTTE and international mediators, the Sri Lankan Government put forward proposals for an interim administration in the disputed north and east of Sri Lanka. The meeting this week in Ireland is intended to give the LTTE an opportunity to fully consider these proposals.</P>
      <P>The LTTE delegation consists of 11 negotiators and support staff. Two Sri Lankan Government civil servants will address the participants, as well as a number of international academics, legal and constitutional experts. The participants in the talks are to number 28 in total.</P>
      <P>While the Government is facilitating the talks as a demonstration of its full support for the Sri Lankan peace process, and the talks enjoy the full support of the Sri Lankan Government, the Government is not represented at the talks. This follows the precedent of the first round of talks in Paris at which the French Government was not represented. The Government respects the nature of the talks, intended as they are to be an internal forum for the LTTE to prepare a response to the proposals for an interim administration. However, officials of my Department will have contact with the participants in the margins of the talks.</P>

      <P>Arising from the report of a planning group, which was established to consider proposals for the development of a national centre for the visually impaired, my Department engaged a project team to consider an overall development strategy for the implementation of the planning group's report. The report of the project team was presented to my Department towards the end of 2002.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Having given careful consideration to the matter, I decided in April 2003 that the national centre as proposed should not proceed, having regard to the low and declining pupil numbers in the schools for the visually impaired and the development costs, estimated to be in excess of <Col N="198" />&euro;30 million. However, my Department is willing to explore with the school authorities concerned how aspects of the proposed centre could be developed, in the context of available resources. The patron and trustees of both St. Joseph's special school and Pobalscoil Rosmini in Drumcondra, which make educational provision for the visually impaired, have been advised accordingly.</P>
    <P>On 28 August last, following a successful appeal under the Education Act by the parents of a girl refused a place in the school, the board of management of St. Joseph's decided that the school should become co-educational with immediate effect. In order to facilitate this development, the school has applied to my Department for certain additional resources. Some resources have been provided and further consideration is being given to the application.</P>
    <P>The question of Pobalscoil Rosmini also becoming co-educational has arisen and the board of management of the school has sought certain additional resources to enable this to happen. Again, this request is under consideration in my Department at present. Responses to both requests for additional resources will be provided at the earliest possible date.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. N. Dempsey Mr. N. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Mr. N. Dempsey)</NameTxt>
      <P>Up to October 1998, my Department's capacity to respond to individual children with special needs was limited. This changed with a Government decision in October 1998, whereby children assessed as having special educational needs in primary schools have an automatic entitlement to a response to their needs. Since this automatic entitlement to support was introduced, the number of resource teachers in the primary system has increased from approximately 100 to in excess of 2,300 and the number of special needs assistants has grown from approximately 300 to almost 5,500 full and part-time posts.</P>
      <P>I am determined to ensure that this considerable investment is deployed as effectively and flexibly as possible. With that aim in mind, a detailed circular 24/03, has recently issued to all schools dealing with the allocation of resources for pupils with special educational needs in national schools. The basic purpose of this circular is twofold: to ensure that applications for resource teacher and special needs assistant support are processed as efficiently as possible; and that such resources are targeted to best effect on an on-going basis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The circular highlights a number of practical <Col N="200" /> strategies to assist schools with existing resource allocations. For example wherever possible, schools should provide additional help for pupils with special educational needs in the mainstream classroom or, if necessary, in small groups; bearing in mind the various categories of special education teachers, including resource, learning support and visiting teachers deployed in the education system, schools are encouraged to develop strategies that draw on the skills of all such teachers, without making artificial distinctions between them; while resource teaching allocations have been approved on the basis of individual applications, the overriding principle is that these resources should be deployed in the manner that best meets the needs of pupils with special educational needs in the school; and before applying for additional special needs assistants, schools should review their existing allocations to see whether an identified need can be met by re-deploying available resources. Where appropriate, principals may deploy individual special needs assistants to support several pupils, perhaps in more than one classroom.</P>
    <P>I want to emphasise that circular 24/03 is not proposing a cut in resources for pupils with special educational needs. Schools will appreciate, however, that the level of approved resources is not immutable. Account must be taken of the progress being made by individual pupils with special educational needs and of the departure from the school of such pupils. It would be expected that schools would notify the Department of instances where resources had become surplus to requirements so that these could be redeployed as necessary. Put simply, the circular requires schools to take full account of what they already have before applying for more. Any other approach would be neither appropriate nor sustainable.</P>

      <P>Under the terms of the indemnity agreement between the State and CORI which was signed on the 5 June 2002, there is provision for an education fund of &euro;12.7 million to be established to assist former residents of institutions and their families in accessing educational programmes. I can confirm that &euro;12.7 million of the &euro;41.14 million cash contribution from the congregations has been set aside for this purpose. Furthermore, I can confirm that a scheme of grant assistance to former residents and their families, which is being funded from this &euro;12.7 million has been put in place. Application forms together <Col N="201" /> with the criteria for eligibility are available from the NOVA office and the scheme was advertised in the print media recently. Payment of grants to applicants that qualify under the terms of the scheme are presently being made by the City of Dublin VEC to cover the cost of college fees and the cost of books and materials.</P>
      <P>A committee has been established to oversee the grant scheme. The committee comprises representatives from the four victim support groups affiliated to NOVA, a representative from the further education section of my Department and the adult education officer at the City of Dublin VEC. The development officer for the outreach services in Britain was co-opted onto the committee recently.</P>
      <P>The committee intends to conduct a review of the scheme in early 2004 based on the experience of the scheme and views expressed by interested parties. Should the Deputy wish to make a submission to the committee in relation to expanding the educational options for which financial support is provided, I am certain that any such submission would be considered by the committee. Any such submission could be made to the NOVA office at 19, Upper Ormond Quay, Dublin 7.</P>

      <P>A grant of &euro;2,539,476 was allocated to Letterkenny Town Council under the 2000 sports capital programme, administered by my Department, towards the provision of a sports centre in the town. To date &euro;378,910 has been paid, in respect of enabling works at the site. Letterkenny Town Council has also applied to my Department for funding towards the replacement of a swimming pool in Letterkenny, to be part of the overall sports complex. Under the local authority swimming pool programme, which is also administered by my Department, there are four stages in a swimming pool project, following the submission and approval of a feasibility study. These, in order of progress, are: preliminary report; contract document; tender; and construction. My Departments technical advisors, the Office of Public Works, evaluate each stage and local authorities cannot proceed to the next stage of a project unless prior approval issues from my Department. Grant-aid is allocated only when tenders have been approved for the project and is capped at the time of allocation.</P>
      <P>Proposals must comply with the standards laid down in the Department's procedures for the planning, approval and financing of swimming pools and technical guidelines. Under the programme, grants of up to a maximum of &euro;3.8 million are available towards either the refurbishment of existing pools or the provision of new pools, subject in both cases to the total grant not exceeding 80% of the eligible cost of the project or, in the case of projects located in designated disadvantaged areas, 90% of the eligible cost. Support is available towards the cost of the swimming pool, toddler pool, sauna and steam room. In relation to the Letterkenny swimming pool application, the situation is that the preliminary report has been approved and, as provided for under the terms of the programme, the contract documents are now being assessed by my Department's technical advisors, the Office of Public Works. The Department is endeavouring to administer the available grants in a manner which will ensure that the sport and leisure centre can be progressed on an integrated basis.</P>

      <P>In respect of museums, I wish to emphasise that I have statutory responsibility for the National Museum of Ireland only. Objects of archaeological or historical interest that are discovered with no known owner, are taken possession of and retained by the National Museum of Ireland under the National Monuments (Amendment) Act 1994 on behalf of the State. All acquisitions made by the national museum, including the large number of objects discovered in the course of archaeological excavations, are fully documented and analysed. These objects frequently require treatment in a conservation laboratory before they can be made available for display.</P>
      <P>The National Museum of Ireland endeavours to display recently discovered acquisitions as regularly as possible. Newly acquired decorative art objects are regularly placed on display at the national museum site at Collins Barracks. At the Kildare Street premises, an exhibition entitled Ten Years Collecting, documents and displays archaeological objects recovered in Ireland during the past decade. In addition, the National Museum of Ireland has also recently placed on display the late 8th or early 9th century cross from Tully Lough, County Roscommon, as part of the treasury in Kildare Street.</P>

      <P>The national lottery-funded sports capital programme, which is administered by my Department, is the primary means of allocating funding to sporting and community organisations at local, regional and national level throughout the country. The programme is advertised on an annual basis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The 2003 sports capital programme was adver<Col N="205" /> tised in the national newspapers in March of this year. A total of 1,337 applications for funding were received in response. Following the completion of the assessment of each application, in accordance with the published criteria for the programme, I made two separate announcements of provisional grant allocations. On 25 July 2003 I announced the allocation of &euro;39.67 million to 591 organisations throughout the country towards the provision of local sporting facilities. This was followed by a further announcement on 29 August 2003 of the allocation of &euro;13.17 million to a further 26 key national, regional and municipal and multipurpose sports facilities.</P>
    <P>Under the local authority swimming pool programme, which is also administered by my Department, grants of up to a maximum of &euro;3.8 million are available towards the refurbishment of existing pools or the provision of a new pool subject, in either case, to the total grant not exceeding 80% of the eligible cost of the project or, in the case of projects located in designated disadvantaged areas, 90% of the eligible cost. Support is available towards the cost of the swimming pool, toddler pool, sauna and steam room. The provision in my Department's 2003 Estimates for the swimming pool programme is &euro;9 million and it is expected that the total allocation will be drawn down this year.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 152 and 153 together.</P>
      <P>Since I took up office I have had various discussions with the Irish Rugby Football Union, IRFU, the Football Association of Ireland, FAI and the Gaelic Athletic Association, GAA regarding the provision of stadium facilities. At my request, the IRFU and the FAI set out their prioritised proposals for stadium development in April, in which they considered five locations, as to their suitability to meet requirements for a modern stadium to host major international rugby and soccer fixtures in the greater Dublin area.</P>
      <P>This report has been subjected to detailed examination by the Office of Public Works, who act as my technical advisors on the project. The Office of Public Works has engaged international private sector construction consultants, Davis Langdon PKS, to ensure that all matters relating to the proposal were thoroughly evaluated. I received the Office of Public Works report in mid-September and I am now reflecting on the issues highlighted by it in conjunction with the response to the earlier initiative to secure stadium facilities with the assistance of private sector funds. When I have considered the matter fully I will present my assessment to Cabinet for decision.</P>

My Department raised the matter with the Eastern Regional Health Authority, which has advised that there are currently two palliative care nurses based in Wentworth Place, Wicklow, covering north and south-east <Col N="211" /> Wicklow, together with an additional vacant post, which has recently been advertised.</P>

      <P>The provision of health centres to meet the needs of local communities and the maintenance and upgrading of such centres within its functional area is a matter for the relevant health board or the Eastern Regional Health Authority. In the case of Newtownmountkennedy Health Centre, County Wicklow, this responsibility rests with the Eastern Regional Health Authority.</P>
      <P>I have been in contact with the Eastern Regional Health Authority and have been informed that it is acknowledged that the health centre facilities at Newtownmountkennedy have been less than ideal for some time. The short notice given to demolish the old health centre, the structure of which was deemed to be unsafe, exacerbated this situation. The Eastern Regional Health Authority has also stressed that the use of the local community hall was, and still is, intended only to be an interim solution.</P>
      <P>Alternatives to the present arrangements are being explored by the authority. Proposals and specifications for a new health centre have been drafted. The Eastern Regional Health Authority has also discussed incorporating a new health centre in the proposed town centre development at Newtownmountkennedy. The developer is currently seeking planning permission and the Eastern Regional Health Authority is awaiting the outcome. The Eastern Regional Health Authority is also engaged in discussions with Wicklow County Council to ensure that the delivery of the health centre remains as a priority for both agencies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Ultimately, it is a matter for the Eastern <Col N="212" /> Regional Health Authority to identify its priorities for capital developments. These will then be examined by my Department having regard to overall funding resources available.</P>

      <P>The health promotion unit of my Department works closely with a range of statutory and voluntary groups to ensure that people have the information and the support to make healthy lifestyle choices. The unit supports an extensive range of initiatives organised by the Irish Cancer Society, a number of which have an impact on the levels of knowledge and awareness of the risk factors associated with many cancer including skin cancer.</P>
      <P>This support enables the society to organise an information and awareness campaign entitled Sun Smart. This begins in May each year, just before the holiday season gets under way. The campaign provides information packs and leaflets both to those who are travelling abroad and to those who remain in Ireland. These materials provide comprehensive information on the nature, incidence and causes of skin cancers. Methods of identification are discussed and the leaflets also provide guidance on what to do in the case of a suspected skin cancer.</P>
      <P>The health promotion unit of my Department will examine the results of this research, which will inform the planning of future initiatives to promote awareness of the risk factors for skin cancers.</P>

      <P>The Government has approved the implementation, on a phased basis, of the recommendations of the Taxi Hardship Panel, which recommended the establishment of a scheme to provide payments to individual taxi licence holders who fall into one of six categories that the panel assessed as having suffered extreme personal financial hardship from taxi liberalisation. Category five of the panel report refers to circumstances where large loan repayments are outstanding and have been secured against a family home.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Area Development Management Limited, <Col N="214" /> ADM, has been engaged to administer and manage a scheme to implement the recommendations of the Taxi Hardship Panel report. My Department is making arrangements with ADM to facilitate an application process and payment scheme on the basis of the panel recommendations and I expect that these arrangements will be finalised in the near future with a view to commencing payments to qualifying persons before the end of 2003.</P>
    <P>It will be open to persons who held a taxi licence on 21 November 2000 to make an application to ADM, in due course, under the taxi hardship payments scheme and these applications will be processed and assessed having regard to the eligibility criteria and specific requirements associated with each category of hardship in accordance with the Taxi Hardship Panel report.</P>

    <P>I am informed by the Garda authorities that the seizure details relate to the principal drugs misused in Ireland and would constitute over 98% of all offences and seizure data. Other drugs occasionally seized include benzodiazepines, psilocin/psilocybin and methadone. Due to the small number of seizures it is difficult to determine a precise value for these drugs.</P>
    <P>The above seizure details are drawn from the Garda Commissioner's annual crime report for the years 2000 and 2001. The statistics for the year 2002 are not yet available.</P>
    <P>In relation to a breakdown of seizure data per county, the annual crime report provides details of the number of drug offences where proceedings have been instituted in the particular year, broken down by Garda division. Statistics are not maintained in such a way as to facilitate <Col N="217" /> the breakdown of seizure data by county. Copies of these reports are available in the Oireachtas Library.</P>

      <P>A contract for services arrangement for the provision of accommodation and related facilities under the system of direct pro<Col N="218" /> vision was entered into with the owner of the Ormonde Hostel, Kilkenny in December 2000. That initial contract which was for a period of two years was followed by a subsequent one year contract which runs until December 2003. Currently 74 asylum seekers are accommodated in the premises in question.</P>
      <P>In accordance with normal practice and on the grounds of commercial sensitivity, I do not propose to comment on the detailed commercial arrangements made by my Department in this or any other similar case. However, I can confirm that, in this case, as in the case of similar hostel type properties in respect of which contract for services arrangements for the accommodation of asylum seekers have been entered into, the payment to proprietors is currently in the range of &euro;182 to &euro;196 per person per week.</P>
      <P>No asylum seekers are accommodated or have ever been accommodated in the private rented sector in Kilkenny by my Department. However, it may be the case that persons who entered the State as asylum seekers and subsequently withdrew their applications on, for example, the birth of a child may have been granted full supplementary welfare allowance and rent supplement by the South-Eastern Health Board. My Department has no role in relation to the determination of these allowances, and as such, it is not in a position to indicate how many were granted. This information may be available from the South-Eastern Health Board.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government (Mr. N. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 184 and 185 together.</P>
      <P>Under the 1999 affordable housing scheme a loan limit of &euro;130,000 applies. My Department is keeping the terms of the loan limit under review, taking into account the movement in house prices, the effectiveness of various schemes in meeting the needs of the relevant target group and the availability of mortgage finance in the private sector. The Department is examining the issues in relation to the provision of such finance by the institutions and consultations have taken place with a number of local authorities and representatives from the Irish Mortgage Council.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government (Mr. N. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>People with disabilities who are unable to provide housing for themselves from their own resources are entitled, irrespective of employment status, to apply for social housing under existing legislation. Under section 9 of the Housing Act 1988, local authorities are required to identify the disabled or handicapped as specific categories when assessing the need for housing. The results of the 2002 assessment of housing need indicated that 423 households or 1% of the total net need were categorised as disabled/handicapped.</P>
      <P>Local authorities normally provide accommodation for disabled people as part of their social housing programmes, generally in small specifically designed housing schemes linked to local services. Figures available to my Department indicate that local authorities provided some 115 units of accommodation specifically for disabled people in 2002. This adds to a significant stock of housing provided by local authorities over many years.</P>
      <P>Capital funding is also available under my Department's voluntary housing capital assistance scheme to approved housing bodies for the provision of special needs housing schemes to provide accommodation for groups such as the elderly, disabled and the homeless.</P>

      <P>The back to education allowance is a second chance education opportunities scheme designed to encourage and facilitate people who have been unemployed for a certain period and others to improve their skills and qualifications and, therefore, their prospects of returning to the active workforce.</P>
      <P>One of the conditions for receipt of the back to education allowance is that a person must be in receipt of a relevant social welfare payment for at least six months, or 156 days, prior to commencing an approved course of study.</P>
      <P>The person concerned was initially refused participation in the back to education allowance scheme on the grounds that she did not satisfy the above condition.</P>
      <P>However, on further examination of her record of previous unemployment, her application is now being awarded.</P>

      <P>As advised in my previous reply, the health board decided to pay a rent supplement to the couple in question as an exceptional measure for a period of six months and advised them accordingly. The decision was taken on 25 March 2003 in respect of the period from 1 February 2003 to 31 July 2003. The board has indicated, that in its view, the assistance provided as an exceptional measure allowed adequate time for the couple to make suitable alternative arrangements regarding their accommodation requirements.</P>
      <P>I am satisfied that the application was fully assessed and given due consideration by the board before arriving at its decision.</P>

      <P>Married and cohabiting couples are treated uniformly under the social welfare code. Prior to 1989 cohabiting couples were treated as single people for means testing and payments purposes. Arising from a Supreme Court <Col N="223" /> judgment in that year the definition of a married couple was extended to encompass cohabitation and these couples then became subject to the same means testing and payment arrangements as <Col N="224" /> apply to married couples. There are currently no plans for changes to these arrangements. The question of the treatment of couples under the taxation system is a matter for consideration in the context of the taxation code generally.</P>
