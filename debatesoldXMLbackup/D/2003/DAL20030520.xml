    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 1 to 4, inclusive, together.</P>
      <P>As I informed the House in my reply of 26 February 2003, the high level group on regulation has made considerable progress since its establishment in May 2001, following publication of the OECD review on regulatory reform in Ireland. The group has met 16 times to date, most recently on 20 March 2003, and reported to Government on its progress in November 2002. The report is available on my Department's &ldquo;better regulation&rdquo; website.</P>
      <P>The group has focused on two areas in particular. It has begun the process of framing a national policy statement on better regulation through the publication of the public consultation document, Towards Better Regulation. The consultation document was designed to highlight the key issues that are likely to feature in the national policy statement and to promote public debate and awareness in relation to better regulation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="3" />The consultation document sets out the key questions that we need to address in considering why we regulate, what we need to regulate and new approaches to governance in a global economy. It is important to emphasise that this process is not about resolving micro-level regulatory issues or specific market problems. Rather, it is about giving us a set of core principles to guide future regulation and policy-making.</P>
    <P>The consultation process was widely publicised in the media, through Government websites, seminars and presentations. Approximately 4,000 copies of the consultation document were distributed and 89 submissions were received from a wide variety of interested parties. A full list of submissions is available on my Department's &ldquo;better regulation&rdquo; website.</P>
    <P>To inform the subsequent formulation of the national policy statement, these submissions have been studied and analysed. Earlier this year, my Department published a booklet containing two papers, the first summarising the submissions received and the second offering an independent analysis and commentary on the submissions by an independent economist. More than 1,000 copies of the booklet have been sent to interested parties and copies have been placed in the Oireachtas Library.</P>
    <P>A drafting group composed of senior officials from key Departments held its first meeting at the end of January to commence preparation of a draft national policy statement. While a specific date for publication has not been set, it is anticipated that the draft text of the policy statement will be submitted to the Government in early summer with a view to publication some weeks later.</P>
    <P>The second priority of the high level group has been the development of a system of regulatory impact analysis, RIA, as recommended by the OECD in its report. Regulatory impact analysis is a policy tool designed to identify and quantify, where possible, the impact of new and existing regulations. A working group of officials has been developing a model that would be suitable for the Irish policy making context. The group has recommended a particular approach and I understand the next steps will be to pilot the model in a small number of volunteer Departments, prepare detailed guidance material and supports and devise and deliver a programme of awareness raising and training to inform civil servants and other interested parties about regulatory impact analysis.</P>
    <P>The publication of a White Paper on regulation in 2003 and the introduction of regulatory impact analysis across Departments are two of the commitments on regulatory reform contained in the new social partnership agreement, Sustaining Progress. Overall, significant progress has been made in the area of better regulation since the establishment of the high level group on regulation and I look forward to continued progress in the coming years.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny" hpid="Mr. Kenny Mr. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>Two years after the publication of the OECD report on deregulation, the response has been an abject failure. The deficiencies identified there have not been tackled. The opening of the energy sector has been too slow and the fees charged by professions are still too high as recognised in the recent report of the Competition Authority. Last week saw us slip out of the top ten in world competitiveness. This must be of serious concern to Government. Is the Taoiseach not concerned at the serious escalation in construction costs for major sites in the country? Many international firms locating here are very concerned at the huge scale of cost increases. Manufacturing facilities could be provided in other countries such as the United States or in central Europe at much less cost. Should the Competition Authority look into the fact that vastly inflated costs seem to apply in a number of cases here and is that not a major factor in driving us out of the top ten in terms of competition and competitiveness?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I will clarify what this is about. It relates to the work of my Department in the implementation of a major national level report by the OECD two years back, in which the Government asked the OECD to involve itself. There are two questions: the White Paper, which I have outlined; and the regulatory impact analysis. The issues on which my Department is working are not the sectoral issues which were in that report. We have now moved on, following the report last year, which was on a cross-departmental basis, and each individual Department is dealing with the issues involved.</P>
      <P>My Department's involvement, through the support of the high level group on regulation, has centred on preparing a better national policy, the consultation document Towards Better Regulation and developing models for regulatory impact analysis. The process is endeavouring to ensure that there should be a model of tests to see, when new legislation is brought in, if regulation is required, if existing regulation should be updated, if we would be better off not regulating and whether regulation would be implementable, if legislation is introduced. A series of measures and the kind of models in which we would involve ourselves were set out in the document last year.</P>
      <P>The group has looked at best practice everywhere. The OECD told the group it should have a regulatory impact analysis but it did not say what its model should be or how it should be done. The group has been working on preparing the White Paper, as I have outlined in my reply, and putting together the regulatory impact analysis, which it will have this summer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The objective behind the document is not to resolve particular regulatory issues in specific areas. As Deputy Kenny said, the OECD report contained questions about looking at pharmacies, professional services studies and other areas. Work has gone on in all of those areas under different Ministries. If the Deputy wishes I can <Col N="5" /> say a few general words about those but I am not directly handling them. They are being dealt with in the relevant Departments. That is what this process is about.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny" hpid="Mr. Kenny Mr. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government received a fairly severe reprimand from the European Union for failing to fully implement a Single Market programme. How does the Taoiseach intend to implement a strategy that will prevent investment moving from Ireland to more competitive countries and has he a strategy in place to deal with that?</P>
      <P>I am surprised that the former backbench critic of the Government and chairman of the select committee dealing with corporate affairs is not here because his brief in dealing with the problems of Irish business is directly related to the matter of competitiveness. Can the Taoiseach give an assurance that that committee will not be used to deflect his own responsibility for maintaining the competitiveness of the economy, in view of the uncertainty that faces us in the future?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I can assure the Deputy that competitiveness is a key issue. We must try to deal with the key issues that make up the competitiveness agenda so that we continue to be competitive. I will be dealing with this issue when I answer the next question on social partnership. We have been looking at all the issues &ndash; costs, benefits, economic and social inputs, consultation and compliance costs and all the issues that make up competitiveness. It is a key issue and we must do everything we can to make ourselves as competitive as possible and to remain so. We must even improve because we have lost competitiveness, as I have said a number of times recently. It is part of Sustaining Progress and the talks on the social partnership process tried to deal with our loss of competitiveness and with regaining it, in so far as we possibly can.</P>
      <P>Deputy Kenny also raised the question of what will happen in more competitive countries where wages and salaries are considerably lower and which have attractions for inward investment. They are all important but they are not based on these questions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeHiggins" hpid="Mr. J. Higgins Mr. J. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Taoiseach agree that the OECD report on regulatory reform, on which the interdepartmental group is basing its work, is one long argument for the privatisation of key public services once one strips away the formulae? It argues for such services finding their way from public ownership into private hands and into the ownership of multinational corporations in particular in the case of Ireland. Does the Taoiseach agree the example of the ESB bears this out fully? There was no argument we could see for a substantial increase in fees or costs to the ordinary consumer but that was awarded to fatten up the ESB for privatisation in the not too distant future. A similar approach to gas, transport and <Col N="6" /> other areas is dictated by the driving mania to privatise public services which comes all the way from the top of the European Commission.</P>
      <P>The Taoiseach spoke recently in Killarney about the professions and the difficulties faced by ordinary working people, for example, in buying good legal advice on the same basis as a millionaire or a wealthy company. What does the Taoiseach see coming out of the group's work which will tackle the inordinate fees charged by barristers? Those fees make the law unavailable to ordinary people. The Taoiseach was saying in general that we need more competition but how does he square that vague formulation with his strong strictures to ordinary workers to stay within the national pay agreement for wage increases which are below the rate of inflation?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy asked two questions. Regarding the first question, the consultation document, &ldquo;Towards Better Regulation&rdquo;, which was based on regulatory reform and on the work done by the committee up to last Christmas, is not the same as deregulation. It is not about deregulating industries or moving on to privatisation. Admittedly, some parts of the OECD report put the case for the State disengaging from public sector companies and the European Union has put forward a similar case. That is true in those cases but it is not true of this particular report. The arguments put forward in some cases regarding consumers and investors was that the broader public interest may be better served by introducing new regulations. That is what the OECD report was saying. In other cases the public interest may be better served by removing regulations but the discussion of legislation and regulations is not based on trying to sell off assets.</P>
      <P>The Government makes no initial assumptions about either the existing quality or quantity of regulations or the need to deregulate. The goal set out in &ldquo;Towards Better Regulation&rdquo; will not be achieved by simply seeking to minimise the volume of regulations. We want to see if it is right to regulate or legislate and to see if doing so is better for the public, trade unions, industry or whoever. The model the OECD said we should devise, which has been devised in other countries and is now being used in the EU, is one where all legislation and regulations are examined. It is not a matter of just looking at State assets.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Regarding the professional services study, the Competition Authority has finished its overall report on the study and has issued two consultation documents. Eight professions were studied in that report, including engineers, architects, dentists, veterinary surgeons, optometrists, doctors, solicitors and barristers. The relevant professional bodies and regulatory authorities, where they exist, also responded by way of completed questionnaires and had discussions with the authority. The consultants commissioned by the authority analysed these discussions and met all the bodies concerned. They conducted surveys of consumers and users of the professional ser<Col N="7" /> vices involved. I think people will admit they completed a very large body of work and they published the overall report in March.</P>
    <P>A number of recommendations in that report will be implemented by the relevant Departments and bodies. The consultants considered each body in detail. They did a lot of this work as they put together their overall report. They will now set out detailed recommendations on each of the professions. This month they will produce the document on the engineering profession and in practically every month for the rest of this year they will produce a detailed document on each of the other professions. Recommendations will be made and it will then be up to the Government and the agencies to implement them. The recommendations are, by and large, an extension of what is in the report and I do not think there will be any surprises. They spell out in more detail what is included in the 20 March report.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>My memory is that the high level group was established in about April 2001 and it was to make a final report to Government within a year. What is the position now? Is the Taoiseach saying that two years later the final report will manifest itself in the form of a White Paper and, if so, when will we see it?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is right in that the consultants started their work on the broad report in April 2001 and they finished it and published their detailed report last year. They have gone on to cover two further aspects of the report, which I outlined. One is a document, Towards Better Regulation &ndash; it is not a White Paper for ongoing discussion although it is called a White Paper. Perhaps I should not use that term as it may cause confusion. That is practically finished &ndash; it will certainly be finished this summer.</P>
      <P>The group will also put forward proposals on developing a system of regulatory impact analysis, which is taking considerable time. The group has looked at how this system works in other countries and, how it can be operated simply so as not to make it a complicated exercise. With the regulatory impact analysis, all Departments and agencies involved in legislation or regulation will go through a series of tests and fulfil criteria before putting forward legislation. The reasons for this are fairly obvious. The OECD analysis showed that bad regulation is a block to competitiveness and flexibility.</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>One has a simple system so one does not go through the enormous exercise of leg<Col N="8" /> islating or regulating only to find it cannot be implemented. There will be a set of less than ten simple criteria whereby anyone regulating will go through these tests which will, I hope, make legislation and regulation more simple, meaningful and useful. Both those exercises will be finished this summer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>Do I understand that an interim report is all that has been published and that what the Taoiseach refers to as a White Paper will be the property of the high-level group and not that of any Minister and that it will not be promoted by any Minister?</P>
      <P>In light of the perceptive question raised by Deputy Kenny, will the Taoiseach outline the role of the new committee? Is it to second guess the high-level group or is it to assuage a troublesome and knowledgeable backbencher? Can the Taoiseach tell us anything about the structure of the high-level group? Is it examining whether we could have one office of regulation rather than a plethora of empire building projects for different sectors?</P>
      <P>In terms of economic theory, what is the difference between energy and gas on the one hand and transport and telecoms on the other? Why can they not be considered under the aegis of one office? Is that kind of thing being examined by the high-level group and is it likely to make specific proposals to Government in that regard? It seems that we are developing an alternative Civil Service. In case that is not enough, it is hardly possible to meet a consultant in the western world who is not working for some of them or on a retainer. Somebody needs to get a grip on the matter soon. Maybe I should put all my eggs in the basket of Deputy Ned O'Keeffe. Maybe he will get a grip on the matter but it seems to go on and on.</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy has raised two questions, the first of which concerns what the committee has done. It is very obvious. Nobody has looked too much at the work it has done and perhaps we should recirculate it. In fairness to the committee, it has issued the report, which relates to the first report of the OECD, and then it made an economic assessment of the submissions. It published 4,000 of these and got submissions from many bodies. I think 89 of the major interests in the country put forward major submissions on which an economic analysis was given. There were various systems such as pharmacies and other professions which were moved out to Departments. That part of the work is over.  Then it moved on to Towards Better Regulation and putting the regulatory impact analysis together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="9" />On the Deputy's second question, the committee is examining the question of regulators, who regulates the regulators and whether we should have myriad regulators built up around every public utility. The committee will report on that and make recommendations. It is now clear that the structures and basis of regulators are not what people thought it would be a decade ago. This is happening in other countries as well. It is an unsatisfactory system which the committee is examining and it will report on it. I am aware of some of the discussions that it had at a recent meeting but I would only be speculating if I were to say what it will ultimately decide. I am getting minutes of its meeting. The committee is looking at this issue and it will bring forward proposals.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
      <P>I echo the Ceann Comhairle's welcome to our visitors.</P>
      <P>Can the Taoiseach say what progress has been made towards publication of the White Paper on regulation in 2003, and the introduction of the regulatory impact analysis which he told us about in February, given the importance of impact analysis for regulatory activity? Would he accept, for example, that because the inflation rate is twice the eurozone average and personal debt stands at &euro;56 billion, according to the economist Dan White, many people are concerned that in many cases regulation tends to be followed by rationalisation and layoffs? Would he for that reason consider it a priority to move on impact analysis before proceeding with deregulation in any other area?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Would he take note of the International Institute for Management Development report which shows that Ireland is no longer among the top ten most competitive smaller economies? Would he accept that Ireland has never been competitive when it came to sustainability and <Col N="10" /> encouraging enterprise based on long-term sustainability? Renewable energy is a topic that we have discussed many times. It is an acid test of future competitiveness. Would the Taoiseach agree that unless sustainable activities are competitive that competitiveness is a short-term thing about which to boast?</P>
    <P>Would the Taoiseach accept that there are certain natural monopolies which it may be counterproductive to deregulate? For example, An Post was in conflict recently with the regulator for trying to locate letter boxes at the roadside rather than in people's houses in rural areas. Would he agree that to maintain levels of service in the community and quality of life, there are certain enterprises that have a natural monopoly? Will that be taken into account?</P>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy asked two questions. On the second question, about competitiveness, if one wants to achieve anything on that agenda it must be based on trying to improve and sustain the situation. There is little point in doing it, boasting about it or criticising it on the basis of any analysis other than its usefulness to the economy in terms of creating jobs, wealth and regenerating resources into services.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent" hpid="Mr. Sargent Mr. Sargent">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
      <P>What about the environment?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>That includes the environment. With regard to natural monopolies, there are areas where it does not make sense to break these up because turning a public sector monopoly into a private sector monopoly does not achieve much. Breaking a public service monopoly into a number of parts does not necessarily make it more efficient. The issue of the post boxes is being dealt with but I do not want to encroach on the area of the Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources. We should not just take the view that deregulation is a good idea in every area. Neither the OECD nor the EU say that we should deregulate for that reason.</P>
      <P>As regards the Deputy's first question, concerning the high-level group which is taking on the next phase of the OECD report, I will cover some of this ground again as I have dealt with it regarding Deputy Rabbitte's question. The group examined those findings. The national statement of Government policy on better regulation, which will be published shortly, will have as its ultimate objective to seek to identify the core principles that make up regulatory impact analysis and to inform future decision making. As regards the need for regulation in the future, or changes to existing regulations, it has made many other proposals that I have not discussed today about composite legislation, condensing legislation and the means of updating legislation. They are set out in the Statute Law (Restatement) Act 2002 which continually updates and consolidates legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The high-level group was asked to consider this issue and it recommended that the first step in the preparation of the policy should be a consultation <Col N="11" /> process. That process and the economic analysis are done and published. Without reciting the issues and going over the same ground, a few examples under some of the main headings might give the House an idea of some of the questions raised in the consultation document. These are likely to be further developed in the context of the paper that is to be issued. There are three sections and I propose to outline some of the headings therein: the performance of the economy and consumer welfare; how to ensure that consumers' rights and interests are protected and promoted; how regulatory reform might contribute to national competitiveness and strengthen the operation of competition policy in the country; and, whether the regulatory system is supporting infrastructural developments and what improvements might be made in that regard. The group will argue over and come to recommendations on those headings.</P>
    <P>Regarding efficiencies in the public sector, regulatory impact assessment, on which I have already given details, will examine proposed new regulations in keeping with a results-orientated approach to management of the public services. As I have already explained, there will be ongoing systematic review and simplification of existing regulations. There will be new legislative procedures to consolidate, restate and enhance the accessibility of existing legislation. Rather than having out-of-date legislation or always having to go back over five or six Bills, we will use the Statute Law (Restatement) Act 2002 to update legislation continually.</P>
    <P>The third section on which the group will report is the quality of governance, including what forms of institution are appropriate to governing newly liberalised sectors and what regulatory reforms are needed in such contexts, a question that Deputy Rabbitte raised regarding controlling regulators and what rules should apply to them. It will also assess whether there is a need for legislation on administrative procedures in the Irish context and how the use of alternatives to regulation can be more widely considered.</P>

      <P>I have two specific questions about the OECD's findings in its report.</P>
      <P>The first concerns the strategic management initiative. The report stated that reliance on the SMI approach based on self-assessment and peer pressure may provide too few incentives to transform regulatory traditions and practices. It went on to state that the unit in the Department of the Taoiseach was too small to achieve any results and that its smallness revealed what the OECD described as a lack of political commitment to SMI, presumably on the part of the Taoiseach himself. Has that changed?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Does the Taoiseach agree with a second statement made by the OECD, to the effect that, compared with the pace of change in the Executive regarding deregulation, the Dáil has been slow to <Col N="12" /> assume its new regulatory accountability role? It goes on to state that adequate resources have not been accompanied&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I can quote it from memory. Adequate resources have not been provided for the Oireachtas to enable it to fulfil what is required of it to ensure that regulatory reform means something. Does the Taoiseach not agree that there is a tremendous risk in this area of creating more paperwork, allegedly to eliminate it, and that there is an endless capacity to set up committees and procedures, supposedly to relieve burdens, but in fact increasing them because of their sheer size and number?</P>

      <P>To answer Deputy Bruton's first question, following that suggestion, we took all those involved in the strategic management initiative and related areas in the Department, with which Deputy Bruton is familiar, and put them all together. We did not simply create a new unit for regulatory impact analysis. To maximise the usefulness of my staff, I brought the entire SMI section and all the related parts together to achieve a more efficient operation. The section is still not enormous, but, as the Deputy knows, there is a fair number of people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Taoiseach not agree that there are no rewards for civil servants who perform well and no sanctions for those who perform badly?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Bruton and all Members of the House know the system in place for civil servants and it is not true to say that they are not rewarded. It is increasingly the case that civil servants of what would have been considered extremely young ages a decade ago now progress to the top positions of Secretary General and Assistant Secretary General, and do so on ability. Promotion is not as it was, namely, based on age grounds. That younger people can get up the ranks is a benefit. That is what I did to get the best value out of my staff and to bring the sections together.</P>
      <P>I agree with Deputy Bruton that we should not set up sections or systems to create more paperwork or more cumbersome issues. That is precisely what the OECD report was about. We should consider all that we do in regard to legislation, regulation and otherwise to find where the system could be simplified or made more sensitive or to find where we should not have it, and to try to keep under very set criteria issues for which we must develop a model, as I said earlier, under the ten areas I outlined earlier.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Regulatory impact analysis and the OECD report are about trying to act more efficiently. It is not an exercise in bureaucracy but the opposite; it is intended to simplify a system which can be <Col N="13" /> extremely bureaucratic, and I hope this system is not going in that direction.</P>

      <P>Substantial resources have been put into the Oireachtas in recent years. It was highlighted in the report that we do not, as we should, have a committee on competitiveness. I have already engaged with the party leaders and the Whips in regard to that. It was stated in the OECD report and in Sustaining Progress that we should have a committee geared to competitiveness in the House and I accept that we have not addressed that.</P>

      <P>Given the dominance of PD thinking within Government in regard to public enterprise, can our citizenry have any confidence that the subtitle of the White Paper when published will be other than a charter for privatisation? When does the Taoiseach expect the White Paper to be published? Can he give us a firm indication that this will happen, if not in this session, in the following session?</P>

      <P>I hope it will be during this summer. I do not think it will be before the upcoming break but the section is working to have it completed before the holiday break at the end of July. I checked this matter this morning and was told that the July deadline will be met. Based on the latest information, which is all I can give the House, I hope it will be before the summer recess.</P>
      <P>I accept the concern that people will think that regulation is another device to move towards privatisation of State utilities because that arises in the OECD paper in regard to a number of issues. However, on this particular issue, it is pointed out that it is seeking to try to simplify regulation and to set a mechanism so that we do not have detailed regulations which are unworkable or cannot function. It is not a device for getting recommendations or a determination to privatise State utilities. While that arises in regard to other aspects of competition, it is not what this working group is endeavouring to do.</P>

      <Quest>the minimum evidence required by a person who is seeking unemployment assistance or unemployment benefit to prove that they are seeking and are available for work.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan" hpid="Mary Coughlan Mary Coughlan">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Social and Family Affairs (Mary Coughlan)</NameTxt>
      <P>Social welfare legislation provides that in order to be entitled to unemployment benefit or unemployment assistance a person must prove, <i>inter alia,</i> that he or she is available for and genuinely seeking work. Unemployment <Col N="14" /> benefit and assistance claimants are expected to demonstrate that they have taken reasonable steps to secure suitable full-time employment and to provide examples of such steps. A person who fails to satisfy the deciding officer that he or she is available for full-time employment and genuinely seeking work is not entitled to an unemployment payment. In applying the legislation, deciding officers have regard to local conditions including job vacancies in the locality and the extent to which a claimant has sought to take advantage of available labour market opportunities.</P>
      <P>The steps which people might be expected to take to seek employment will vary with the circumstances but could include, for example, making oral or written applications for work to employers or persons who have advertised job offers on behalf of an employer; seeking information on the availability of employment from employers, advertisements, employment agencies and people who have placed advertisements indicating that employment is available; availing of reasonable training opportunities suitable in his or her case; and acting on the advice given by a jobs facilitator, a FÁS adviser or other placement agency such as the local employment service.</P>
      <P>It would not be possible or indeed desirable to specify a set of requirements which would guarantee qualification for benefit in all cases. The present system is based on the exercise of judgment by the deciding officer or, as appropriate, the appeals officer, as to whether a claimant meets the conditions of entitlement. The Department has a programme of training for deciding officers on the carrying out of their responsibilities and on the application of the legislation. Each case is decided on its own merits within the framework of the relevant social welfare legislation.</P>
      <P>A person who fails to satisfy the deciding officer that he or she is available for full-time employment and genuinely seeking work is not entitled to an unemployment payment. I am satisfied that the requirement to be available for full-time employment and to be genuinely seeking work is operated in a reasonable manner so as to ensure that those who are genuinely seeking employment qualify for payment and those who are not, do not.</P>
      <P>Under social welfare legislation decisions in relation to individual cases are made by statutorily appointed deciding officers and appeals officers. Where a person is dissatisfied with a decision made by a deciding officer to refuse him or her an unemployment payment, the decision may be appealed to the social welfare appeals office.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelRing" hpid="Mr. Ring Mr. Ring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ring</NameTxt>
      <P>There appears to be some confusion between the Minister and her Department about the regulations because when people bring evidence in the form of letters to social welfare officers indicating that they have been actively seeking work they are told by the Minister's officers that they are not looking for work. If <Col N="15" /> somebody produces three, four or five letters to the social welfare officer, how can that officer say that person is not actively looking for work? The Minister is falsifying the unemployment figures because when people bring evidence to social welfare officers which is not accepted by them, they then have to get money from the health board. All that is happening is that they are being paid by one State agency instead of another.</P>
      <P>What does the Minister intend to do about those people who bring evidence to the social welfare officers but who are told by them that the evidence is not acceptable? Somebody will take the Minister and her Department to court on the basis that the genuine evidence they produced was not accepted. Some officers are telling these people that seeking work 20, 25 or 30 miles away is acceptable despite the fact that some of them do not have transport.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan" hpid="Mary Coughlan Mary Coughlan">
      <NameTxt>Mary Coughlan</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mary Coughlan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure the Deputy is much more responsible than that. The Deputy has brought to my attention, through parliamentary questions, concerns regarding his own constituency and I assume those concerns are reflected in the priority question before me. Guidelines, which are fair and reasonable, are available to the deciding officers and they take into consideration some local issues, particularly those in employment black spots. As I indicated, we have an employment support service, where job facilitators and FÁS advisers are available, in addition to the local employment service, to facilitate people in seeking full-time employment.</P>
      <P>The days of people running to employers to request letters because a social welfare investigative officer was asking a few hard questions are gone. People have to make a substantial effort in applying for jobs advertised, for example, in the newspapers or by the FÁS service. It is also important that they are registered with FÁS to ensure they are kept informed. On making an application for social welfare allowance, applicants are given a booklet in which the Department outlines the regulations concerning availability for work and the way in which one goes about making an application.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy knows, a person may be entitled to social welfare allowance while his or her application for social welfare allowance is being considered. However, the same eligibility criteria will apply during the interim period. As such, there is a continuum with regard to eligibility criteria.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While I appreciate there are difficulties in obtaining employment in some parts of the Deputy's constituency, these are taken into consideration. If people have a personal issue, they are free to take their case to an appeals officer. <Col N="16" /> Reason must prevail on both sides. If the Deputy finds rulings in particular cases unwarranted or excessively harsh, he should bring them to my attention and I will deal with them accordingly.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan" hpid="Mary Coughlan Mary Coughlan">
      <NameTxt>Mary Coughlan</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 83 and 85 together.</P>
      <P>The free travel scheme is generally available to all people living in the State aged 66 years and over. It is also available to carers and people with disabilities who are in receipt of certain social welfare payments. The scheme provides free travel on the main public and private transport services for those eligible under the scheme. These include road, rail and ferry services provided by semi-State companies, such as Bus Átha Cliath, Bus Éireann and Iarnród Éireann, as well as services provided by more than 50 private transport operators. The vast majority of these private contractors operate in rural areas. The underlying feature of the scheme is the use of spare capacity on these transport services.</P>
      <P>I am always willing to consider applications from licensed private transport operators who may wish to participate in the free travel scheme. However, while my Department pays transport providers to operate the free travel scheme, it is not in a position to provide transport services where none exists.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="17" />I am aware that research has shown that those who are most marginalised by lack of access to transport in rural areas include the elderly and the mobility impaired and that the provision of accessible, affordable and acceptable local transport can make a very important improvement in quality of life for these people. In this regard the rural transport initiative has selected 33 community groups to receive funding to provide innovative community based transport services on a pilot basis in rural areas.</P>
    <P>This initiative is being managed by area development management on behalf of the Department of Transport and funding of approximately &euro;6 million has been provided for this purpose through the national development plan. As free travel pass holders clearly benefit from this initiative, I contributed &euro;500,000 in the last budget towards its cost, thereby ensuring free travel pass holders have full access to these community based transport services.</P>
    <P>The travel needs of those in rural areas are best met through improvements in the overall transport infrastructure. In this regard, the experience gained from the schemes operating under the rural transport initiative will be important when developing future rural transport policy. Significant improvements have been made in the free schemes, including the free travel scheme, in recent budgets both in terms of the qualifying conditions and the coverage of the schemes. I will continue to review the operation of these schemes with a view to identifying the scope for further improvements as resources permit.</P>
    <P>The Government programme includes a proposal to put in place an all-Ireland travel scheme for pensioners resident in all parts of this island. This will require discussions and agreement with the relevant authorities and transport providers on both sides of the Border. Work on the implementation of this proposal will commence as soon as possible.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamPenrose" hpid="Mr. Penrose Mr. Penrose">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Penrose</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it not the position that a free travel pass is the first item pensioners applying for a pension receive from the Department? Is it not also the position that these are put in a drawer or on a mantelpiece and that for many people they amount to no more than a document from the Department which will not be utilised? Why is this the case? The reason is that many older people live in rural and remote parts of the country where there is no access to public transport. How many free travel passes are utilised and how many issued?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Will the Minister agree to carry out a full review of the free travel pass scheme in the context of usage of multiple modes of transport? Will she also agree to create a simple voucher system to allow transport operators to obtain full reimbursement from the Department for free travel pass holders? Such a measure would extend the scope of the free transport scheme to cover those elderly people most affected by the lack of transport in rural areas, that is, those who cannot <Col N="18" /> access public transport, despite holding a free travel pass because none is available near their homes. This problem is pervasive in rural areas where the free travel pass is useless to the vast majority of its recipients.</P>
    <P>What progress is being made on the all-Ireland travel scheme? What discussions have taken place with the Minister's counterparts north of the Border to ensure this innovation will be available to many people throughout the island as soon as possible?</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan" hpid="Mary Coughlan Mary Coughlan">
      <NameTxt>Mary Coughlan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy will appreciate that we have some tentative difficulties with regard to the all-Ireland travel pass. Progress will be made on the initiative at official level and I hope we will be able to address the issue at political level in due course. Discussions on the proposal will soon commence. As the Deputy will be aware, people may travel to Northern Ireland using the free travel pass, but may only use one point of access.</P>
      <P>The total expenditure on free travel last year was &euro;46.2 million. The cross-Border scheme currently costs &euro;3 million while spending on private travel operators and CIE is &euro;2.8 million and &euro;40.4 million respectively.</P>
      <P>The scheme from which the concept developed was originally introduced to address spare capacity, particularly in CIE. Trinity College carried out a review of its operation in 2000, which examined the issue of vouchers, widely regarded at the time as the correct approach to take. However, having considered the recommendations of the review and the alternatives to the current scheme, I have been advised that a voucher system would be more complicated and less feasible than the current scheme and would undermine some of its fundamental aspects.</P>
      <P>The rural transport initiative came about as a result of the study, which proposed that a community fund be established to which people qualifying for the travel pass would have access. The community development approach is excellent and would, if expanded, address the concerns being brought to our attention as it entails greater consultation with the community. This approach involves finding out what are the main areas of need, for example, whether the scheme is used to bring people to hospital and so forth. Thus far, the assessment suggests this approach, as opposed to a voucher system, offers the best way forward. The issue will be evaluated in the near future. ADM has provided the &euro;500,000 already allocated for the initiative.</P>
      <P>Like every other Member, I would like to see the free travel scheme extended throughout the country. Its implementation to date has been more than successful. The best way forward may be to make available a central fund. I appreciate that while everyone receives a free travel pass, many do not have access to buses or trains.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelRing" hpid="Mr. Ring Mr. Ring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ring</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister accept that we now have a different attitude to taxis? Thousands <Col N="19" /> of people have started to use taxis in the past ten years. It is not beyond the ability of the Department to develop a simple scheme allowing pensioners to use them. During a visit to the Houses today, some of the pupils of St. Louis school, Rathmines, suggested pension books could be issued containing vouchers which would allow people to use taxis and the taxi companies could then draw down the costs from the Department. Such an initiative would not cost a fortune and would be workable. Its time has come. Many people in rural Ireland have free travel passes, but they do not have public or private transport. The time has come to look at a way of allowing them to use the scheme. The Minister mentioned an all-Ireland scheme. However, we are part of Europe. These travel passes should be allowed to be used across Europe. Europe is great for introducing rules and regulations for this country. The Minister should ensure that people from Ireland can use their free travel pass in any part of Europe. It is the least we can do for the elderly who have helped to build up the State. When people retire, they should be able to use their free travel pass across Europe. What will the Minister do in that regard?</P>

      <P>Other recommendations were made in the review. There were 12 priority recommendations of which eight have been implemented. They included companion passes and the extension of the scheme for people over 75 years of age and for those in receipt of carer's allowance. There has been a huge change in the free travel scheme <i>per se</i> and that has resulted in costs. Work is ongoing in the Department in terms of establishing a rational and transparent basis for reimbursing the suppliers of free travel services. Perhaps we could take into consideration the views expressed. One would have to provide for a hackney service because there are few taxis outside the main centres of population. One would have to consider the price, the number of vouchers issued etc. As that could be cumbersome, it was decided to consider a community fund to provide a community transport service which, in many ways, is similar to a taxi service. The free travel pass can also be used for essential services to allow people to travel within the main suburban areas. It costs &euro;46 million to provide the service to people who currently use the travel pass. I am concerned about expanding that in a more complicated way. Perhaps we could look at the proposals put forward by the Deputies in the context of the ongoing work on the recommendations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamPenrose" hpid="Mr. Penrose Mr. Penrose">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Penrose</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister reconsider the companion pass because some of the criteria are <Col N="20" /> restrictive? An older person often needs a young person to help him or her to get from one place to another.</P>
      <P>As regards Irish people in the UK who qualified for the pre-1955 pension, will the Minister give them the free travel pass as a start? These people built this country in the 1940s and 1950s. Many of them were given one way tickets and they now live in Camden Town, Cricklewood and other such places. Will we acknowledge their existence and give them the free travel pass? I compliment the Minister on the work she is doing in terms of the rural link initiative. It is worthwhile and it shows the Minister is aware of the concerns of rural people. The Minister should consider extending the free travel pass to Irish people in the UK. It would help some of them, who are elderly, to return to their native shores once or twice a year.</P>

      <P>I thank the Minister for her reply. Some 3.1% of the Department's staff are people with disabilities. I urge people to be strong on this issue because the target of many disability groups and parents is 4%. The figure for Dublin City Council is 4.3%. I encourage the Minister to examine examples of good practice.</P>
      <P>Are the Minister and her Department genuinely serious about supporting families? The Government has a responsibility to treat children and adults with disabilities with respect, dignity and equality.

      <P>As regards the employment of people with disabilities, the best way to deal with this issue is to introduce in the next couple of weeks a progressive disability Bill which will ensure that all people with disabilities can avail of services as a matter of right.

We are looking specifically at the employment of people with disabilities in my Department. We have reached the target, but we have also taken a proactive approach in supporting people with disabilities, considering issues appertaining to people with disabilities within the Department and trying to facilitate them as much as possible. The proactive response has been the appointment of a disability liaison officer within the Department to examine those issues. Given that it is the European Year of People with Disabilities, I will be proactive in supporting people with disabilities and ensuring access to proper employment.

      <P>My Department is committed to providing an efficient and speedy service to all its customers by ensuring that claims for its various schemes are processed and decided as expeditiously as possible having regard to the eligibility conditions which apply. My Department processes a large volume of claims and bearing in mind that each individual case has to be examined on its merits </P>
      <P>I am satisfied that, in the generality of cases, there is no undue delay on the part of my Department in processing such cases. The time taken to process individual claims varies significantly having regard to the difficulty in establishing the circumstances in each case. People claiming unemployment payments must provide evidence of identification and address and satisfy conditions that they are available for and genuinely seeking work.</P>
      <P>Failure to provide this information on time can result in a delay in processing a claim. In the case of unemployment assistance, it is necessary to carry out an assessment of the customer's means and this can involve a home visit. Investigations may also have to be carried out in the case of unemployment benefit where details of social insurance contributions have not been submitted by the employer.</P>
      <P>When a customer makes a claim, he or she is given as much information as possible regarding the processing of their claim. He or she is advised of additional documentation, if any, he or she needs to supply and whether further investigations are necessary to enable a decision to be made on his or her claim.</P>
      <P>Claim processing performance is monitored on an ongoing basis and staff are deployed as necessary to meet the requirements of fluctuating volumes of work. In addition, my Department has developed a system of performance standards to ensure that all claims are processed without undue or unnecessary delay and that the customer receives his or her payment at the earliest possible date. These standards are monitored on an ongoing basis. My staff examine processes on an ongoing basis to insure that all claim decisions are made as speedily as possible. A customer who is awaiting a decision on any social welfare claim and who is unable to meet his or her needs and those of his or her dependants may apply for supplementary welfare to the local community welfare officer.</P>

      <P>The Minister did not outline what steps, if any, she will take to fast-track the process but she might come back on that. The background to the question is that in the Dublin region 1,194 people have lost their jobs over the past two months. Gallaher's announced the loss of 200 jobs in my constituency earlier and <Col N="24" /> I look forward to hearing about what extra supports those people will be given by the Government.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanCroweSF" hpid="Mr. Crowe Mr. Crowe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crowe</NameTxt>
      <P>I am seeking ways to fast-track this process. I am aware of the process involved but during the waiting period on claims, people must make up the shortfall in income because they do not receive the full allowance from the community welfare officer. Many people go to moneylenders and so on as a result. I ask the Minister to examine the process to see if there is any way of fast-tracking applications and providing people with extra information.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan" hpid="Mary Coughlan Mary Coughlan">
      <NameTxt>Mary Coughlan</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to the job losses at Gallaher's in the Deputy's constituency, when the Department was advised that there might be job losses at the company, the local office was contacted and staff have been asked to interact with those who, unfortunately, lost their jobs and provide them with information. That will, I hope, fast-track the process.</P>
      <P>The Department's performance targets are high and the performance indicators vary between all the local offices. This can be attributed to repeat claims or lack of information. I am disappointed that people are not fully informed because the Department makes a great deal of information available. Information officers are also available in the offices and appointments can be made to see them. The Department funds the community information service, about which the Deputy will be aware. People are informed about their rights through the service and they are facilitated to make a more informed judgment.</P>
      <P>I agree there are delays, in certain circumstances, in processing claims. We have examined the performance targets and tried to establish at regional level where the bulk of claims emanate from so that resources can be moved from one place to another to address specific problems with UA or UB claims, for example. We have adopted a methodology to address the targets we want to meet. It is easier to do so in some regions than in others. The Department is a family friendly workplace and that can cause delays in processing claims.</P>
      <P>I examine claims performance at each Minister and management committee meeting to see where additional resources and supports are needed. The Deputy has alluded to particular circumstances and I would be more than happy to bring the concerns he has raised to the attention of the regional manager.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan" hpid="Mary Coughlan Mary Coughlan">
      <NameTxt>Mary Coughlan</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 87 and 115 together.</P>
      <P>There are currently three different weekly rates of child dependant allowances payable to social welfare recipients &ndash;&euro;16.80, &euro;19.30 and &euro;21.60, depending on the type of payment. Half rate CDA may also be paid in respect of a child in certain circumstances, for example where both of the child's parents are receiving a social welfare payment or where one parent has earnings over a prescribed amount. The gains from standardising the rates of allowances would have to be weighed against the costs. In this regard to standardise the three main rates of allowances at the highest rate of &euro;21.60 would mean that approximately 251,500 payments would be increased at a cost of approximately &euro;60 million annually.</P>
      <P>Since the publication of the report of the Commission on Social Welfare, which recommended a rationalisation of the rate of child dependant allowances, the number of different rates has been reduced from 36 to the current three. The policy direction followed by successive Governments however, has been to concentrate resources for child income support on the child benefit scheme which is neutral <i>vis-à-vis</i> the employment status of the parents and does not contribute to poverty traps. The loss of child dependant allowances by social welfare recipients on taking up employment can act as a disincentive to taking up available work opportunities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government's commitment in this regard is reflected in the substantial resources it has invested in the child benefit scheme since entering office, including the increases announced in budget 2003, which came into effect in April, adding &euro;104.84 million in a full year. Total expenditure on child benefit will reach &euro;1.9 billion when the current programme of multi-annual increases is complete. The substantial investment that the Government has made in the child benefit scheme in recent years has been of major benefit to families and a most effective use of the resources available for child income support. However, for families receiving social welfare payments, the combined value of their child <Col N="26" /> benefit and child dependant allowances has increased since 1998 at a rate which is more than double the rate of inflation for the period.</P>
    <P>In the recent partnership agreement, Sustaining Progress, the importance of child income support arrangements, including child dependant allowances, is recognised with a commitment to examine the effectiveness of current arrangements in ending child poverty. The question of further rationalisation of child dependant allowance will be a matter for consideration in a budgetary context and in the context of priorities generally.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelRing" hpid="Mr. Ring Mr. Ring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ring</NameTxt>
      <P>There are three rates of CDA and the difference between the top rate and the bottom rate is &euro;250 per year for a family in receipt of social welfare payments. That is a great deal of money for these families. What is the difference between one child and another? Why are there three rates? Under the Constitution, we are supposed to treat all children equally. The Minister is a mother and I am depending on her to deal with this issue immediately. The allowance should be paid at the top rate for all children, regardless of the cost because all children should be treated equally. Will the Minister consider referring the issue to the Equality Authority so that it can make a judgment? It is wrong to have three different rates for children. I ask the Minister to make sure the allowance is paid at the top rate of &euro;21.60 or more in the next budget. That type of anomaly should not exist within the social welfare system. The Minister should ensure that all children are treated equally. Perhaps she will consider asking the Equality Authority to make a judgment on it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan" hpid="Mary Coughlan Mary Coughlan">
      <NameTxt>Mary Coughlan</NameTxt>
      <P>When one looks at what has been achieved so far, huge improvements have been made. Previously, there were 36 rates of CDA and we now have three. Payments in that regard cost in the region of &euro;60 million. I agree all children should be treated equally. There is no one in this House who would disagree on that. One has to consider whether a policy direction on CDAs or child benefit is the best option.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan" hpid="Mary Coughlan Mary Coughlan">
      <NameTxt>Mary Coughlan</NameTxt>
      <P>We have seen a better return for investment through child benefit in that a person will remain entitled to it regardless of whether in employment. There is no point looking at it as a disincentive. A person's entitlement to an allowance is not guaranteed based on the number of children he or she has. The loss of an allowance can be detrimental and can create an additional poverty trap.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy asked how the Government intends to deal with these issues. If I had an additional &euro;60 million I would gladly address this, and all the other issues which Opposition Deputies want dealt with. All child income sup<Col N="27" /> port will be taken into consideration as part of the new agreement. That issue will have to be progressed. There have been huge changes as a consequence of previous agreements. We will take Members' views into consideration.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan" hpid="Mary Coughlan Mary Coughlan">
      <NameTxt>Mary Coughlan</NameTxt>
      <P>Government policy on equality of treatment has been to increase child benefit, which is more beneficial in addressing child poverty issues. That view may change following analysis of all child income supports. It is currently considered best, in the context of the resources available, to put those resources into child benefit. I have made changes to CDAs in relation to children over 16 years of age who were not entitled to short-term payments if in third level education. That change recognises the need for a continuum for children in third level. Changes are being made and we will progress them over the next couple of years. It was felt at the time a decision had to be made, that access to CDAs by those aged 16 to 22 in third level education was a particular area of difficulty and that the resources would be best applied there.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamPenrose" hpid="Mr. Penrose Mr. Penrose">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Penrose</NameTxt>
      <P>Does any real explanation exist for the breaking down of the child dependant allowance into three categories? Will the Minister tell the House the number of people in receipt of each of the payments, &euro;16.80; &euro;19.30 and &euro;21.60, and how many people fall into the split category?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan" hpid="Mary Coughlan Mary Coughlan">
      <NameTxt>Mary Coughlan</NameTxt>
      <P>There are 116,000 people in receipt of &euro;16.80; 136,500 in receipt of &euro;19.30 and 24,000 in receipt of &euro;21.60. Those figures relate to people in receipt of widows-widowers contributory benefit, survivor benefits and deserted wife's benefit. Those in receipt of short-term payments are paid &euro;16.80.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DanBoyle" hpid="Mr. Boyle Mr. Boyle">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boyle</NameTxt>
      <P>People in receipt of the third category of payment could be called &ldquo;parents of lesser children&rdquo;. The Minister referred to the recent budget increase in child benefit. If, even <Col N="28" /> adding the &euro;60 million referred to, child dependant allowances were increased the Minister would still fall short of her commitment in relation to child benefit for this year. The Government is merely adding to its list of unfulfilled promises in regard to child benefit and child dependant allowances.</P>
      <P>On the three categories, the mathematics provided by the Minister has been the difference between the lower and higher payments multiplied by the number of payments. Has the Department undertaken a study of the savings made from the needless bureaucracy of dividing children into these categories?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan" hpid="Mary Coughlan Mary Coughlan">
      <NameTxt>Mary Coughlan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Department always looks at ways of making savings. If we ever came up with savings of &euro;60 million, serious questions would have to be asked. Greater differentials existed heretofore. In reply, I will use a phrase once used by the Deputy when he said &ldquo;You would say that wouldn't you&rdquo;. We will achieve our child benefit targets over the next three years. We provided more than &euro;100 million this year and will provide the same amount next year and the following year resulting in a substantial investment in child benefit. That has been the best use of resources in supporting children and in addressing the issue of child poverty. Providing &euro;60 million for CDAs this year would have left only &euro;40 million or so for child benefit. Child benefit is, in my opinion, the best way to go. We will review CDAs in tandem with all other child income supports. We look forward to the deliberations of the partnerships following publication of our proposals in that regard.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mary Coughlan</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 88 and 434 together.</P>
      <P>Deputy Ryan's question relates in particular to the operation of the treatment benefit scheme which provides a range of benefits in the areas of dental, optical and aural treatment for qualified PRSI contributors and their dependant spouses. The PRSI contributions which are reckonable for treatment benefit are classes A, E, H and P. The PRSI contribution conditions relating to entitlement to these benefits vary depending on the age of the insured person.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Persons aged under 21 must have at least 39 contributions paid since first starting work to qualify. Persons aged from 21 to 24 must, in addition to that, have at least 39 weeks' contri<Col N="29" /> butions paid or credited in the relevant tax year. In the case of persons aged over 25 the requirement is that they have at least 260 PRSI contributions paid since first starting work and 39 paid or credited in the relevant tax year. These qualifying conditions are necessary to ensure the continuing viability of the scheme while directing available resources towards those in greatest need, including dependant spouses of insured workers. They are also designed to ensure a realistic relationship between entitlement to benefit and a continuing or recent attachment to the workforce through an active PRSI contribution record.</P>
    <P>I have no plans at present to change the current qualifying conditions of the treatment benefit scheme. A review of the dental benefit scheme in consultation with the Irish Dental Association is shortly to be undertaken and the existing conditions of entitlement will be reviewed in that context. Any changes to the qualifying conditions would, however, have financial implications and would have to be considered in a budgetary context.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanBoyle" hpid="Mr. Boyle Mr. Boyle">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boyle</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister not accept that the current system in relation to the 39 week rule is arbitrary and crude and discriminates against a certain category of younger people who engage in third level education for longer than average periods and are thereby coming into the formal workforce at age 25 or 26? Will she consider introducing proportionate payments for those who make 80% or 90% of the required contributions? Many of us meet people in our constituency offices who fall one, two or three weeks short in all of these categories&mdash;</P>

      <P>B'fhéidir go mbeidh sé níos fusa trí Ghaeilge, tá sí níos gaiste. I appreciate what the Deputy is saying about people who might be 25 or 26 before they complete their third level education, but as he knows, once people are under 21 they get 39 weeks from the Department as a contribution to get them started. In the main, many of these young people would actually have reached the number of contributions by the time they reach that age through part-time work. Many people, sometimes to the detriment of their education, are now actually working and obtaining a contribution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I know exactly what the Deputy is saying about apportionment but, no more than any other scheme, once a base is set we will always have people three or four stamps above or below the line. We are certainly looking at the review of the <Col N="30" /> dental benefits scheme in particular, which seems to be the scheme used most, and perhaps we will look at something like apportionment in that context. However, I would see difficulties in setting up apportionment at the moment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PadraicMcCormack" hpid="Mr. McCormack Mr. McCormack">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCormack</NameTxt>
      <P>It would appear from the way the scheme is administered that the people who fall short in their contributions are really subsidising the people who eventually get their contributions. It is not fair if somebody is only two or three contributions short that a sliding scale is not introduced to cover the benefit to that person, particularly in relation to dental benefit. Often, dental work carried out at an early stage can save a lot of expense later on. I ask the Minister to seriously consider a sliding scale whereby the people who do not reach the required contributions would not subsidise the people who do qualify.</P>

      <P>Regarding the recent dental dispute, has the Department made a decision in relation to people who were out of pocket? Is it going to pay back these people? Are there many applications from people who have actually used the service, paid good money and are now trying to reclaim the money from the Department?</P>

      <P>I agree with the Leas-Cheann Comhairle that it is a separate question. No matter what scheme we have there will be always be a situation or circumstances where an insured person will lose out because of contributions. A sliding scale can be examined but would be difficult to implement. This is an area where we support young people by giving them the additional weeks in order to get them started and make them eligible for the scheme. There is always a cut-off point. At the moment it is 25, up to the age of 65. If there were reasons to review that, and we are reviewing the dental benefit scheme in particular through an independent chair, we certainly will look at both additional service provision and eligibility criteria. In truth, it would be difficult at the moment to change or review the eligibility criteria but the possible development of this concept could be examined.</P>

      <P>I am aware of these views and, in fact, I spoke at the same conference, which was held recently by the World Pension Association in co-operation with the Irish Association of Pension Funds. Many issues were discussed at this conference in relation to pensions systems both at the broad macro and at the more detailed level.</P>
      <P>Pensions are an international issue and most countries in the developed world face the same challenges going forward as to how to provide pensions that are both adequate and sustainable in a context where our populations are ageing fast. Overall, the combined effect of large numbers reaching retirement age and increasing life expectancy will be a doubling of the old age dependency ratio. In 2000, the over 65s were equivalent to about one quarter of the working age population in the EU; by 2050 this is projected to rise to nearly 50%.</P>
      <P>Ireland stands out from other EU countries in that just over 11% of our population are over age 65. This does not mean that we will be exempt from the difficulties faced by other countries. Ireland faces the same challenges, the only difference being that these appear later. The future of national pensions systems has been the focus of an in-depth analysis at EU level over the past year or so through what is known as the &ldquo;open method of co-ordination&rdquo;. Under this process, agreed objectives in the area of adequacy, financial sustainability and modernisation were set out. The aim is that member states learn from each other while remaining free to develop their pensions systems in accordance with their own traditions, values and priorities.</P>
      <P>As part of the EU process, we have presented a clear strategy to achieve the common goals of adequacy, sustainability and modernisation which was well received by the EU. Our overall strategy for the future in the area of adequacy includes a continuation of our policy of significant increases in State pensions and increasing the number of people with supplementary pensions cover from its current level of about 50% to 70% of those at work aged over 30.</P>
      <P>In relation to ensuring the sustainability of our system, the Deputy will be aware that the Government has set up the national pensions reserve fund which will be available to part-fund pension expenditure from 2025. A high level of workforce participation among all sectors of society is also an important element of any policy to ensure the sustainability of our pensions systems. In this regard workforce participation of older people in Ireland is above the EU average and very close to EU targets set for 2010.</P>
      <P>Overall, the EU considered that Ireland had made good progress in ensuring the financial sustainability of our pensions system while at the same time increasing the level of our pensions.</P>
      <P>Pensions will remain an important issue for this country, and the EU as a whole, and it will be necessary to monitor closely the situation on an ongoing basis in the years ahead.</P>

      <P>I thank the Minister for her comprehensive reply. I think she is aware that Mr. Richard Hinz, a World Bank adviser, indicated at the World Pension Association conference that the extent of demographic changes would mean that in some countries &ndash; probably not our own but we nevertheless have to take cognisance of European and world events &ndash; pensions would have to decrease by 50% or the retirement age would have to increase by about ten years to make the current systems financially viable in the long term.</P>
      <P>The Minister has stated that the proportion of the EU population over the age of 65 will almost double between the years 2000 and 2050. This obviously raises questions about the sustainability of existing state pension funds. Would the Minister agree that although we have a younger population, we are not immune, isolated or cocooned from those events and demographic trends that will certainly impinge upon the sustainability of pensions? Does it give the Minister cause for concern that Irish managed pension funds sustained significant losses in 2002 &ndash; I think they were in the region of about 18% or 19% &ndash; and we have been subject to volatility in the pensions market for the past three years or so?</P>
      <P>Is the Minister satisfied that the national pensions reserve fund, which her Government set up to pre-fund State and public service pensions from 2025, will continue to invest heavily in equities despite the losses over the past number of years? We need a huge level of worker participation and contributions to make the PRSA system work. Is the Minister satisfied that in this environment we will get the level of participation which is so vital to ensure the sustainability into the future about which we speak?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mary Coughlan</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree that every Minister with the same responsibilities as I will be very concerned about the issue of pensions. Luckily, we are not in the same position as our colleagues in Germany or Sweden, where very difficult decisions have had to be taken. On that basis, we learn from those who have to take action before us because we are very much at an early stage when it comes to pension provision. We are not immune from any of that market volatility either, and the management of the national pension fund saw a loss of 18.9%. I am happy with the way in which pensions are being managed at present through the pensions board. This House gave the board flexibility to look at how the fund is managed. These are long-term provisions but we have taken short-term action to address the failure of pension funds to mature here as compared to other parts of the EU. Through the open method of co-ordination, we have learned a lot from what other countries have done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The actuarial review has indicated the timescale within which we must address those concerns. That is why we introduced the national pension reserve fund and PRSAs. If we are not happy with the performance of PRSAs, which is <Col N="33" /> good at present, we may have to look at other issues. While I am happy at present, I am very aware of the concerns that exist about pensions, as is my colleague, the Minister for Finance.</P>

      <Quest>the measures she intends taking to improve incentives for people with disability to take up paid employment, whereby such take-up does not bring about a reduction in living standards through the removal of secondary benefits.</Quest>

    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan" hpid="Mary Coughlan Mary Coughlan">
      <NameTxt>Mary Coughlan</NameTxt>
      <P>The potential disincentive effects of the loss of secondary benefits, such as the medical card, fuel allowances, rent and mortgage supplements etc. for those who wish to move from social welfare dependency back into employment has been a cause of concern for a number of years. These benefits are administered by a number of Departments and agencies, including mine, and a range of measures has been introduced to mitigate the problems, including the retention of some secondary benefits in full or on a sliding scale for a number of years following the commencement of employment.</P>
      <P>My Department provides a range of supports aimed at encouraging and assisting people on disability and illness payments to identify and take up available employment, training and other self-development opportunities, where appropriate. For instance, under the back to work scheme, people with disabilities and long-term illnesses can retain their social welfare payments on a sliding scale for three years if they take up full-time employment or four years if they take up self-employment.</P>
      <P>Where people avail of these employment supports, the associated secondary benefits can be retained for the duration of the payment. It is estimated that there are in the region of 13,600 people in receipt of the various illness and disability payments who are availing of these employment supports.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Despite the improvements, which have been made in this area, I recognise there are still some problems in the operation of these supports, such as the fact that the existing arrangements may not be fully suitable for people with a partial incapacity. In this regard, my Department is undertaking a review of the various income maintenance payments for people who are ill and people with disabilities, as part of its programme of expenditure reviews. One of the key elements of this study is to examine the extent to which the illness and disability payment schemes support self-sufficiency and incentives to move into work, training or rehabilitation. The review, which is nearing completion, will be important in informing future policy development in this area. This is a complex area but I am confident that measures can be put in place to improve the situa<Col N="34" /> tion for people with disabilities who want to participate in the active workforce.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanBoyle" hpid="Mr. Boyle Mr. Boyle">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boyle</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for her reply. Does the Minister accept that unemployment among people with disabilities is in the region of 80% and their uptake of full-time paid employment is hindered by the lack of ongoing supports, which seem to be available to other people in society? The need to retain secondary benefits, particularly health benefits, is greater among people with disabilities. Will the Minister initiate a wide-ranging review involving the agencies and NGOs that work in the area of disability to overcome the very real problems for people with disabilities entering the employment market and to overcome the continuing barriers, which unfortunately still exist, concerning the provision of certain payments in her Department?</P>

      <P>I welcome the fact that the Department of Social and Family Affairs is carrying out a review of this matter. Taking up work again often provides rehabilitation for people with disabilities, particularly those with mental disabilities or depression. As part of her review the Minister should seriously consider allowing those people to at least retain their benefits in a similar manner to the three-year back to work scheme.</P>

      <P>The working group will complete its work very soon and we will be able to publish its report and consider what our policy should be. I agree that access to employment and training is very important. We have some excellent initiatives on access to education through partnership with the employment agencies. IBEC has looked at employing people with disabilities and addressing the concerns there. It has decided to set up a fund with the county enterprise boards to encourage entrepreneurship for people who are disabled.</P>
      <P>We are considering how people in receipt of some of our allowances can access proper training. There are programmes that are working very well. Pilots have taken place under the employment support services. These are new initiatives, which will provide greater access to employment. The working group is specifically looking at issues of secondary benefit. Despite what the Deputies might say about me, when we looked at any scheme this year those who were less well off and in particular those in receipt of disability allowances and illness payments were targeted for extra support and were not taken out of any of the existing schemes. There has been no change in access to those for people with disabilities.</P>

      <P>I welcome the Progressive Democrats to the list of parties opposed to the re-introduction of third level fees. While this explosion of opposition is very welcome, I wonder where that party was when registration fees were increased by 69% and when the schools building programme descended into chaos. As the Taoiseach has given his backing to the Minister for Education and Science, Fianna Fáil is now the only party in the House that is a proponent of the re-introduction of third level fees. Leaked reports indicate that these fees might be in the order of &euro;8,000 per student. The Taoiseach has given his backing to the Fianna Fáil Minister for Education and Science on this. One Minister of State supports fees for those earning more than &euro;75,000.</P>
      <P>The parents of 50,000 students starting their leaving certificate exams in the next few weeks are under a cloud of uncertainty as to whether this will happen and whether they will have access to a third level college when this is over. In the middle of this unseemly row we are told that the Government parties have not even discussed this matter. They have not been briefed either officially or unofficially and there has been no discussion about the matter at Cabinet despite the fact that the dogs in the street are talking about it. On television programmes, both parties fight about this issue publicly.</P>
      <P>This is a matter of the gravest concern to thousands of parents and students. The time has come to put an end to this matter. Will the Taoiseach put an end to this charade and the associated speculation? Will he come clean on the issue and tell the people that the Government has no intention of re-introducing third level fees and that it will abandon this proposal forthwith?</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>While I do not have much to add to what I said last week, I will repeat a few matters. No decision has been taken to re-introduce fees for third level education. The review, <Col N="37" /> which the Minister has been undertaking into access to and funding of third level education, is not merely about one matter. That is almost complete. The Minister will bring the matter before Government shortly and we will discuss it. There is no proposal before Government yet. As in all reviews or examinations, a Minister carries out the work within his or her Department, presents it to the Cabinet and circulates it to Departments, Ministers give their views and then there is a discussion and a decision. The process is always the same.</P>
      <P>During last year the Department of Education and Science spent a total of &euro;380 million on third level student support. Free third level fees cost &euro;240 million last year and the balance was spent on maintenance grants for qualifying students. The Minister for Education and Science asked his Department to undertake a full review of this expenditure programme to assess its effectiveness. That is going on. He is looking at public spending under his Department's various programmes. The abolition of tuition fees did not achieve the stated aim of assisting those from lower socio-economic backgrounds. As we know and as the Minister has said, the proportion of people from low socio-economic groups at higher education is only one fifth of what it is in the higher socio-economic groups. The Minister is, of course, conscious that examinations are coming up and that people are doing examinations who will be going to third level next year. As I stated last week and as the Minister has said, the vast majority of people on normal incomes will not be affected one way or the other, regardless of what the Minister brings forward. When the Minister brings forward his proposals and the Cabinet has dealt with them, an announcement will be made in the normal way.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny" hpid="Mr. Kenny Mr. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach has again refused to answer the question. The rainbow Government abolished third level fees. I had the honour of being a member of that Government. They were abolished to reduce economic pressure on parents and guardians of students and to open up greater access to third level education for those from disadvantaged areas. Fine Gael, the Labour Party, Sinn Féin, the Green Party, the Independents, the Progressive Democrats and a significant element of the Taoiseach's party are opposed to this measure. This means that the Taoiseach and the Minister for Education and Science are the main proponents of this revenue-generating scheme and that this is a Government of broken promises and panic.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In view of the concern and anxiety of thousands of students who are due to sit the leaving certificate in a few weeks time, and their parents, as well as those who are currently in the system, will the Taoiseach tell the House and the people that the Government has no intention of reintroducing third level fees, irrespective of what the Minister for Education and Science brings forward and that he will, at least, bring about a situa<Col N="38" /> tion where equality of opportunity applies in a free education system?

The Taoiseach is the leader of the Government. Can he put an end to the unseemly public debate and squabbling between Ministers and among his own party? What is the truth of the situation? Are we going to have the reintroduction of third level fees or not?</P>

Is there any truth in the leak to <i>The Irish Times </i>yesterday? Are fees going to be introduced at approximately &euro;8,000 or &euro;4,000? It is important that the Taoiseach, as Head of Government, puts an end to this uncertainty so that people know where they stand and so that students may sit their examinations free from anxiety that ought not impede their progress in those examinations.

I wish the House was as concerned about people who will be doing their leaving certificate this year and who, under present arrangements, have no opportunity to access third level education. As we know, 97% of the children of people in higher managerial groups attend third level and the corresponding figures for the lower socio-economic groups is 21%.

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister for Education and Science has, for some months, been examining the &euro;380 million that is, at present, being spent on supports for third level students. The free fees element of that is &euro;240 million. The Minister is looking at that. He has examined what has happened in other countries, he has looked at a range of proposals and he will bring forward proposals. When those proposals are brought forward everyone is entitled to express a view in every political party, including my own, on what they would like to see. The Minister will take all of that into account&mdash;</P>

      <P>Is it the Taoiseach's view that only people earning an income in excess of several hundred thousand euro ought to be subject to a fee, if reintroduced? Has he figures for the number of taxpayers paying more than &euro;100,000 or &euro;150,000, not to mention several hundred thousands, and how many of them would be likely to have students in third level education? What is the Government's position in a country <Col N="40" /> where, if one puts one's money into an SSIA one attracts a 25% bonus, if one puts it into a holiday home one gets tax relief, if one buys a stallion one does not have to pay any tax, but if one puts one's children into third level education this Government screws one?</P>
      <P>What is the attitude of the Government on a fundamental question in a modern economy that requires the skills honed in third level education in order to maintain its economic potential for the future? Is the Government going to reintroduce fees or not? What is the Taoiseach's view? We know the views of the Minister for Education and Science, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, the Tánaiste and the Minister of State at the Department of the Environment and Local Government, Deputy Noel Ahern. We know the views of would-be Minister, Deputy Batt O'Keeffe, and the views of a clutch of dissatisfied backbenchers. Does the Taoiseach have a view on this?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Taoiseach is saying some people have too much money then obviously there are other ways to collect the excess. Will he answer some of those in very dilapidated schools? According to his list, he is planning to help them. Is he aware that many of the schools on the list, which is published in today's <i>Irish Independent,</i> thought they were already on the list and were going to get their improvements anyway? Is there a letter to be sent by the Department stating that the plans which were in place were undone and have now been put in place again? Many of those schools did not realise they were off the list and it is a surprise to them to see they are now mentioned in the newspapers as being restored to that list. What game is being played by the Department to give the impression it is caving into pressure and realising there is a need here which they did not recognise before?</P>
      <P>I am surprised the Taoiseach is not more active on this issue as I see him in various schools as often as I see him here. Is he saying he was not aware of the rat-infested prefabs used by schools and that he has been visiting only solid structures? Where is the new information coming from which has given rise to the new plan for schools we see on the website?</P>
      <P>Will the Taoiseach cease using terms of self-congratulation about spending &euro;343 million on schools building projects? To put it in context, that sum is approximately one quarter of the annual emissions trading charge that will be levied on Ireland after 2008 due to our failure to come to grips with climate change. If the Taoiseach can only spend one quarter of that charge on schools, it will be a sorry day when we have to face up to our responsibilities under international obligations. He cannot give money to schools now, before we start paying the price for our failure to deal with international problems.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Department of Education and Science set out the comprehensive list of schools, which the House has sought for some time, under all categories and stages back in January. The list to which Deputy Sargent refers is an update of the schools building programme and the changes are reflected in the details available on the Department's website. At the launch of the programme it was stated that the information would be updated regularly and the published programme clearly identified a contingency sum. That sum was required for accommodation, health and safety works and other urgent work which arose during the school year. The schools were listed on the website yesterday following that examination and details were published and sent out to the schools yesterday &ndash; individual primary and post-primary schools where approval had been given in respect of emergency works, health and safety works and temporary accommodation. These additional projects are typically small scale rather than large scale capital projects and relate mainly to temporary accommodation. The total number of schools involved is 122, 113 <Col N="42" /> primary and nine post-primary schools, and the changes are highlighted and listed in sections 11 to 13 of the website.</P>
      <P>There is also a programme involving a list of 20 schools for new pilot initiatives, where grants will be paid to the boards of management to provide maximum flexibility to respond to their accommodation needs. The schools selected were in need of accommodation as a matter of urgency and the pilot initiative is aimed at reducing the amount of temporary accommodation in schools.</P>
      <P>It is not a question of congratulatory sentiments about the hundreds of schools on the programmes of the past few years. Substantial resources have been provided compared to the paltry sums paid a few years ago.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent" hpid="Mr. Sargent Mr. Sargent">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
      <P>That was almost self-congratulatory from the Taoiseach although he tried to hold himself back. He must admit that the Government lied to the people before the last election by sending out letters promising improvements to local schools only for the new Minister to say, in essence, that those were daydreams from the previous Minister and that he cannot accept responsibility. Does the Taoiseach agree that this update will beg the question of how regularly we will receive updates of the school building programme? Will this updated programme be enacted within a certain timeframe or is it just another wish list which will never see the light of day? Are the Taoiseach's officials being listened to when they say that if they had an idea of the building projects required and if there was clarity of funding over the next four to five years, then they could get much better value for money? The funds we allocate to primary and secondary education are quite paltry in comparison with other countries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with multi-annual programmes and they are being examined in regard to education; annual programmes involve too many stops and starts. We have a capital programme in education worth several hundred million euro &ndash; in comparison with the &euro;13 million being spent a few years ago &ndash; which will allow us to do so. I reject Deputy Sargent's comments on last year's programme. The budget provision for primary school capital programmes was &euro;153.6 million, five times greater than it was a few years ago. The then Minister, Deputy Woods, secured an additional &euro;19 million from Department savings and from other Departments for the primary schools budget. That gave a revised total of &euro;173 million, an unprecedented level of investment. All that money was spent although a few schools were not in a position to take up the resources so the funds went to other schools.</P>

      <P>No, there were planning issues in some cases. The money was moved to other schools, which were upgraded, and all the <Col N="43" /> resources were spent. The then Minister achieved a record level of expenditure of &euro;173 million.</P>

The gynaecological and maternity units at Louth County Hospital were closed two years ago and the children's ward was closed some years previously.

    </Speaker>
    <P>This Bill provides for the establishment on a statutory basis of a body to be known as Science Foundation Ireland. The new body will be an agency of Forfás. The establishment of the foundation is central to an overall strategy which will <Col N="59" /> see Ireland as a leader in the global knowledge-based economy. There is a broad consensus at all levels of society for creating a knowledge-driven economy and it is widely accepted that by investing in excellence in basic research, Ireland is investing in future social and economic growth and industrial development. Central to the vision of Ireland as a country driving technological change is Science Foundation Ireland.</P>
    <P>Ireland's emergence as Europe's high-growth economy has been a feature of the last decade. We have experienced a substantial expansion of our industrial base. Indeed, 750,000 more people are working in the country now than was the case ten years ago. To build on the progress made and to ensure a continuing expansion of our economy, our policy has been modified to give increased priority to research and development as a means of ensuring the economy's continued growth and success. Ireland can no longer compete on a low cost basis with other cheaper economies around the world. The Irish economy must compete on skills and innovation.</P>
    <P>Ireland's sustained economic growth and prosperity will depend upon establishing a culture of scientific and technological innovation, a high level of research and development, and a globally-competitive, knowledge-based economy. Such re-positioning is essential to provide sustainable, high quality, well paid jobs in Ireland.</P>
    <P>Science, technology, research and innovation are the key words of the future. We must build the structures which support research excellence. We must enhance our ability to compete at the pinnacle of knowledge and produce the people through our education system who will take on the new challenges. A cornerstone of this future is building our research capability in our universities, institutes and enterprises, in essence, the research infrastructure which will make it possible.</P>
    <P>The process leading to the establishment of Science Foundation Ireland started in 1998 when a major technology foresight initiative was carried out by the Irish Council for Science, Technology and Innovation. The aim of the technology foresight exercise was to identify the technologies that will be key to our national future economic and social development and to propose the actions needed to foster our capabilities in these technologies. A key feature of the initiative was that it involved a wide range of consultation with key industrialists, academics, senior civil servants and other interested parties in an attempt to develop a consensus on the actions required to foster technological development.</P>
    <P>The technology foresight report identified a need for a substantial increase in national capability in niche areas of information and communications technology &ndash; ICT &ndash; and biotechnology. These technologies were identified as representing, for the future, the engines of growth in the global economy. The technology foresight report recommended the establishment of a fund <Col N="60" /> to invest in research in those key areas of technology and recognised that, in order to achieve this outcome, a qualitative shift of industrial policy would be required. This would also have to be accompanied by a significant increase in the level of resources allocated to investment in research which would achieve the excellence and critical mass needed to give Ireland an international reputation in the specified technological sectors.</P>
    <P>In February 2000, the Government approved the establishment of the technology foresight fund, from which &euro;646 million is being used over the period of the national development plan to support research excellence in strategic technologies, particularly the development of world-class capabilities in the niche areas of ICT and biotechnology. The Government also approved the establishment of a national strategic research foundation, Science Foundation Ireland, as a mechanism for the management of this expenditure from the fund.</P>
    <P>To allow the foundation to commence operations almost immediately, the Government then agreed that it could be established under the existing Industrial Development Acts as a sub-board of Forfás. The purpose of this Bill is to establish the foundation as a separate legal entity. Science Foundation Ireland will invest in funding research that is of intrinsic excellence and acknowledged internationally, is of a sufficient scale and critical mass to have real significance in Ireland and internationally, and strengthens the scientific foundations on which to develop high-productivity, high-technology, market-driven, knowledge-intensive investments, including start-ups, in Ireland's industrial and services sectors.</P>
    <P>As recommended in the technology foresight report, the foundation will concentrate on the fields underpinning the industrial sectors of biotechnology and ICT with a view to promoting and supporting basic research of world-class stature in these fields. A world-class research capability in selected segments of these two enabling technologies will become an essential foundation for future growth in our economy.</P>
    <P>ICT involves all disciplines that underpin the study of physical components, systems, networks, storage, transmission, software and applications, as well as the underlying fields of mathematics, computer science, physics, chemistry, materials science and electrical engineering. ICT is at the core of the knowledge society, as scientific and engineering research today requires the use of systems and processes that ICT research has produced. New breakthrough technologies will be required to continue the progress made in electronics technology that we have experienced in the last 50 years. These advances will be of profound significance to the microelectronics and semiconductor industries in the future. If Ireland is to compete in this era of rapid development of ICT products and services, appropriate state-of-the-art infrastructure must be put in place.</P>
    <P>Agencies such as IDA Ireland and Enterprise Ireland have already helped give the country a <Col N="61" /> global reputation as a major competitor for ICT industrial investment. This sector has been developing steadily over 30 years through substantial investment by Government and by the world's leading ICT companies. Today it is one of the most important sectors in the Irish economy and a key engine of growth. By building a globally-renowned research base, focusing on the fields that underpin ICT, our economy can build on the relationships it has already formed with this industry. It could also play a competitive role in defining and shaping economic activity and technological advancements worldwide. This represents a truly significant opportunity but also a threat. If we miss it, we will face the possibility of being left behind as the 21st century progresses.</P>
    <P>Ireland's research institutions are involved in most of the key research areas in ICT, including some engaged in globally-distinguished research. However, we must focus on developing ICT research programmes in areas that can compete on a global scale. Doing so will require the formation of outstanding research centres as well as the recruitment and development of critical masses of research talent.</P>
    <P>In seeking to establish a dynamic, competitive, knowledge-based economy, characterised by a high skill base and high added value, biotechnology will reveal more knowledge in the coming decades than all other technologies combined. Biotechnology includes areas such as gene expression, protein synthesis and characterisation, DNA chips, genomics, biosensors, drug delivery and bioremediation. This research will affect health care, pharmaceuticals, environmental management, agriculture, marine science, medical devices, consumer goods and food and drink businesses.</P>
    <P>One example of the possibilities offered by world-class research in even one area within the biotechnology area would be the new techniques for studying incredibly small-scale phenomena that are being developed at present. Efforts in this area will provide a detailed understanding of the structure and behaviour of biological systems, such as cell membranes. Innovative research in this area could lead, for instance, to the development of new drug delivery systems that could advance the treatment of disease.</P>
    <P>The industries most affected by biotechnology &ndash; pharmaceuticals, chemicals, agri-food and medical devices &ndash; have contributed significantly to industrial development in Ireland over the past 20 years and have the potential to continue to do so. Ireland is home, for example, to the operational bases of nine of the top ten largest pharmaceutical companies in the world. This situation links Ireland closely to an industrial culture that is among the leaders of the knowledge revolution. Combined with the recent emergence of indigenous biotechnology start-up companies, such relationships give Ireland a crucial opportunity to prove itself a successful innovator and knowledge generator.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="62" />Biotechnology will play a pivotal role in social and industrial advancement over the next 20 years. With its strong base in the relevant industrial sectors and with its existing, though small, research capabilities in some aspects of biotechnology, Ireland is in a good position to participate in the next phase of the biotechnological revolution.</P>
    <P>The foundation will review its focus in both biotechnology and ICT regularly to seek out the most promising opportunities. Through investments in these areas, the foundation offers the possibility of significantly enhancing Irish science, engineering and economic growth and becoming a vital partner in building a research system recognised and distinguished around the world for its excellence.</P>
    <P>The greatest challenge facing Ireland's research and development goals is building its most important resource, the human talent that drives discovery, innovation and prosperity. SFI will help Ireland diversify and grow its economy through recruiting and retaining creative individuals with advanced research experience in areas critical to the development of a knowledge-based economy. These leading research scientists and engineers will bring their skills to Ireland and thereby augment this country's skills portfolio. They will also train new generations of talent which will contribute to making this economy even more attractive to the industries that will increasingly need their scarce resources.</P>
    <P>Since its establishment as a sub-board of Forfás in 2000, the foundation has introduced a range of policies and established five key programmes: the SFI fellow awards; investigator programme grants; centres for science, engineering and technology grants; ETS Walton visitor awards; and SFI workshop and conference grants. It has already recruited and retained the expertise of approximately 93 research scientists and engineers, and their teams, for a total investment commitment of &euro;161 million. The foundation has also recently made an additional investment of &euro;42 million in three new world-class research centres for science, engineering and technology that will build top-class research teams between academia and industry.</P>
    <P>Science Foundation Ireland offers the prospect of acting as a catalyst for Ireland's future economic and social transformation into a knowledge economy in the same way that Enterprise Ireland and IDA Ireland helped to support the development of our economy to its current level. Establishing the foundation on a statutory basis is essential if we are to sustain this transformation, a transformation that, if attained and exploited, will yield untold benefits for future generations of Irish society.</P>
    <P>I will now outline briefly the provisions of the Bill. As I indicated earlier, the main purpose of the Bill is to provide for the establishment of Science Foundation Ireland as an agency of Forfás. The Bill also provides for amendments to the Industrial Development Acts 1986 to 1998 and <Col N="63" /> the Shannon Free Airport Development Company (Amendment) Act 1986. These amendments arise out of the establishment of the foundation as an agency of Forfás and also the necessity to update certain financial limits.</P>
    <P>Part 1 contains standard provisions relating to the Short Title, collective citation, interpretations, establishment day, expenses and procedure for making regulations. Part 2 deals with the establishment of Science Foundation Ireland.</P>
    <P>Section 6 provides for the establishment of the foundation as a corporate body and an agency of Forfás. In that regard, the foundation will come within the policy and co-ordination remit of Forfás and its powers have been extended to allow for this in section 34.</P>
    <P>Section 7 sets out the functions of the foundation. The foundation will promote, develop and assist the carrying out of oriented basic research in strategic areas of scientific endeavour that concern the future development and competitiveness of industry and enterprise in Ireland. These strategic areas include information and communication technologies and biotechnology.</P>
    <P>Sections 8 to 12 provide for the board, its composition, chairperson and meeting arrangements. Sections 13 and 14 cover the appointment of the director general and include a provision requiring the director general to be accountable to the Committee of Public Accounts and other Oireachtas committees. Sections 15 to 18 are standard provisions on disclosure of interests, disclosure of information and provision of a seal.</P>
    <P>Sections 19 to 21 are staffing provisions. Under the terms of the Industrial Development Act 1993, as amended by the Industrial Development (Enterprise Ireland) Act 1998, Forfás is the overall employer of both its own staff and staff of Enterprise Ireland and the IDA. It is proposed to retain this approach for Science Foundation Ireland; that is to say that staff will be employed by Forfás and seconded to Science Foundation Ireland. However, provision is also being made to allow the foundation assume the role of employer should this prove necessary at some future date.</P>
    <P>Section 22 allows the foundation to engage consultants and advisers and section 23 obliges the foundation to prepare strategy statements and work programmes. Section 24 provides for an annual report and also requires that accounts are submitted to the Comptroller and Auditor General for audit. Section 25 provides that the foundation shall provide the Minister and Forfás with any information they may require and section 26 provides that the foundation may build, purchase or lease land or buildings required for its functions.</P>
    <P>Part 3 amends the Industrial Development Acts 1986 to 1998 and the Shannon Free Airport Development Company (Amendment) Act 1986.</P>
    <P>Provision for the raising of existing legislative thresholds on the aggregate amount of grants to Forfás and its agencies to Shannon Development and to the county enterprise boards, respectively, <Col N="64" /> for use in discharging their obligations and liabilities is made in sections 33, 34(<i>e</i>) and 35. The increase is necessary because the bodies in question are now nearing the existing statutory limit in respect of the total amount of moneys which may be granted to the bodies for the exercise of their functions.</P>
    <P>Provision is made for the raising of threshold levels in the 1986 Act in respect of various industrial incentive instruments, above which Government approval is required for the agency concerned to proceed with payments to individual industrial projects. The existing thresholds were set in 1998 and, taking inflation into account, have resulted in a significant increase in the number of projects which require Government approval. The threshold for capital grants is raised in section 34(<i>f</i>), the threshold for employment grants is raised in section 28, the threshold for equity provision is raised in section 31, the aggregate threshold for all investment aid is revised and raised in section 32, the threshold for training grants is raised in section 29 and the threshold for research and development grants is raised in section 30.</P>

While the purpose of the Bill is to establish the foundation to give grant aid for basic research in ICT and biotechnology, I am also taking the opportunity to raise the thresholds. It is a matter for the House&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>At present, any project which receives total investment by the State of &euro;4 million or more, in other words, if an enterprise expands in such a way as to bring total investment by the State to &euro;4 million, Government approval will be required. A large number of such projects now come before the Cabinet. We want to raise the current thresholds which were last raised in 1998. The same applies for research and development grants and for Enterprise Ireland. If the Deputy wishes to raise industrial policy generally, it will be a matter for the Ceann Comhairle. However, given that the issue is central to our industrial policy, I do not see a problem.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy is aware, we often use legislation of this kind to do some tidying up. <Col N="65" /> Increasing thresholds would not warrant separate legislation. We used the amalgamation of CTT and Forbairt on a previous occasion to do the same thing.</P>
      <P>The existing provisions on employment grants and research and development grants are redrafted to take account of current practice in using these instruments. Employment grants are dealt with in sections 27 and 28 and research and development grants in section 30.</P>
      <P>As was noted in the Seanad debate on this Bill, most knowledge-based economies and societies are built around world class research institutions, skills and abilities. If we can successfully exploit the innovations yielded from this new world class research culture we are building in Ireland, it will be of immense benefit to future generations. I commend the Bill to the House.</P>

      <P>The overall vision and strategic direction for Science Foundation Ireland is to build and strengthen scientific and engineering research and its infrastructure in the areas of greatest strategic value to Ireland's long-term competitiveness. For this reason, this Bill establishing Science Foundation Ireland is supported by my party. Establishing the body on a statutory basis, while a radical departure, is an essential initiative if we are to build a global, knowledge-based economy.</P>
      <P>The Minister and the Government must introduce new ways to tackle our deteriorating level of competitiveness. The Government has failed to maintain Ireland's position as a competitive location for business. We have been slipping in our efforts to remain competitive and failed during buoyant economic times to plan ahead for the post-Celtic tiger era. As I have stated on many occasions, we have squandered the boom, failed to invest in research and development, broadband and infrastructure generally, and are now playing catch-up with the rest of Europe and the world.</P>
      <P>It is interesting to note that the Minister and the Progressive Democrats Party, in a mark of political opportunism and their lack of policy, are abandoning the notion that one cannot borrow for particular productive purposes and now support borrowing for infrastructural developments. The cheers in the House during the budget speech of 2000, when the Minister for Finance stated his budget would not require borrowing, have given way to a shallow policy that meant nothing in reality other than papering over the cracks which have appeared in Government expenditure programmes since the general election.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>The imposition of massive indirect taxes since the general election and the failure to plan ahead at a time of sound economic and financial means or to implement decisions which would encourage investment, particularly in infrastructure projects, are concentrating the minds of all the partners involved in the economy, whether business people or politicians. We must plan to make Ireland competitive again. We have no option but to invest in human resources in the same manner in which we invested in the 1960s when the Minister for Education at the time, former Deputy Donogh O'Malley, introduced free secondary education, a contributory factor to the jobs boom of the 1980s and 1990s, and the 1970s when regional technical colleges were established throughout the country marking a major advance in bringing science related subject matter to the attention of our students.</P>
      <P>The Fine Gael Party has always believed in the fundamental value of equality of opportunity in education. Access to education is now a burning issue. The Minister's view on third level fees differs from other Ministers and her political party, the Progressive Democrats, takes a different view on the issue from the Fianna Fáil Party. We cannot find out, to the extent we should in a proper accountable democracy, what is the real policy of the Government in order that students and parents who require and want access to third level education can plan ahead with a degree of certainty. For the benefit of students who will enter third level education from September and October 2003 onwards, will the Minister inform the House, in the context of this all-embracing legislation on industrial policy and science, what is the Government position regarding educational funding for the years ahead?</P>
      <P>I welcome the decision to allocate substantial resources in the National Development Plan 2000-2006, to assist knowledge and science-based activities. However, if Science Foundation Ireland is to succeed it must have certainty in relation to its budget. The partners, investors, business people and educational establishments involved will be able to make solid commitments in terms of the human capital required and make Science Foundation Ireland a major success if there is certainty regarding funding.</P>
      <P>The reason Science Foundation Ireland is being established is to maintain our recent economic success by continuing to raise levels of excellence and quality among industries located here. Competition from eastern Europe and other locations means we have no option but to go for higher value-added production. In terms of costs, we are competing with cheaper locations. Science Foundation Ireland offers an opportunity to attract companies producing high quality goods to locate here and employ a highly skilled labour force which we must continue to resource through our educational establishments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="67" />While Ireland can no longer compete with other cheaper economies on a cost basis, we can compete on skills and quality. Financial certainty is required as it will ensure researchers have confidence that the Government is serious about its role in developing a world class, knowledge-based economy. Through its grants system, Science Foundation Ireland will contribute to improving standards in both these areas by attracting first class researchers from outside this jurisdiction to live and work here. These researchers will also support the development of a trial ecosystem and world class research in Ireland which will eventually lead to new discoveries and innovations and will be attractive to industries which need such scarce skills.</P>
    <P>A critical mass of excellent researchers employed in research laboratories in third level institutions here is essential for the success of this new entity. It is essential that we are able with the help of grant aid to recruit leading researchers to continually raise skills levels and competence here. If Ireland is to have the personnel and skills to meet the demands of the next phase of development, it is essential that Science Foundation Ireland is supported in every possible respect by the Government.</P>
    <P>Most knowledge-based economies and societies are built around world class research institutions, skills and abilities. Correctly exploited and used, innovations and world class research can benefit future generations. However, every possible effort should be made by Science Foundation Ireland to ensure young people have access to education, in particular, institutes of technology. We must utilise centres, which are well placed geographically under the national spatial strategy and funded under the national development plan, to ensure every possible effort is made to provide easy access to the talented people in our country.</P>
    <P>It is important to point out that science research should not be elitist but should be the norm in our educational and research facilities. I and my party are convinced that the development of Science Foundation Ireland is an important step which can reap tremendous rewards for the talents of our people and country into the future. It is not acceptable to have a couple of elitist locations around the country. The institutes of technology should have access in an outreach capacity, if not a core capacity, to the funding and expertise which will be available when the foundation is placed on a statutory basis.</P>
    <P>I welcome the fact that an interim board was established some years ago with leading academics and researchers from home and abroad taking an active part in the establishment of this entity. I welcome the appointment of the director general, Dr. William Harris. I have read some of his speeches in recent years and he and his board of directors have been diligent in assessing and improving a range of new research programmes. Generous grant schemes are now <Col N="68" /> available, which were outlined by the Minister. I am informed that the grant schemes to date have funded in excess of 120 projects with a total financial commitment of more than &euro;200 million over the next five years. That is a good start for Science Foundation Ireland, which I welcome.</P>
    <P>I recently had the opportunity to meet Dr. Fottrell, the acting chairman, the director general, Dr. Harris, and the head of corporate affairs, Mr. McCabe, to discuss the establishment of Science Foundation Ireland. I was impressed by their commitment and enthusiasm to ensure that Ireland becomes successful in the global race for knowledge in both biotechnology and information and communications technology. I am convinced there is great potential in all the players, including the State, acting together as a team with the excellent human capital that has been assembled by the director general. In a recent address Dr. Harris told the Ireland Chamber of Commerce in the United States that teamwork which breaks down boundaries between people and joins them in a search for knowledge and shared persistent imagination and outlook will help to answer fundamental questions about nature. He also said it may help us to see further than Newton might have dreamed. Teamwork is important and the State must play its part.</P>
    <P>It is essential to allay the fears about funding if we want this new entity to be successful. I am interested in the centres programme which the foundation funds. I am aware that substantial grant assistance has already been allocated to many colleges and institutes of technology as well as the Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland. I wish those projects, which have already been funded, well.</P>
    <P>Science Foundation Ireland was established as a result of a study which was commissioned in 1998 by the Government. Forfás was to the forefront in ensuring that all the studies were taken on board. It came up with this proposal and assembled the necessary expertise to get the project off the ground. It deserves our congratulations and our support for the forward looking report which was published in 1998. The conclusions reached that biotechnology and information communications technology represented the engines of future growth in the global economy were correct then and are more correct today. The report stated that a world class research capability in selected niches of these two enabling technologies is an essential foundation for future growth. That was the right conclusion. As there is a worldwide market for biotechnology industries which could grow to $275 billion and support three million jobs in Europe, it is important that Ireland develops its policies to tap into that growth.</P>
    <P>Ireland must be well placed to attract some of this investment. Dr. Harris said the future may not be what it used to be, but science is. Ireland has been to the forefront in seeking investment and educational opportunities. There is no doubt that our economic growth would not have hap<Col N="69" /> pened to the same extent over the past ten years had it not been for the vision and the policies pursued in terms of educational participation, access and opportunities. Ireland's success during the past decade has been greatly helped by the crucial work done in organisations, such as IDA Ireland and Enterprise Ireland, to attract multinational investment and to encourage indigenous business growth.</P>
    <P>Partnerships have also been crucial to boosting Irish competitiveness. Partnerships between college based business and third level institutions is being enshrined on a statutory basis through the creation of Science Foundation Ireland. Decisions taken today mean that research in areas such as mathematics, chemistry, physics, biology, biochemistry, bio-engineering, computer science, engineering and electrical engineering will help to yield employment opportunities for the young people emerging from our third level institutions in the future. It has been identified by Science Foundation Ireland that the areas which can produce the most significant results for research and development over the next few years are cell growth and differentiation, therapeutics, medical devices, which is a growing area in terms of recent employment announcements, gene and environment interactions and computation biology. As regards communications and information technology, Science Foundation Ireland has identified areas of growth within broadband, wireless and mobile transmission, wearable sensors, human language understanding, image and signalling and computer based problem solving.</P>
    <P>The Government should take note of the urgency of implementing a broadband strategy. We have lagged behind in recent years, at a time when we had unprecedented resources at our disposal, in terms of rolling out broadband technology. It is ironic that the State is now relying on a former public entity, Telecom Éireann, which was privatised and became Eircom, to roll out broadband technology with Government assistance. When it was privatised, enormous resources of &euro;4.6 billion were brought into the Exchequer. We must now pay the same company to roll out broadband technology. What happened some years ago should not have happened.</P>
    <P>Science Foundation Ireland also believes that the best opportunity for technological and economic advancement will emerge in areas such as novel adaptive technologies, software engineering, segmenting web technologies, which is new to me and for which a centre has been developed in the National University of Ireland in Galway, network design, novel components and components integration. This activity regenerated at research centres around the country will ultimately result in teamwork between academic and industrial researchers. It is the first clear example in education and science of a public private partnership. Such partnership must permeate all regions and third level educational establishments and it should not be allowed to become elitist. <Col N="70" /> Science Foundation Ireland is aiming to bring fine researchers together and to support them financially so that they can work together and train the next generation. That is why the campus industry research partnerships are critical in the contribution they will make to science innovation in Ireland.</P>
    <P>The Minister outlined the contents of the Bill, which are mechanical in nature. The Bill sets up a new entity and deals with staffing issues and the necessary appointments to the board of directors, such as the director general. Section 23 provides that the foundation is obliged to prepare a strategy statement every five years and a work programme which must be presented at the end of the year. We must ensure we know the direction the Minister is giving to Science Foundation Ireland in the strategy statement. The work programme must be approved by her and account must be given to the Oireachtas on an annual basis. Section 24 provides for an annual report. An indication should be given about the content of the annual report required of Science Foundation Ireland and about what the Minister expects Science Foundation Ireland to be able to accomplish and to report on arising from the requirements outlined in section 24.</P>
    <P>I seek clarification on the issue of intellectual property. If significant resources are invested on behalf of the taxpayer in partnership with business and educational institutions, inevitably, discoveries will be made and innovations will emerge. The question of intellectual property and patenting needs to be outlined in the legislation so that everybody is clear from the outset about who holds the rights of the intellectual property that will ensue from the success of Science Foundation Ireland.</P>
    <P>I welcome the legislation. It is not a serious political issue as far as Fine Gael is concerned. My party fully supports the knowledge-based economy that we are seeking to enshrine in legislation through the establishment of Science Foundation Ireland on a statutory basis. I wish the new board of directors and the director general, Dr. Harris, every success in what they are seeking to achieve through this entity. I have no doubt that through proper funding and commitment from the State in partnership with business, important results will be achieved in the years ahead as the talent, knowledge and expertise of the population is developed at the highest level globally. This will ensure value is added to the workforce and to the products that will be needed to compete economically. We will not be dependent on traditional industries that, unfortunately, are unable to compete currently because of the economy's deteriorating state of competitiveness. I support the Minister in commending the Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Hogan for sharing his time. I have four points to make on the Bill. First, it is too late. As Deputy Hogan pointed out, &euro;120 million of taxpayers' money has been committed to the foundation without a statutory <Col N="71" /> authority being put in place. This is not abnormal &ndash; unfortunately, this has been all too normal in our democracy under successive Governments. The Oireachtas is taken for granted and no great regard is paid to an entity having statutory authority before it is allowed to begin spending money. As far as the operation of this entity is concerned, the passage of the legislation will make virtually no difference and that is not as it should be. That is a reflection on the lassitude of Members of the House in insisting on their rights as progressive democrats.</P>
      <P>Second, the objectives spelt out in the legislation are unduly narrow and economistic. References are made to excellence and efficiency. Excellence can only be judged on the basis of values. What underlying values are inherent in the Government's science policy? On what does the Government put a value? Is it only money? Enhancing the quality of people's lives and not only the length of their lives should be indicated as one of the underlying values of scientific policy. Redressing the economic balance of the market is a necessary justification of State intervention. For example, in the medical field, very little research is being conducted on malaria because those who contract the disease cannot afford to pay drug companies. A small amount of our commitment to science should relate to researching cures for ailments, the drugs for which victims cannot afford, so that the research will not have to be justified on commercial grounds.</P>
      <P>Section 7 deals with objectives and it should be scrutinised with great care with a view to elaborating more fully on them. There is an obligation on the House to give guidance to the foundation regarding what it should achieve. Scientists should not tell us what values there should be in science. It is the job of politicians to set values and it is for scientists to deliver on them. It is important that we should do our job in making valued judgments about what is important. While I agree with the objectives the Minister has included such as competitiveness, which is precise, clear and necessary, others could be included.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Third, the legislation does not provide for sufficient parliamentary accountability. When legislation of this nature is passed, we are saying we cannot ask questions about it anymore because once a body similar to this has been established, the Ceann Comhairle will rule that parliamentary questions tabled about it are not a matter for the Minister. Every time legislation such as this is passed, the power of the House is diminished. That is necessary but it should be justified. The legislation should be strengthened considerably in terms of parliamentary accountability. For example, section 7(1)(<i>f</i>) refers to the granting of additional functions to the body. That should require the approval of the House and it should not be possible for the Minister to grant additional functions without referring to the <Col N="72" /> House. Likewise, section 7(4) relates to general directives and permits the body to move into new areas. The directives should also be approved in the House.</P>
    <P>I agree with Deputy Hogan that the content of the annual report should be the subject of considerable scrutiny by the House. For example, reports should be provided on the value of intellectual property acquired by the State as a result of its investment or the value of the profits made as a result of these investments. The detail of the content of annual reports should be specified. There is a standard practice whereby the parliamentary counsel drafts sections similar to this in legislation. The Bill is identical to others that put other bodies on a statutory footing for entirely different purposes. Only one or two sections vary from similar legislation that passes through this parliamentary mill three days a week. We should focus on the changes we can make. I hope an effort will be made during the Bill's passage to amend section 24 so that it provides that what we want is included in the annual report. It should not be left to the foundation to write what it thinks is a report that is acceptable financially.</P>
    <P>My fourth and final point relates to the ethical aspects of science. One of the priority areas in the legislation is biotechnology, which deals with the manipulation of human life. Each human life is sacred and each human being is a person from the time of his or her creation. I do not believe people are a fit subject for scientific manipulation. Many of the claimed benefits of stem cell research can be achieved by other methods using adult cells, without the necessity to use a human being or incipient embryo. Strong ethical guidelines are needed to govern research but they are not mentioned in the legislation.</P>
    <P>It is not sufficient for scientists to decide their own ethical guidelines. The elected representatives of this House should decide the ethical guidelines for science, whether it is funded by the State. We are the experts as far as public ethics are concerned, not scientists. We are elected to make such decisions. They may be difficult decisions but we are charged with that responsibility. It is not appropriate to delegate ethical issues to scientists. They must inform us but we must make the decisions because we are charged by society under the Constitution to do so. I am disappointed that no section relates to scientific ethics. I presume they will be encompassed in some fashion in the annual report or in directives that the Minister might give to the board but they should be specified. As far as I can see, we are behind many other European countries and the United States in dealing with the issue of ethics in science. The Minister is well known for her preference for Boston over Berlin or, perhaps, her preference for Waco over Paris. She is welcome to that choice &ndash; we all have our value systems. Personally, I prefer Paris even though I have relatives who live quite close to Waco, but that is the Minister's way of looking at things.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="73" />The big difference between Europe and America is that America is utterly confident about science. There is a scientific fix to every problem in the American mind whereas in the more pessimistic European psyche we believe that every problem is a problem not a solution. We are more cautious and stuck in the mud in that regard. We complement each other and that is why we should stay together rather than fall out.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>I, as always, am impressed by the contribution of the former Taoiseach, Deputy John Bruton, and agree with much of what he said. I hope to amplify some of those points in the few minutes available to me.</P>
      <P>This is important legislation. It is not hugely substantial in terms of the written word but it is of extreme importance to Ireland into the future. One could pose a few immediate questions such as whether a Bill of this type should be anchored in the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment. The whole emphasis of the briefings we received of the explanatory memorandum and the Minister's speech today and in the Seanad is of an enterprise culture and science for the use of enterprise. That is extremely important because technology has been the basis on which we developed our enterprises during the past decade or so, and it will be the basis on which we develop and hold on to our industries into the future.</P>
      <P>There are, however, other dimensions. Science is not about industry and technology for the sake of employment alone, there is such a thing as pure science. One of the questions I posed as a former health Minister related to the status of the Health Research Board in this regard where there is scientific research for medical good that might not, as Deputy John Bruton said, have a particular value in terms of economic generation. These matters need to be teased out in this House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I also agree with Deputy Bruton that quite often the last place where the basis of critical policy is debated is in this House. It is often in the Department in multilateral discussions with the social partners that the future of Ireland is debated, projects are agreed upon and taxpayers' money is committed. Finally, when all is done the debate to give the policy the vestige of demo<Col N="74" /> cratic accountability takes place here. We have tolerated that and many of us who have had the privilege of being in government have contributed to it. If we are to have a meaningful democracy, the debate should commence, not end, here. That is important.</P>
    <P>Another issue which we dealt with in the European scrutiny enactment last year is that when we set up a structure, we should not cut the umbilical cord and make it unaccountable thereafter. The whole idea of having functioning committees is to ensure democratic dialogue between the agencies we establish. We will shortly deal with another agency, FÁS, in Private Members' time. I have many files containing queries in relation to FÁS for which the Minister has no statutory responsibility so that CE schemes and so on can be cut. The Minister for the Environment and Local Government has no responsibility for the Environmental Protection Agency. We establish these agencies and off they go on their merry way. We can invite them to come before our committees to give explanations for their actions. We need to address that area. The business of governance has become complicated. We need to ensure this House remains relevant. The most dangerous thing facing our democratic institutions is irrelevance followed closely by indifference from a public that demands that we hold somebody accountable for the actions which impact on their lives.</P>
    <P>The Bill sets out to establish on a statutory basis Science Foundation Ireland whose function it will be to promote and develop world-class research capability in strategic areas of sciences such as those concerned with economic and social benefit and long-term competitiveness, information and communications technologies and biotechnologies, the new cutting edge. The objective of Science Foundation Ireland is to attract individuals and teams of researchers of a world-class standard into this country to carry out research here. The Minister, in the Seanad, outlined it as seeing Ireland as a leader in the global knowledge-based economy. That is very telling &ndash; it is not in a global knowledge-based world that she sees it but in a global knowledge-based economy.</P>
    <P>The world and its economy is changing and knowledge remains king. There are new challenges. If the raw material that is the most valuable for our economic well-being is knowledge we do not have a unique pool of it. We are fortunate to have a good and well trained pool of it but other countries such as India and the Far East have talented, educated, intelligent people who can challenge that unless we are always responsive to a changing environment. That response is not solely the prerogative or main concern of the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment. All Departments and agencies of State must share that responsibility. As a number of other speakers said, there does not appear to be any sense of the joined up nature of Government that is required to achieve the Minister's objective of <Col N="75" /> establishing Ireland as a leader in a global knowledge-based economy. We are not achieving the roll-out of broadband or access to technologies that should be available and are available in much poorer countries. We seem now incapable of even reaching the objectives of the national development plan in the timeframe we set.</P>
    <P>The Government commit itself to a &ldquo;can do&rdquo; philosophy six years ago. It was anti-statist and was going to push away the difficulties of red tape and get the job done. Our infrastructure is drastically inferior to that of much poorer countries. There must be an answer to that so that when the roll-out of broadband technology promised for the region does not happen somebody will be able to get the job done. There is no point having the finest experts in the world developing technologies here if we do not have the educated workforce to man the industries that are spawned from that research. Where will they come from? They will come from young people who are attending schools at primary, secondary and tertiary level. There is a supreme irony here. We are saying that our prime focus for the future in terms of economic well-being, employment status and full employment is to be in our intellectual capacity, the raw material of knowledge and the ability of our people to utilise cutting edge technologies to create new and innovative jobs. At the same time, this daft kite is being flown by the man who must now be the most professional kite flyer in the business, the Minister for Education and Science, to reintroduce third level fees.</P>
    <P>The man has crash landed more kites in the past five years than anybody I know but it really is not good enough to look at education as a commodity in the crude, crass way evident in the Minister's approach. I am heartened to know that the only member of the Government present agrees with me on this, if I am to accept the Tánaiste's Brussels speech last night. If we are to have the type of joined up Government which ensures that the hundreds of millions of euro we are to invest in this new statutory body is to spawn jobs in sustainable, vibrant, cutting edge Ireland, then we must have the graduates to carry the batons of the cutting edge research. Surely we should be trying to break down those barriers. If the Minister for Education and Science wants to provide new schemes to break down inequality and new access and supports, let him do so without putting up other barriers to a different category of person who really will depend on the absence of fees to ensure that he or she can have access to third level education.</P>
    <P>That sort of joined up thinking is spectacularly absent in the Government's proposals on the free fees issue. That is why I make these points. The Tánaiste has a great deal of credibility in relation to what she wants to achieve on this but it is not for her alone to achieve it. She must have the active support, not simply in voting terms but in policy terms, of all her Cabinet colleagues. The two examples I have just given show that this sup<Col N="76" /> port, and joined up Government, is spectacularly absent.</P>
    <P>The work of the technology foresight initiative carried out by the Irish Council for Science from 1998 was extraordinarily important and worthwhile. We required those involved in the initiative in 1998 to look into their crystal ball and identify emerging technologies. They were asked to identify, if you like, the IT of the next phase. Their recommendations, which included the establishment of a science foundation, are now being acted upon on a statutory basis. I am taken by what Deputy John Bruton said about their being belatedly put on a statutory footing because these recommendations should be front-loaded on a statutory basis if we are to allocate money as the Minister has.</P>
    <P>All sorts of peculiar enactments have been allowed. I recall that the Health (Corporate Bodies) Act 1961 allows the Minister for Health and Children, uniquely, to establish a corporate body by the simple stroke of a pen on a statutory instrument. That really is not good enough any more and we should seek to ensure that the democratic scrutiny these Houses provide is a functioning, working process and not, as many Department officials see it, just a cipher or rubber stamp for policies determined elsewhere.</P>
    <P>When Science Foundation Ireland was established, &euro;646 million was allocated to support research for the duration of the national development plan. In the briefing we received from Science Foundation Ireland, that sum is repeated and reference is made to the organisation's established five key programmes. It tells us that Science Foundation Ireland has already recruited and retained the expertise of 93 research engineers, scientists and their teams for a total investment commitment of &euro;161 million and that further investment of &euro;42 million in three new world class research centres that would build top class research teams between academia and industry is now planned.</P>
    <P>I would be interested to hear how much money has actually been expended. How much of that &euro;646 million has been drawn down to date and what is the expected run of the money? Was that sum just plucked from the air in 2000? It is an odd, uneven sum. Perhaps if I translated it into pounds it would be a more obvious figure but I wonder how it came about. Is that the sum available regardless of the values of the ideas and research made available and the projects that might be offered? Where did the sum come from and how has it been spent to date? Our challenge is to be a centre where new technologies are created and devised rather than simply a place where new technologies created elsewhere are applied.</P>
    <P>I want to deal briefly with an issue of extreme importance and urgency. I have no difficulty with the Tánaiste's proposals. It is very important legislation that will do an important job, and we trust that the skills of the people already recruited are first class. I have no difficulty with that and <Col N="77" /> we can deal with the minutiae of the Bill and how we could tweak the structures on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>However, I want to state a couple of important general principles now. These concern the issue of what the new technologies will be, particularly biotechnologies The briefing we received from Science Foundation Ireland indicates the sort of issues that will be examined. The briefing states:</P>
    <P>SFI believes that the following areas are likely to produce the most significant results for R&amp;D for the next few years in particular: cell growth and differentiation; therapeutics; host-pathogen interactions; gene expression; bio-markers and bio-sensors signal transduction in a cellular context; gene environment interactions; computational biology; and medical devices.</P>
    <P>I am no scientist and I do not know what most of these things are. However, I am concerned about new biotechnologies in terms of the ethical standards that have been referred to previously. I want to raise this in this context because it is important for us as politicians to take control of this issue. We have not done that. Other speakers are correct in saying that we in Ireland are particularly bad at this. We must set a framework within which the research can take place.</P>
    <P>Scientists want that. They want certainty in relation to the framework of ethics in which issues like stem cell research and cloning are to be dealt with. We do not have those standards. We need to look at issues like patenting of genes, in particular of agricultural genes, and the implications for north-south issues.</P>
    <P>The European Commissioner for Development and Humanitarian Aid, Poul Nielson, addressed these matters in a speech to a conference in Brussels on 31 January. I wish to quote a small portion of that speech:</P>
    <P>The challenge we are facing now is to make sure that present and future discoveries will be accessible to those who need them most, particularly the poor. It is our responsibility as decision makers to facilitate this process and to ensure greater equity in the sharing of science and technology.</P>
    <P>He quoted the French political leader philosopher, historian and peace activist, Jean Jaures, when he declared:</P>
    <P>Science creates the possibility of new societal forms, but it creates only the possibility. Progress in science is not sufficient to achieve justice.</P>
    <P>The European Union has spelled out its policies in a January 2002 Commission document entitled &ldquo;Life Sciences and Biotechnologies: A Strategy for Europe&rdquo; which has been largely supported by the Council of Ministers and the European Parliament.</P>
    <P>The message of that document was that any policies and strategies elaborated in Europe <Col N="78" /> regarding life sciences and biotechnologies will have a major impact on developing countries. Therefore, the interests of developing countries must be taken fully into account by the European Union when main routes for the future are considered.</P>
    <P>Developed and developing countries have common fields of interest in life sciences and biotechnology. New informed, democratic, ethical and transparent partnerships should be encouraged among developed and developing nations to take full advantage both of promising technologies available primarily in the northern hemisphere and an extraordinary bio-diversity potential primarily in the southern hemisphere.</P>
    <P>Environmental and health concerns are paramount when considering life sciences and biotechnologies and they must be fully integrated in strategic choices contributing to sustainable development in accordance with international commitments and conventions and the precautionary principle.</P>
    <P>Although the economic benefit for Ireland is of paramount importance, there are other issues, including the ethics of gene research and the impact it will have on humanity and developing nations. We have a responsibility as a developed nation to establish ethical partnerships with other nations in the world. I hope to have the opportunity to deal with all these issues on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>I wish to make brief reference to another new Council of Europe document on stem cell research by Dr. Michael Asciak, which was adopted by the Science and Education Committee of the Council of Europe at its last meeting a fortnight ago. It sets out a moral anchor for this sort of research. We need to return to these kinds of issues in this House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryUpton" hpid="Dr. Upton Dr. Upton">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Upton</NameTxt>
      <P>I am in the somewhat invidious position of being a scientist and a politician so my views on the Bill are coloured to a certain extent. The Tánaiste will be pleased to hear that I welcome the Bill for a number of reasons although I have some criticisms also. I welcome it because it gives us the opportunity to have a robust discussion in the House on science and technology. This is the first substantial debate on these issues that I can recall, which in itself is welcome.</P>
      <P>The Bill is very thin in that it relates predominantly to the funding of science. My colleagues raised extremely important issues concerning ethics and intellectual property to which I will return. I welcome the Bill on the basis of its being a flagship in regard to the importance of science and technology for our economy. They form the powerhouses and engines of our economy and there is no aspect of life that is not influenced by scientific development.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I will first deal with the major ethical issues, which were addressed by my colleagues in some depth. Earlier this year saw the completion of the mapping of the human genome, which did not merit a sentence or a small debate in this House. <Col N="79" /> I have tabled a Private Members' Bill on human cloning, which we have not had any opportunity to debate. These are the issues of science and technology that will be important to everybody in the future. There are economic aspects to the debate, but there are serious ethical issues that cannot be left aside and must be given priority.</P>
    <P>There are issues of intellectual property and intellectual rights as well as patenting, including the question of who takes responsibility for and has ownership of patenting of the human genome and patenting of information in general. My colleague, Deputy Howlin, referred to the importance of this particularly for agriculture in developing countries. These are the issues of which we must take account as well as sheer economics.</P>
    <P>I return to the funding of science. I welcome the input of significant resources into the science and technology area. The sub-text of the Bill is to generate a world-class research base in Ireland, the outcome of which should be to attract multinational companies and other major investors that will help us to drive the economy. The problems of generating interest in science and technology are multi-factorial and have been debated in the media in general. We are concerned about the lack of interest in science subjects at second level. I do not want to rehearse that because it has been well covered and the main points have been clearly set out. There is concern over the level of interest in the hard sciences of physics, chemistry and mathematics at second level. The consequence is that students are unable or unwilling to undertake those subjects at third level, which has a knock-on effect on graduates, postgraduates and post-doctoral fellows. If we are serious about science and technology, and driving the economy on a research basis, we must ensure the subjects of physics and chemistry in particular are supported at second level.</P>
    <P>Another aspect of our lack of commitment to science and technology is shown by the career paths and career structures for scientists. These fall considerably short when compared to other professions. It is grossly unfair and unacceptable for highly educated and trained individuals aged 27 or 28 with a PhD and a couple of years post-doctoral experience to be unable to get a mortgage because they have no career path and no guarantee of a positive career structure. If we are serious about retaining our scientists and about attracting good science expertise to the country, we must look at the career structure and options open to scientists. Otherwise, they will move to those professions where there is more money to be made. In many cases the more difficult subjects like physics, chemistry and mathematics are left aside for the leaving certificate at higher level. We must look at what is happening at second level and even at primary level. I know this is getting some attention at present, but it needs more input, greater resources, much improved laboratory facilities, etc.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="80" />We sometimes suffer from an inferiority complex about the expertise available to us. We should acknowledge the important role of the universities and our third level institutes and the very high calibre of graduates they are producing. I am concerned that those graduates will not be retained in the country if we do not provide them with the structure and opportunities to stay.</P>
    <P>Any allocation of funding to science must take account of the importance of the social sciences and the humanities. In the past, we have tended to compartmentalise these. On the one hand we have science and on the other hand we have social sciences and humanities. In addition to the economy there are important quality of life aspects that cannot be ignored. We must bring together and develop the humanities, social sciences and other sciences. They cannot be set out in different compartments.</P>
    <P>The Minister has stated there will be an equitable balance between men and women in the composition of the board, which I welcome. I am sure the Minister is aware of a very effective group called WITS, Women in Technology and Science. It might be time for this board to break the mould and have more women than men. Many high calibre women scientists would be very happy to participate on the board.</P>

      <P>Emphasis appears to be placed on the two areas of biotechnology and communications technology. At present, these two areas are hugely important to the country economically. I accept that other general areas will be included and that there will be an awareness of them as they evolve and become important, but this definitely narrows the Bill. How do we know what is going to happen? We must look at what is happening in terms of emerging technology and at what we can expect in five or ten years' time. The Bill is quite exclusive in that respect, even though it has a rather broad general third area. We should leave it open to incorporating, at a much greater and higher level, other areas of interest.</P>
      <P>Is it necessary or desirable to include the director general as a member of the board? Might it not be somewhat invidious to have the director as a board member in a difficult situation, as might arise on any board? Should this matter not be given some consideration?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome the establishment of the Friends of Science by the Tánaiste. Meetings between politicians, scientists and business people are a recipe <Col N="81" /> for good communication and the advancement of science. It is important that we learn to listen to each other and understand the views that are important from a business and scientific point of view. However, as has been pointed out by my colleagues, politicians have ultimate responsibility in determining the direction and focus. The Friends of Science have held a number of meetings. I encourage the Tánaiste to widen the membership base of the group among Members of the Oireachtas. Members of the group are mostly scientists or people with a background or interest in some area related to science but it might be worthwhile expanding that base so that we could broaden out our ideas in terms of Oireachtas interests and political views.</P>
    <P>It is important that science be made user-friendly and that the awareness of science at primary and second level be emphasised and promoted. The ethical issues I mentioned must be the driving force and we cannot move away from those.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Eamon Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to share my time with Deputies Morgan, Connolly and Cowley.</P>
      <P>Like Deputy Upton, I welcome the chance for a broad debate about where we are going in science and what role science has to play in our society. It is particularly appropriate that we are debating the question in this Chamber, which was originally built by the Royal Dublin Society, a scientific society, as a lecture theatre and where, I am sure, huge original scientific debate took place. I believe the Chamber was also, at one time, a concert theatre, which was a more colourful use than its current one. This is an interesting place in which to debate science, which we do not do sufficiently.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When it was established, the Royal Dublin Society was originally named the Dublin Society for Improving Husbandry, Manufactures and Other Useful Arts. A week later the members added the word, &ldquo;science&rdquo; to the title. I hope the Minister will be equally flexible when she comes to amending this Bill to improve it. Unfortunately, one of the amendments I will be suggesting will propose the deletion of the word &ldquo;science&rdquo; from the title. The Bill might be better described as &ldquo;the orientated basic research foundation Bill&rdquo;. The Bill promises that research will be carried out with the expectation that it will produce the broad base of knowledge that is likely to form the background to solutions or recognised current or future problems or possibilities. My understanding of science is that one cannot approach it with expectations. A student of science views the world as a removed observer and tries to understand what is going on. If we compromise that basic independence which is the kernel of scientific method we are not promoting science, we are promoting research and development. There is nothing wrong with that. It is welcome in Irish industry that we develop and use technology and research to maintain jobs and to help our economy. That is very valuable. <Col N="82" /> However, we must be careful about feeling that by doing so we are developing science, in the purest sense, or developing our inquiring and independent scientific minds. I have a terrible fear that the Bill may be a research and development Bill or an orientated basic research Bill but I do not believe it is a Bill to promote science <i>per se </i>in our society.</P>
    <P>The Bill has two or three regrettable aspects. Emphasis is continually placed on the basis of the economy, even on the narrow basis of technology and applied research. We must change our ways and start looking at how we develop our county and our industries on a broader and more holistic basis. The environment, society and the economy cannot be separated. The ecology and the sense of interconnectedness of everything in our society comes first. We must take an ecological analysis, an economic analysis and an equality analysis and, by bringing those three together, we will achieve sustainable development.</P>
    <P>In our work in the Oireachtas we continually refer to the economy. Unless we are ecological in our approach and see the interconnectivity between nature and our economy and society and our economy, the economy will not develop successfully. Successful economic development requires sustainable economic development and this Bill does not have that emphasis. It is based purely on economic development rather than on that broad sustainable basis.</P>
    <P>The position is not the same elsewhere. President Truman established what was probably the first scientific institute in the United States in the 1950s. Its strategic objectives are much broader and include welfare. It also includes national defence, with which I have a problem, but its analysis is much broader than purely economic development. One of the statements of what the institute is about defines one of its roles as, &ldquo;funding and encouraging fundamental research and education resulting in discoveries and innovations that save lives, save time and maybe even save planet Earth&rdquo;. The American institute had a broad and wondering vision and a desire to understand. The New Zealand Scientific Research Institute, which again is involved primarily in investing in industry and in trying to develop connections, also has a much broader basis. It has a special fund for investing in sustainable development research. In five or ten years' time I am certain that the findings from that sustainable development research will provide the technology which will be demanded throughout the planet from which new industries will be created. If we really want to develop our economy we must emphasise sustainable development, which is not even mentioned in this Bill. The environment does not feature.</P>
    <P>Some people might expect members of the Green Party to be anti-science. We certainly have serious qualms about the use of certain technologies in, for example, genetic engineering and the use of patenting of life. Most of the solutions to our environmental problems will come from <Col N="83" /> science. We rely on scientists to provide an object analysis of what is happening and of how we solve it. Science is our only solution. The misuse of science and technology may well have been the cause of most of the damage which occurred in the 20th century and of most of the harmful effects we are now creating on the planet, but in the 21st century science and technology will be the chief tool in undoing that damage.</P>
    <P>To do that we need to whet the creative ambition of our younger people. I agree with the comments about concern at the lack of impetus towards people moving into the basic sciences at a very junior level in school. To encourage young people into science we cannot set a model that they might some day help the global economy or a certain corporation by developing a scientific or technological solution. That will not set a child's imagination alight. We must show children the big picture and tell them the truth. We are in deep trouble in that we are affecting the planet. We are affecting the climate, the level of biodiversity and other areas in ways we do not even know about. We can set young people's imaginations aflame by telling them they will have to solve those problems because such problems will come to a head in their lifetimes &ndash; they will have to go into science to understand the way nature works in order to solve the problems. This will raise young people's ambitions and creative instincts and they will create jobs and wealth for us in the process of saving the planet. This Bill shows none of that vision; it sees Ireland Inc. as a business community, not a social community. It does not have any sense of an environmental approach, which is also regrettable. Like the founders of the Royal Dublin Society, I hope the Minister agrees to amend the Title of and some other terms in the Bill.</P>
    <P>I agree with Deputy Howlin that it seems remarkable that we are the last people to discuss the Bill. It has gone before the social partners, through a consultation process within the Department and the institution involved is even up and running. The House which was to debate it comes in last place. That is reflective of a general trend of how we set our vision and policies in Ireland and it is not particularly democratic.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ArthurMorganSF" hpid="Mr. Morgan Mr. Morgan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morgan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Bill which facilitates the establishment of Science Foundation Ireland. The long, lazy reign of the Fianna Fáil-Progressive Democrat Government has done little up to now to encourage indigenous research and development-based industry. The creation of a science foundation which will promote research and development and support the research work being done by universities is long overdue. The failure of the Government has often been in the lack of ability to see the long-term picture but this Bill marks the commencement of a long-term, determined national effort to develop research and development capabilities in the State.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="84" />I hope Science Foundation Ireland will play a central role in encouraging and supporting the growth of research and development and in supporting the development of indigenous industry, helping us to move away from our over-dependence on multinational companies. Other, albeit bigger, countries, such as the United States invested heavily in national science foundations as far back as the 1950s. As a result, those countries have cultivated generations of outstanding scholars and have succeeded in keeping their best graduates at home. There is a strong link between investment in the research and innovation base of the economy and sustained economic growth. Those countries' economies have benefited greatly from such investment.</P>
    <P>Ireland has long lagged behind our European neighbours in the amounts we invest in research and development and the economy has suffered because of that failure to invest in research and development. As a result Irish students with third level science degrees have tended to leave the country because they feel advanced research facilities do not exist in the State. Investing in research and development through Science Foundation Ireland will create scientific know-how which will act as a permanent resource benefiting the economy. Research and first-rate universities prepare people for the knowledge-based economy and will help develop a flexible workforce which is able to adopt to the changing needs of the economy.</P>
    <P>It is now a pertinent time to undertake a critical assessment of the industrial policies which have been pursued by the IDA over the past ten to 15 years. Increasingly, we see that multinational companies which received inordinate amounts of grant aid from the State during the boom years are uprooting and moving to developing countries where they can access cheap labour. They are also moving to the EU accession states, which have emulated Ireland's policy of low corporate tax and high incentives. This trend illustrates the necessity of providing indigenous industries with the same quality and quantity of resources as were made available to foreign investors. We need an economic development strategy which creates a balance between indigenous and inward investment. We must encourage both small and large scale indigenous countries to form a research and development anchor, while also recognising that some 80% of employment stems from small and medium-sized enterprises. Investment in indigenous companies will have a beneficial impact on ensuring job security for Irish workers. One can be certain that if an Irish company is in difficulty it will fight tooth and nail to survive, if only for the sake of its workers. That close relationship between workers and management is often missing in the bigger companies, particularly multinationals.</P>
    <P>I am not opposed to multinational companies, far from it. We have seen the benefits and excellent conditions some of them provide but we should not be as dependent on them as we are at <Col N="85" /> present. The crazy thing is we do not need to be; indigenous industry has proven its ability and with the establishment of Science Foundation Ireland there is now an opportunity to give those indigenous companies some of the necessary assistance they require. Despite the fact that by 2000, 40% of Ireland's trade with the rest of the world was in research-intensive products and services, eight times the OECD average, those products were not developed or researched in Ireland.</P>
    <P>The development of SFI cannot be divorced from the wider issue of investment in education. Investment in research at third level will fail if it is not matched by investment at primary and secondary level, a point made by several previous speakers. If the education system fails students at primary and secondary levels, we cannot expect to have an educated and knowledgeable workforce to work in research and development-based industries. Sustainable economic development cannot happen without a well-educated workforce but we will not have such a workforce if we do not invest in those two critical sectors, primary and secondary education.</P>
    <P>The decreasing interest in science among students in the 26 Counties is worrying. The Government must make science and engineering careers attractive to students. I hope SFI will demonstrate to Irish students that careers in science and technology lie ahead of them as researchers, teachers and innovators in an ever-growing and increasingly important sector of the Irish economy. Investment in research and development should not be dictated simply by economic prosperity and future competitiveness. The social benefit must also be prioritised. We must invest in research and development areas which will be of benefit to the people of Ireland, such as the medical and health care sectors. The importance of environmental issues should also be recognised. As Deputy Eamon Ryan pointed out, there is no reference whatsoever to the environment in the Bill although there are many opportunities for effective work in areas such as the development of green energy. There are developments all over the world regarding tidal and wind energy &ndash; the Dundalk Institute of Technology is pioneering a new type of wind energy facility. This should happen more often and the research facilities should not all be offered to top flight companies, as smaller Irish companies should be able to avail of assistance with research and development.</P>
    <P>Investment should be directed at areas which will be of benefit to the country first rather than just being a matter of profit. Many bigger companies already have expertise and back-up. I am not saying they should not receive assistance, as if they do not invest in research and development we will not be going anywhere.</P>

      <P>&ndash;&nbsp;deploring the continuing assault on disadvantaged communities represented by the economic policy of the Government, which has starved communities of essential resources and led to increased poverty and deprivation and a widening of the gap between rich and poor in both rural and urban Ireland;</P>
      <P>&ndash;&nbsp;believing that many of these communities continue to suffer as a result of inadequate policing, unequal educational opportunities, and unemployment levels well above the national average;</P>

      <P>&ndash;&nbsp;the failure to provide the promised second round of funding under the young people's facilities and services fund;</P>
      <P>&ndash;&nbsp;the failure to provide the Education Welfare Board with adequate resources to ensure that it can function fully and the failure to implement the promised action plan on school attendance and early school leaving for each area covered by the RAPID programme;</P>

      <P>The broken pre-election promises of the Government continue to be exposed but the cynical betrayal of disadvantaged communities through the Government's failure to provide promised funding under the RAPID programme would be extraordinarily difficult to surpass. RAPID stands for revitalising areas by planning, investment and development. There has been disjointed planning together with very little investment and development since the programme was first announced by the Taoiseach in February 2001.</P>
      <P>On 16 April last, I asked the Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs, Deputy Ó Cuív, for the progress made to date in each of the RAPID areas. In reply he stated that his Department is to co-ordinate the implementation of the RAPID programme assisted by Area Development Management Limited. He went on to inform me that under strands 1 and 2 of the RAPID programme an area implementation team was established in each of the 45 areas to develop a plan for the areas. He confirmed that plans for both strands had been completed and proposals forwarded to the relevant Departments for consideration. He then went on to state that it is a matter for each of the other Departments to report on the implementation of the programme that falls within the remit of their Department.</P>
      <P>I tabled parliamentary questions to other relevant Ministers, and I will return to that in a moment, but in regard to the Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs, it has provided &euro;2.2 million to area implementation teams. Six community development projects in RAPID areas were announced this year, each receiving a renewable contract for funding of &euro;60,000. Core funding of &euro;152,000 was provided to a community development programme, CDP, building project and towards equipping.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is roundly to be condemned as a measure of the Government's real commitment to the RAPID programme that since inception only &euro;2.2 million has been spent directly on driving the programme by the Department which is charged with the co-ordination of its implementation. Indeed in this year's Estimates, the Department's Vote for local development and social inclusion <Col N="88" /> measures was reduced from &euro;47.6 million to &euro;44.9 million, a decrease of 6%.</P>
    <P>In regard to the amount of money spent by the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment in each of the RAPID areas since the inception of RAPID, the Minister of State, Deputy Fahey, informed me that his Department's contribution to the RAPID programme has been delivered mainly through the prioritisation of existing FÁS schemes. Support provided by FÁS has been through FÁS community services where the community employment scheme is the major element &ndash; where RAPID areas continue to be prioritised &ndash; FÁS employment services, the local employment services and FÁS training schemes.</P>
    <P>The estimated value of FÁS community services activities associated with each relevant RAPID area which is funded from FÁS existing resources is as follows: Dublin, &euro;13.8 million; Cork, &euro;6.96 million; and Limerick, &euro;2.65 million, giving a total of &euro;23.41 million. The fact that no money has apparently been provided by FÁS in Waterford, Bray, Drogheda, Dundalk or any of the smaller or larger towns is further evidence of a lack of commitment to the RAPID programme.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform has approved funding of &euro;3.8 million for ten projects under the equal opportunities child care programme for child care proposals and a probation and welfare proposal to a total of &euro;3.8 million. The Department of Health and Children does not have a figure for money spent in RAPID areas since the inception of the scheme but it is arranging to provide the figures to me from each of the health boards and health authority. It is extraordinary that the Department of Health and Children could not provide a figure.</P>
    <P>Similarly, the Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources stated that it was not possible within the time available to provide a full breakdown of expenditure by his Department in RAPID areas since the inception of the programme, however he was arranging for the information to be forwarded to me as soon as possible. The Minister, Deputy Dermot Ahern, also stated that while to date no RAPID projects had been funded under programmes administered by his Department or his agencies, a significant amount of investment had taken place and-or is planned under such programmes in RAPID designated areas.</P>
    <P>I was informed by the Minister for Arts, Sport and Tourism that the proposals for the development of sports facilities contained in the RAPID area implementation plans were not submitted to his Department prior to the closing date for the 2002 sports capital programme.</P>
    <P>Of projects listed in RAPID area implementation plans submitted subsequently for consideration, 40 would have been eligible for funding under the sports capital programme. Of these, 23 had not applied for funding under the programme and were advised to prepare applications for funding under the 2003 programme and 17 had actually applied independently to the programme <Col N="89" /> of which 12 have been allocated funding totalling &euro;4.2 million. It is extraordinary that in relation to projects listed in RAPID area implementation plans, their promoters were not advised of the closing date for the 2002 sports capital programme and advised to make sure to get their applications in before that closing date.</P>
    <P>Under the local authorities swimming pool programme which is administered by the Department of Arts, Sport and Tourism &euro;6.6 million was provided to pools located in RAPID areas since the inception of the programme.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Transport informed me that Bus Éireann introduced a new route in Cork city, southern orbital bus service, on a pilot basis. The Department has provided funding of &euro;288,000 towards the project and is evaluating the project with a view to providing further funding in 2003.</P>
    <P>The Department of the Environment and Local Government funded projects to the tune of &euro;64.3 million, however there is a Dublin inner city project for which &euro;123,000 million at 1999 prices is being provided over the period 1999 to 2003. The Department did not give a figure of what was being spent over the period of RAPID &ndash; obviously, this was not a project that evolved through the RAPID programme.</P>
    <P>The Minister also states that his Department provides funding for local co-ordinators for each RAPID area, co-ordination of the programme across the Department of the Environment and Local Government and ongoing consultation with local authorities. However, no figure is put on this and some other services that local authorities provide.</P>
    <P>The Department of Education and Science spent in excess of &euro;1.9 million on proposals submitted under the RAPID programme. Some &euro;800,000 has been allocated to community groups in RAPID areas. The Minister stated that people in RAPID areas would benefit from other initiatives from the Department.</P>
    <P>The Department of Social and Family Affairs has had 18 requests from eleven RAPID areas. Payments totalling &euro;205,406 have been either allocated or approved to support these initiatives. The Department has also funded and otherwise supported initiatives within RAPID areas which were not specifically included in RAPID plans. For instance, in 2002 &euro;1.6 million was spent on family resource centres in RAPID areas and approximately 53 other initiatives.</P>
    <P>It is now two years and three months since RAPID programme strand 1 was launched and it is one year and three months since RAPID programme strand 2 was launched. Someone recently described CLÁR to me as &ldquo;money and no talk&rdquo; and RAPID as &ldquo;talk and no money&rdquo;. It should be noted that the funding for CLÁR was reduced in this year's Book of Estimates from &euro;12.7 million to &euro;9.5 million, a reduction of 25%.</P>
    <P>In regard to RAPID, the question must now be asked, where is the front-loading and where is the &euro;12.9 billion? The Government always knew that the RAPID programme would not yield the sort <Col N="90" /> of money its dishonest predictions promised. Nonetheless, it is an important programme for those who missed out on the fruits of strong economic growth.</P>
    <P>It is clear that large capital projects are being catered for and the level of service integration is poor under RAPID. It seems likely, as has been alleged in some quarters, that projects already under way in RAPID areas will now be re-labelled as RAPID projects. The Labour Party is calling on the Government to honour the commitment made to fast-track the promised funding over the RAPID programme. The only way to achieve this is to give the Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs the wherewithal to drive the programme. For this to succeed, the Department will need significant funding.</P>
    <P>The cutbacks affecting the 38 area partnerships and community groups with projects funded by area partnerships have been devastating this year. The Department's Vote for local development and social inclusion measures was reduced from &euro;47.6 million in 2002 to &euro;44.6 million in 2003, representing a decrease of 6%. However, what was even more upsetting to the area partnership companies and the community groups was that carry-over commitments and unspent money from 2002 to 2003 was disallowed. The reason for this, advanced by the Minister, Deputy Ó Cuív, was that prior to 2002, under the previous national plan, this scheme was EU-funded on a multiannual funding basis. He further stated that as this scheme is now Exchequer-funded, the Department has to operate on an annual cash basis and not on an annual accruals basis, as was the case previously.</P>
    <P>It has been reported that because of this new measure concerning the annual versus multiannual budgets, and the reduction in the Department's Vote, budget cuts of between 25% and 40% have affected some area partnerships.</P>
    <P>An estimated &euro;200 million is to become available from dormant bank accounts, to be used for social and community projects. The shortfall in regard to the CDPs can be made good from the dormant accounts fund. I strongly urge the Minister to do this. The Minister's Department could effectively kick-start and drive the programme by using this fund.</P>
    <P>We are told that some people have yet to benefit significantly from improved living standards in the State in recent years. We were told that the national development plan had up to &euro;15 billion earmarked for social inclusion measures, to be spent on development measures over the next five years, and that the RAPID programme would target the 25 most concentrated areas of disadvantage and front-load a significant share of this money to them over the next five years. A further 20 areas were added to this list later and it was promised that &euro;1.9 billion would be fast-tracked to these areas.</P>
    <P>During the general election campaign, Fianna Fáil Deputies in particular used the promise of <Col N="91" /> the RAPID programme to hoover up votes in areas that were disadvantaged and desperate for a lift. Of all the broken promises, this must be the most cynical. Derisory amounts of money have been provided under the RAPID programme. There were great expectations and hopes but they have been dashed. Worse still, the cynicism of the Government has once again led to the profession of politics being treated with revulsion.</P>
    <P>Nominally, the Minister is to co-ordinate the implementation of the programme. In fact, he can do little about it because Departments will do what they like and the money being sought has to come from their budgets. There is nobody in charge or nobody to say that one has to spend the money and that a project has to go ahead. This is no accident. Cleverly, the Government had this system in place before the last general election. There has been a cynical exercise of using people and raising expectations but, for all that, we are at the stage where this project has never been more important. The Minister needs to get it across to his colleagues, and the Taoiseach in particular, that this project must be treated seriously and got under way because the situation regarding social inclusion is getting worse.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a comprehensive Labour Party motion. It has many components but one objective, which is simply to prove that Deputy Ned O'Keeffe is correct in saying that we have the most right-wing Government this State has ever had. Over the past ten years or so we have become a sophisticated society, not only a wealthier society but a discerning society that has put in place a structure of supports that tries to tackle issues such as disadvantage and recognise that there are vulnerable communities and individuals in the State who will not, of themselves, be able to share in the fullness of the Celtic tiger or boom economy. The old axiom that a rising tide raises all boats is not necessarily true and the State has a moral imperative to assist those who are most vulnerable to ensure that basic standards are achieved.</P>
      <P>In a time of plenty one would have thought that an opportunity presented itself to any Government with a social conscience to try to create a more equal society. One would have thought that the party founded by de Valera would at least hold on to some vestigial part of his original philosophy, namely, to bring about an inclusive Ireland of equals. If the yardstick used to determine what is right wing is the deliberate and systematic transfer of resources from the weakest to the wealthiest, then Deputy Ned O'Keeffe's thesis is proven beyond doubt.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Combat Poverty Agency has analysed the first five budgets of Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats. The agency is not a partisan group or a political think-tank. It is an independent group which found that the resources transferred to the top 30% of income earners over those five years was six times the total transferred <Col N="92" /> to the bottom 30% of income earners. The Government has attempted to justify this reverse Robin Hood tactic by claiming that only 11% of the resources devoted to tax reductions went to the top rate. However, those on the top rate benefited from all the other cuts.</P>
    <P>The Combat Poverty Agency tells the true story. Its analysis was of income tax. What about capital acquisitions tax or capital gains tax, which are both at 20%? If one goes out and breaks rocks or works every hour God sends as a PAYE worker, one will pay more than double the tax paid by the land speculator who is waiting for a developer to purchase the land he or she has bought, which is no doubt properly rezoned to avail of a windfall tax at 20%. There are volumes of real evidence for this. This Administration made these decisions deliberately, systematically and inexorably to shift money from the most vulnerable into the hands of the wealthiest. This is not just a tax system, it is a culture and an economic attitude supported by this Government which has now metastasised into every aspect of Government policy. The wealthy are to be protected and those who are most vulnerable are at the end of the queue when resources are to be divided up. Consider the SSIAs, a daft scheme, which is going to cost half a billion euro a year, for five years. This money is wasted on people like me who have an SSIA and will get a 25% bonus for the money we invest in these accounts.</P>

      <P>Many people have them. There are 1.2 million of these accounts. Most people who can afford it have one. A nest egg of half a billion euro a year is being given to people who do not need it and for what purpose? That money could be invested in our social infrastructure, in hospitals, social housing, in tackling the very thing for which the Minister of State who is here to defend the Government should be responsible: tackling the scourge of homelessness on our streets and providing accommodation for the growing number of young people who are sleeping under bridges and in doorways in this city tonight. A dearth of moral understanding within this Government allows that to happen.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to tax breaks for the better off, the most recently published Revenue study shows that 30% of the 400 highest earners in the State paid less than 30% of their income in tax last year. Some paid nothing at all through the tax breaks created by the Minister for Finance. Many <Col N="93" /> are heroes in our society and choose to live offshore. Ireland has consistently shown itself to be among the most unequal countries in the developed world, alongside the US and the UK. Ireland historically had been one of the most unequal countries because of its comparative underdevelopment. The recent economic boom gave us the opportunity for once to challenge our place in the &ldquo;most unequal&rdquo; league and become, like the rest of developed northern Europe, a more equal, sustaining and supportive society. That opportunity was squandered in the past six years and it will be devastated if the policies of the past few months continue for the next four years.</P>
    <P>I want to focus on one component of our motion, the systematic dismantling of community employment. This most innovative scheme, introduced by Deputy Quinn when he was Minister for labour, has provided a support infrastructure in communities up and down the land. It has supported sports organisations, the elderly, the disabled, arts groups, environmental protection, in short, a range of activities with workers and supports they never thought they would have. Good was done in every community in the State and there are hundreds of thousands who can attest to that. Equally important, it gave dignity to people who were unemployed, who thought themselves almost unemployable and who were left out of the employment market. Many thousands of those people returned to full-time employment through CE but the ideological view of this right wing Administration is that the State cannot be involved in supporting employment. It must phase out those schemes because in a time of increasing employment we cannot have a situation where there are not enough workers for organisations such as ISME to ensure they have a constant supply of employees. Therefore, State supports that are doing so much good in communities have to be dismantled.</P>
    <P>This year one in five CE schemes, involving 5,000 individuals, is to be abolished. One puts down parliamentary questions to establish the logic behind this and the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment replies that &ldquo;FÁS prioritises CE projects according to the types of services provided and the levels of unemployment in the locality and so as to minimise any negative effects on groups and services which are most in need of programmes.&rdquo;  That is simply untrue. We all have bulging post-bags, at least I do, of correspondence from groups all over the country, and scores within my county, which provide essential services that are being reduced to the point that they are not viable because they cannot justify their insurance costs and so on. This is more than reduction, it is strangulation of many of the schemes.</P>
    <P>These groups include Wexford Community Services Council, which provides services such as meals on wheels and support for the disabled; Wexford Disability Development Limited; Our Lady's Island work and care group; Bridgetown <Col N="94" /> Community Council and the people's resource centre. These are not esoteric, irrelevant, outfits producing no good. They are important engines of development and support within communities and it is a patent falsehood to suggest that damage is not being done. The Carmichael Centre is well known in this city. The Minister of State must have received correspondence from it about the essential workers it is losing. I have communicated with FÁS on this matter to no avail. It states that centre, which provides a range of services from an important national institution, is to lose two support workers next month, June 2003. Meanwhile, the Government maintains the fiction that all essential services are being maintained.</P>
    <P>My Kilkenny colleague, Deputy Pattison, gave me a letter which he received from the Watergate group in Kilkenny. That scheme is coming to a close and the letter lists the people working in the arts area who are to lose their jobs next month. It begs us to do something about them. This is a cultural institution which has done great work for years and now that too, for the sake of the paltry difference between providing support and allowing people to be unemployed, is to be taken away and a centre of cultural excellence will be deprived of those cultural initiatives.</P>
    <P>What is the Government about? There is no coherent, sensible reason to cut schemes. It does not make economic sense. It makes no social sense. In none of the PQ replies that I have received, or debates with the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment is there any logical reason given why even in a time of significant employment these schemes should not be maintained. If there are no workers for them well and good but when there are workers who have done a job that is needed to sustain life in our communities and will otherwise remain undone why can not that be maintained? The cost is well worthwhile and the negative social costs cannot be properly quantified.</P>
    <P>I have made my case. We have a regressive Government that has abandoned any of the egalitarian principles once espoused by Fianna Fáil and has embraced in the trinity of individuals &ndash; I was going to say triumvirate but as one of them is female it would be inaccurate &ndash; which runs this Administration, namely the Taoiseach, the Tánaiste and the Minister for Finance, an ideology that is foreign to us, that is anti-community and that is wreaking devastation in the heart of communities. On these issues that we have put before the House I beg the Government to relent.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanRyan" hpid="Mr. S. Ryan Mr. S. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>This country has witnessed huge economic changes over the past ten years or so. We are now regarded as one of the world's richest countries. Major changes have taken place, particularly in the area of employment, resulting in greater prosperity, yet society is more unequal. Notwithstanding the apparent prosperity of many, there are major problems which need to be urgently addressed, such as the increasing levels <Col N="95" /> of poverty, homelessness, social exclusion and discrimination.</P>
      <P>Social exclusion is one of the major challenges facing Irish society as we move into this new century. If we as legislators do not acknowledge the extent of the problem and endeavour to address the causes, such as poor health care, crime, drug abuse and alienation, our generation of politicians will leave major problems for those who come after us. Poor people are excluded from decision-making. By and large the same poor and unemployed individuals are excluded from the main life of the community. When one is excluded, one's views are not sought, one feels disillusioned and, like many groups in society, one tends not to vote. Therefore some politicians ignore those groups, knowing that their seats will not be affected at subsequent elections. That vicious circle must be addressed.</P>
      <P>Many groups working in disadvantaged areas throughout the country initially warmly endorsed such proposed Government initiatives as RAPID. The RAPID programme had great potential, especially if it linked into the concept of community development. Once again, community activists are feeling totally disillusioned as the RAPID schemes have not been developed and there seems to be no commitment on the part of the Government to making them work.</P>
      <P>The number of community employment schemes has been systematically reduced. In my constituency, the numbers on it will be reduced by 40% this year, and that does not take into account the significant reductions made to the scheme last year. That scandalous decision has been taken by a Government that obviously has no regard for the services being provided locally through CE schemes. The range of services that will be affected by the cutbacks includes arts, senior citizens' programmes, youth work, child care and the operation of community centres and sports-related projects. All those schemes provide invaluable support to the community.</P>
      <P>On an individual level, scheme participants have developed self-esteem, social skills and work-related skills. That is particularly important when one realises that nearly 60% of participants are over 40 and 25% over 50 years of age. RAPID has never been implemented, and the social employment scheme, which provided a little dignity, training and self-fulfilment to participants, has been decimated. At the same time this discredited Government continues to implement legislation that favours its friends and those with influence. These schemes are only one small element in empowering people to help themselves. By its actions and policies, the Government has delivered a very clear message, it is not prepared to provide the resources to set in train a process to minimise social exclusion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoisinShortall" hpid="Ms Shortall Ms Shortall">
      <NameTxt>Ms Shortall</NameTxt>
      <P>The Irish public is, quite clearly, very quickly coming to realise that it was conned by the Government in last year's general election. <Col N="96" /> That con-trick was probably nowhere more cynical than in those areas most affected by poverty. At a time when many voluntary and community organisations are making huge efforts to improve living conditions and opportunities for those living in the poorest areas, the Government has slashed budgets and reneged on its promises. The Government, particularly the Taoiseach, is very good at talking the talk of social inclusion. It constantly uses the language of concern and caring, but its actions to date prove that its words are absolutely meaningless as not a single extra cent has been invested in the various programmes and services set up over recent years and specifically designed to enable people to feel included.</P>
      <P>In the few minutes available to me tonight I wish to talk about the effects of such cuts on young people in poor areas. The Minister of State will be very familiar with that since he shares a constituency with me. He is familiar with the severe effects of those cuts on people living in Ballymun and Finglas. First, there is the young people's facilities and services fund, an excellent idea that we all supported when it was set up in 1998 under the drugs task forces. The scheme was intended to provide much-needed and hitherto lacking facilities in the areas most affected by serious drug problems. Round one went ahead as promised and it has enabled many communities to provide facilities such as youth centres and sports halls and add to existing facilities to improve opportunities for people there. Round two has been promised for the past two years and was supposed to have been delivered about nine months ago.</P>
      <P>As the Minister well knows, all the local drugs task forces throughout Dublin and in Cork have come up with plans, costed them, had them evaluated and submitted them to his Department, but nine months later, they have not got a single extra cent to implement those programmes. In many disadvantaged communities, the building programmes are now nearing completion. The Minister will know that a brand new facility is almost complete in Finglas and there is another in Ballymun. The same is true of all the drugs task force areas. The difficulty now is that in the absence of round two, there are no staff to operate the centres and it is not possible to run programmes. I have heard that in Cabra, in the Taoiseach's constituency, where there is a new facility, there is talk about contracting out the gym to raise funds to employ youth workers. Those facilities, which were intended for the target group of drug users and recovering drug users, will not be available to those people because the Government has failed to deliver on round two.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Just as in the case of the lack of commitment to the implementation of the drug services, the cuts in the CE scheme are having a devastating effect. As the Minister knows, CE is the main route back into training and possible employment for recovering drug users, but as places are cut, in spite of our being assured that drug services would be ring-fenced, that is not happening. In <Col N="97" /> many areas, the quota for CE has been used up so that when recovering drug addicts come seeking a training place, they are not there and FÁS tells them that all the places have been used. That is having a huge effect and means that the whole emphasis that we have been trying to place in recent years on drug rehabilitation and getting people back into mainstream services is a joke. The places are not there because of the cuts.</P>
    <P>Equally, the Government claims that drug services will not be affected by cuts in the budget allocated to drugs task forces.All of the new programmes and services set up in recent years and mainstreamed to other State agencies are now facing cuts &ndash; there is a 2% cut for health boards and a 7% cut for vocational education committees &ndash; which are beginning to impact on those services which were supposed to be protected.</P>
    <P>The area of education services has been equally badly affected. The Education Welfare Board, arguably the most important service in terms of tackling educational disadvantage, is in a shambles. It is quite clear that there is little or no commitment, in spite of all the fine words, on the part of the Government.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelAhern" hpid="Mr. N. Ahern Mr. N. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very happy to speak on this motion on behalf of the Government and have an opportunity to refute categorically many of the claims made by the Opposition this evening. I highlight the strong and ongoing commitment of the Government to tackling social exclusion through the many programmes and initiatives it operates in disadvantaged areas. The establishment of the new Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs has provided a mechanism to focus responsibility on areas of disadvantage in urban, rural and island settings. In addressing the issues raised by the Opposition I will confine my remarks to the work being done by the Department in urban areas which fall under my area of responsibility as Minister of State.</P>
      <P>Tackling drug misuse remains one of the Government's key priorities. My Department co-ordinates the implementation of the national drugs strategy which was launched in May 2001 and brings together all elements of drugs policy into a single framework with responsibilities clearly assigned. It contains 100 separate actions across the four pillars of supply reduction, prevention, treatment and research to be carried out by a range of Departments and agencies. Under each of the four pillars, a series of objectives and key performance indicators are set.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The implementation of the strategy is continuing. Progress is monitored on an ongoing basis through regular meetings of the interdepartmental group on drugs, which I chair, as well as through six monthly progress reports to the Cabinet committee on social inclusion. The work being done by the local drugs task forces is another vital element in the ongoing fight against drugs. As many Members will be aware, there are 14 local drugs task forces in Dublin, Cork and Bray. The task forces were established in 1997 and include representatives of statutory, community and voluntary sectors as well as local public representatives, including many Deputies who will be aware of the ongoing valuable work that task forces do, as I was during my time on the Ballymun drugs task force with Deputy Shortall. Their purpose is, through partnership, to address the service gaps in the area and co-ordinate existing services. They have had an enormous impact in recent years. They do this by means of prepar<Col N="99" /> ing a local action plan which includes a range of measures in relation to treatment, rehabilitation, education, prevention and curbing local supply.</P>
    <P>The local drugs task forces have been a very effective way of delivering services and engaging local communities. They are an excellent example of how Departments, State agencies, front-line workers, the community and politicians can work together in partnership. I commend the commitment and hard work of the many individuals and agencies involved in this process. Most task forces are implementing their second round action plans. To date, the two plans have funded approximately 500 local projects. In monetary terms, since 1997, over &euro;130 million has been either spent or allocated to projects in the local drugs task force areas through the two local action plans &ndash;&euro;65 million &ndash; the premises initiative for drugs projects &ndash;&euro;11.5 million &ndash; and the young people's facilities and services fund &ndash;&euro;54 million.</P>
    <P>In 2003 the allocation for the drugs subhead has increased by approximately 16% over 2002. This subhead funds the work of the local drugs task forces, the premises initiative for drugs projects and the national advisory committee on drugs. This shows very clearly that the drugs issue remains a priority for the Government and rather than starving the drugs strategy of funding, it has, in fact, increased the level of funding available in 2003.</P>
    <P>Turning now to the young people's facilities and services fund, Members will be aware that it was established in 1998 as part of the Government's overall strategy to tackle drug misuse. It aims to assist in the development of youth facilities, including sports and recreational facilities, and services in disadvantaged areas where there is a significant drug problem or has the potential to develop. Its overall objective is to attract &ldquo;at risk&rdquo; young people in disadvantaged areas into these facilities and activities and divert them away from the dangers of substance abuse. The target group for the fund are ten to 21 year olds who are marginalised through a combination of risk factors relating to family background, environmental circumstances, educational disadvantage, involvement in crime and-or drugs, etc.</P>
    <P>While the main focus of the fund has been on the local drugs task force areas, funding has also been allocated to a number of urban areas where there is a serious drug problem or has the potential to develop. The target areas selected were Galway, Limerick, Waterford and Carlow. A separate allocation was also made to seven voluntary organisations to deliver drug prevention and education programmes, including peer education programmes, on a national basis.</P>
    <P>Since 1998 an amount of &euro;68.2 million has been allocated under the fund, the bulk of which &ndash;&euro;54 million &ndash; has been allocated to local drugs task force areas. The overall amount allocated also includes funding of &euro;9.1 million for the <Col N="100" /> Springboard initiative managed by the Department of Health and Children.</P>
    <P>In broad terms, approximately 350 facility and services projects are being supported under the fund. These initiatives fall into seven broad areas as follows: the building, renovating or fitting out of community centres, youth facilities and sports clubs so as to provide suitable accommodation for programmes and services geared for the most &ldquo;at risk&rdquo; young people in an area, as access for the target group is an essential condition of funding for capital projects; a number of purpose-built youth centres are being funded which will provide a focal point for youth activities in an area, particularly in areas such as Tallaght, Ballymun, Clondalkin, Blanchardstown in Dublin, and in Cork, where there has been a dearth of dedicated youth facilities-&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy should wait until they are built. The remaining areas are as follows: over 85 youth and outreach workers have been appointed to work on the ground with the target group offering developmental activities and educational programmes for young people who have traditionally found themselves outside the scope of mainstream youth work due to family background, involvement with crime or drugs or through lack of education; ten sports workers have been employed to encourage greater involvement of the target group in sports and recreational activities, and I am aware of the good work being done in my own constituency by some of these workers, and I would like there to be more of them; a wide variety of community-based prevention/education programmes, including early school leaving programmes; sports and recreational activities; family support programmes; art, drama and music programmes; counselling and transport services are being supported; a number of targeted interventions for particular groups such as youth work; and a number of national drugs education and training officers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As Deputies will see, therefore, a large and varied number of programmes and activities are being funded. The fund is regarded as an important element of the overall national drugs strategy, particularly the prevention pillar, and has been positively received in local drugs task force areas since it commenced five years ago. These areas, as many Deputies will know from personal experience, had been marked by a serious shortage of sports, youth and community facilities and services. Many of the clubs and community groups in those areas had traditionally been unable to access funding from other mainstream schemes to the same extent as other more affluent areas. What the fund is about, therefore, is trying to strengthen and support those communities in their efforts to prevent young people drifting into drug misuse, and the Government <Col N="101" /> remains committed to the fund and its overall objectives.</P>
    <P>In terms of the current position regarding the fund, the national assessment committee, which is chaired by my Department, is currently examining the services projects funded under round 1 of the fund. The intention would be that where they are found to be effective they will be mainstreamed, thereby enabling their ongoing provision by statutory agencies.</P>
    <P>Qualification for continued funding will be dependent on the successful evaluation of each project by the services steering group, which has been set up to examine the projects, and sufficient funding being in place. I understand the work of the steering group has been completed and recommendations will be going to the Cabinet committee on social inclusion at its June meeting. Development groups will be informed of the outcome as soon as possible thereafter.</P>
    <P>The position regarding the funding of additional proposals is being considered by the assessment committee which is having ongoing discussions with the relevant Departments and agencies involved.</P>
    <P>Recently, the Cabinet committee also considered a number of issues regarding the operation of the fund, including its future funding. The matter will be kept under review and the Cabinet committee will be returning to the issue again at its next meeting.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I will now outline the position regarding funding for community development programmes. Despite the changed economic circumstances in which we are now operating, there has been no reduction in the funding allocated to community development support programmes. This is in recognition of the importance of these programmes as a mechanism for achieving social inclusion. Some &euro;25.3 million was spent on community development support programmes last year and a similar allocation has been made for this year.</P>
      <P>Even without an overall increase in budget, I have been able to fund an additional 15 projects from this budget in the current year. I am also pleased that established projects have not experienced any reductions in their core budgets this year. The funding for the 15 new projects has been made available through savings on the administration costs of the programme and I am hopeful that further savings in administration costs will enable me to announce funding for further projects next year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="102" />In keeping with the overall aims of the programme, priority in funding these new projects has been given to disadvantaged communities. The 15 projects which will commence from September are in Achill, Bluebell, Dolphin House flats complex, east Clare, Inchicore, Longford, Merchants Quay/Ushers Quay, Newbridge, Erris, County Mayo, north-west Roscommon, south-east Galway, south-west Cavan, Thurles, Tipperary Travellers and west Limerick.</P>
    <P>I am sure Deputies of all parties will recognise the importance of this expansion in the programme. Each project will receive a renewable one-year contract for funding totalling &euro;60,000. The Department is in discussion with these projects to organise their start-up and to explore possibilities regarding appropriate linkages and supports with other local agencies.</P>
    <P>The community development programme gives important recognition to the role of community development in tackling poverty and disadvantage. The programme has developed a network of community development resource centres and projects in communities affected by high unemployment, poverty and disadvantage. The programme also provides project funding to particular disadvantaged communities, such as Travellers, lone parents, the homeless, the unemployed, people with disabilities or elderly people who live in isolated circumstances.</P>
    <P>The programme provides core funding to cover the cost of up to two full-time staff and funding towards overhead and administration costs associated with running a resource centre. The number of projects in the community development programme has grown from nine in 1990 to 190 today. Among the important activities funded are the provision of practical assistance to community groups and some other items outlined in my script which I will pass over because they are probably well known.</P>
    <P>As I made clear in March 2003 when I announced funding for 15 new projects this year, the Government remains firmly committed to supporting the important work in disadvantaged communities which the community development programme funds. This commitment will be reflected by a further expected increase in the number of projects in 2004.</P>
    <P>As I have indicated to the Dáil on a number of occasions, my Department is currently reviewing the operation of the various programmes which come under my remit with a view to streamlining funding and eliminating overlap and duplication between programmes. A widespread consultation process is currently nearing completion and my Department will host a conference in June to enable the various bodies and agencies articulate their views.</P>
    <P>In order to enable this process to take place, all CDP projects have been placed on co-terminus one-year contracts. Following the review process, decisions will be made regarding the appropriate term of funding for projects into the future. I appreciate that the switch to one-year <Col N="103" /> funding has led to concerns among projects about the long-term future, but they can be assured that no project which is working well and making a difference to its community has anything to fear from this process. Rather, by achieving greater coherence between different programmes and reducing the bureaucracy and administrative burden for projects, it is my hope that a greater proportion of the overall budget will be directed at meeting the needs of disadvantaged communities. The fact that I have been able to fund 15 additional projects in the current year without recourse to additional funding, illustrates the way forward in this respect.</P>
    <P>I would also like to touch briefly on the progress being made in implementing the White Paper, Supporting Voluntary Activity, which was published in September 2000. The White Paper marked a commitment to the Government's long-term strategy of developing and supporting the community and voluntary sector. It sets out the rationale for developing the relationship between the State and the sector and the principles which should underpin this relationship.</P>
    <P>The White Paper made provision for two main funding schemes to provide ongoing development and support to the community and voluntary sector. Under the funding scheme for federations, networks and umbrella organisations, funding totalling &euro;1.827 million will be allocated to projects by the end of July this year. Due to the multiannual nature of the scheme, it is being administered on the basis of similar levels of funding being available in years two and three. This scheme was initially advertised in 2001 but a number of issues arose in the course of processing the applications which it was considered could give rise to legal challenge. In order to ensure that eventual funding decisions would command full public confidence, it was considered necessary to re-advertise the scheme and to seek fresh applications. It was decided also that consultants should be recruited to complete the assessment in the interests of ensuring the independence and impartiality of the process.</P>
    <P>The scheme was re-advertised in March 2003 with revised guidelines and application forms. The closing date for applications was 11 April&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I clearly explained the legal difficulties. A total of 132 applications were received and acknowledged by the Department. We want to spend the money on the communities and not give more of it to barristers. I look forward to announcing the successful applicants in July.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under the scheme for training and supports in the community and voluntary sector, funding totalling &euro;600,000 will also be announced in July. The scheme is being administered on the basis of at least similar levels of funding being available in years two and three. The scheme was adver<Col N="104" /> tised in March 2002 with a closing date of 7 May 2002. There was a strong response with 540 applications received. It was decided that in order to expedite matters and in the interests of transparency of assessment, independent consultants would be recruited for the task. The decision to recruit consultants follows the decision to do likewise on its sister scheme.</P>
    <P>In addition to the schemes established through the White Paper, my Department will also provide grants for locally based community and voluntary organisations to fund equipment, refurbishment and education and training projects. A budget of &euro;2.5 million has been set aside this year for the scheme, details of which will be advertised in the national newspapers in the next few weeks.</P>
    <P>The Government's ongoing commitment to core funding and training support in the community and voluntary sector is illustrated by the funding of these schemes. As the White Paper states:</P>
    <P>Voluntary activity forms the very core of all vibrant and inclusive societies. This White Paper signals a very clear intention of the Government to invest in enabling the voluntary sector to serve individuals, communities and the country as a whole.</P>

I am glad the committee played a role in highlighting these issues. We brought before us ComReg and some of these issues are now being addressed.</P>

      <P>They have not been cut back. The Inishowen Women's Network recently completed a project in which it collated information from women around the area. It is now working to find out what are the outstanding issues, of which there are some, which need to be addressed. Last Friday the Inishowen Disability Network celebrated getting a new wheelchair-friendly bus which has greatly enhanced access and the ability of its members to get around the peninsula.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I also welcome the role of the various tidy towns organisations and voluntary groups, such as the many branches of Care for the Aged, the Society of St. Vincent de Paul and other development associations working in partnership with State agencies to develop facilities on the ground. <Col N="106" /> Working at grassroots level, these groups work out the problems they face, rather than have solutions imposed from above. The Inishowen Women's Network did precisely this last week when it presented the information it gathered on the ground with the support of various Departments. This work will yield real success on the ground, which is as it should be.</P>
    <P>Last week, the Minister for Social and Family Affairs, Deputy Coughlan, launched the Family Support Agency and the support for families directory. These initiatives will affect rural communities by providing support for voluntary organisations, real information and support for people who need it.</P>

      <P>Of all the measures on which I commend the Minister, the most important perhaps is the CLÁR programme which he initiated. The Opposition talks a great deal about what it would do if it were in government and what the Fianna Fáil Party is not doing. The CLÁR programme has been put in place and is so successful that every community I visit, which is not already involved in it, is clambering to get involved. What are the results? There are many pages here outlining the support it has provided, whether for bilingual signage, top-up schemes for sports capital grants, basic projects such as group water and sewerage schemes, village enhancement schemes, LIS programmes, county roads, community initiatives, enterprise units, electricity, health and telecommunications. Much more needs to be done and it is important we press ahead with infrastructure, expand the CLÁR programme, proceed with the decentralisation programme and ensure the national spatial strategy results in the creation of local business in rural areas. We must also ensure we continue to disperse facilities and resources. There is a lot done and more to do&mdash;</P>

      <P>I have been here for only a year and ask Members to give me a chance. I welcome the opportunity to briefly speak on the motion. I was sent to the House by the people of Tallaght, Firhouse, Greenhills and Templeogue to represent their interests. As far as this issue is concerned, I can speak with enormous authority about my life and experiences in Tallaght. I compliment the Minister and the Minister of State <Col N="107" /> who have shown immense interest in and support for the work we are doing. The Minister has a good grasp of his brief.</P>
      <P>Tallaght has had a difficult day. Apart from all the other matters with which I and my colleagues must cope on a daily basis, Tallaght has had a black day today with the loss of 120 jobs. This focuses my attention, particularly when I am discussing social inclusion. It is important that as a Fianna Fáil backbencher I remind the Government of our commitment to social inclusion. I hope all Members understand that at a time when boats need to rise, the smaller boats will always be in trouble.</P>
      <P>Like other colleagues, I represent disadvantaged communities. I do not single them out in a negative manner as there are many positive things happening in the communities of Tallaght, Killinarden, Jobstown, Brookfield and the many other estates one often hears about. We need to be positive about these estates because the communities living in them were let down by all of us in society. They were moved into housing estates which were not properly&mdash;</P>

Happily, Tallaght is a different place than it was 12 years ago. The Minister of State at the Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs, Deputy Noel Ahern, will visit the area tomorrow night and the Minister, Deputy Ó Cuív, has been in the area at my invitation on a number of occasions and has seen the positive work that has been done and the need for infrastructure and facilities. I am glad that as a result of the joint efforts of many Members and others, the Tallaght west estates can look forward to good times. Many new developments are proceeding, including a new swimming pool in Jobstown and a new community centre in Brookfield. There are also many other issues on which we wish to press the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I remind the House of the considerable media attention focused in recent days on questions described by some media pundits as middle class issues. I have no problem with that description and will support those causes. All of us have disadvantaged communities in our constituencies. <Col N="108" /> Those people are on the margins and they deserve our support. The Minister is doing a good job.

    </Speaker>
    <P>I compliment the Labour Party for tabling this important motion which clearly outlines the areas of disadvantage where poor people and communities are trying to build themselves up through various schemes. In almost every respect, these schemes have been reduced. Great work was done through FÁS and community employ<Col N="109" /> ment schemes to help communities, sports organisations, the elderly and the environment. These have been cut by 50% in the past two years. I suppose that is a lie as well. I am sure the Taoiseach has received representations from the Carmichael centre in his constituency which lost two supervisors in the past couple of weeks who cannot be replaced. The schemes which were valuable in building up many areas of the city centre will have to be abandoned because of the cutbacks initiated by the Government to pay for its extravagance in the past three years. It is correcting the nation's finances on the backs of the disadvantaged and at the expense of jobs.</P>
    <P>Many community groups which I and other Deputies meet throughout the country know that the nation's purse strings must be tightened because of the extravagance of recent years in terms of increases of 20% to 25%. We are affecting people who should be supported. These people should be the last line of defence. Many programmes, such as the RAPID and Leader programmes, were announced in a fanfare of publicity before the election to get votes in vulnerable areas from vulnerable people. They were robbed of their intellect by the Government and cynically exploited for votes. However, the Government does not have any money now to honour the lavish promises made before the election by Fianna Fáil candidates who knocked on doors and made leaflet drops.</P>
    <P>Deputy Keaveney referred to the great work being done in Donegal. Some 4,500 jobs have been lost in the past two and a half years in Donegal, but nothing has been done to replace them. It will take a lot to replace these jobs because, as a result of the huge indirect charges imposed on jobs and businesses by the Government, Ireland is not a competitive economy. I am surprised at the Progressive Democrats Party, which is supposed to be pro-enterprise. The Progressive Democrats are far from that, as can be seen from the actions of the Tánaiste and the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform at the Cabinet table. They have agreed with all the indirect tax increases in order to pay for the insanity, according to the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, that prevailed before the last general election.</P>

      <P>Task force reports are building up in the Department, but, unfortunately, nothing has been done to implement them. Some 800 jobs are being lost every week. Businesses know that it is difficult to meet the cost of compliance, of employing people and of paying the indirect charges associated with setting up a business. There is such a bureaucratic system for small businesses that it is more attractive for people to go to eastern Europe than to build up a business in this country.</P>
      <P>As regards insurance costs, the Government had three and a half years to carry out a report on insurance costs, which is the biggest issue facing businesses. However, it is one year since the report was published and we are now being told it will be another year before the meat of the proposals contained in it &ndash; I refer here to the establishment of the Personal Injuries Assessment Board &ndash; will be implemented. We want action, not words. The people are getting fed up with reports, commissions and surveys.</P>
      <P>The people want action which does not damage employment or community groups. They want people to be able to aspire to equality of opportunity in the workplace and to get on a community employment training scheme. They do not want a policy implemented that will abolish the back-to-work allowance scheme which provides an opportunity for people to get back into employment. The Government has abolished that and is, therefore, making decisions which are damaging employment.</P>
      <P>The school completion programme and the stay at school retention initiative, which are valuable, are being starved of funding. People involved in second level education are currently making decisions about the scheme because they will not have the money when it resumes in September or October. The school completion programme was excellent in terms of keeping disadvantaged pupils at school. The Government has cut back that scheme, which means there is another group of disadvantaged people in our society. The Government is responsible for these problems which it has created. It is now its job to resolve them.</P>

      <P>I did not expect the Minister to have the brass neck to deny the facts. Partnership communities throughout the country are up in arms about budgetary matters. They expected multiannual funding. Breakfast clubs, community groups, etc., spent money before Christmas in anticipation of that funding. However, they were not able to draw down the money in January because ADM Limited told them it was not available. What happened to the multiannual funding? Multiannual funding did not take place. The Minister met the group representing the partnerships recently and said he wanted to examine the issue of partnerships which, in the expectation of multiannual funding, spent extra money last year because no money is available for them now. I will table a parliamentary question to the Minister next week to find out what has happened to the money on a partnership by partnership basis.</P>

      <P>Deputies Hogan and O'Dowd referred to the schools building programme and the initiatives designed to prevent early school leaving. There is no doubt funding for them has been cut. The Minister for Education and Science and his Department decided that this body would have the fundamental responsibility for ensuring that children attend school, but it is not in operation. The National Educational Welfare Board was established last July with responsibility for school attendance of children aged six and over. The board is supposed to ensure they attend a recognised school or otherwise receive a certain minimum education. I accept this service was to be developed on a phased basis, which is fine, but the pace of development has been pathetic. A total of 300 educational welfare officers were supposed to have been appointed, yet only 23 are in place. That is not even 10% of the requirement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is unbelievable that responsibility can be taken from one group of workers and transferred to another without people being appointed to deal with the workload. The Garda had responsibility for school attendance until the establishment of the board last July. The service is in chaos and, while gardaí are not supposed to carry out this function, they are still doing so in communities even though they are not legally required to do so. That raises issues for the Garda in terms of its resources. Gardaí who undertook the task previously in small rural communities and in inner city areas recognise there is a vacuum and are trying with limited resources to <Col N="113" /> address the problem. However, it is the responsibility of the National Educational Welfare Board to fulfil this function.</P>

    <Speaker pid="OlwynEnrightFG" hpid="Ms Enright Ms Enright">
      <NameTxt>Ms Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>Under the Education (Welfare) Act, schools must also fulfil legal responsibilities. They are required to monitor attendance and report suspensions of more than six days, absences of more than 20 days a year and expulsions to educational welfare officers but there are few officers to whom they can report. There are only 13 officers to cover hundreds of schools. How are they supposed to get anything done? It is inexcusable that the board is operating in this manner.</P>
      <P>The board had to write to schools last February to inform them that in many cases it could not follow up on reported cases of excessive absence. The board has admitted it is not in a position to carry out the function for which it had been appointed. Schools to which an educational welfare officer has not been appointed do not have a mechanism to address school attendance problems. What are the schools supposed to do? The blame must rest with the Minister for Education and Science for his failure to act on this issue. A total of 800 primary school children drop out of the education system every year while 19% of secondary school students do not complete the leaving certificate. How can such appalling statistics be addressed if the educational welfare board is not established properly? This is not acceptable and this issue is not being taken seriously.</P>
      <P>The Government is paying lip service to students, particularly those from disadvantaged backgrounds. The programme for Government promised to ensure mature students and those from disadvantaged backgrounds would be given assistance to reach third level, illiteracy would be challenged and early school leavers would receive a second chance through adult education courses, yet keeping pupils in the school system in the first place is not being addressed. Stage 2 cannot be undertaken unless stage 1 has been completed properly.</P>
      <P>Before the Estimates were introduced last year, the Department cut expenditure for these programmes. Investment in initiatives designed to reduce the school drop-out rate was reduced by &euro;6 million while programmes to help disadvantaged school leavers make it to third level were reduced by &euro;5 million. The Department is paying lip service to them. Funding and facilities must be put in place if early school leaving is to be tackled but that is not happening.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Research demonstrates that the drop-out rate among those who attend third level through access initiatives is lower than those who attend through the usual channels. They are determined to complete third level because a great deal has been invested in them. Slashing investment in these people is particularly cruel because they are <Col N="114" /> determined to stay in the system if they are given the support.</P>

      <P>It is the Minister for Education and Science's responsibility to ensure these initiatives are up and running and he is not doing so.</P>
      <P>There are also serious problems in terms of the career guidance that is available to students who remain in second level education. In 1983 there was one career guidance counsellor for every 250 students and few third level courses were on offer. The institutes of technology infrastructure had not been developed. However, there are now hundreds of courses available, including PLC and apprenticeship courses, and there are more third level institutions, yet there is only one career guidance counsellor for every 500 students. This makes no sense and this issue must be addressed if people from disadvantaged backgrounds are to have a chance of making it to third level. They need more assistance in selecting courses that are suited to them because they receive little currently.</P>
      <P>The 24% reduction in funding for universities and the 33% reduction in funding for capital projects in institutes of technology are also having a seriously negative effect. The reduction in funding for institutes of technology is particularly harsh given that statistics show that people from disadvantaged backgrounds are more likely to attend these institutions.</P>

      <P>I have offered to share time with Deputy Crowe. I do not see him in the House, but I hope I will be able to do so should he appear.</P>
      <P>I raise this issue on what has been a black day for my constituency, with the announcement of 120 job losses at Gallaher's, Tallaght. As public representatives, we understand the importance of job creation in our areas. What we need in our constituencies, and in south-west Tallaght in particular, is job creation. I acknowledge the presence of Minister of State, Deputy Treacy, in the House and I would appreciate if he would convey to the Minister my concern regarding CE schemes in my constituency.</P>
      <P>Community employment schemes have served communities well. A number of organisations have benefited in critical ways from such schemes. I am a board member of the Tallaght Welfare Society. I was previously a board member of Get Tallaght Working and I have been involved in other organisations such as the Tallaght centre for the unemployed. We are receiving mixed messages about what is proposed in relation to CE schemes. Disadvantaged communities should, as a right, get as much discrimination towards their needs as is possible. One could make a political point on the needs of RAPID areas. Like other colleagues, I represent RAPID areas in Tallaght west, Killinarden, Brookfield, Jobstown and Fettercairn.</P>
      <P>I ask the Minister of State to make a definite commitment during the debate on this issue to take care of RAPID areas in terms of CE schemes. It is important that he understand the need to provide clarity in respect of such schemes. I realise that these are operational matters for FÁS, but we are receiving mixed messages from that organisation. We are told that the cuts will not be as severe as we were led to believe. I understand that FÁS management met representatives of the Tallaght partnership in recent days. The message which came from that meeting was anything but positive. I need assurances from the Minister of State in that regard.</P>
      <P>A number of organisations gathered under the auspices of the Tallaght centre for the unemployed on two separate Mondays in recent months. We had a long discussion, under the chairmanship of Senator O'Toole, during which the organisations made clear to us how difficult it is for them to manage those schemes. We need to continue to support these schemes as much as possible and we must ensure that the agency is instructed to look after disadvantaged communities. I hope the Minister of State can give me assurances in that regard.</P>
      <P>I also hope he can give me a commitment to visit, at our invitation, Tallaght over the next couple of weeks to see for himself the good work being done there.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Crowe</NameTxt>
      <P>There is broad consensus across the political divide on this issue. A climate of fear exists in many estates in Tallaght. More than 100 people representing the different schemes attended the meeting to which Deputy O'Connor referred. People are worried. Ciscom, which has been responsible for the training of more than 8,500 people, will cease to exist because it depends on CE schemes for assistance in its training programme. That is but one example.</P>
      <P>Many Deputies recalled the &ldquo;wastelands&rdquo; in an earlier debate. We have the facilities, but there is a danger they will close because there is no one to staff them. Community employment schemes are about upskilling people. Tallaght is an unemployment blackspot; it has the second highest rate of unemployment in Dublin. We cannot afford to lose 200 to 300 jobs as a result of cutbacks in the FÁS budget.</P>
      <P>I appeal to the Minister of State to intervene in this matter. We are not seeking special treatment, but Tallaght is a disadvantaged community. We have sought a meeting between the Taoiseach and the various Deputies and Senators from the area. I hope the Taoiseach will facilitate such a meeting to discuss the fears and concerns of those involved.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. Treacy Mr. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture and Food (Mr. Treacy)</NameTxt>
      <P>The primary purpose of the community employment, CE, programme as an active labour market programme is to provide long-term unemployed persons with the necessary skills and confidence to take up employment in the open labour market. The programme is targeted at persons over 25 years of age and in receipt of certain welfare payments for a minimum of one year.</P>
      <P>In accordance with the Government's decision in 1999 to restructure community employment, participation levels are gradually being reduced. This reflects the significant reduction in the numbers of the long-term unemployed and the shift in emphasis away from work experience programmes to training, from which there is a greater level of progression to employment. We consider the reduction in the level of CE places available over the past number of years warranted given the availability of employment opportunities and based on the evidence that community employment in its current form is not as effective as other measures in enhancing employability. The existence of large numbers of persons on community employment during a period of labour market shortages is not appropriate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The average participation rate on the CE programme for 2003 is expected to be in the region of 22,000. Funding amounting to &euro;274 million has been provided for this purpose. There were 24,991 participants on community employment at the end of 2002 and this number will reduce to a projected participation rate of 20,000 by end 2003. FÁS prioritises community employment projects according to the types of services provided, the value of the service to the community <Col N="117" /> and the quality of the projects performance to date. Reductions in CE places are co-ordinated in order to minimise, as far as possible, any negative effects on groups and services most in need of the programme. Drugs task force activity and child care service provision are ring-fenced from any reductions and projects in RAPID areas are given priority.</P>
    <P>Community employment places in the health sector, which includes personal assistant services, are being maintained at existing levels to ensure continuity of the delivery of these services. Projects outside of these priority areas will be approved by FÁS in an equitable, transparent and consistent manner, subject to the overall level of places and funding available.</P>
    <P>The Government is very much aware of the important contribution that CE has made to the development of services for local communities over the years and the difficulties which now arise for sponsor organisations in the voluntary and community sector due to the reduction in the level of funding available for the programme. In this context, a cross-departmental group of senior officials has been asked to consider options for the future of community employment, taking account of the link with the provision of community services. The Departments of the Taoiseach, Finance, Social and Family Affairs and Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs and FÁS are represented on the review group. FÁS is also undertaking an internal review of CE and the job initiative programme which is well advanced and should be finalised shortly.</P>
    <P>In addition, the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness mandated review of active labour market programmes is being progressed under the aegis of the standing committee on the labour market chaired by my Department. This committee includes representatives of the community pillar, employers and trade unions, as well as certain Government Departments and FÁS. A key element of the review of active labour market programmes will be towards reorienting these programmes in the future to focus on the needs of disadvantaged groups. The standing committee also hopes to conclude their deliberations by end of June 2003.</P>
    <P>While CE was established as a scheme to progress the long-term unemployed and other disadvantaged groups towards gainful employment, it has, for a variety of reasons, broadened its focus to include the development and resourcing of community services. This is the reality which must be addressed going forward. The outcome of the various reviews under way will inform the Government's consideration of options for the future delivery of community services and appropriate levels of community employment for the future.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">

      <P>The matter I propose to raise could, if it is not brought under control, lead to a <Col N="118" /> disaster for the cattle industry if there was to be another outbreak of foot and mouth disease or a wider expansion of BSE. The key issue is the disposal of meat and bonemeal which, as the House is aware, was considered to be a causal factor of BSE. The current situation is that a subsidy is being paid to the rendering industry to dispose of them. This subsidy is &euro;250 per tonne in the Republic. A subsidy of &euro;190 per tonne is being paid to a Northern Ireland renderer for getting rid of bonemeal from the South in Northern Ireland. The difference is &euro;60 per tonne. However, the Northern Ireland renderer is allowed under Northern Ireland regulations to dispose of this meat and bonemeal in a landfill site.</P>
      <P>As we know, landfill is much cheaper than incineration. The difference in the cost factor between the Southern rendering industry which has to incinerate its waste and the Northern renderer who does not and can dispose of it by landfill is somewhere in the region of &euro;150 per tonne. The difference in the subsidy is only &euro;60 per tonne. Furthermore, it is not open to renderers in the Republic to import offal from Britain or Northern Ireland to keep their plants going. While offal can be exported to Northern Ireland, it cannot be imported. As a result, the rendering industry in the Republic is in severe financial difficulty and, despite the very large investments made, runs the risk of going out of business unless this inequity in competition is resolved.</P>
      <P>The encouragement of the export of offal to Northern Ireland and ultimately to Britain also is not wise from an animal health point of view. This material is potentially very infectious. One does not have to be a veterinary surgeon to contemplate the seriousness of it travelling either across the Irish Sea or the length and breadth of Ireland to be rendered in Northern Ireland. It is not appropriate that we are encouraging a trade in offal. We should endeavour to have it rendered and disposed of close to its point of origin but the current arrangements are having the opposite effect. They are encouraging long distance traffic in offal.</P>
      <P>Apart from this, and more importantly, the differential in the subsidy and the different regulations in Northern Ireland which allow disposal by landfill will ultimately cause the destruction of the industry here. My understanding is that from 1 June the subsidy will be abolished but that will not solve the problem. At that stage, in the absence of subsidies, the situation of Southern renderers will get even worse because the entire difference will be &euro;150 per tonne due to the respective methods of disposal available to Northern and Southern renderers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The solution is to stop exportation of offal from one jurisdiction to the other altogether or, alternatively, for uniform regulations to be introduced in regard to disposal, North and South. In other words, incineration would be required in the North just as it is required here. The present situation is clearly in breach of EU competition <Col N="119" /> rules. If the matter was to be brought to the attention of the EU authorities in either the agriculture or competition directorates, they would find the current arrangements to be both unwise from a health point of view and in breach of competition rules because they represent unfair competition between persons involved in the same business across borders. As the Minister of State is no doubt aware, this is illegal under Article 86 and other articles of the current EU treaty. I hope he will be able to give me a clear response as this is a matter of considerable urgency.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. Treacy Mr. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>The livestock sector generates over half a million tonnes of animal offal per annum. Two thirds of this was traditionally rendered into meat and bonemeal and used in the manufacture of animal feed, of which 90% was exported. In November 2000 new EU measures designed to control the spread of BSE were introduced banning the feeding of meat and bonemeal to farmed animals. That ban remains in place. As a result, meat and bonemeal was transformed from a commercially valuable product into a waste material with a significant disposal cost.</P>
      <P>In January 2001, to address the situation faced by the cattle sector and against the background of particular difficulties being faced by the beef sector due to the closure of non-EU markets, the Department of Agriculture and Food introduced a subsidy towards the cost of rendering offal into meat and bonemeal and its subsequent storage and disposal. It was always intended that the subsidy would be short-term to facilitate an adjustment by the livestock sector to the changed legislative environment and the difficulties in the beef market at the time. Since then the level of subsidy has been gradually reduced and financial responsibility for disposing of the offal returned to the industry.</P>
      <P>In 2001 the Exchequer contribution to the rendering and disposal of meat and bonemeal was &euro;66 million. The figure for 2002 was &euro;44 million and the estimated amount for 2003 is &euro;36 million. Since the introduction of the subsidy, the overall expenditure provided by the Government has been &euro;146 million. In the absence of domestic disposal facilities for meat and bonemeal, there has been limited disposal of stocks. There are 170,000 tonnes in store awaiting disposal. When this material is eventually disposed of abroad, it could cost the State approximately &euro;34 million at existing charges. Therefore, the overall level of Exchequer support to the rendering sector since January 2001 is of the order of &euro;180 million. These figures do not include the cost of other support schemes which involve rendering costs. For example, there was significant expenditure on the purchase for destruction and special purchase schemes introduced to support the beef market since 2001.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In summary, the Government has been more than generous in its support of the livestock sector with public funding of some &euro;600 million to <Col N="120" /> help it through the crisis times of 2001 and 2002. While the rendering sector has provided a very valuable service in implementing these schemes &ndash; I acknowledge this as someone with first-hand experience of the rendering industry &ndash; the sector has benefited significantly from Exchequer spending. It continues to benefit financially from Government support for the rendering of fallen animals and BSE herds.</P>
    <P>It is the absence of disposal outlets for meat and bonemeal in Ireland which is at the root of the current problems for the rendering sector. The requirement to export meat and bonemeal is a cost for the livestock sector which has become more apparent with the reduction in the level of the subsidy. The meat processing sector has sought to reduce the cost of rendering. One of the options explored has been the export of offal to Northern Ireland for rendering and disposal there. The movement of offal, from one member state to another, once taken from animals passed fit for human consumption, is provided for under the new EU animal by-products legislation.</P>
    <P>Since the beginning of the year export of offal to Northern Ireland on a relatively small scale has commenced. A reduced level of rendering subsidy has been paid in respect of such exports to reflect the availability of lower cost of disposal of meat and bonemeal to landfill in Northern Ireland. The main advantage available to Northern Ireland renderers is not the payment of a rendering subsidy but the availability to them of lower cost disposal of meat and bonemeal by means of landfill. This is apparently a more economic disposal option than sending meat and bonemeal for incineration in the United Kingdom or Germany. As the Deputy knows full well, we have been exporting these products &ndash; meat and bonemeal, chemical residue and so on &ndash; to Germany, Holland and the United Kingdom for incineration for many years at huge cost to the Exchequer.</P>
    <P>Every effort should be made to make use of meat and bonemeal in a way that extracts maximum value from them, in either energy production or industrial use, thereby reducing disposal costs. This is the situation in many other member states. This would be of benefit to the economy generally in terms of reducing the use of fossil fuels and also of benefit to the agriculture sector. Any disposal facilities would have to fully comply with the environmental and planning requirements of the relevant regulatory authorities and be in full compliance with EU animal by-product regulations.</P>
    <P>In summary, the issue is that the rendering industry is now facing a situation where the lack of domestic disposal outlets is putting it at a competitive disadvantage <i>vis-à-vis</i> the rendering industry in Northern Ireland and, possibly, the United Kingdom&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Perry</NameTxt>
      <P>This matter deals with the most appalling case of educational neglect I have seen in Sligo city. There have been 20 years of promises and no relief in sight. In the past week significant attention has been given to the shortcomings and broken promises in primary and third level education. The case of the Ursuline College in Sligo demonstrates that our secondary schools are also under significant pressure.</P>
      <P>Why has the proposed extension to the Ursuline College again been postponed? The Department has all the details of the substandard state of the classrooms, corridors and facilities and of the unaccountable delays by the Department of Education and Science in providing information on the planning stages. In 1983, Department inspectors considered the school unfit and unsafe for 500 students; in 2003, 650 students use the same facilities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I cannot understand why the Ursuline College building project should be described as &ldquo;very necessary&rdquo; as opposed to &ldquo;urgent&rdquo;. The Department's criteria under which a building project has been designated as urgent includes the fact that the need is such that failing to address it will impact heavily and negatively on the day-to-day <Col N="122" /> functioning of the school. In effect, addressing the need is simply not discretionary.</P>
    <P>The Ursuline College is educating 650 students in substandard accommodation, some of which was built before 1860. There are 439 home economics students with only one home economics kitchen. There are 732 students taking all the sciences with one ill-equipped science room. New syllabi in biology, chemistry, physics and junior certificate science create significant difficulties at curricular and health and safety levels. Technology facilities are appalling, and students and teachers work in conditions that represent a health and safety hazard. For 287 art students there is one art room. The PE facilities for 650 students comprise one small, unequipped hall and one hockey pitch. Classrooms and corridors, built for a school of 250, are overcrowded and unsafe.</P>
    <P>Failure to address these curricular and physical needs is already impacting heavily and negatively on the day-to-day running of the school and is a cause of concern to management, staff, parents and students. I cannot understand why this extension has been postponed again.</P>
    <P>I beg the Minister to bring the neglect of this famous school in Sligo to an immediate end. The staff and students deserve no less. It is a school with a fantastic history. One of the Minister's colleagues is a former pupil who visited the school quite recently. While her visit was most welcome, the Minister's approval for this extension is more important. I hope the Minister of State will not give me the routine reply but that he has good news instead. What I have stated is all factual with no fiction. We have had pre-election and post-election promises going back to 1983. It is regrettable the Department does not recognise the situation and approve the necessary funding. I call on the Minister to confirm that approval has been given to move to the next stage of planning to allow work to proceed.</P>

      <P>The Department of Education and Science has received an application for additional accommodation from the school authorities. The planning section of the Department has agreed a long-term enrolment projection of 700 pupils with the school's management authority. Accordingly, the proposed development is being planned on this basis by agreement. The extension will provide additional accommodation of 1842 sq. m., including a number of general classrooms, a <Col N="123" /> mathematics room, a science laboratory, two art and craft rooms, two social studies rooms, a home economics room, a music and drama area, a PE hall and ancillary accommodation.</P>
      <P>In this regard a full design team has been appointed and architectural design of the project is progressing. The architectural design of post-primary education projects is based on nine stages.</P>

      <P>The design and planning of the project is covered by stages 1 to 5, during which the project is developed from the assessment of site suitability, through detailed design, including the obtaining of planning permission, to the point where detailed bills of quantities are prepared. At stage 6, tenders are sought in line with public procurement procedures and subsequently a tender report is prepared and examined. Assuming that the outcome of the tender process is acceptable in terms of procurement procedures, providing value for money and that funds are available to meet construction costs, a construction contract is placed at that stage and the construction of the project begins.</P>
      <P>Stages 7 to 9 cover post-contract cost control throughout the construction period, construction and practical completion of the building&mdash;</P>

      <P>The stage 5 submission has been received in the Department and is currently being examined. However, in view of the scale of the programme as now published, and having regard to the level of financial commitments to be met from projects already in construction, the Department of Education and Science does not envisage that it will be in a position during this year to <Col N="124" /> allow architectural planning for large-scale building projects to progress beyond their current authorised stage including this project.</P>
      <P>Members of this House seem to forget that our population is now at its second highest level in history. By 2020 we will have the highest population in the history of this island. Consequent on that there is a demand at primary, secondary and third level to expand, improve and enlarge facilities. From the days when we allocated single-digit figures for gross expenditure on educational buildings, we have now gone to multiple-digit figures, which is putting significant pressure on the revenue and the taxpayers.</P>

      <P>I know the Deputy would not support further taxation on the people of Ireland and therefore we must live within the resources available. The timing of when this project can proceed to tender and construction is dependent on the funding allocation for 2004 and subsequent years. As a voluntary secondary school that is privately owned and managed, it is the responsibility of the board of management to address health and safety issues that arise at the school. This is underpinned in the Education Act.</P>
      <P>I have noted what the Deputy has said. I again confirm the tremendous personal interest of the Minister for Social and Family Affairs, who is committed to the project. The great regard and respect the convent has will ensure it gets due consideration as quickly as possible.</P>

      <P>Cáirde Ghaelcholáiste Mhuineacháin submitted a valid application for an all-Irish second level school for Monaghan in September 2002, to be under the aegis of County Monaghan Vocational Education Committee which facilitated the proposal for a school which would open in September 2003. The recently published Monaghan development plan 2002 &ndash; 10 calls for a post-primary all-Irish college to be established under VEC administration by September 2003.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In September 2002 Monaghan Gaelcholáiste met all the criteria necessary to have the application for a Gaelcholáiste in the town considered. The school had a patron in the VEC, a location for its premises and, most importantly, the pupils. In September 2002 the application was made in good faith to the Department of Education and Science. After two years of dedicated work, committee members made a presumption that their application was being considered. That was until they received a letter, in April 2003, telling them that their application was not even being considered. They were told the commission for school accommodation was re-examining the criteria involved. It may transpire when the criteria have been re-examined that Monaghan Gaelcho<Col N="125" /> láiste will meet them but it may happen that the criteria will make it impossible for Monaghan to achieve a Gaelcholáiste. I ask that it be given the chance that the 30 other Gaelcholáistí, nationally, were given when they started. One can imagine the outcry there would be if, having considered the application for a medical card, planning permission or a driving licence, an applicant was told that the criteria were being re-examined and he or she would have to wait until that had been done.</P>
    <P>In September 2002, 43 pupils had expressed their intention of attending an Irish college in Monaghan if one opened in 2003. Because of the confusion that number has reduced to 17 but these are 17 very determined pupils and sets of parents and they are going to start a college irrespective of what decision the Government comes to. In the longer term, 133 prospective pupils have given their names and dates of birth to the Department and are interested in attending a Gaelcholáiste in Monaghan. Compare this with some of the Gaelcholáistí in Dublin. For example, when Coláiste Cillian started it had 14 pupils attending and now has 430. Coláiste Eoin had 17 pupils when it opened and now has 300. This, coupled with the fact that there are waiting lists for the Gaelscoileanna in Monaghan, shows that there is a very bright future for Monaghan Gaelcholáiste where we have a solid foundation. Approximately 5,000 pupils attend Gaelcholáistí nationally and I have no doubt that if others were provided, the number would quadruple.</P>
    <P>The Irish language belongs to the whole nation. Hundreds of millions of euro have been directed at the Gaeltacht areas in the form of grants for speaking Irish, setting up businesses, building houses, teaching Irish to workers and keeping students. I do not begrudge the Gaeltacht its grants but believe we deserve a drop in the ocean to get the Gaelcholáiste started in Monaghan.</P>
    <P>Gaelcholáistí, like Gaelscoileanna, attract very dedicated teachers who make a positive commitment to teach in an all-Irish school. The schools also tend to have very committed parents and, consequently, committed students. The parents who send their children to all-Irish speaking schools make a positve and conscious cultural choice. They do not associate Irish with poverty and backwardness.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister for Education and Science to reconsider his decision and have Monaghan Gaelcholáiste considered under the present criteria, to which we are entitled. We are, possibly, legally entitled to be considered under the criteria in place when the application was first made. There is a fear that we will not qualify under the new criteria. We should do all we can to encourage students to use Irish as much as possible. The Government's actions are being interpreted as discouraging Irish and applications for Gaelcholáistí. That is not good. The people of Monaghan are making a strong statement about the Irish language and I ask the Minister to grant the Gaelch<Col N="126" /> oláiste temporary recognition of a period of three years to prove ourselves.</P>

Tá an t-Aire Oideachais agus Eolaíochta ag déanamh a dhícheall chun gach seans a thabhairt do dhaoine an Ghaeilge a labhairt go líofa. Níl aon ghá le coláiste Gaeilge chun go mbeadh aos óg na tíre líofa sa Ghaeilge nuair a chríochnaíonn siad a chuid oideachais sa bhunscoil, sa mheánscoil nó san ollscoil.</P>
      <P>I thank the Deputy for raising this matter since it affords me the opportunity, on behalf of the Minister for Education and Science, of outlining the current position on the application received in the Department's planning and building unit from County Monaghan Vocational Education Committee for the establishment of a new second level Gaelcholáiste in Monaghan town. What is being proposed is a full all-Irish school under the aegis of the VEC.</P>
      <P>It is the policy of the Department of Education and Science to facilitate and support the establishment of all-Irish facilities at primary and second level in areas outside the Gaeltacht where a demand for such facilities is demonstrated and there exists no alternative within a reasonable distance. The Department recognises that a demand for post-primary education through Irish is likely to arise in areas such as Monaghan where Gaelscoileanna have already been established.</P>
      <P>There are, generally, two methods by which all-Irish educational provision at post-primary level can be met: through the establishment of either an independent all-Irish post-primary school or an all-Irish unit attached to an existing post-primary school. The unit, while part of an existing school, operates in a semi-autonomous manner and has a teacher in charge who holds a grade A post allowance. The unit is favoured by the Department in areas where demand for such a facility would be relatively small. However, it is possible that a unit could grow sufficiently over a number of years to warrant recognition as an independent school or Gaelcholáiste. The all-Irish units or schools are usually under the aegis of the relevant vocational education committee. In general, provisional recognition only is granted for the first three years of operation, during which time the school's or unit's progress is monitored by the Department. Permanent recognition is then considered, assuming that the school or unit has a viable future and is being conducted satisfactorily. The question of permanent accommodation for the school or unit is then considered at that stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In line with the Department's objects to improve and give greater clarity on policy related matters, the Minister for Education and Science has requested the commission on school accom<Col N="127" /> modation to examine and review policy in relation to all-Irish provision at second level. The commission will submit its report and recommendations on criteria and procedures for establishing and maintaining provision through the medium of Irish in individual second level schools or clusters of schools. Its work in this area is ongoing and the Minister expects to receive its report and recommendations later this year. In the interim, the Department is not processing any applications for the establishment of new all-Irish facilities, of which a number have been received, including an application from County Monaghan VEC. Any extension of all-Irish provision at second level will be considered in the light of the <Col N="128" /> commission's recommendations, which may contain revised criteria in this regard. The Department will give all the applications immediate consideration as soon as the commission's report and its recommendations on the matter of all-Irish provision at second level are received and fully considered in the Department.</P>

      <P>It is the policy of the Department in conducting its affairs, to ensure so far as is reasonably practicable, the safety, health and welfare of staff, customers and visitors to the Department. The policy in this regard is set down in the Department's safety statement, the latest version of which was published in August 2002. The approach adopted is based on an identification of hazards and an assessment of risks to safety and health in the workplace by local managers. As part of an ongoing process, risks identified are minimised by control measures, while necessary training and equipment are provided to maintain the standards set.</P>
      <P>The Department's safety statement contains a commitment to review its operation periodically, and such a review is under way at present across the Department to ensure that local risk assessments are up to date and any consequent action initiated by managers. In order to improve on all aspects of health and safety my Department provides training courses for managers on risk assessment. To date, over 300 staff at management level have attended these courses. Training is also provided for safety representatives and 100 have attended these courses. Training in manual handling has been availed of by more than 200 staff. Audits are also carried out in a number of offices each year. In the past two years, audits have been carried out in 12 offices and 35 branch offices of the Department to identify difficulties and areas for improvement.</P>

      <Quest>if a review of bilateral arrangements can be undertaken with a view to speeding up the processing of applications; and if she will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan" hpid="Mary Coughlan Mary Coughlan">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Social and Family Affairs (Mary Coughlan)</NameTxt>
      <P>My Department has responsibility for bilateral social security agreements with seven <Col N="130" /> countries: Austria, Australia, Canada, New Zealand, the United Kingdom, the USA and Switzerland. Ireland also entered into a bilateral understanding with Quebec on 1 October 1994. EU regulations govern arrangements with the other EU member states. A review of the implementation of EU and bilateral arrangements was carried out by officials from my Department last year. The time taken to have social insurance records made available was addressed in the course of that review. The results were quite satisfactory, to the extent that my Department is not experiencing difficulty with any one country at this point in time. The position is being continually monitored and further action will be taken where circumstances warrant it.</P>
      <P>The volume of claims which fall to be considered under the EU regulations and the bilateral agreements will continue to grow following EU enlargement, the number of new bilateral agreements entered into in recent years and the increased mobility of workers globally. Pension applications based on a combination of Irish insurance contributions and contributions from another EU member state or a country with which Ireland has a bilateral agreement take longer than normal to process for a variety of reasons. For example, they must first have their entitlement to a standard rate pension determined. Where there is no such entitlement, the applications are then referred to the EU-bilateral section for consideration. The cases are also more complex than standard rate pensions and involve checking insurance records from various sources.</P>
      <P>In cases where employment contributions have been made outside of EU countries entitlement may have to be tested under more than one agreement. In all cases the over-riding consideration is to ensure that customers receive their correct entitlement and decisions cannot be taken until all appropriate information is received and clarified. The time taken to deal with these claims has also been affected by the significant number of cases arising where a person does not qualify for a standard pre-53 pension but may have entitlement to a pro-rata rate. Some 3,000 of these cases have come to light since the pre-53 pension was introduced in May 2000. Every effort is being made to process these claims as quickly as possible. Additional resources have been deployed to the area and the situation will be kept under review.</P>
      <P>Delays in processing applications do not result in any losses to pensioners, the majority of whom are already in receipt of a basic pension. Those who qualify for payment have their claims backdated in accordance with the appropriate provisions.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan" hpid="Mary Coughlan Mary Coughlan">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Social and Family Affairs (Mary Coughlan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 93, 95, 96, 104, 120, 121, 137, 440 and 441 together.</P>
      <P>The carer's allowance is a social assistance payment which provides income support to people who are providing certain elderly or incapacitated persons with full-time care and attention and whose incomes fall below a certain limit. There are currently 20,600 people in receipt of the allowance at a cost of &euro;160 million last year. As with all other social assistance schemes, a means test applies under which the income of the applicant and his-her partner is assessable to ensure that limited resources are directed to those in greatest need.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Provision has been made in successive budgets for substantial increases in the means disregards. From April 2003, the weekly income disregards <Col N="132" /> increased to &euro;210 for a single carer and &euro;420 for a couple. The effect of this increase is that a couple with two children, earning a joint income of up to &euro;24,150 can qualify for the maximum rate of carer's allowance. The same couple, if they had an income of &euro;39,750, could still qualify for partial carer's allowance, plus the free schemes and the respite care grant. It is estimated that an additional 1,700 carers will qualify for the allowance and 2,800 existing carers will receive an increased payment as a result of this measure.</P>
    <P>It is estimated that abolition of the means test could cost in the region of &euro;150 million per annum. In view of the many supports required by carers, particularly in the areas of community care and respite care, any proposal to abolish the means test would have to be considered in the wider context of supports generally for this group and would have to be considered in a budgetary context.</P>
    <P>In addition to the improvements in the means test, I also made provision in budget 2003 for an increase in the rates of payment of carer's allowance by &euro;7 to &euro;129.60 for carers aged under 66 and by &euro;10 to &euro;147.80 for carers aged over 66. The annual respite care grant will increase by &euro;100 to &euro;735 and to &euro;1,470 for carers who are caring for more than one person.</P>
    <P>As far as paying carer's allowance concurrently with another social welfare payment, such as widow's pension, is concerned, the primary objective of the social welfare system is to provide income support and, as a general rule, only one social welfare payment is payable to an individual. This ensures that limited resources are not used to make two income support payments to any one individual. Of course, persons qualifying for two social welfare payments will always receive the higher payment to which they are entitled.</P>
    <P>In relation to research into poverty among carers, the National Council on Ageing and Older People, which advises on all aspects of the ageing and welfare of older people, has published a large body of research into poverty among older people and carers. This research has been extremely useful and has contributed to various reviews within my own Department such as the review of the carer's allowance, the review of the free schemes and the review of the qualifying conditions for the old age contributory and retirement pensions.</P>
    <P>The Department also funds the Economic and Social Research Institute in relation to research on the national anti-poverty strategy, NAPS, and other areas relevant to the work of this Department. As part of the monitoring of the NAPS, the ESRI also publishes reports on poverty trends and dynamics. Work is also undertaken by the Combat Poverty Agency and Comhairle. All of this research and analysis forms part of the policy formulation process within my Department.</P>
    <P>With regard to future developments in relation to carers and care in the community, the Government's health strategy, provides for reforming the <Col N="133" /> current arrangements, including the carer's allowance, in order to introduce an integrated care subvention scheme which maximises support for home care. The strategy also contains a number of other proposals for carers and those for whom they care and a number of Departments are involved in progressing these and other initiatives. The development of the range of supports for carers will continue to be a priority for this Government and, building on the foundations now in place, we will continue to develop the types of services which recognise the value of the caring ethos and which provide real support and practical assistance to people who devote their time to improving the quality of life for others.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan" hpid="Mary Coughlan Mary Coughlan">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Social and Family Affairs (Mary Coughlan)</NameTxt>
      <P>The personal public service, PPS, number was introduced in 1998 and involved changing the revenue and social insurance, RSI, number from a tax and social welfare reference number only to a number for public services. It is the individual's unique identifier in his-her dealing with public services and is part of the general drive to modernise Government services and provide for a more integrated public service. When I launched an awareness campaign for the number in November 2002, I described it as the key to accessing services and making the delivery of benefits to our citizens easier and more efficient. Ultimately, by reason of the existence of the number, the public will no longer have to, for example, repeatedly produce a birth certificate or passport as a form of identification when availing of public services.</P>
      <P>The PPS number is issued, based on each individual's basic identity information such as name, date of birth and address and it is only issued when this information is verified. As it replaced the RSI number, the vast majority of people already have a PPS Number. Also, for some years, my Department has allocated numbers to children as child benefit is claimed. The PPS number, therefore, already has an established population base and there is a high level of awareness of it. More than 80% of individuals surveyed since the recent campaign have an awareness of the PPS number and its uses and many Departments and agencies now use the number. The important aspect in relation to the PPS number is that it is unique for each individual and, when linked to a card, it will be a reliable form of identification.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As an important element of the overall strategy in this regard it is my intention that a public service card will be developed which will contain the PPS number. The 1998 Social Welfare Act <Col N="134" /> already provides for the issue of a card to a person, which contains their name, personal public service number and other details such as their date of birth and gender. My Department currently issues a social services card. This caters for certain payment customers of my Department and it is also a permanent record of the PPS number. The social services card is automatically issued to individuals as they reach 16 years of age. While the social services card is well placed in terms of usage and recognition for development as the public services card, it would need significant upgrading to meet existing and future demands including authentication of identity and the possible extension of electronic payment methods.</P>
    <P>I welcome the proposals from my colleague, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, that those aged between 18 and 25 should carry identification cards in order to be served in pubs and I intend to explore, with the Minister, the possibility of using the PPS number and related public services card as a means of identification for that purpose.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Question Nos. 97 and 423 together.</P>
      <P>The living alone allowance is an additional payment of &euro;7.70 per week made to people aged 66 years or over who are in receipt of certain social welfare type payments. It is also available to those under 66 years of age receiving payments under a number of invalidity type schemes. It is not a payment in its own right but an allowance which can only be paid as a supplement to an Irish social welfare payment. As such, it cannot be paid to people without a social welfare entitlement or those whose pension payments are made under the social security regimes of the UK or other countries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The overall policy being followed in relation to support for our older people has been to commit resources to improving the personal pension rates <Col N="135" /> rather than supplementary payments such as the living alone allowance. I believe this to be the more effective way of ensuring that the position of all our pensioners is improved. Since 1997, the Government has followed a policy of significantly increasing payments to pensioners and this will continue. The programme for Government commits to increasing the basic pension to &euro;200 per week by 2007. There is also a commitment in the partnership agreement, Sustaining Progress, to increasing the old age contributory pension from its current level of 31% of gross average industrial earnings to 34% over the next five to ten years. This is the target rate recommended by the Pensions Board in its report on the national pensions policy initiative.</P>
    <P>The improvements announced in budget 2003 saw the old age contributory pension increase to &euro;157.30 per week and the old age non-contributory pension increase to &euro;144 per week. The equivalent rates in 1997 were &euro;99.4 and &euro;85.71 respectively. Other improvements made in the area of pensions include changes in the assessment of capital under the means tests for non-contributory payments. There have also been significant improvements in the area of the free schemes. Older people will remain one of the major priorities for the Government and the most effective way of improving their position will be kept under review in the context of future budgets.</P>

      <P>In applications for carer's allowance, the basic qualifying conditions, apart from a means test, are that the person receiving care must be so incapacitated as to require full-time care and attention and the carer is providing that full-time care and attention. The carer is the applicant and, accordingly, is the appellant against a decision disallowing payment. Appeals against the refusal of claims for carer's allowance normally require an oral hearing in order to determine the appeal. The carer, as the appellant, attends the hearing but the person being cared for ordinarily cannot and does not attend.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In his annual report for 2001, the chief appeals officer alluded to the question raised by the Deputy. He recognised that the care recipients are fundamental to the issue and that, in some cases, they would be able to provide valuable, first-hand testimony. However, many are, by definition, too elderly or frail to attend and for this reason they are rarely summoned. There is <Col N="136" /> provision, however, for having the cared for person examined by a medical assessor of the Department where this is likely to be helpful and where their doctor has indicated that they are fit to attend.</P>
    <P>While it is accepted that testimony by the care recipient could be helpful in certain cases it is considered that the medical evidence and the testimony of the carer provide a basis on which a fair and equitable determination can be made. Ultimately, the question of who should attend an oral hearing is one for the appeals officer but in general, care recipients who attend hearings with a view to testifying in support of the carer's appeal are readily facilitated.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>The back to education allowance scheme is a second chance education scheme designed to <Col N="137" /> assist unemployed people and other disadvantaged groups who are being held back in their search for employment by a lack of qualifications. A review of the basic purpose underlying my Department's back to education provisions was carried out recently. In the light of this and of the expenditure constraints facing us this year, the scheme has been revised.</P>
    <P>In framing proposals to change elements of the BTEA scheme, I was conscious of the need to ensure that payments were focused on those who most need training or qualifications in order to gain a foothold in the labour market. In line with this aim, payments under the scheme for the summer period have been discontinued, as people who had been previously unemployed often find work opportunities either at home or abroad during the summer months. Of course, participants in the scheme who fail to find employment during the summer may be entitled to unemployment assistance or benefit, subject to satisfying the usual qualifying conditions.</P>
    <P>Regarding changes in the scheme as it relates to postgraduates, I am satisfied that people in possession of a third level qualification have already achieved a good level of academic attainment, which should impact positively on their employment prospects. In a time of financial constraint, I want to ensure that supports are directed to those with more pressing needs. I recently asked my officials to liaise with the relevant bodies to identify specific postgraduate courses such as the higher diploma &ndash; H.Dip &ndash; which add significantly to a person's employability and to which BTEA should continue to apply. As a consequence, my Department will continue to support those wishing to take up a higher diploma, H.Dip &ndash; in all disciplines or graduate diploma in primary school teaching.</P>
    <P>There has been no change in the entitlements of BTEA participants to secondary benefits. For example, participants who are unable to find employment and who sign on for an unemployment payment for the summer months may continue to qualify for rent or mortgage interest supplement under the supplementary welfare allowance scheme on the same basis as other social welfare recipients. As before, additional income from part-time employment may affect the amount of supplement in payment. The rent supplement means test allows for a weekly income disregard of up to &euro;50 in respect of additional income from part-time employment i.e. less than 30 hours per week. However, additional income in excess of &euro;50 will reduce the amount of rent supplement payable.</P>
    <P>People who take up full-time employment i.e. 30 hours or more per week are excluded by legislation from receiving assistance under the terms of the SWA scheme. I am aware of the views expressed by the Union of Students of Ireland. However, I believe that I have ensured, in a situation where priorities had to be set and choices made, that those in the greatest need of assistance under the BTEA scheme have been protected.</P>

      <P>The Government is committed to extending social insurance pension cover to as many categories as possible. In this regard a number of measures have been introduced in recent years which are making it easier for people to qualify for pensions. These measures are of particular benefit to women who may have less than complete social insurance records. In 1997, the average number of contributions required for pension purposes was reduced to ten and, in 2000, a special half rate pension was introduced based on pre-53 insurance contributions. <i>Pro-rata</i> pensions were also introduced to allow people with mixed rate insurance records to receive a payment.</P>
      <P>The Government is also committed to increasing the payment for qualified adults who are aged 66 or over to the same level as the personal rate of the old age non-contributory pension. This process commenced in budget 2000 and a number of special increases have been granted since then. The rate of the qualified allowance on the contributory pension now stands at &euro;121.50 per week which is about 84% of the maximum rate of the non-contributory pension. New applicants for pensions can now apply to have the qualified adult allowance paid directly to their spouse or partner. This facility has been available since October 2002.</P>
      <P>Measures are also in place since 1994 to protect the pension entitlements of those who take time out of the paid workforce for caring duties. This scheme, known as the homemakers scheme, allows for up to 20 years to be disregarded when a persons insurance record is being averaged for pensions purposes. The scheme is being reviewed as part of the second phase review of the qualifying conditions for the old age contributory and retirement pensions. The review is almost completed and further development of the homemakers scheme will be considered in the light of the conclusions of the review.</P>

A fuel allowance payment of &euro; 9.00 per week is paid to eligible households while an additional &euro; 3.90 per week is paid in smokeless zones, bringing the total amount in those areas to &euro;12.90 per week. These payments are made for the duration of the fuel season which lasts for 29 weeks. The fuel allowances represent a contribution towards a person's normal heating expenses. They are not intended to meet the full cost. In addition many households also qualify for electricity and gas allowances.</P>
      <P>Improvements have been made to the fuel allowance scheme in recent budgets. The means test has been eased and the duration of payment has been increased from 26 weeks to 29 weeks. The cost of the national fuel scheme in 2002 was &euro; 80.5 million, of which &euro; 67.5 million was spent on fuel allowances and &euro;13 million on smokeless fuel allowances. If the scheme were extended to the full year, the total cost would be approximately &euro;145 million, based on current payment rates. The ban on bituminous coal sales will be extended later this year to include Bray, Kilkenny, Sligo and Tralee at a cost to the scheme of &euro; 356,000 in 2003 and &euro;860,000 in a full year.</P>
      <P>The significant increases in recent years in primary social welfare payment rates, such as the old age pension, have also improved the income position for people dependent on the social welfare system. Primary payment rates are payable for the full 52 weeks of the year and increases in these rates benefit a wider range of recipients. The question of further increases in the rates of fuel allowance or an extension of the fuel allowance season is a matter for consideration in a budgetary context.</P>

      <P>My Department has special arrangements in place for the payment of unemployment benefit and unemployment assistance to customers who are categorised as casual workers. Customers are issued with dockets which they return to their local office on a weekly basis, detailing the days worked. Employers are requested to co-operate by marking the days worked on the docket and then signing and <Col N="140" /> stamping it. The customer signs to state that the information is correct prior to returning the docket to the local branch office. Payment is then made based on the information on the docket.</P>
      <P>My Department has to take into account the difficulty some customers can have in getting the dockets completed on a timely basis. Difficulties can arise where an employer has large numbers of casual or part time employees, where the customer has more than one employer or where the employer is situated a long distance from the place of casual employment. Where customers are having difficulty in getting a docket certified, they should immediately contact the staff in their local office. In order to assist customers where difficulties arise, employers can be asked to supply details of the days worked over a period for comparison with the days notified by the employee. Where an employer is unco-operative an investigating officer will call to ensure that the correct records are being kept.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 105, 108, 110, 112 and 138 together.</P>
      <P>The supplementary welfare allowance scheme, which is administered by the health boards, provides for the payment of a weekly or monthly supplement in respect of rent or mortgage interest to any person in the State whose means are insufficient to meet his or her needs. In assessing a person's means for this purpose, all income, whether in cash or in kind, is taken into account although certain sources of income, for example, child benefit, can be disregarded in the means test. There is no provision for disregarding allowances paid towards the cost of child care and such payments are taken into account in assessing means for this purpose.</P>
      <P>Rent and mortgage interest supplements are calculated to ensure that a person, after the payment of rent or mortgage interest, has an income equal to the rate of supplementary welfare allowance appropriate to his-her family circumstances, less a minimum contribution of &euro;12 which recipients are required to pay from their own resources. Many recipients pay more than &euro;12 towards their rent because applicants are required to contribute any additional assessable means that they have over and above the appropriate basic supplementary welfare allowance rate towards their rent. Up to &euro;50 of additional weekly income gained from part-time employment or approved training courses is disregarded in the means test.</P>
      <P>Under the legislation, supplementary welfare allowance is not normally payable to people in full time employment. However, anyone who has been unemployed for 12 months or more and who moves from a welfare payment to a full-time job may retain rent supplement on a tapered retention basis subject to a weekly household income limit of &euro;317.43. Special arrangements are also in place which allow people on approved employment schemes such as back to work or community employment to retain part of their rent supplement. The period for which rent supplement may be retained has been extended to four years on a tapered basis, for example, 75% in year one, 50% in year two and 25% in years three and four and the upper limit of &euro; 317.43 per month on the amount of supplement payable was abolished for people on these schemes.</P>
      <P>As a result of these changes, many participants in the schemes now retain a substantial amount of their rent supplement. Rather than acting as a disincentive to work or training, the arrangements I have outlined are designed to encourage and assist people in the transition from reliance on welfare payments to full-time employment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am aware of the recent report on rent supplement in the private rented sector which was a joint publication by Comhairle and Threshold. One of the criticisms levelled at the rent sup<Col N="142" /> plement scheme in the report is that it acts as a disincentive to work and training, particularly for families where relatively high levels of rent are payable. I do not accept that this is the case in view of disregards and various other features of the scheme which now apply. There are no plans to introduce a new housing benefit scheme but any further changes in the qualification criteria for receipt of rent supplement will be considered as part of the review of the supplementary welfare allowance scheme currently under way in my Department.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 106, 116 and 427 together.</P>
      <P>The supplementary welfare allowance scheme is administered by the health boards. Among other things, the scheme provides for the payment of a weekly or monthly supplement in respect of rent to eligible people in the State whose means are insufficient to meet their accommodation needs. The amount of rent supplement payable was always subject to a cap to ensure that reasonable rents were charged. The maximum level of rent that a person may incur and still qualify for rent supplement is determined by each health board. These maximum rent levels are set by reference to local considerations.</P>
      <P>I am concerned to ensure that increases in maximum rent levels are set by the health boards in response to rises in market rent levels. Setting maximum rent limits higher than are justified by the open market distorts the rental market and leads to a general rise in rent levels that disadvantages people on low incomes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Data provided by the Central Statistics Office show that rent levels have been falling consistently since April 2002 and are now lower than <Col N="143" /> they were in August 2001. In the circumstances, I decided to maintain the maximum rent levels set by the health boards at their current levels until the end of December 2003. Regulations giving effect to this were introduced on 22 November 2002. I am satisfied this change is not having an adverse impact on social welfare recipients in the private rented sector. In fact, since the beginning of the year, the number of households in receipt of a rent supplement has increased by 6.6%, from 54,213 to 57,780.</P>
    <P>If an individual is unable to secure accommodation at or below the applicable maximum rent level, it is open to the health board to provide a payment above the maximum level as an exceptional measure for a limited period. This measure is designed to provide the person concerned with an opportunity to secure alternative accommodation at the applicable rent level. My Department is not aware of any case where the change in relation to the maximum rent levels has resulted in any person being made homeless. In addition, the Dublin Homeless Agency, which is in regular contact with providers of services to the homeless, has advised my Department that it too is not aware of any individual being made homeless as a result of this measure.</P>
    <P>The effects of the change are being monitored on an ongoing basis by my Department. In this regard the health boards are required to notify my Department of instances where supplements are put in payment in cases where exceptional circumstances are involved. Since the new regulations were introduced, 71 such cases have been notified to my Department. I am satisfied that the current regulations are appropriate, given that rent levels are stable and falling in many cases. My Department will continue to monitor these matters closely.</P>

      <P>The objective of the public services broker project is to create a single point of access to public services in Ireland. Since its inception, the Reach Agency has progressed the project by defining the technical architecture for the public services broker, building a proof of concept, developing a brand and communications strategy around broker services and by providing a definition of public services identity, PSI. In January 2002, Reach sought partners to build the public services broker and almost 30 companies from around the world responded to the notice published in the EU Journal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Following an exhaustive first phase evaluation, it is intended to move shortly to the next stage of <Col N="144" /> the process, leading ultimately to the award of a contract for building a defined phase of the broker. This phase will provide the basic foundations of the broker and allow Departments and agencies to offer their services on-line in a secure, reliable manner. Later phases will extend the range of channels and services offered through the broker.</P>

      <P>The Government is committed to bringing the maximum rate of the widow's and widower's contributory pension for those over 66 years of age into line with that of the old age contributory pension. A number of special increases have been granted in recent budgets in pursuit of this objective and the maximum rate now stands &euro;155.80 per week, against a rate of &euro;157.30 for the old age contributory pension. Widows and widowers are also benefiting from the changes in the free schemes announced over a number of budgets. Under these arrangements, all persons aged over 70 years of age are now entitled to the full range of schemes, regardless of their means or household composition.</P>
      <P>In budget 2000, a new scheme was introduced, the widowed parent grant, to help with the special needs of this particular group in the immediate aftermath of a bereavement. This involves the payment of a special grant of &euro;2,500 to a widow/er with dependent children. The increase in the rates of child benefit are of benefit to widows and widowers with children. Since 1997, the monthly rates of child benefit have been increased dramatically. Since April this year, monthly child benefit payments are &euro; 125.60 per month for each of the first and second children and &euro;157.30 per month for the third and subsequent children.</P>
      <P>In addition, there are special arrangements in place whereby a person in receipt of a widow or widower's pension or one-parent family payment may also receive half-rate disability benefit or unemployment benefit in addition to their pension. This provision applies where the person satisfies the relevant contribution conditions and dual payment can continue for up to 15 months. Social welfare provision for widows and widowers will be kept under review and further improvements will be considered in a budgetary context.</P>

      <P>Social welfare legislation provides that a person who has lost his or her employment by reason of a stoppage of work which was due to a trade dispute at his or her place of employment is disqualified from receipt of unemployment benefit or assistance other than in certain defined circumstances. In relation to the dispute in question, following a decision by a deciding officer in a test case, all of the employees who are participating in or directly interested in the dispute are disqualified from receipt of unemployment payments for as long as the stoppage continues. Where a person is dissatisfied with a decision made by a deciding officer to refuse him or her an unemployment payment, the decision may be appealed to the social welfare appeals office. The decision in this case was appealed to the social welfare appeals office. The appeal was heard on the 14 May 2003 and the appeals officer's decision is expected shortly.</P>
      <P>Where a person is disqualified on the grounds of his or her involvement in a trade dispute and feels that he or she has been unreasonably deprived of employment because his or her employer refused or failed to follow the negotiating machinery available for settling disputes, he or she may apply to the Social Welfare Tribunal for an adjudication. Where the tribunal decides that an applicant was unreasonably deprived of employment by his or her employer, he or she is entitled to an unemployment payment for the period of the trade dispute subject to satisfying the other qualifying conditions for receipt of payment. The trade union representing the employees concerned had applied to the Social Welfare Tribunal for an adjudication in this case. This application will proceed in the event that the appeal is disallowed.</P>
      <P>Persons involved in a trade dispute are not entitled to receive supplementary welfare allowance for the duration of the dispute. Supplementary welfare allowance is, however, payable, subject to a means test, to any adult or child dependant of a person involved in such a dispute.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 113 and 132 together.</P>
      <P>I have noted with interest the recently published CORI Socio-Economic Review 2003, which focuses on reducing poverty and achieving social inclusion. These are key objectives of my Department which we are pursuing through the implementation of the revised national anti-poverty strategy. In relation to the gap between rich and poor, the CORI review cites figures which show that the position of the lowest income households relative to the position of the highest earning households has disimproved over the past 15 years. This is attributable to a range of factors, but it is certain that a primary factor has been the very substantial growth in employment and reduction in unemployment which has occurred in that period.</P>
      <P>It is widely accepted that reliance on income alone as a measure of poverty has limitations, most particularly in a period where there has been a very rapid growth in average incomes. The consistent poverty measure developed by the Economic and Social Research Institute, which incorporates both income and the presence of various indicators of deprivation, provides a broader picture of poverty arising from a sustained lack of resources.</P>
      <P>According to the most recent figures, Ireland has seen significant reductions in consistent poverty over the past decade from 15% in 1994 to 6% in 2000. The levels of consistent poverty among vulnerable groups such as children and older people have also fallen during this period. In the revised national anti-poverty strategy, the Government has committed itself to further reducing the numbers of those who are consistently poor to below 2% and, if possible, to eliminate consistent poverty altogether. Trends in relative income will also be monitored over the period of the national anti-poverty strategy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The CORI review also quotes EUROSTAT figures which show that in 2000 Ireland's social protection expenditure as a proportion of GDP was the lowest in the European Union. Over recent years, however, Ireland has differed significantly from other EU member states in terms of its high rates of economic growth and its low level of unemployment. The fact that Ireland has the lowest elderly population in the EU and that it relies less on State provision in a number of key areas, such as supplementary pensions, and child <Col N="147" /> and elder care services, inevitably results in Ireland's social protection expenditure as a percentage of GDP being below the EU average. This will change in time as economic growth and unemployment levels fluctuate and as the population ages.</P>
    <P>The policy of improving the standard of living of all those dependent on social protection is continuing, as resources permit and guided by the National Anti-Poverty Strategy. It is necessary to bear in mind that the degree of progress that can be achieved in this area in Ireland, as in all EU countries, is dependent on ensuring the economic growth which provides the resources necessary to achieve real improvements.</P>

      <P>I understand that the Deputy is concerned in particular about the current arrangements applying in the case of old age pension where a landholder leases land or is otherwise in possession of land which is lying fallow or idle. Where land is let on short-term lettings such as the eleven months system, the income from such lettings is calculated as cash income for the purpose of the means assessment for old age pension. Necessary expenses incurred by the owner, such as auctioneer fees, fencing or fertilising between lettings is deducted from the gross letting income.</P>
      <P>Where land is lying fallow or idle, there are two options for the assessment of means. If the social welfare inspector is satisfied that the pension claimant is depriving himself or herself of an income in order to qualify for a pension, or a pension at a higher rate than would otherwise be the case, the relevant assessment is the income which would be received, if the land was let. Where the Inspector is satisfied that this is not the case, the value of the land is obtained from the Valuation Office and is assessed as capital for means purposes. There are no plans to change the present arrangements in this regard. Any change in these assessment arrangements could only be considered in a budgetary context.</P>

      <P>One of the key objectives of the 2003 social welfare package was to protect or enhance the value of all rates of payment in relative terms. The budget made provision for increases in the main personal rates of weekly payments and in the weekly rate of qualified adult allowances ranging from 5.1% to 7.6%. The budget day projection was that prices will increase by an average of 4.8% in 2003 as a whole. I understand from my colleague, the Minister for Finance, that his Department will publish a revised estimate of inflation over the summer. In this regard, I welcome the recent fall in the annual rate of inflation to 4.3% in April of this year.</P>
      <P>In addition, budget 2003 also provided for additional increases to those aged 66 or over, in particular those on widows and old age pensions; increased or maintained the real value of all qualified adult rates of payment and ensured that they did not fall as a proportion of the associated personal rate and made significant progress in our programme of increases in the level of child benefit.</P>
      <P>Social welfare spending rose by over &euro;3.5 billion between 1997 and 2002, a level of increase significantly in excess of the level of inflation. An additional &euro;833 million in social welfare spending is provided for during this year, and this will bring the projected level of annual spending to over &euro;10 billion. At a time of economic uncertainty, the increase in payment rates emphasises the Government's commitment to protecting those at highest risk. My colleagues and I are committed to safeguarding the position of all social welfare recipients and I look forward to making further progress, in the years ahead, on the achievement of our social inclusion commitments.</P>

      <P>The Government is committed to protecting the family through political, economic, social and other measures which will support the stability of the family. A range of family income support programmes are provided by the Department of Social and Family Affairs. These include child benefit, widow/er's payments, payments for families who are out of work through illness or unemployment, one-parent family payment for parents raising children alone, family income supplement and provision for carers. These support programmes have been developed over the years to respond to the different personal circumstances which families may experience during their life cycles. The overall objective is to ensure <Col N="149" /> that individuals and families have recourse to income support for themselves and their families in times of need.</P>
      <P>The Government's policy focus in relation to families is on support for parents and their children in an inclusive way and to make families central to policy making and the delivery of services. While there is no formal definition as to what constitutes a family for this purpose, the promotion of continuity and stability in family life, which is particularly important for children, is a central feature of the policy approach. The approach recognises that the best interests of children are of paramount concern and that a child's basic need for security and stability can be met in a variety of family situations.</P>
      <P>I am at present undertaking a programme of public consultation to hear the views of representative family members, especially parents, organisations who work with families and public representatives, about the challenges families are currently facing. I wish to hear at first hand how effective the services provided by the statutory and community and voluntary sectors are in helping them meet these challenges and in strengthening family well being so that any necessary policy changes can be put in place.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 122 and 128 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The detection of fraud and abuse of the social welfare system is an integral part of the day to day work of my Department. The work of all staff who are engaged in any aspect of claims processing is to some degree concerned with preventing and detecting fraud and abuse. There are some 600 staff at local, regional and national level whose work is entirely or significantly related to the control of fraud and abuse of the social welfare system. Some 300 of these are responsible for routine investigations under the <Col N="150" /> various schemes and for reporting on and following up suspected cases of fraud, where these are discovered.</P>
    <P>There are some 82 staff in special investigation units, whose specific purpose is to investigate fraud and abuse. These units, one of which works jointly with inspectors from the Revenue Commissioners, carry out inspections of employers in relation to their PRSI obligations. They also investigate cases where fraud or abuses of the schemes are suspected. In addition to the special investigation units, all of the main scheme areas have staff dedicated to the control of fraud.</P>
    <P>During 2002 a total of 341,428 reviews of social welfare claims and 8,854 employer inspections were carried out by control staff, resulting in overall savings of &euro;282.7 million. Review numbers include routine reviews which monitor ongoing entitlements to social welfare payments, as well as reviews of those suspected of making fraudulent claims. The special investigation units carried out a total of 26,065 reviews and investigations during 2002, resulting in savings of &euro;37.3 million. In addition, 2,161 employer inspections were carried out by the unit which resulted in the detection of &euro;9.24 million in PAYE-PRSI arrears. Arising from the reviews and investigations carried out by control staff, 13,786 cases of fraud were detected which resulted in overpayments of &euro;11.8 million being identified and these are included in the savings above. Approximately 12,600 of these payments related to unemployment schemes.</P>
    <P>In addition to the overpayments set up, rates of payment were reduced or claims were terminated where cases of fraud or abuse were identified. This resulted in significant ongoing savings on social welfare payments and these are reflected in the control savings already mentioned. In the nature of fraud, especially social welfare fraud, it is difficult to offer a definitive assessment of its extent. The aim of the activities outlined, however, is to reduce fraud to a minimum. The target for control savings for 2003 is &euro;331 million.</P>
    <P>Up to the end of April 2003, approximately 104,000 reviews of claims have taken place and these have yielded control savings of &euro;102 million. Separate figures are not maintained as to the cost of carrying out these reviews and investigations which are an integral part of the work of the Department.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 123 and 136 together.</P>
      <P>The school meals programme provides funding for a statutory urban school meals scheme, which operates in conjunction with certain local authorities, as well as a local projects scheme which targets schools with high levels of disadvantaged pupils in both urban and rural areas. In 2002, &euro;2.02 million was spent on the school meals programme. This year I provided an additional &euro;2.35 million in the budget to enable me to enhance and expand the programme. In 2002, some 380 schools with a total of more than 60,000 pupils benefited from the urban scheme while 105 schools and voluntary organisations received funding which benefited more than 11,000 children under the school meals local projects scheme. So far this year, a further 63 schools have received funding under the local projects scheme.</P>
      <P>The report of an interdepartmental working group to review the school meals scheme was completed earlier this year and it recommends a number of changes in order to focus the scheme on areas of greatest disadvantage. These include targeting secondary schools with the highest concentration of pupils at risk of early school leaving and the primary schools from which their pupils come. The working group felt that, in view of the scale of implementation, changes should be introduced on a phased basis. It recommended that, initially, the most disadvantaged schools should be targeted.</P>
      <P>My Department is working with the Department of Education and Science to ensure that the available resources are applied in the most effective way to ensure that they are targeted at the schools and students most in need of this support. The Department of Agriculture and Food is also assisting with the school meals programme as it operates a scheme, funded by the European Union, whereby milk and dairy products are provided free of charge or at subsidised cost to school children. This scheme can make an important contribution in providing suitable nutritional food for the programme.</P>
      <P>With regard to the school in question, my Department contacted the school in March to advise of the existence of the school meals programme. The school subsequently made an application for funding which was approved recently and payment issued. That funding, together with a similar amount of funding from Dublin City Council, meets the full cost of school meals provision in the school.</P>

      <P>At end December 2002, there were approximately 375,000 people aged over 65 and resident in Ireland in receipt of a social welfare payment, either in their own right or as a qualified adult on their spouse or partner's payment. This represents about 86% of the total population over 65 years of age. In relation to retirement and old age contributory pensions, there are about 188,000 recipients and, of these, over 27,000, or 15%, have a qualified adult allowance in payment. Comparable figures for 1993 were approximately 130,000 recipients with 38,000, or 29%, with a qualified adult allowance in payment. During the same period the number of non-contributory old age pensions in payment has fallen from approximately 111,000 to 83,000.</P>
      <P>A recent actuarial report on the social insurance fund estimated that there will be a total of 255,000 recipients of old age contributory and retirement pensions by 2011. There are no projections available in relation to qualified adults allowances. However, it is expected that trends in the area of increased workforce participation of women and the effect of the extensions of social insurance in the last thirty years will see a continuation of existing trends with less reliance on means tested payments and more people qualifying for contributory payments in their own right.</P>

      <P>Every person who is dissatisfied with a decision on a claim to a social welfare payment or with certain decisions made by health boards in regard to supplementary welfare allowances has a statutory right to appeal. When an appeal is received, the social welfare appeals office refers the case to the deciding officer for his or her comments on the arguments made by the appellant, including any new evidence submitted. As a result of this process, over one fifth of such cases are revised in the person's favour by deciding officers, usually because new evidence that warrants such a revision has become available.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Some appeals may be decided summarily by an appeals officer on the basis of the documentation presented to him/her. In other cases the appeals officer may decide that an oral hearing is required before the issue can be decided. Where an oral hearing is held, the process will inevitably take longer. The average time taken to process appeals determined during 2002 and the early months of 2003 was 23 weeks. This average period includes all phases of appeals, such as the additional time <Col N="153" /> involved in the determination of appeals where, for example, further investigations have to be made or where adjournments have been sought by the appellant or by the legal representative acting on his behalf. The big majority of appeals are, however, processed more quickly than the average time given above. Excluding the slowest cases, the average processing time for appellants is now 14 weeks.</P>
    <P>A consultancy study has been carried out on the appeals process, in order to assist management in effecting improvements. Additional resources have been deployed to the office and the number of appeals on hands has been reduced from 7,500 at the beginning of 2000 to under 5,400 currently. Further measures are also being put in place to reduce the number of appeals on hands and it is anticipated that these will result in significant improvement in processing times during the second half of 2003.</P>
    <P>The social welfare appeals system is a quasi-judicial one and the procedures involved are designed to ensure that every appellant's case gets full and satisfactory consideration. While the achievement of further improvement in processing times is a major objective of the office, at all times it is necessary to ensure that progress in this regard is achieved in a manner that is not in conflict with or at a cost to the demands of justice and the requirement that every appeal be fully investigated and examined on all its merits.</P>

      <P>Child benefit is payable in respect of all children up to the age of 16 years and continues to be payable in respect of children up to age 19 who are in full-time education or who have a physical or mental disability. According to figures collected under the quarterly national household survey by the Central Statistics Office for the final quarter of 2002, there were an estimated 116,700 students aged 19 to 22 years. Extending child benefit to this category would cost in the region of &euro;185 million per annum.</P>

This provision previously applied to long-term schemes only. The measure is estimated to cost &euro;630,000 million in a full year.

      <P>The 2003 Estimates for unemployment benefit and unemployment assistance were framed on the basis of an average live register of 179,000. This average took account of a seasonal pattern where increases and decreases occur at various times throughout the year. The actual live register at the end of April, at 170,940, was 5,760 lower than the comparable figure underlying the estimate. Therefore, the indications at this stage are that the estimate for the year will not be exceeded.

      <P>Strengthening families and the promotion of continuity and stability in family life, the welfare of children and support and affirmation for parents in carrying out their important child rearing responsibilities are core features of the Government's pro-families policy approach. The importance of accessible information about parenting issues and child development to strengthen the capacity of families in carrying out their essential functions of caring for children was highlighted by the Commission on the Family.</P>
      <P>Under my Department's families research programme, a research project entitled &ldquo;Effective Parenting &ndash; An Exploration of Need&rdquo; was commissioned. The study involved 1000 parents and 200 children and provides a comprehensive report of parents' perspectives on their parenting role and the support available to them within their own family network, in their community and through family support services.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The report recommends that the Family Support Agency would have specific responsibility to provide appropriate general and targeted information on parenting issues. The agency, which has just been established, brings together a range of family and community supports and services which were developed by the Government over <Col N="155" /> the past number of years. It will provide a comprehensive and coherent response for families in need of support services and for families and communities generally. It will be a dedicated agency and a resource for all those involved in the promotion of family and community well-being,</P>
    <P>The Family Support Agency has been given the responsibility to promote and disseminate information about a range of issues affecting families. Key among these is the provision of information in relation to parenting. In carrying out its information function the agency is charged with co-operating with other public authorities in providing information to assist persons in balancing their work and family responsibilities. The agency will shortly be commencing preparation for its strategic plan, setting out its strategies for fulfilling the functions for which if has been given responsibility.</P>

      <P>Significant improvements in the level of support under the child benefit scheme to parents of multiple births have been made in recent years. Prior to 1998, child benefit was payable at the normal rate for each child in the case of twins with an added grant of &euro;634.87,£500, payable at birth. Further grants of &euro; 634.87 were payable when the twins reached the ages of four and 12. Child benefit was paid at double the normal rate where three or more children were born together. However, no birth grants were payable in the case of triplets.</P>
      <P>In the Social Welfare Act 1998, two key additional measures were introduced, designed to improve the overall package of benefits available to parents of multiple births. First, the &euro; 634.87, £500, grants, which previously were confined to families with twins, were extended to include families with multiple births of three or more children. Second, the rate of child benefit payable in respect of twins was increased to 150% of the normal rate. Very substantial investments have been made in general to the CB scheme in recent years, with total expenditure on child benefit expected to reach &euro;1.9 billion when the current programme of multi-annual increases is complete. These improvements will benefit all families with children, including of course, families with multiple births. Any further changes in the scheme to improve the position of parents of multiple births would have to be considered in the light of overall budgetary priorities.</P>

      <AskConj>asked the </AskConj>
      <askee>Minister for Social and Family Affairs</askee>
      <Quest>the number of persons who have been awarded a pension based on pre-1953 contributions; and the number of applications being processed.</Quest>

      <P>The pre-1953 old age contributory pension was introduced from May 2000 specifically for people who commenced insurable employment before 1953 and who had at least five years paid insurance comprising either national health insurance or a combination of social insurance and national health insurance. The pension is payable at 50% of the maximum weekly standard personal rate. Increases for qualified adults and child dependants, where applicable, are also paid at 50%. The implementation of the pre-1953 pension was part of the Government's continued focus on the needs of the elderly. It acknowledges insurance paid by people prior to 1953.</P>
      <P>Since its introduction, some 26,000 people have been awarded a pre-53 pension. Approximately 8,500 of these were previously in receipt of a <i>pro-rata </i>old age (contributory) or retirement pension at a lower weekly personal rate. The processing of pre-1953 pension claim is a tedious and time consuming process, given the lapse of time since the relevant employments and the difficulties of tracing old insurance numbers. In many cases we are dealing with employment records over 50 years old and predating any computerisation.</P>
      <P>Applications for the pension continue to be received at the rate of around 90 per week, the majority of which are from persons living abroad. There are at present some 1,500 claims in various stages of processing. In addition, up to 3,000 cases which do not qualify for a standard pre-53 pension are in the process of having their entitlement to a pro-rata rate of pre-1953 pension examined under EU or bilateral agreements. Where foreign insurance records are not to hand, the relevant social security authorities have been requested to forward the necessary information. Most of those who might qualify for a <i>pro-rata</i> pre-1953 pension would be people living in Great Britain who are in receipt of a British retirement pension in their own right.</P>
      <P>Every effort is being made to process these claims as quickly as possible. As has been the case with all applications for the pension, the overriding consideration is that all claims are thoroughly checked to ensure that pensioners receive their correct entitlement and nobody loses out as a result on any shortcomings in regard to the quality of the records available.</P>

      <askee>Minister for Social and Family Affairs</askee>
      <Quest>the number of non-contributory old age pensioners and non-contributory widows pensioners whose pensions have been reduced as a result of receiving British pension entitlements; the total reduced in 2002 and 2003 to date; and if she will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social and Family Affairs (Mary Coughlan)</NameTxt>
      <P>There are almost 104,000 people receiving an Irish non-contributory old age or widowed person's pension. Of these, some 10,700, or 10%, also receive a British retirement pension. British pension rates in these cases are less than the maximum rate of non-contributory pension payable in this country. As a result, the people concerned have an entitlement to Irish pension to, in effect, top-up their British pension to the level of Irish non-contributory pension.</P>
      <P>The rate paid in respect of Irish non-contributory pension to people with British pensions has to be adjusted to take account of changes in the rate of their British pension. In this regard, there is a legal obligation on pensioners to notify the Department in the event of changes in their means for whatever reason. While changes in exchange rates themselves do not lead to initiation of claim reviews by my Department, they must be taken into account when the case is being reviewed.</P>
      <P>My Department has an ongoing claim review and control programme in place for all social welfare schemes, including pensions. In the calendar years 2002 and 2003 to date, some 740 pensioners with British retirement pensions have had their old age non-contributory pensions reduced following claim reviews, largely as a consequence of increases in their British pensions. In the same period, 60 widow/er's non-contributory pensions were reduced for this reason following review. It should be noted that the overall income position of these pensioners has been maintained, as their Irish pension reductions arose directly as a result of corresponding increases in their other means.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 135, 431 and 432 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The free travel scheme is available to all people living in the State, aged 66 years or over, to all carers in receipt of carer's allowance and to carers of people in receipt of constant attendance or <Col N="158" /> prescribed relative's allowance. It is also available to certain people with disabilities.</P>
    <P>The household benefits package, which comprises the electricity/gas allowance, telephone allowance and free television licence schemes is generally available to people living permanently in the State, aged 66 years or over, who are in receipt of a social welfare type payment or who fulfil a means test. The package is also available to carers and people with disabilities under the age of 66 who are in receipt of certain welfare type payments. People aged over 70 years of age can qualify regardless of their income or household composition. The household benefits package as currently constituted provides a basic package of household benefits for a particular targeted group. There are no plans at present to expand the range of services covered by the schemes. My colleague, the Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs operates the scheme of community support for older people which provides funding for initiatives to improve the security and social support of vulnerable older people.</P>
    <P>With regard to developments on the free travel scheme, the Government programme includes a proposal to put in place an All-Ireland travel scheme for pensioners resident in all parts of this island. This will require discussions and agreement with the relevant authorities and transport providers on both sides of the border. Work on the implementation of this proposal will commence as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>Very significant improvements have been made in the household benefit package of schemes and the free travel scheme in recent budgets both in terms of the qualifying conditions and the coverage of the schemes. I will continue to review the operation of all schemes in a budgetary context with a view to identifying the scope for further improvements.</P>

      <P>The 13 recommendations in question were the 11 relating to IFSRA, and recommendations numbered 34 and 57. Those relating to the Irish Financial Services Regulatory Authority, IFSRA, are now being progressed since IFSRA was established on a statutory basis on 1st May 2003.</P>
      <P>Recommendation No. 34 relates to the Department of Transport. It deals with amending the Road Traffic Acts to require insurance on the vehicle as in mainland Europe, rather than requiring the user of the vehicle to be insured as is the case in Ireland and the United Kingdom. Implementation would involve fundamental changes in the arrangements for motor insurance in Ireland. The complex risk assessment and civil liability issues and potential costs and advantages of implementation will have to be evaluated before coming to a decision. In this context I note that the report of the implementation group in August 2002 estimated that implementation of recommendation 34 would have no impact on costs.</P>
      <P>Recommendation No. 57 refers to &ldquo;not increasing the financial limits of the court&rdquo;. This is to prevent further increases in claims costs and in legal fees. The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform will not commence the relevant provision, which would increase financial limits of the Courts and Courts Officers Act 2002 until the personal injuries assessment Board has been in operation for a period and experience is available on the extent of its effect on the case load of the courts. In effect, by not commencing the relevant provision in the Courts and Courts Officers Act 2002, the MIAB recommendation is being implemented, to the extent that the financial limits of the courts are not being increased. No action is required at present. Experience gained when PIAB has been in operation for some time will then be considered for future action in this matter.</P>

      <P>The activity referred to by the Deputy is called the phoenix syndrome. The main company law provisions to deal with the phoenix syndrome are contained in Part VII of the Companies Act 1990. Part VII and related provisions provide that where companies are wound up and are found to be unable to pay their debts or where companies are not wound up because they are unable to meet their debts, the directors of such companies are restricted from being involved in the promotion or formation of a company or acting as a director or secretary of a company unless that company has a specified minimum paid up share capital. The amount of the minimum paid up share capital is &euro;317, 434 in the case of plcs and &euro;63,487 for any other company. To avoid restriction, a company director must be able to show to the court that he or she acted honestly and responsibly in relation to the conduct of the affairs of the company.</P>
      <P>Part VII also provides that a person who is convicted on indictment for an offence in relation to a company or for an offence involving fraud or dishonesty is automatically disqualified from having any involvement in the promotion or formation of a company or acting as an officer of a company, irrespective of the paid up share capital without the matter having to go before the courts. Also, the court may disqualify a person where the person is adjudged guilty of a range of matters, including where the conduct of the person makes him or her unfit to be involved in the management of a company.</P>
      <P>The recently established Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement will have a major role in combating the phoenix syndrome and has been fully resourced and given a range of enforcement powers to this end. In addition, the liquidators of all insolvent companies are now required to seek the restriction of all company directors, unless specifically relieved of that obligation by the Director of Corporate Enforcement.</P>

      <P>At present the work permit system grants the permit to an employer to recruit a specific employee to fill a specific vacancy, where the employer has been unable to find a suitable employee within Ireland or the wider European Economic Area. This arrangement does have the safeguard that the non-EEA employee in question is coming to fill a specific vacancy, an important factor when most of the personnel in question are at the lower end of the skills spectrum.</P>
      <P>Work permit personnel may in certain circumstances change jobs and in such circumstances a new work permit is issued to an eligible employer. This flexibility is possible and warranted by the relatively high number of vacancies arising in recent years.</P>
      <P>If we were to move to a situation where a work permit was given to the individual employee, we would in effect be giving on authorisation to come to Ireland in search of an employer. Such a system would give rise to a number of serious policy questions and would raise very significant resource issues. Any informed decision to move to a new system should take these into account.</P>
      <P>Any proposal to issue employment permits directly to employees raises questions such as: To whom would permits be issued?; in respect of what skills?; how many per year?; would we give quotas to other countries, if requested, and if so, to which countries?; for how long might a person seek a job?; what would be done if a person did not find a job within the period allowed?; would families of the work permit holder be permitted to travel immediately and, if so, who would be responsible for their substance in Ireland?</P>
      <P>In terms of resources, the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform has had to put in place very significant resources to give detailed consideration to applications from 10,000-12,000 asylum seekers per year. Given the likely level of demand from aspiring employees, the question arises as to whether the State would be prepared to devote an equivalent amount of resources to detailed assessment of employment permit applications from a similar or even greater level of applicants.</P>

      <P>On 15 January 2003, I approved, in principle, the report of the Reserve Defence Forces Review Implementation Board for the implementation of the recommendations of the special steering group on the Reserve. The steering group, which I estab<Col N="167" /> lished to undertake a study of the Reserve, reported to me in September 1999.</P>
      <P>The Permanent Defence Force is now organised in a three-brigade structure and a Defence Forces training centre. The Reserve Defence Force will be similarly reorganised and restructured and it is envisaged that the implementation of these changes in the Reserve Defence Force will take place over a period of approximately six years.</P>
      <P>The White Paper on Defence recognised that a notable and important feature of the existing FCA organisation is its countrywide, geographical spread. This particular aspect will, in general terms, be retained in the future. The full organisational and establishment details of the new Reserve will be determined in the course of the ongoing detailed implementation process. Plans are currently being prepared within each brigade for the amalgamation of FCA units in line with the proposals outlined in the steering group report. The objective of this process is to ensure that better training and other facilities will be provided to members of the Reserve Defence Force.</P>
      <P>In general terms, the blueprint for the new Reserve Defence Force will involve replacing An Fórsa Cosanta Áitiúil with an Army Reserve consisting of two elements. One element will provide personnel who will integrate with Permanent Defence Force units to bring them up to full operational strength in a contingency situation. Personnel who opt for a period of integrated service will be provided with enhanced military training. The larger element will provide the overall Army Reserve, organised into three Reserve brigades.</P>
      <P>The steering group report proposed the amalgamation of the 18th Infantry Battalion with the 25th Infantry Battalion and a consequence reduction in the number of companies. I am aware that the General Officer Commanding the Western Brigade has proposed that the existing battalion HQ located in Castlebar be replaced with a company HQ and a rifle company. Currently the number of personnel who attend for training on a regular basis, is 310. Accordingly, no Reserve Defence Force location will be closed and no member of the RDF will be asked or required to terminate their service. However, no final decision on the amalgamation of FCA units will be taken until I have had the opportunity to examine and approve the final amalgamation proposals which are to be submitted to me by the implementation board of each brigade by June 2003.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Members of the FCA are already seeing the benefits of the reorganisation process in terms of better clothing and improved equipment and more and better quality training. As the process develops we will see additional benefits in terms of a clearer role for the Reserve, a better overall organisation structure, and opportunities for suitably qualified Reserve personnel to serve over<Col N="168" /> seas. We will also see benefits from the closer integration of the Reserve with the Army.</P>
    <P>In 2002, &euro;185,000 was spent upgrading the facilities in Castlebar barracks. Currently the kitchen facilities within Castlebar military barracks are being upgraded. The electrical wiring within the sleeping accommodation is awaiting refurbishment. As I have previously stated it is not intended to close any Reserve Defence Force location.</P>
    <P>I must emphasise I am very mindful of the need to preserve and to retain the very many traditional and well established strengths of the current Reserve system, not least the admirable spirit of individual voluntary commitment, close social links with local communities and a good depth and scope as regards nation-wide geographical spread.</P>

      <P>The person named applied for area aid in 2001 in respect of 41.53 hectares but this included a land parcel in respect of which an overclaim of 1.28 hectares or 3.18% was determined.</P>
      <P>Under EU rules where an applicant makes an area overclaim of between 3% and 20%, a penalty of double the difference must be applied in determining the area eligible for payment purposes. After application of the penalty, an area of 37.69 hectares was determined for this herd owner's 2001 area aid and he did not qualify for 2001 extensification premium.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The person named requested a review of his 2001 application on the basis that the area over<Col N="170" /> claimed was less than that recorded on the area aid system. Following an on-the-spot inspection, the area found has been revised upwards to 40.56 hectares which is sufficient for him to qualify for payment of 2001 extensification premium. Payment of &euro;791.92 has now issued to the person named.</P>

      <P>Bovine artificial insemination in Ireland is regulated by the Live Stock (Artificial Insemination) Act 1947 and the Live Stock (Artificial Insemination) Regulations 1948. Under this legislation a person may not distribute or sell bull semen or practice the artificial insemination of cattle except under and in accordance with a licence issued by my Department. In addition to the regulatory provisions already outlined, the European Communities (Trade in Bovine Breeding Animals, Their Semen, Ova and Embryos) Regulations 1996, implemented by my Department, also apply.</P>
      <P>The bovine semen distribution network in Ireland is composed of AI organisations and semen collection centres and semen distribution companies. All companies and organisations operating in the network must be licensed by my Department. As part of the control process licensed companies are subject to on-site inspections by officials of my Department.</P>
      <P>AI technicians, operating on behalf of these organizations to deliver the service to farmers, must have a licence issued by my Department under the Diseases of Animals Act 1966 (Foot-and-Mouth Disease) (Restriction on Artificial Insemination) Order. Individual farmers must also have a licence from my Department to carry out artificial insemination of cattle in their own herds only.</P>

      <P>The 2002 area aid application for the person named has been fully processed and an area determined for payment purposes of 61.02 hectares.</P>
      <P>The person named applied for premium on 18 January 2002 for ten animals under the 2002 suckler cow premium scheme under herdnumber G2620293. A further application for premium in respect of 17 cows and three heifers was lodged by him on 16 May 2002 under herdnumber G2631252 with a note stating that his father was retiring from farming and that the suckler cow quotas were being amalgamated. The herdnumbers were subsequently amalgamated under G2631252.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Correspondence issued to the applicant concerning the animals claimed which as a result of the amalgamation totalled 27 cows and three heifers. He was advised that under the terms and conditions of the scheme the number of heifers <Col N="172" /> being submitted for premium must be at least 15% of the total number of animals for which premium is being requested and so with an application for premium for 30 animals it is a requirement to include five heifers. The herdowner was given the option of deleting two cows and including a further two heifers.</P>
    <P>He replied stating that although he had two heifers on the date of application 16 May, they were sold inside the required retention period. The position therefore is that as the total number of heifers eligible for payment is three the maximum number of cows will be limited to 20 in order to be compliant with the terms and conditions of the scheme.</P>
    <P>The herdowner can request a review of his case through his local office and is also entitled to request the appeals office to examine the matter. Payment of his suckler cow entitlement under herdnumber G2631252 will issue as soon as possible.</P>

      <P>The criteria for obtaining suckler cow quota from the national reserve are proposed each year by the quota review group and adopted with or without amendments by me, as Minister, having regard to EU regulations governing the quota regime.</P>
      <P>The criteria are generally similar from year to year and the criteria which applied in respect of the 2003 national reserve were as follows. There were four categories A, B, C, D under which farmers could apply for an allocation of quota but a farmer could only apply under one category. Category A catered for first time applicants for suckler cow premium in 2003 who were under 35 years of age on 1 January 2002. Farmers who applied for the suckler cow premium for the first time in 2002 could also apply under this category provided they satisfied the age criteria. Category B catered for farmers with holdings on off-shore islands where at least 50% of the forage area of the holding was located on the island. Category C catered for organic farmers who were registered with the Department on or before 29 June 2002. Category D catered for farmers who were regular applicants for the suckler cow premium and who would be applying in 2003 and who required additional quota to ensure viability of their holdings.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="176" />The total annual income of a farmer including that of his-her spouse-partner, applicable under all categories, could not exceed &euro;25,600. Any off-farm income for the period 6 April 2001 to 31 December 2001 included in the total income could not exceed &euro;9,525.</P>
    <P>In respect of Categories A, C and D only, the total number of livestock units on the holding could not exceed 50. There were only some 1,500 suckler cow premium rights available for distribution from the 2003 national reserve. Since demand for reserve quota exceeded that figure, there were not enough rights available to satisfy all applicants. Consequently, quota had to be distributed in accordance with the priorities laid down by the quota review group and EU regulations as follows: (i) 5% of the reserve had to be reserved for category B applicants &ndash; farmers with holdings on offshore islands; (ii) 10% of the reserve had to be reserved for category C applicants &ndash; organic farmers; and (iii) the remaining quota was distributed to qualifying applicants under category A &ndash; first time applicants under 35 years of age who, under EU rules, had to be given priority. As a result there was no quota left to allocate to any applicant under category D, that is, farmers who required additional quota to ensure viability of their holding. The position with regard to the 2004 national reserve will be examined later next month.</P>

      <P>Section 18(2) of the National Pensions Reserve Fund Act 2000 provides that each year there shall be paid into the national pensions reserve fund, in equal quarterly instalments, a sum equivalent to 1% of GNP. The fund is managed by commissioners who are independent of Government. They con<Col N="180" /> trol and manage the fund with discretionary authority to determine and implement an investment strategy for the fund. This investment strategy is based on a commercial investment mandate with the objective of securing the optimal return over the long-term, having regard to (a) the purpose of the fund as set out in section 18(1) of the Act and (b) the payment requirements of the fund as provided for under section 20, provided the level of risk to the moneys held or invested is acceptable to the commission. In following this mandate, the commission has decided on an investment portfolio of 80% equities and 20% bonds. The commission commenced entry into the markets in 2002. The assets of the fund were held in cash up to 31 December 2001.</P>
      <P>The national pensions reserve fund was established on 2 April 2001 with &euro;6,515 million being allocated to the fund. This sum was comprised of the net proceeds of the sale of the former Telecom Éireann and 1% of GNP in 1999 and 2000 as well as interest earned on same. A total of &euro;972 million, representing the 1% of GNP contribution, was paid into the fund in 2001.</P>
      <P>In 2002, the 1% of GNP contribution paid into the fund amounted to &euro;1,034.5 million. By end-December 2002 a total of &euro;8,163 million had been paid into the national pensions reserve fund since its inception in April 2001 by way of capital contributions from the Exchequer. A further capital contribution of &euro;276 million was made in March 2003 bringing the total Exchequer contribution to &euro;8,439 million.</P>
      <P>The provisional market value of the fund at end 2002, the latest date for which figures have been published by the Commission, was &euro;7,426 million, that is, there has been a decline of &euro;737 million between the capital contributions to end 2002 and the year-end value of the fund. This represents a return of -13.3% since the fund's inception, as opposed to a return for the fund's strategic benchmark of -24.4% and a return for the average Irish managed pension fund of -19.3%.</P>

    <P>I can appreciate the thrust of the various points raised by the Deputy.

      <P>As I outlined to the Deputy before, the Office of Public Works has been giving every assistance in these areas since the severe flooding from the River Tolka last November.

The work involved constructing a new wall along the Tolka to the rear of these houses.</P>
      <P>The Office of Public Works has also, since January, been carrying out further flood alleviation measures, which were contained in the interim report prepared by the consultants carrying out the flood study on the River Tolka for Dublin City Council.

Indeed the Office of Public Works will continue these interim works until the autumn when they are due to be completed.

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 193 and 194 together.</P>
      <P>The International Financial Services Centre (IFSC) was established by the Government in 1987. The key focus in establishing the centre was the desire to create a substantive and active financial centre which would generate quality sustainable employment for a well-educated young work force. An additional goal was to contribute to the renewal and regeneration of the Custom House Docks area. In 1998, the EU Commission reviewed its approval under EU state aid rules of the IFSC regime and agreement was reached on arrangements for phasing out the preferential IFSC regime in an orderly manner in conjunction with the introduction of the general 12.5% corporation tax rate from 1 January 2003 for all trading income, including financial services. Under the agreement reached with the Commission, projects approved prior to end July 1998, will continue to benefit from the preferential 10% rate until the end of 2005, while those approved after July 1998 could avail of the 10% tax rate until the end of 2002.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the tax yield from IFSC companies, I take it that the Deputy is referring to corporation tax. I understand from the Revenue Commissioners that the estimated corporation tax paid by these companies in 2002, including <Col N="183" /> advance preliminary tax, was of the order of &euro;700 million. The IFSC has been a major success and is now firmly established as a quality international financial services centre. In addition to the significant corporation tax yield from this sector, the IFSC makes a major contribution to Ireland, both in terms of the provision of high quality employment and our international profile. The international financial services industry estimate that there are 11,000 people directly employed in the IFSC and in associated back-office projects. The centre has also given rise to substantial indirect employment, in areas such as accounting, legal, computer and other general service industries. Substantial renewal of the docklands area has also been achieved.</P>
    <P>In the context of the introduction of the general 12.5% corporation tax rate, the challenge for Ireland is to build on the substantial foundations that have already been put in place. The Government's strategy is to ensure that Ireland maintains its hard-won competitive edge in the global marketplace. Our goal is to ensure that the IFSC will continue to attract new operations by providing a supportive business environment. New products are coming on-stream and business opportunities are being identified and pursued. In that regard, the Finance Act 2003 included a number of initiatives which are designed to promote the further development of Ireland's international financial services industry. These include provisions on securitisation transactions, asset management and international pension funds investment. I am confident that the industry is well placed to continue to grow and develop this important sector of our economy into the future.</P>

      <P>In the event of a sustained, significant decrease in the price of oil, disposable spending power would tend to increase and strengthen economic growth in our major trading partners. This would be likely to increase our exports to those countries and could also reduce inflation here. However, while oil prices have decreased from $34 in March, the highest price since 2000, it remains to be seen how permanent this decline is.</P>
      <P>As a small, open economy, Irelands ability to trade to a large extent determines our living standards. Therefore, it is vital that Ireland remain competitive primarily in relation to our main trading partners, but also in a global context. Relatively high wage and price inflation pose a risk to the competitiveness of our economy. This is particularly the case in the context of the euro recent appreciation against both the dollar and sterling.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="184" />The euro is currently trading higher against the US dollar and sterling than at the same time last year. The appreciation of the euro affects the economy in a number of different ways. On the positive side, it lowers inflation by reducing input prices and reduces oil prices, as oil is invoiced in US dollars. However, it also reduces the competitiveness of Irish firms exporting to the UK and US and of firms competing with US and UK firms in third country markets. In addition, by diminishing the competitiveness of the euro area, it lessens demand for Irish goods and services in the euro area. That is why competitiveness is a priority for this Government.</P>

      <P>On budget day last December, inflation, as measured by annual changes in the consumer price index (CPI), was projected to average 4.8% this year. This forecast was, as always, based on the technical assumption of unchanged interest rates, exchange rates and oil prices as at the time of the forecast. Since then the ECB has twice reduced interest rates. These cuts, together with the appreciation of the euro, the recent decrease in oil prices and the easing of domestic inflationary pressures will have a favourable impact on CPI inflation this year. The annual rate of inflation fell to 4.3% in April. This is in line with the expectation that inflation would moderate over the course of the year.</P>
      <P>My Department's revised inflation estimate for 2003 will be published in the Economic Review and Outlook in the summer.</P>

      <P>Section 140 of the Finance Act 2003 gave legislative effect to the stamp duty increase from &euro;19 to &euro;40 per annum on credit card accounts which I announced in the budget 2003.</P>
      <P>This section also contains an anti-avoidance provision as, under the previous legislation, the stamp duty on credit cards was in respect of an account maintained by the bank on 1 April. However, people could cancel their cards in a particular manner so as to avoid the annual charge. In view of this, an anti-avoidance provision was included in the Finance Act 2003 for credit cards to ensure that a stamp duty charge will arise where the account is maintained by the bank at any time during the 12 &ndash; month period ending on 1 April rather than maintained specifically on 1 April. This change is effective where the charge arises after 1 April 2003.</P>
      <P>If an individual having used a card at any time cancels the credit card after 1 April in a year, a further stamp duty charge of &euro;40 is payable on closure of the account, as the account had been maintained by the financial institution at any time during the year ending on 1 April of the following year. This is consistent with applying a stamp duty charge for a year or part of a year for which the credit card account is held.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are revenue implications in any change to the current provisions. For that reason I will keep this matter under consideration in the context of next year's budget and Finance Bill, which <Col N="186" /> is the normal context for any changes in taxation arrangements.</P>

      <P>I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that, based on declarations made by all qualifying savings managers, QSMs, at 31 December 2002, the total number of active accounts at 31 December 2002 was 1,143,962, as compared to 1,170,208 at 30 April 2002, a reduction of 26,246. These figures are based on information provided to date by all QSMs in their 2002 declarations and revisions may be necessary if amendments to those declarations are received at a later date.</P>
      <P>I am further informed by the Revenue Commissioners that there are no official figures as to the number of SSIA accounts which are either at a fixed or variable rate of interest. Nor is there any information on the breakdown between accounts that are deposit-based or equity-type accounts. As all accounts receive the Exchequer contribution of 25%, there is no requirement for QSMs to provide a breakdown of which of their deposit based savers receive fixed interest rates and which receive interest at a variable rate.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will be aware that, as long as the rate payable on an SSIA deposit account is above 0%, the balance of the account will be made up of the contribution the saver has made, the 25% Exchequer contribution, and any interest payment added to their account. As far as I am aware, all variable deposit interest SSIA accounts are interest bearing.</P>

      <P>The Ombusdman's special report to the Oireachtas of November 2002 entitled Redress to Taxpayers made a number of recommendations. The Revenue Commissioners accepted and moved immediately to implement two of the five recommendations. These were the repayment of an additional five years tax in the two cases which were the subject of the report and repayments in any other cases similarly affected. However, Rev<Col N="187" /> enue maintained that it could not implement the other recommendations of the Ombudsman in regard to paying compensation for loss of purchasing power because it did not have the statutory authority to do so.</P>
      <P>On foot of the Ombudsman's special report, I introduced legislative provisions in Finance Act 2003 which provide for a general right to repayment of taxes and duties, subject to a four year claim period. The scheme also provides a right to interest on such repayments subject to certain conditions. These general provisions are prospective and represent a balanced approach to providing general rights to repayment and interest while protecting the Exchequer from unquantifiable and unlimited costs.</P>
      <P>In order to respond fully to the Ombudsman's report, provisions were also made in the Finance Act to cater for certain specific cases on which the Ombudsman had made recommendations. The cases in question arose from a court finding (O'Coindealbháin v. O'Carroll) which led to a reinterpretation of tax law regarding the tax treatment of Garda widows' pensions. The provisions provided for in Finance Act 2003 enabled the Revenue Commissioners to make payments for loss of purchasing power to the widows referred to in the Ombudsman's report. Payments will be made by reference to the consumer price index, as recommended by the Ombudsman, and will come out of the central fund.</P>
      <P>In addition, the Revenue Commissioners will use the voted funds mechanism to make loss of purchasing power payments to a much smaller remaining group of ten taxpayers arising from other tax matters on a wholly exceptional and ex gratia basis, so as to complete the response to the Ombusdman's recommendation.</P>
      <P>I am informed that appropriate administrative arrangements are now in place and payments have begun to issue to the people concerned.</P>

While the top rate of stamp duty for certain categories of residential property had, for several years, been 9%, the top rate for non-residential property had remained at 6%. The new rates introduced ensure that the same top rate of 9% exists for both resi<Col N="189" /> dential and non-residential property.

An anti-avoidance provision was also included in the recent legislative changes so that, in future, the stamp duty charge will arise by reference to accounts maintained at any time during the year, rather than on a particular day (that is 1 April). However, I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that there is an established Revenue practice for the banks not to charge duty in certain circumstances (e.g. where the card is returned never having been used, is reported stolen or the cardholder is deceased). This practise has not been altered by the recent Finance Act.</P>

      <P>I am informed by my officials that Dublin City Council, which is the contracting authority for the greater dublin drainage study (which includes a full study on the River Tolka catchment), expects to receive a draft technical report, on the River Tolka catchment, from the consultants, M.C. O'Sullivan &amp; Co, later this month. This will require detailed technical examination by the contracting authority and the Office of Public Works. While the draft technical report is being considered the consultants will carry out an evaluation of the issues raised in third party submissions and will also complete a cost benefit analysis on the recommended scheme. The contracting authority expects a draft final report before the end of July.</P>
      <P>When the full report is completed, it should provide additional information on the entire catchment of the Tolka and this along with the items in the interim report, which have not yet been implemented, will provide the basis on which decisions will be made on further flood alleviation measures. Decisions on the provision of funding for a flood relief scheme on the catchment can only be made when the final report has been fully examined.</P>

      <P>Under Government accounting procedures, the Government carries its own insurance. This is based on the fact that the risks for which it could be liable are wide ranging. In general, the premia to be paid by the Government to cover all the likely risks would be greater than the cost of the compensation or damage in any year.</P>
      <P>Each category of risk is considered on its merits in order to establish whether a departure from the general rule would be justified. Such departures require Department of Finance approval.</P>
      <P>There are a number of exceptions where insurance has been taken out, for example: the Department of Defence takes out insurance to cover official vehicles in use abroad; the Tánaiste's office took out an insurance policy for public liability in respect of a seminar on unemployment held in St. Patrick's College in 1996; there is a limited insurance policy in place since 1998 to cover officials when travelling abroad on official business; the Irish Coastguard provides insurance for its emergency road vehicles, marine craft and personal accident insurance for its volunteers; and health boards take out public liability insurance on their property.</P>

      <P>The Government has long been concerned about allegations of collusion between the security forces and loyalist paramilitaries in Northern Ireland. <Col N="194" /> We have consistently raised such allegations with the British Government.</P>
      <P>The recent report published by Sir John Stevens on 17 April confirmed much of what has been alleged. He reported that there was collusion in the murders of Pat Finucane and Adam Lambert and he uncovered enough evidence to believe that the murders could have been prevented. Nationalists were known to have been targeted but were not properly warned or protected. Stevens sought to determine whether both sides of the community were dealt with in equal measure by the RUC and found that they were not.</P>
      <P>These findings are of the utmost gravity and raise fundamental questions. It is clear that the murder of Pat Finucane cannot be considered in isolation. The Government's conviction that a public inquiry is required to resolve the questions that surround his murder has been reinforced by the Stevens report. The allegations regarding Stakeknife are also disturbing and give rise to fundamental questions regarding accountability and the rule of law.</P>
      <P>Two years ago at Weston Park the Government agreed with the British Government that there was a need to gain closure on certain cases which were, and continue to be, a source of grave public concern, both in themselves and in terms of maintaining the necessary confidence in the administration of justice. On 28 May 2002 the two Governments announced the appointment of Justice Peter Cory, a retired judge of the Canadian Supreme Court, to undertake a thorough investigation of allegations of collusion in certain outstanding cases, among them those of Pat Finucane and Rosemary Nelson.</P>
      <P>Judge Cory has completed the Finucane, Hamill and Wright cases and is currently working on the Rosemary Nelson case. He will then start work on the cases in this jurisdiction. Judge Cory has indicated that he hopes to finish his report later this year. The two Governments have agreed that, in the event that a public inquiry is recommended in any case, the relevant Government will implement that recommendation.</P>
      <P>The allegations of British military intelligence operations in our jurisdiction are taken very seriously and I will be raising this matter with the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland today at the BIIGC in London. It is a situation on which we have very little factual information &ndash; there are allegations and counter allegations in the public domain and, until we have received clarification on the situation, it is difficult to comment with authority.</P>
      <P>The Government will continue to closely monitor developments regarding all such allegations, with its approach being determined in particular by the need to establish confidence in the administration of justice and the rule of law.</P>

      <P>The Government's national programme of assistance to developing countries comprises two elements. The major component is my Department's Vote for international co-operation, &euro;374 million in 2003. Overseas development aid is expected to total some &euro;80 million in 2003 and elements of it are administered by other Departments.</P>
      <P>The UN target for official development assistance is expressed in GNP percentage terms. Ireland's official development assistance is reported on an annual basis as a percentage of GNP in compliance with OECD requirements. Provisional outturn figures indicate that overall expenditure on ODA in 2002 amounted to &euro;422 million or 0.41% of GNP compared to &euro;320 million or 0.33% of GNP in 2001. In percentage terms Ireland is now the seventh largest donor internationally and is just behind Belgium at 0.42%. Our performance is well above the EU average.</P>
      <P>These increases have been pursuant to the Government's commitment to achieving the UN target for ODA of 0.7% of GNP by the end of 2007.</P>

      <P>The situation has not changed significantly since I answered a similar question in the House on 9 April, when I outlined our policy in relation to this issue. The Government continues to follow the situation closely. We continue to consider the UN settlement plan, which provides for the holding of a referendum to determine the future status of Western Sahara, as a reasonable basis for a just political solution to the conflict. We also welcome political negotiations on possible alter<Col N="198" /> native proposals for a solution, though these must embrace the consent of all parties to the conflict.</P>
      <P>On 19 May the United Nations Secretary General issued his latest report on the situation in Western Sahara. His report and recommendations are being examined by the Government.</P>
      <P>Following on from this, the UN Security Council will discuss the issue during the week. It is expected to adopt a new resolution before the end of the month.</P>

      <Quest>if he has raised the issue of the several hundred people who disappeared in the Republic of Congo since 1992 with the government of that country; if he has raised the failure of the UNHCR to protect returnees at the United Nations; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <P>The Republic of Congo, Brazzaville, suffered from three civil wars during the 1990s. Its Government's general amnesty for rebel groups and the subsequent ceasefire agreements reached with them facilitated the restoration of peace in that country. The Republic of Congo has now entered a period of relative stability. Presidential elections in 2002 were observed by an EU election observation mission which included two Irish observers. On 17 March a new ceasefire agreement was signed between the Government and Ninja rebels.</P>
      <P>In 1999 the UNHCR signed a tripartite agreement with the Governments of the Republic of Congo and of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Kinshasa, for the voluntary return of refugees to the former country. The UNHCR subsequently facilitated the return of thousands of refugees through logistical and humanitarian support for those who chose to return. The disappearance of 353 of these returnees is deeply disturbing and a matter for the Government of the Republic of Congo to urgently address. I am confident that the UNHCR did everything within its means to protect returning refugees.</P>
      <P>The EU has committed itself to finding a lasting peace in the Republic of Congo by funding disarmament, demobilisation and reintegration initiatives. The European development fund is carefully examining ways it can help strengthen human rights processes in the country, including reform of the security sector. I support and endorse these efforts.</P>

      <P>In May 2002 my predecessor announced the provision of 175 additional therapy training places to tackle the shortage of physiotherapists, occupational therapists and speech and language therapists. These vacancies were identified by the report Current and Future Supply and Demand Conditions in the Labour Market for Certain Professional Therapists undertaken by Dr. Peter Bacon and Associates in 2001. The announcement followed on the work of an interagency working group comprising representatives from my Department, the Department of Health and Children and the Higher Education Authority was established to ensure the provision of these extra places. It considered proposals received from a number of third level institutions for the expansion of existing courses and/or the introduction of new courses, including graduate entry programmes. The distribution of the additional places is as follows:</P>

      <P>25 places &ndash; bachelor of science in physiotherapy</P>
      <P>In 2002 there was an intake to the new physiotherapy course at the University of Limerick. Preparatory arrangements, including the recruitment of necessary staff, are being made by the institutions concerned to enable first intakes to the other additional courses to commence in 2003. These increases are in addition to previous increases in the number of places provided by institutions with existing courses in the 2000-01 and 2001-02 academic years, in response to a request by the Higher Education Authority to expand provision in light of perceived shortages. The provision of these extra places takes account of the full analysis set out in the Bacon report and is in line with the recommendations made.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Mr. N. Dempsey)</NameTxt>
      <P>Payment to teachers for supervision and substitution duties was introduced with effect from 1 September 2001. Pensionability of the payment applies in the case of a teacher who, on foot of a written commitment, undertakes the duties on an ongoing basis to retirement under a 37 hour per annum contract. A teacher currently in service must give the written commitment by 1 September 2004 while future appointees must commit within one year from date of first appointment. Teachers who retire on pension between 1 September 2001 and 31 August 2004 and who have received payment for the delivery of supervision and substitution duties will have the payment, subject to averaging of the amount received as appropriate, reckoned for pension purposes. Pensionability in all cases is also subject to the teacher making the appropriate pension contributions on the payment.</P>
      <P>As with other pension emoluments, for a teacher to benefit in pension they must have received monetary payment for supervision and substitution immediately prior to retirement. In this case the payment must have been received for the delivery of the duties on foot of an ongoing commitment. Teachers who retired prior to 1 September 2001 did not have payment for supervision and substitution in pay therefore it cannot be reckoned in their pensions.</P>
      <P>This approach is consistent with long established pension parity policy. Where a pensionable payment is introduced from a specific date the benefits are confined to those retiring after that date provided they otherwise fulfil the requirements.</P>
      <P>With regard to future pension increases for teachers, practice will be guided by the development of policy for the public service generally. The Commission on Public Service Pensions recommended that public service pensions should continue to increase in line with public service pay, although it recommended an alternative method of calculation.</P>
      <P>The detailed implementation of the commission's recommendations is still under consideration by a joint management-union working party. The working party is expected to complete its report for Government shortly.</P>
      <P>Pending any decision by Government, pension increases for teachers will continue to be based on existing pension increase practice.</P>

      <P>As outlined to the Deputy in a recent parliamentary question, the school's future has been under review for some time. I am satisfied that educational provision should be phased out over a two year period, with final closure in June 2005. I have advised the owners and trustees accordingly. To facilitate an orderly closure the school authorities will not accept a first year intake in September.</P>
      <P>I am confident that arrangements can be made to facilitate the placement of pupils from St. Brigid's in neighbouring schools as the situation arises. Arrangements are currently being made to accommodate the remaining pupils during the phasing out of the school through the provision of temporary accommodation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>All reasonable arrangements have been made to facilitate the orderly closure of the school. <Col N="206" /> Therefore, a meeting would not serve any useful purpose.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Mr. N. Dempsey)</NameTxt>
      <P>The report to which the Deputy refers was commissioned by Dublin Institute of Technology with financial support from Atlantic Philanthropies. I received a copy in the past week and I will consider it in due course.</P>
      <P>The issue of university status for Dublin Institute of Technology is not new. In June 1997 the Government decided to appoint a review group under section 9 of the Universities Act 1997. The group was established to advise the Higher Education Authority on whether, having regard to the objects and functions of a university under sections 12 and 13, Dublin Institute of Technology should be established as a university.</P>
      <P>The group's report, chaired by Dr. Dermot Nally, was published in November 1998. The group recommended that there should not be immediate university status for Dublin Institute of Technology. However, the group recommended that the institute might become a university within a three to five year period subject to it meeting a number of criteria set out in the report.</P>
      <P>In March 1999 the HEA, following detailed consideration and analysis of the advice prepared by the review group, recommended against the immediate establishment of the Dublin Institute of Technology as a university. It indicated that a further statutory review of the institute, in line with section 9 of the Universities Act, would be necessary for university status. This can only arise should Dublin Institute of Technology, at some future date, apply for university status and should the Government decide that the application be considered.</P>
      <P>Waterford Institute of Technology has no plans to change its status. My Department continues to work with the institute on its development and upgrading.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In July 1996 the Government approved, in principle, the recommendations in the report of the steering committee on the future development of higher education, as a benchmark for future planning in the sector. The committee concluded that an upgrading and expansion of Waterford regional college, now WIT, represented the most appropriate response to the higher education needs of the southeast region. The committee's report also recommended an increase in student places, an increase in degree level awards and a change of title. It was also <Col N="207" /> recommended that the major focus of expansion should be at degree level. It stated that such provision would place the college at the top end of the spectrum in terms of provision of degree places and would enable the region to reach the national average participation rate in degree programmes.</P>
    <P>The Government accepted these recommendations. The provision, in both the total number of places and in degree level courses, in WIT has been expanded annually and incrementally in line with available resources. Figures supplied to my Department by the institute indicate that almost 40% of students enrolled on full-time certificate, diploma, degree and postgraduate courses are enrolled on courses at degree and postgraduate levels. These measures, combined with the change of title of the college provide the necessary status and capacity for the institute to meet the identified higher education needs of the region over the coming years. Consistent with this approach, WIT is among the first institute of technology to be given authority to make its own educational awards under the terms of the Qualifications (Education and Training) Act 1999.</P>

      <P>There are five children detention schools under the aegis of my Department. They provide residential accommodation for children under 16 years who have been convicted of an offence or remanded in custody by the courts. The operational capacity of these schools was 130 places for the months of January to March 2003 rising to 134 places in the month of April. Of the 130 places available for use in January to March 2003, 100 places were occupied in January, 96 in February and 98 in March. Of the 134 places <Col N="209" /> available for use in April 2003, 92 places were occupied. The figures supplied relate to the last Wednesday in each month &ndash; 29 January, 26 February, 26 March and 30 April.</P>
      <P>The operational capacity and occupancy levels of these schools fluctuate on a daily basis. These variations may occur due to a range of factors such as client movement, refurbishment work, current child care practice, staffing levels etc. The capacity of the schools are monitored by the Department on an ongoing basis.</P>
      <P>Children convicted of offences may be committed to the schools for a period ranging from one year to four years. The average duration of stay ranges between 12 to 18 months. Children on charges before the courts may be remanded in custody to the schools either on remand only or remand for assessment. Remand period's range from days to weeks. The average duration of remand periods ranges between four to 13 weeks.</P>
      <P>Work is currently under way on a programme of capital developments at the children detention schools. This programme provides for the major refurbishment and replacement of existing facilities that are considered inadequate in the context of building regulations, health and safety standards and current minimum standards for residential child care.</P>
      <P>In 2002 my Department commissioned an independent review of residential provision for children. The purpose of this review is to ensure that there are adequate places available to accommodate children who have been convicted of an offence or placed on remand by a court and to ensure that the existing places are being used optimally. The schools for young offenders are currently governed by the Children Act 1908 which will be replaced by the Children Act 2001 when the provisions of the latter Act are commenced by ministerial orders.</P>
      <P>My Department is considering the recommendations of this report in conjunction with the implementation of the provisions of the Children Act 2001. The report has been forwarded to the Special Residential Services Board for its views, which will also be considered when available. The Special Residential Services Board was established in 2001 on an administrative basis. The purpose of the board is to ensure the efficient, effective and co-ordinated delivery of services to children on whom detention orders have been imposed or in respect of whom special care orders have been made.</P>

      <P>The new curricula at primary and post-primary level provide ample opportunity to extend students' awareness of their environment and the wider world, to learn about the lives of people in other countries, and of their contribution to art, history, music, drama, etc. particularly through the language, arts, religion, history and geography, music, business and home economics programmes, and the social education module of the leaving certificate applied. The social, personal and health education programmes at primary and post primary level, and the civic, social and political education programme at second level are designed to prepare students for participatory citizenship, to develop the skills of critical appraisal and decision-making based on human rights and social responsibilities, and to promote a respect for human dignity, tolerance for the values and beliefs of others, and a <Col N="212" /> celebration of diversity. The format allows scope for teachers to deal with issues such as gender equity, racism and xenophobia, interculturalism and development education. All subjects can be taught from an interculturalism anti-racism perspective.</P>
      <P>The recommendations in the report on promoting anti-racism and interculturalism centre on enhancing policies at national, organisational and institutional level; in promoting greater dialogue with interests and non governmental organisations; providing awareness and development programmes for staff; enhancing language tuition, translation, and support services; developing culturally appropriate materials; and increasing the focus on monitoring, research and evaluation.</P>
      <P>Actions under way to support the strategy include: information for schools on the integration of asylum seekers and travellers; additional resources for schools to support the needs of students for whom English is not the mother tongue; resource packs for schools prepared by organisations such as the National Consultative Committee on Anti-Racism and Interculturalism; a video for second level schools highlighting excerpts from the &ldquo;Mono&rdquo; programme; materials and training for teachers through funding the work of Integrate Ireland Language Training and other bodies; development in progress by the NCCA of guidelines for primary and post primary teachers on how the existing curriculum can be mediated and adapted to reflect the emergence of an expanding multi-cultural society; and supports provided by the Reception and Integration Agency to assist in the integration of refugees and asylum seekers into schools.</P>
      <P>Since the report was launched, modules in interculturalism have been developed and approved for use in the further education sector and work is nearing completion on a report on the next steps in implementing an FE strategy; support staff have been appointed in the Dublin vocational education committees to assist with the educational assessment and placement of unaccompanied minors; new initiatives for migrant groups have been developed under the back to education initiative; the number of adult non-nationals availing of literacy and language tuition through the VEC adult literacy service has increased to 3335; a report on addressing the literacy and language needs of adult asylum seekers has been launched, and training for staff has taken place in collaboration with the London language and literacy unit.</P>
      <P>The implementation of the strategy will be progressed and strengthened on an ongoing basis as resources permit.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Mr. N. Dempsey)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 251 and 252 together.</P>
      <P>There is a provision within the national development plan for a third level access fund totalling almost &euro;121 million over the period 2000 to 2006, to tackle disadvantage at third level. The millennium partnership fund for disadvantage, which was introduced with effect from 2001, is one of the initiatives in place to promote equity in access.</P>
      <P>The fund provides assistance to partnership companies and community groups to develop their support schemes for students from disadvantaged families. Area Development Management Limit, ADM, under whose aegis the partnerships operate, administered the fund for both the 2001-02 and 2002-03 academic year. The total allocation for the 2001-02 academic year was &euro;1.2 million. I increased the provision for the 2002-03 academic year to &euro;2 million.</P>
      <P>The report of the action group on access to third level education sets out a co-ordinated framework of actions required to improve equity of access to third level. The group considered that a single co-ordinating body was essential in order to realise the framework. Accordingly, a key recommendation of the group was that a national office for equity of access to higher education be established to ensure the effective implementation of many of the recommendations in the report.</P>
      <P>I have given approval for the establishment of the national office, within the Higher Education Authority. My Department is engaged in discussions with the Higher Education Authority with a view to bringing the national office into operation in time for the academic year 2003-04. I anticipate that the national office will facilitate the aim of increasing third level access by the target groups, in partnership with my Department, the third level institutions and other stakeholders and agencies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The action group report recommended that the national office should have responsibility for allocating funding for initiatives to promote equity in access. These initiatives include schemes such as the millennium partnership fund for disadvantage, the fund for students with disabilities and the student assistance fund. The 2003 provision for third level access measures funded by my Department is &euro;26 million, an increase of &euro;2 million on the outturn for 2002, almost &euro;24 million. Decisions, in respect of the 2003-04 academic <Col N="214" /> year, regarding the 2003 allocation for each access measure will be taken in due course.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Mr. N. Dempsey)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Education (Welfare) Act 2000, which is now fully commenced, established the National Educational Welfare Board as the single national agency with responsibility for school attendance. The Act provides a comprehensive framework for promoting school attendance and tackling the problems of absenteeism and early school leaving.</P>
      <P>To discharge its responsibilities, the board will develop a nation-wide service that is accessible to schools, parents-guardians and others who are concerned with welfare of young people. For this purpose, educational welfare officers, EWOs, will be appointed and deployed throughout the country to provide a welfare-focused service to support regular school attendance and discharge the board's functions locally.</P>
      <P>The board appointed an interim chief executive officer in August 2002 and directors of corporate services and educational services have recently taken up their posts.</P>
      <P>Some 37 former school attendance officers who were employed by local authorities under the previous legislation were transferred to the board on 5 July 2002 in accordance with section 40 of the Act. These staff are currently providing a service in the cities of Dublin, Cork and Waterford. Some 25 of these have recently accepted the terms and conditions of employment of EWO and will henceforth be carrying out the full range of EWO duties and providing a year round service rather than the school-term based service they were providing as former school attendance officers.</P>
      <P>Proposals for the recruitment of an additional cohort of education welfare officers have been received from the board and officials of my Department had discussions with the executive of the board recently in relation to these proposals. Arising from these discussions, the executive wrote to my Department clarifying certain costs associated with their proposals. It is not possible to specify the number of new EWOs who will be put in place this year until my Department has had an opportunity to consider these proposals and costs in a multi-annual framework.</P>
      <P>I have allocated a budget of &euro;5.4 million to the board for the current year and it is my intention that the board's proposals will be taken forward in the context of these resources and budgetary allocations in future years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My Department is not aware that there has been a decline in attendance at school by Travel<Col N="216" /> lers. The position is that 40 teachers have been assigned to the Traveller visiting teacher service. These teachers are overseen by a national education officer for Travellers who is responsible for promoting and overseeing the education service to travellers on a national basis. The service provides a very comprehensive range of supports to assist Traveller families which include liaising with local agencies on behalf of Travellers, providing backup to the resource teachers for Traveller education in schools, co-operating with school authorities in relation to issues that may arise and ensuring that Traveller children are enrolled in schools.</P>
    <P>A key function which the service provides is to ensure optimal use for travellers of existing educational facilities through the close monitoring of attendance, school visits, provision of advice on the placement of children, providing education information to Traveller families, and ensuring that, in the event of a Traveller family moving from one area to another, the education of the children involved is disrupted as little as possible.</P>

      <P>My Department's student support schemes were extended to provide maintenance grants to eligible students pursuing approved full-time undergraduate courses of at least two years duration in another EU member state as and from the 1996-97 academic year. The extension of the schemes at that time did not include courses at postgraduate level and, accordingly, there is no grant aid available under the schemes for students pursuing postgraduate studies outside Ireland.</P>
      <P>Any extension of the current arrangements to provide for students pursuing postgraduate courses outside Ireland could only be considered in the light of available resources and other competing demands within the education section.</P>
      <P>However, the Deputy may be aware that section 21 of the Finance Act 2000, as amended by section 29 of the Finance Act 2001, provides for the introduction of tax relief for postgraduate tuition fees paid in third level colleges outside of Ireland. This relief, which is available from the tax year 2000-01 onwards, applies at the standard rate of tax. It is available to full-time and part-time postgraduate students and includes distance education courses offered here by publicly funded colleges in other EU member states. Further details and conditions in relation to this tax relief are available from local tax offices.</P>

These schools provide residential accommodation for children under 16 years of age who have been convicted of an offence or remanded in custody by the courts.

      <P>Following the transfer of the ownership of the school from the Rosminian Order to my Department, a new board of management was established in June 2002 for the purpose of managing the school on my Department's behalf.

This section provides for the board of management to comprise a chairperson and 12 other members, including two members of the staff of the school. The Children Act 2001 does not guarantee any particular staff group representation on the board of management of the children detention schools.</P>

      <P>The Higher Education Authority has for a number of years provided dedicated funding to the universities and other Higher Education Authority designated institutions to support new developments in areas of strategic importance in higher education. One particular priority area is that of broadening access to the universities and Higher Education Authority institutions for students from traditionally under-represented groups. These include students from disadvantaged backgrounds, mature students and Travellers. In 2002, the Higher Education Authority provided over &euro;6 million to support institutions in initiatives aimed at providing for such broadened access.</P>
      <P>The Foundation Course for Higher Education &ndash; Young Adults, in Trinity College is one development which has been funded by the Higher Education Authority under its targeted initiatives. In this regard, &euro;127,000 was provided by the Higher Education Authority in 2002. Decisions regarding allocations for 2003 for all access programmes in the university sector will be taken by the Higher Education Authority in due course.</P>
      <P>Overall, in 2002, a total of &euro;706,000 was provided for access measures in Trinity College, under the targeted initiatives. My Department also grant aids a number of special projects which are designed to improve access to third level for second level pupils in particular schools in disadvantaged areas. In this regard, my Department provided funding of &euro;36,830 in 2002 for these activities within the Trinity access programmes.</P>

      <P>In 2002, my Department introduced the school completion programme &ndash; SCP, which is a new and significantly expanded programme to deal with early school leaving incorporating the learning, experience and best practice derived from previous early school leaving initiatives and assimilates the eight to 15 early school leaver initiative &ndash; ESLI &ndash; and stay in school retention initiative &ndash; SSRI.</P>
      <P>Some 17 ESLI projects were funded by the Department and these were located in 14 areas both urban and rural and covered both primary and second-level schools. The level of funding for each project site ranged from &euro;80,000 to &euro;279,000 per annum. Schools were selected to participate in the stay in school retention initiative based on the Department's records of school retention rates. Some 118 schools participated during the academic year 2001-02. The level of funding for each school was &euro;50,790 in respect of a full year's involvement in the initiative. The total expenditure on the SSRI and the ESLI schemes in 2002 was &euro;14.246 million.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Additional funding was made available under the National Development Plan 2000-2006 with assistance from the ESF fund for an expansion of these initiatives. Some &euro;23.019 million has been allocated to the school completion programme in 2003. Some 82 project sites involving 109 post-primary schools and 295 primary schools were selected to participate in the project strand of the <Col N="221" /> school completion programme. Annual allocation of funding for these sites range from &euro;72,000 to &euro;362,000.</P>
    <P>In addition to the 82 projects, my Department continues to support 53 second level schools under the stay in school retention strand of this programme, as they were not selected for the project strand. It was decided to fund these schools on a phasing out basis to 2005, as my Department's policy to expand the programme is based on the project model rather than funding individual schools. These schools received &euro;50,790 in the school year 2002-03 and will receive 50% of this allocation in 2003-04, reducing to 25% of this allocation in 2004-05.</P>

      <P>My Department is currently in the process of re-tendering in respect of catering services for staff in its Tullamore and Athlone premises. Also, tenders will shortly be sought for similar provision in a new restaurant facility in the Dublin complex in Marlborough Street. These contracts will be for the provision of a range of catering services on an agreed price list and on a direct payment basis by staff. In addition, refreshments such as teas, sandwiches and biscuits are provided for meetings and workgroups on the Department's premises. Expenditure on this provision was approximately &euro;75,000 in 2002. It is not known to what extent this food originated outside the State.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. N. Dempsey Mr. N. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Mr. N. Dempsey)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 271 and 272 together.</P>
      <P>The funding arrangements made by my Department for second level schools reflect the different management and ownership arrangements for vocational schools and community colleges, comprehensive and community schools and voluntary secondary schools.</P>
      <P>At the core of funding arrangements at second level is reliance upon capitation as the principal determinant of funding. Voluntary secondary schools are funded on a <i>per capita</i> grant basis. Financial allocations for vocational schools and community colleges are made to the vocational education committees as part of a block grant, which also covers the VEC head office overheads and other activities apart from the second-level programme. Community and comprehensive schools are funded on a budget basis. Schools have considerable discretion as to how this funding is best utilised in the interests of their pupils and schools.</P>
      <P>Significant improvements have also been made in the level of funding to secondary schools. The standard <i>per capita</i> grant from &euro;224.74 that applied in 1997, was increased to &euro;256.49 in September 2001, and was further increased to &euro;266.49 in September 2002. An additional <i>per capita</i> grant of &euro;38.09 is paid to disadvantaged schools bringing the total <i>per capita</i> grant in the case of such schools to over &euro;300.</P>
      <P>In addition, under the school services support initiative, secondary schools have benefited from further significant increases in the support grant from &euro;25.40 per pupil in 2000 to &euro;88.88 from September 2002 and to &euro;99 per pupil from 1 January 2003.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Funding for voluntary secondary schools has been further enhanced by the introduction of a <Col N="223" /> range of equalisation measures that are designed to reduce the historic anomalies in the funding arrangements for the different school types at second level. Under the terms of recent equalisation measures, the support services grant was increased by &euro;28 per pupil with effect from September 2002. This brings the support services grant in the case of voluntary secondary schools to &euro;116.88 per pupil from September 2002 and to &euro;127 per pupil from 1 January 2003. This increase is in addition to the range of equalisation grants of up to &euro;15,554 per school, &euro;44.44 per pupil, per annum that was approved for secondary schools in December 2001.</P>
    <P>For a voluntary secondary school with 500 pupils, this amounts to extra funding of up to &euro;100,000 per annum, and annual grants of up to &euro;236,761 &ndash;&euro;255,811 in the case of disadvantaged schools &ndash; towards general expenses and support services.</P>
    <P>Schools have welcomed these improvements. It is my intention to further improve the financial position of secondary schools to the extent that the availability of resources permits.</P>

      <P>Under the wild salmon and sea trout tagging scheme for 2002, the total allowable catch (TAC) for the Bangor district was 8,211 fish. The TAC for the same district under the scheme for 2003 is 6,202 which is a reduction of 25%.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am advised that the chief executive officer of the North-Western Regional Fisheries Board, fol<Col N="224" /> lowing recent consultation with the district committee of the Bangor district has allocated a sectoral allocation this year of 4,652 fish to the drift net sector and 1,550 to the draft net sector.</P>
    <P>I understand that individual allocations of tags within the sectors have been based on catch returns made by fishermen over the past five years, i.e. 1998-2002.</P>
    <P>I advise the Deputy that the standing scientific committee of the National Salmon Commission advised that there should be no fishing in the Bangor district in 2003 in order to allow the conservation limit for the area to be achieved. The National Salmon Commission, however, accepting the advice of the fisheries managers, recommended that the quota for the Bangor district in 2003 should be reduced by only 25% on last year in order to mitigate the socio-economic impact of cessation of the fishery.</P>

      <Quest> the reason he will not compensate the drift net fishermen in view of the fact that many of them have taken out loans to finance their fishing, yet are being restricted to just fishing one week of the two month season in 2003 due to the reduction in quota; and his plans to compensate the fishermen affected.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="DermotAhern" hpid="Mr. D. Ahern Mr. D. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources (Mr. D. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>On 28 April 2003, the Minister of State, Deputy Browne, signed regulations revising the wild salmon and sea trout tagging scheme for 2003. These regulations provide, <i>inter alia,</i> for a total allowable catch for commercial salmon fishing this year of 182,000 fish, which represents a reduction of 12% on the 2002 catch. The quota for 2003 was decided by the Minister of State on the strong advice of the National Salmon Commission, which is representative of all stakeholders in the sector, including drift net fishermen. The drift net salmon fisheries season is open for a two-month period in June and July in accordance with the conservation of salmon by-law No. 789 of 2003. The fishermen will not be restricted to only one week's fishing in the two-month season.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I assure the Deputy that I am aware of the concerns of commercial fishermen in coastal communities who depend on the annual salmon run as a source of income. as well as for the continuation of traditional fishing methods passed down through the generations. I will ensure, in so far as is possible, that these concerns are fairly addressed. The clear and robust scientific evidence available to me points to a decline in the salmon stock over recent years, however. The Government has, over the past number of years, introduced a range of measures for the management of salmon fisheries to address this decline. The aim of the measures, which are implemented through the central and regional fisheries boards, is first and foremost to allow adequate spawning stock into our rivers through the establishment of <Col N="225" /> and adherence to conservation limits. This ensures that rivers and lakes can produce juvenile salmon to the maximum of their productive potential, which in turn provides for the maximum return in the future of adult fish to our coastal waters in subsequent years.</P>
    <P>The conservation limits are set on the advice of the National Salmon Commission's standing scientific committee. The scientific advice further warns that unless action is taken now, salmon stocks will slip to the point where there may be no longer capable of supporting a commercial fishery in the years to come. In the face of the advice available, I am sure the Deputy will accept that doing nothing is not an option. I am hopeful that if we act collectively in a responsible manner to protect the salmon resource over the short-term, we will enhance its sustainability over the longer term to the benefit of all who depend on it. I would therefore strongly urge everyone to support the quota reductions based on the scientific information and the socio-economic needs of the commercial sector. I have no proposals to compensate commercial fishermen, given that the reductions imposed this year are for the benefit of fishermen in the long-term.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 285 and 295 together.</P>
      <P>It has been estimated that approximately 80% of patients on waiting lists for admission to hospital are in the nine surgical specialties of orthopaedics, ENT, ophthalmology, plastic surgery, urology, gynaecology, cardiac surgery, vascular surgery and general surgery. Surgical procedures for these specialties require the patient to be admitted to hospital as a day case or as an in-patient, which involves at least one overnight stay in hospital. Arising from the health strategy, Quality and Fairness &ndash; A Health System for You, the national treatment purchase fund was established for the sole purpose of purchasing treatment for the public patients who have been waiting longest for treatment in hospital. The treatment purchase fund is initially concentrating on those adults waiting longer than 12 months for admission to hospital and children waiting longer than six months for admission to hospital, rather than on those patients requiring out-patient services.</P>
      <P>The health boards have been asked to identify public hospital patients waiting longest on in-patient lists so that they can be offered treatment under the purchase fund. Public patients who satisfy the criteria can apply to their general practitioners, medical consultants or local health boards to seek to have their treatment carried out under the fund. Some 4,200 patients have received treatment so far and this figure continues to rise. The treatment purchase fund has identified sufficient capacity to treat approximately 8,000 patients in 2003. My Department has asked the chief executive officer of the Western Health Board to reply directly to the Deputy in relation to the position of patients awaiting treatment for arthritis conditions.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children (Mr. B. Lenihan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I assume the Deputy is referring to the provision of appropri<Col N="230" /> ate services for non-offending children in need of special care or protection, on which the DG case centred. Since 1997, additional revenue funding of approximately &euro;178 million has been invested through the health boards in the development of child welfare and protection services. This includes an additional &euro;8 million in 2003. This has provided for a wide range of developments including family support projects, preventive services and intensive community based services.</P>
      <P>Approximately &euro;40 million in capital funding has been made available by the Government, through the health boards, to put in place additional high support and special care places to provide for a small group of non-offending children who need more intensive intervention than mainstream residential or foster care services. The number of high support and special care places has increased from 17 in 1996 to a current total of over 120. This includes an additional five-place special care unit for boys which has been completed and is due to come on stream on a phased basis in the Mid-Western Health Board later this year. While health boards have experienced some difficulty in recruiting and retaining suitably trained staff for these services, progress has been made in this area through recruitment abroad and the expansion of training courses. As I am sure the Deputy is aware, a new career and pay structure for child care workers was introduced in 2001. This aims to attract more people to child care and to ensure that child care workers are trained to an appropriate level.</P>
      <P>From time to time, health boards have put in place individual high support packages to meet children's specific needs. In addition, a number of intensive community based services has been put in place to provide for the needs of children. An example is the youth advocacy pilot projects in the Northern Area Health Board and the Western Health Board which commenced last year. Work is at an advanced stage with a view to introducing Parts 2, 3 and 11 of the Children Act 2001 later this year. These parts provide a statutory scheme for non-offending children in need of special care or protection to be placed in special care units on foot of a special care order made by the District Court in appropriate circumstances as a last resort and for as short a period of time as possible.</P>

Under the dental treatment services scheme, which is administered <Col N="231" /> by my Department and the health boards, adult medical card holders receive a range of dental treatments free of charge from mainly private dental practitioners. The costs for these treatments are agreed in negotiations involving the Department of Social and Family Affairs, the Department of Health and Children and the Irish Dental Association and reflect, in the main, a discount on the fees charged privately.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>While I met with a number of public health doctors at the Irish Medical Organisation's annual conference in Killarney in April, I have not had a formal meeting in relation to the current dispute and I do not intend to interfere with the industrial relations process. I am being fully briefed on an ongoing basis, however, by my officials and by the Health Services Employers Agency.</P>
      <P>The issues central to the public health doctors' dispute have been the subject of negotiations over the last 12 months between the Irish Medical Organisation and management, comprising officials from the Health Service Employers Agency, my Department and the health boards. Such negotiations took place initially through joint discussions and in more recent times under the aegis of the Labour Relations Commission. Since the commencement of strike action by the IMO, efforts have been made at the highest level to reach a satisfactory conclusion. Management acting on my behalf made an offer of 10.5%, excluding benchmarking, through the independent chair during informal talks at the Labour Relations Commission on 14 March. This offer was confirmed in writing by the HSEA on 18 March. The application of this increase, along with the benchmarking and sustaining progress increases, would result in increases for public health doctors ranging from &euro;11,000 to &euro;29,000 per year between now and 2005.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The HSEA asked the IMO to agree to have all outstanding issues referred to the Labour Court. The IMO did not agree to this request, unfortunately, and commenced strike action on 14 April. I wrote to the IMO on 17 April requesting that it return to the negotiating table. On 22 April, I again wrote to the IMO confirming the availability of the HSEA and my Department to re-enter discussions with it on the four specific issues identified as being in dispute. On 23 April I invited a delegation from the IMO to meet me <Col N="232" /> and, although this invitation was declined, a telephone discussion between the IMO and I ensued.</P>
    <P>During exploratory talks between management and the IMO at the LRC on 1 May, management indicated its willingness to discuss the implementation of the recommendations of the report of the public health review group, including the development of a structured out of hours system. The above-mentioned increase of 10.5% was again offered at the meeting. Management stressed that the issue of the granting of consultant status to directors and specialists was not the subject of a recommendation by the group, but merely the expression of the chairman's viewpoint.</P>
    <P>Across the health system, different levels of staff enter claims about a variety of issues related to their terms and conditions of employment. If each of these claims was to be conceded without challenge, the resources available would not be used effectively. There are general frameworks &ndash; for example, the various pay agreements &ndash; within which any such claims have to be examined and considered. There is also the formal industrial relations machinery through which valid claims must be processed. It is simply not within my power, nor that of my Department, the HSEA or any other agent of management, to concede simply major pay claims just because they have been demanded. Such a concession is not given to any group in the health system or the wider public services. The national implementation body has urged the IMO to suspend its strike and to avail of the industrial relations mechanisms, in accordance with the conditions of the Sustaining Progress national programme. Efforts are currently being made under the aegis of this body to identify a basis on which negotiations can be resumed, leading to a resolution of the issues in dispute.</P>

      <P>A number of reports are being formulated in respect of reform of the health system. The first of these relates to action 114 of the health strategy, which dealt with the need to support organisation development, clarify roles and co-ordinate the work of different organisations. Prospectus Strategy Consultants were contracted in June 2002 to complete an audit of structures and functions of the health system. The terms of reference included consideration of the structures and functions of health boards and authorities and other specialist, advisory, regulatory and executive agencies under my aegis. The terms of reference also required Prospectus to make recommendations to improve corporate governance arrangements in the health system generally. This was to include consideration of interactions between all agencies who play a pivotal role in the system, including the Department of Health and Children.</P>
      <P>A second report relevant to the question is that prepared by the Commission on Financial Management and Control Systems in the Health System, which was undertaken on behalf of my colleague, the Minister for Finance. The commission carried out a detailed examination and review of the financial management and control systems in the Irish health service. While the principle remit related to matters of financial management, the analysis and conclusions of the commission necessarily drew it into the area of the organisation and configuration of the health service more generally.</P>
      <P>The recommendations in these reports are likely to have implications for the future structure of my Department. My colleague, the Minister for Finance, has recently received the report of the Commission on Financial Management and Controls in the Health Service and is now considering its contents. A final draft of the Prospectus report has been received by the steering group overseeing the project. I anticipate that this report will be submitted to me shortly and I hope, together with the Minister, Deputy McCreevy, to bring this and the report of the Commission on Financial Management and Controls in the Health Service to Government in due course. When decisions have been made by the Government, I anticipate that the reports will be published in full and made available generally.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children (Mr. T. O'Malley)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware of <Col N="234" /> the concerns regarding the provision of services to persons with an intellectual disability and those with autism. Additional funding of &euro;13.3 million has been allocated to services for persons with an intellectual disability or autism in 2003 to meet the full year cost of the 2002 developments and to enhance further the health related support services to children with an intellectual disability or autism. This funding is in addition to the very significant revenue investment, amounting to &euro;188 million, which has been made in these services since 1997 and which is built into the ongoing budget base.</P>
      <P>The additional funding provided by this and the previous Government between 2000 and 2002 was used to put in place, in addition to a range of other services, more than 900 new residential, 380 new respite and around 2,000 new day places for people with an intellectual disability and those with autism. In particular, &euro;14.6 million has been invested in health related support services for children with autism or an intellectual disability nationally between 1998 and 2002. A further &euro;4 million has been allocated to these services in 2003. This includes diagnostic and assessment services, early intervention, home support and out reach support to children of school going age. The overall investment by this and the previous Government in services to persons with disabilities, which amounts to &euro;555 million, is evidence of the priority which has been given to these services. When taken in conjunction with other measures in the area of education, training and general mainstreaming, it is concrete evidence of our commitment to equity issues.</P>
      <P>Despite this very significant investment, demographic factors are contributing to growing waiting lists for residential services in particular even though the numbers of people in receipt of services, including full-time residential services, continues to increase. The increased birth rate in the 1960s and 1970s has resulted in large numbers of adults in their late 20s and early 30s requiring full-time residential services. In addition people with an intellectual disability are living longer than previously adding to the need for services compared to previous generations. This has also been the international experience in service provision to this population.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The overall economic position in 2003 has had implications for all aspects of public investment, and this is reflected in the Estimates and budget adopted by the Government for 2003. Within this overall framework, however, some two thirds of the additional funding available for non-capital investment in services has been allocated to the health services. This funding is being applied largely to maintaining existing levels of service across all service programmes, including services for people with an intellectual disability. While it is regrettable that the level of investment in these services achieved in recent years could not be maintained in 2003, my Department will work closely with the health boards and other service <Col N="235" /> providers in relation to service provision this year.</P>

      <P>The overall target set out in the national health strategy states that, by the end of 2004, all public patients requiring admission to hospital will be scheduled to commence treatment within a maximum of three months of referral from an out-patient department. Intermediate targets have been set to achieve this aim to ensure the focus is being turned towards those waiting longest for treatment. The 2002 target was that no adult would wait longer than 12 months and no child would wait longer than six months to commence treatment. Despite pressures on the acute hospital system and the influence of factors such as the winter vomiting bug, considerable progress has been made by health agencies in reducing waiting times for public patients in 2002.</P>
      <P>The total number of children waiting for more than six months for in-patient treatment fell by 24% between June and September 2002. The total number of adults waiting for more than 12 months for in-patient treatment in the nine target surgical specialties covered by the waiting list initiative fell by 15% between June and September 2002. Waiting list data in respect of the quarter ending December 2002 will be published shortly. While the waiting list initiative will continue to fund additional elective activity, the dedicated national treatment purchase fund is being used to target those waiting longest for treatment. Funding of &euro;43.8 million has been provided in 2003 for the waiting list initiative and &euro;31 million has been provided for the treatment purchase fund. The fund has capacity available to arrange treatment for adults who have been waiting more than 12 months and children who have been waiting more than six months. To date approximately 4,000 people who had waited a long time have received treatment under the NTPF.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>BreastCheck, the national breast screening programme, commenced in March 2000. Phase one of the programme covers the Eastern Regional Health Authority, Midland Health Board and North-Eastern Health Board areas. Screening is being offered free of charge to all women in the areas in the target age group of between 50 and 64 years of age. The target population consists of approximately 140,000 women and represents about 50% of the national target population. By the end of December 2002, 110,636 women had been called for screening and 83,035 women had been screened. This represents an uptake of 75%. In February, I announced the full extension of BreastCheck in the east. Approximately 19,000 women between the ages of 50 and 64 in counties <Col N="239" /> Wexford, Kilkenny and Carlow will be invited for screening, which is expected to begin following the completion of a new permanent screening facility at the Merrion unit, adjacent to St Vincent's University Hospital, which is under construction at a cost of approximately &euro;6 million.</P>
      <P>In March 2003, I announced the full national expansion of BreastCheck to the south and west of the country. Under the extension, two static units are proposed in host hospitals &ndash; one in Cork and the other in Galway. The southern area unit will be located at South Infirmary Victoria Hospital in Cork, with three associated mobile units. The area of coverage is counties Cork, Kerry, Limerick, Waterford and south Tipperary. Under the extension, approximately 130,000 women in the target population &ndash; those between 50 and 64 years of age &ndash; will be eligible for screening. the southern area will be located at South Infirmary Victoria Hospital in Cork, with three associated mobile units. The area of coverage is counties Cork, Kerry, Limerick, Waterford and south Tipperary. Under the extension, approximately 130,000 women in the target population &ndash; those between 50 and 64 years of age &ndash; will be eligible for screening. The programme expects to diagnose approximately 450 cancers per annum among this population.</P>
      <P>Approval has issued for the establishment of two capital project teams to develop a brief for the capital infrastructure needed for the static units in the south and west. This approval will allow for the immediate commencement of the detailed planning for the national roll-out. Discussions have also commenced between the Department of Health and Children and BreastCheck with representatives of the static units concerning operational plans for the national roll-out, including linkages with the symptomatic services and detailed costings. In particular, it will be important that integrated care pathways are developed for women diagnosed with cancer to ensure that they have access to the full range of diagnosis, treatment and follow-up care in all regions.</P>

      <P>My Department has, over the past few years given special attention to the resourcing of suicide prevention initiatives. Additional revenue funding of &euro;0.655 million has been provided this year for suicide prevention programmes. Therefore, since the publication of the report of the national task force on suicide in 1998, a cumulative total of more than &euro;13 million has been provided towards suicide prevention programmes and for research. This includes funding to support the work of the National Suicide Review Group, The Irish Association of Suicidology and the National Suicide Research Foundation for its work in the development of a national parasuicide register.</P>
      <P>Additional funding has also been made available to further develop child and adolescent psychiatry, adult psychiatry and old age psychiatry services to assist in the early identification of suicidal behaviour and to provide the necessary support and treatment to individuals at risk.</P>
      <P>I have been advised that campaigning nationally to highlight the problem of suicide is a sensitive issue due to the fear of normalising suicidal behaviour. Such a campaign is best conducted in the context of wider mental health promotion campaigns. In this regard my Department supports the ongoing work of many organisations such as Mental Health Ireland, Grow, AWARE and Schizophrenia Ireland in raising public awareness of mental health issues.</P>
      <P>I assure the Deputy that this Government shares the public concern about the level of suicide in this country. I am fully committed to the intensification of suicide prevention initiatives and the further development of our mental health services, as resources become available.</P>

      <P>The information requested by the Deputy in relation to the cost to the health service of the treatment in hospitals of the victims of road accidents is not available in my Department. However, the Deputy may be interested to know that a cross-departmental review of road safety expenditure has been established under the auspices of the Department of Transport. One of its objectives will be to estimate the cost of dealing with road accidents generally. I understand that the first meeting of the cross-departmental review steering group is due to take place shortly.</P>

      <P>While I have not received any formal communication from the Irish Medical Organisation in the matter, I was disappointed to learn recently that the organisation had signalled its intention to withdraw from the national primary care steering group. This group was established to facilitate all of the partner interests contributing to the development of national primary care policy, as the strategy is rolled out. I regret this decision and, when I addressed the organisation's annual general meeting recently, I asked the IMO to reconsider its position on this issue.</P>
      <P>The approach adopted in the strategy, Primary Care: A New Direction, is that it should not be imposed from above. Leadership in its adoption and operation must come, not just from central government or the statutory health agencies, but also from the national organisations representing the key professional interests involved. Clearly, the medical profession, and in particular general practitioners, are key stakeholders in this regard.</P>
      <P>It is my hope that the IMO will reconsider its intention to withdraw from the primary care steering group so that it can continue to contribute to the work of this group in guiding the implementation of the primary care strategy.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 334 and 335 together.</P>
      <P>Following the report of the joint review group on psychological services in the health services, a major priority for my Department was to promote an integrated and co-ordinated approach by the health boards to its implementation over time. This applied in particular to the major recommendations of the report relating to the organisation and management of psychology services, entailing very substantial increases in the number of principal and director level psychologist posts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Given the key role of the Health Boards Executive in fostering collective working and progressing organisational change and development in the health service, my Department secured the agreement of the executive to work with the directors of human resources in the health boards towards the implementation of the recommendations of the report. The present position is that the directors of human resources are in the process of individually considering the recommendations contained in the report and how their boards might propose to proceed with the implementation process in due course. This work is being undertaken in light of: service imperatives; funding priorities; and the budget 2003 announcement on public service numbers. In this context, it is important to bear in mind that the overall budgetary and economic position in 2003 has had important implications for all aspects of public <Col N="252" /> spending, and this is reflected in the Estimates and budget adopted by Government for 2003.</P>
    <P>Given these constraints my Department, together with the directors of human resources in the health boards, is prioritising support for the implementation of a key recommendation of the joint review report relating to human resource planning through the provision of a substantial number of additional postgraduate training places in clinical psychology. This has resulted in a threefold increase from end-1999 to end-2002, from 26 to 83, in the number of trainee clinical psychologists employed in the health services. This development, in enhancing graduate output, will help maintain an improved balance between demand and supply in human resource and service provision.</P>
    <P>My Department remains committed to working on an ongoing basis with health agencies, educational providers and the education authorities to ensure adequate provision of training places in clinical psychology, consistent with the medium-term human resource requirements of the health services and the important recommendations on investment in training and education detailed in the action plan for people management published in November 2002.</P>
    <P>A particular priority is to secure the best return, in terms of graduate output, on the very significant financial resources currently being invested in the health services to support postgraduate clinical psychology training. Consequently, my Department, together with the health boards' directors of human resources, is currently examining the current model for postgraduate psychology training, with the objective of supporting training provision on a planned and sustainable medium-term basis.</P>
    <P>With regard to the issue of vacancies, the Deputy may wish to note the significant increase, in excess of 40%, an addition of 121 to 412, over the three years to end-2002 in the numbers of fully qualified psychologists working in the health service which has contributed to a significant increase in the volume of psychological services provided.</P>
    <P>In addition to measures to increase the supply of psychologists through the implementation of the recommendations of the joint review report, it should be recognised that other efforts have been undertaken to improve staffing levels in the psychological services, both at local and national level. Relevant developments include the recruitment of psychologists from overseas by the health boards, the introduction of a fast track working visa scheme for health and social care professionals, the streamlining of procedures for the validation of overseas qualifications and the devolution of responsibility for recruitment of basic grade psychologist posts to health boards from the Local Appointments Commission. Ongoing pay enhancements through the implementation of the recommendations of the public service benchmarking body will make a further contribution to reducing current vacancy levels by <Col N="253" /> increasing the attractiveness of employment as a clinical psychologist in the health services.</P>
    <P>Responsibility for human resource planning, including the filling of vacant psychologist posts in each health board region, rests with the chief executive officer of each board. Each chief executive officer in managing the workforce in his/her region is responsible for determining the appropriate staffing mix and the precise grades of staff to be employed in line with service plan priorities, subject to overall employment levels remaining within the approved regional employment ceiling. My Department has requested information from the chief executive officers of the health boards and the regional chief executive officer on the number of vacancies that exist for clinical psychologists and this information will be sent to the Deputy as soon as it is available.</P>

      <P>Smear-taking services are provided, in the main, in GP clinics and family planning clinics. In a limited number of instances, smear test clinics are run by health boards. The Western Health Board provides such clinics and has advised that a person employed as a smeartaker in the clinics in question must have a minimum qualification as a registered general nurse, with specific training and experience in cervical screening. The nurse must also be on the current register with An Bord Altranais.</P>
      <P>In the case of phase one of the Irish cervical screening programme in operation in the Mid-Western Health Board, the board has advised that prior to registration with the programme as a smeartaker, a doctor must be a registered medical practitioner. Also, a nurse or midwife registered with An Bord Altranais who is employed within a primary health care setting and has received adequate smeartaker training, may be registered with the programme as a registered general practice associated smeartaker. Item 3.1 (i) of the general practitioner Mid-Western Health Board Irish cervical screening programme agreement provides that, &ldquo;The general practitioner should endeavour to attend for training programmes approved by the programme and ensure that his practice nurse(s) and locums and trainees are adequately trained to the quality assurance guidelines of the programme.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 340 and 341 together.</P>
      <P>The Western Health Board has advised that the public health nurse, employed to carry out the smear testing clinics in Galway, Mayo and Roscommon, ceased to provide the service to the Mayo and Roscommon areas, in line with the recommendations from the board's occupational health physician in 2002. However, cervical smear testing continues to be available in a number of settings in Mayo and Roscommon, for example, GP practices, family planning clinics and obstetric-gynaecology clinics. In the event of clients contacting the board's community services about this service, they are advised to contact their GPs in the absence of scheduled clinics in Mayo and Roscommon.</P>
      <P>The board has advised that it is currently examining proposals, in consultation with its directors of public health nursing, to reinstate the service in Mayo and Roscommon. Ultimately, recommencement of the clinics will require training of staff to provide the service in the two counties.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 351, 358 and 362 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In February 2002 the Government approved the appointment of a panel of three independent persons to report in general terms on the nature and extent of extreme personal financial hardship, which may have been experienced by individual taxi licence holders as a direct result of the liberalisation of entry to the taxi industry on 21 November 2000. No prior parameters were imposed in relation to the recommendations the panel might make concerning the level of payments, if any, it might propose. The panel invited submissions from taxi licence holders and also met taxi representative groups and individuals who made submissions before finalising and submitting its report to me. The report of the panel recommends the establishment of a scheme to provide payments to individual taxi licence holders who fall into one of six categories that the panel assessed as having suffered extreme per<Col N="259" /> sonal financial hardship. In this regard the panel has recommended that a range of payments might be made to eligible and qualifying taxi licence holders for sums ranging from &euro;3,000 to &euro;15,000 depending on the category of hardship involved.</P>
    <P>I have accepted the report of the Taxi Hardship Panel and on 17 December 2002 the Government also approved the implementation on a phased basis of the recommendations of the Taxi Hardship Panel in accordance with An Agreed Programme for Government. Any payments to be made as a result of this implementation will not represent compensation but rather compassionate payments in respect of extreme personal financial hardship. It has been clearly stated from the outset that based on legal precedent there can be no legal duty on the State to compensate taxi licence holders in relation to open market licence values that may have existed prior to liberalisation.</P>
    <P>I explained the above position to the EU committee on petitions on 4 April 2003 and no promise of a review of the Taxi Hardship Panel recommendations was made by me at that meeting. While every effort is being made to put in place a structure to facilitate the commencement of payments on the basis of the panel recommendations as soon as possible, I have no current proposals for any payments beyond those recommendations.</P>
    <P>As indicated at the meeting with the EU Committee on Petitions, I am available to meet the Families Advocate Immediate Redress group and hope to do so at a mutually convenient date in the future.</P>

      <P>Irish driving licence regulations are required to operate within the framework of a harmonised EU system. The criteria essential for recognition of licences from other countries are testing and licensing regimes which meet the requirements of the EU directive and reciprocal recognition of Irish licences.</P>
      <P>A person who holds a driving licence issued by a member state of the European Union or of the European Economic Area, which includes Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway, is permitted to drive in Ireland for so long as that licence remains valid.

    </Speaker>
    <P>In addition, Australia, the Isle of Man, Japan, Jersey, South Africa and South Korea are recognised states for the purpose of driving licence <Col N="260" /> exchange under the terms of Article 30(7) of the Road Traffic (Licensing of Drivers) Regulations, 1999. Under these regulations, persons holding a valid driving licence from a recognised state may exchange their licence for an Irish driving licence when they take up residence here, without the need for a driving test.</P>

      <P>My Department received a complaint in January 2002 from a private bus operator, that Bus Éireann was competing contrary to Section 25 of the Road Transport Act 1958 with the licensed services of the private operator on the Carrickmacross to Dublin route. My Department had issued two licences to the private operator in 1998 on the Carrickmacross to Dublin route: licence No. 98028 departing Carrickmacross at 6.45 a.m.; and licence No. 98113 departing Carrickmacross at 9 a.m.</P>
      <P>Bus Éireann commenced operating new services on the Monaghan to Dublin route and on the Letterkenny to Dublin route in July 2000, which had departure times from Carrickmacross at 6.35 a.m. and 9 a.m., which were allegedly in direct competition with the licensed services of the private operator. Bus Éireann is exempt from licensing under the Road Transport Act 1932. However the company is bound under section 25(1) of the Transport Act 1958 to seek the consent of the Minister if it wishes to initiate or alter services so as to compete with a licensed service.</P>
      <P>Having fully considered the matter, including correspondence from both Bus Éireann and the licensed operator, I concluded that Bus Éireann had initiated passenger road services from Monaghan to Dublin on Monday to Friday at 6 a.m. and from Letterkenny to Dublin on Monday to Saturday at 6.35 a.m. which competed respectively with: the licensed passenger road service under licence No. 98028 for services on the Carrickmacross to Dublin route departing Carrickmacross at 6.45 a.m. Monday to Friday in respect of the stops at Carrickmacross, Ardee, Collon and Slane; and the licensed passenger road service under licence No. 98113 for services on the Clones to Dublin route departing Carrickmacross at 9 a.m. Monday to Saturday in respect of the stops at Carrickmacross, Ardee, Collon and Slane.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I also concluded that Bus Éireann did not seek or obtain ministerial consent to operate the services complained of and that it was therefore in <Col N="261" /> breach of section 25 of the 1958 Act. Bus Éireann was advised on 10 April 2003 that the company had been found to be in breach of section 25(1) of the Transport Act 1958 and directed to modify the operation of the services in question in the following ways with effect from 26 May 2003: the 6 a.m. service from Monaghan to Dublin, departing Carrickmacross at 6.35 a.m., should no longer serve Carrickmacross, Ardee, Collon and Slane; the 6.35 a.m. service from Letterkenny to Dublin, departing Carrickmacross at 9 a.m., should not be permitted to pick up but may continue to set down passengers between Carrickmacross and Slane, both points inclusive.</P>
    <P>Bus Éireann was also requested to give passengers on these routes a minimum of 21 days notice of the modifications to the operation of services specified in the direction and the commencement date of those modifications. Bus Éireann may at any time apply under section 25(1) of the 1958 Act for my consent to initiate a passenger road service which competes with a licensed road service.</P>

      <P>The use of bus lanes in this country is provided for in the Road Traffic (Traffic and Parking) Regulations 1997, the primary purpose of which is to facilitate and promote bus based public transport. These regulations generally limit the use of bus lanes to buses and, in the case of with-flow bus lanes, to cyclists. Having regard to the role of taxis in providing on-street immediate hire services, an exemption to that limitation is allowed in respect of taxis when they are being used in the course of business.</P>
      <P>The Minister for the Environment and Local Government previously held responsibility in this area and following representations from hackney, limousine and motorcycle interests on the issue of bus lane access, a review of the regulations was undertaken in 2001 by his Department in consultation with the Garda Síochána, the Dublin Transportation Office and Dublin City Council.</P>
      <P>An overriding concern is the carrying capacity of bus lanes and the potential that their primary role to provide bus priority could be undermined if other vehicles are allowed access. Having regard to these circumstances, and having considered the various views expressed on this issue, it was decided on completion of the review that there should be no change in the existing bus lane access provisions, at present.</P>

      <P>Iarnród Éireann informs me that the Rosslare to Dublin line is currently being upgraded as part of the national development plan and with European Regional Development Fund assistance. It is planned to renew 24 miles in the current year and complete the final 14 miles in 2004. It is planned to replace the rolling stock with new regional railcars within five years.</P>
      <P>The strategic rail review examined the Rosslare-Limerick route and concluded that even with a much enhanced service, the major investment needed to upgrade services, estimated to be in excess of &euro;200 million, could not be justified. The review goes on to state that potential passenger volumes are such that it is questionable whether additional investments should take place, particularly where competing investments of higher societal returns are available.</P>
      <P>Nevertheless, my Department is working with the various local and regional authorities on the development of a future land use and transportation strategy to meet the needs of the regions affected over the next 20 years. Part of this work will include an analysis of future transportation needs. The outcome of this work over the coming months will inform future investment in transport, including rail. I await the outcome of this work which is being undertaken as part of the implementation of the national spatial strategy.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. Brennan Mr. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Transport (Mr. Brennan)</NameTxt>
      <P>The penalty points system, which is provided for in the Road Traffic Act 2002, was introduced with effect from 31 October 2002 for the offence of breaching a speed limit. Penalty points are being applied to the driving licence records of those convicted of such offences and to those who pay a fixed charge to the Garda in order to prevent the instigation of court proceedings.</P>
      <P>The Road Traffic Act 2002, contains a number of provisions to ensure the effective application of penalty points on the licence record of an individual. Section 5 of the Act provides that where penalty points are to be endorsed in a record, a notification of that endorsement must be issued to the licence holder involved. The notice sets out in particular the basis for the endorsement of the points. Section 7 of the Act provides that, save in very limited and quite specific instances, the operative date for penalty points is 28 days from the date of the notice issued under section 5. The application of penalty points from the date of the alleged commission of an offence would not be appropriate in that the points would apply from a date that would precede either the payment of a fixed charge or the determination of guilt by a court.</P>
      <P>The Act also sets out details relating to the operation of the system. The points remain on the licence record for a period of three years from the date of the application of the points and the accumulation of 12 points or more leads to an automatic six month disqualification. I am satisfied that the timeframe provided for in the Act is appropriate.</P>

      <P>I am informed by the Garda authorities that two incidents have been reported since 1 November 2002 in relation to the location referred to by the Deputy. Both incidents are still currently under investigation. This area is considered to be a meeting point for young people who reside outside the area. These gatherings have resulted at times in anti-social behaviour. As a result of regular patrols and attention to the area by local gardaí, difficulties with such youths have been reduced considerably in recent months.</P>
      <P>Gardaí from Mountjoy Garda station, and in particular the local community gardaí, are aware of past and present difficulties in this area. I am assured that they will continue to give the area ongoing attention, and will also continue to liaise with local residents' associations.</P>

      <P>Legal costs, in the sense of legal fees, incurred by the Criminal Assets Bureau are met from the Vote for the Office of the Chief State Solicitor. However, the information sought is not provided as a matter of course in the annual reports of the bureau which are laid before the Oireachtas and is not otherwise readily available. I will write to the Deputy with the information in the near future, provided that it does not require a disproportionate amount of time and resources to compile the information in question.</P>

      <P>An Agreed Programme for Government published by Fianna Fail and the Progressive Democrats includes commitments in relation to measures to deal with fraudulent claims. Substantial progress has been made on preparation of legislative proposals in this regard and I would hope to put these to Government shortly. Among my proposals will be a provision that certain forms of action will require the support of sworn affidavits so as to create liability in perjury for fraudulent claims and a provision to allow the courts to make orders to deal with those who make false and exaggerated claims.</P>
      <P>Section 6 of the Criminal Justice (Theft and Fraud Offences) Act 2001 makes it an offence for a person to dishonestly, with the intention of making a gain for himself or herself or another or of causing loss to another, by any deception induce another to do or refrain from doing an act. A person guilty of this offence is liable on conviction on indictment to a fine or imprisonment for a term not exceeding five years or both.</P>

      <P>As the Deputy may be aware, the Children Act 2001, now in the course of phased implementation by the relevant Departments, shifts the emphasis away from residential-custodial care to care in the community, for children aged under 18 years, in the juvenile justice and welfare systems. Thus the Act stipulates that detention of a child is to be an absolute last resort. In replying to Parliamentary Question No. 183 of 13 May 2003, I have indicated what is being <Col N="270" /> done by way of early intervention as a measure to address the needs of children who may come before the courts or get in trouble with the law.</P>
      <P>Under the provisions of the Act, I will be obliged to provide separate, dedicated secure detention centres for the accommodation of 16 and 17 year old offenders. These secure detention centres, called children detention centres, will operate under their own unique regime which will cater specifically for the needs of juvenile offenders.</P>
      <P>The provision of these facilities has been identified as a priority by the Irish Prison Service. As the Deputy is probably aware, I recently announced that I have accepted the recommendation of the Commissioners of Public Works that a proposed Irish Prison Service development at Newlands Villa, Clondalkin, including the construction of a children detention centre, should not now proceed. The identification of another site for the proposed juvenile detention centre is now being pursued by the Irish Prison Service in consultation with the Office of Public Works.</P>
      <P>I wish to advise the Deputy that pursuant to a Government decision of April 2002, it was the intention of the service to provide 20 spaces at St. Patrick's Institution for the custody and education of 14 and 15 year old boys but, following a review of accommodation requirements for juveniles, the possibility of moving directly to using the new facilities at St. Patrick's for 16 and 17 year old boys is now under consideration.</P>
      <P>Pending the phased implementation of the Children Act, a court intending to commit a young offender aged 17 years and under to custody in an institution managed by the Irish Prison Service, has a range of options available, including: committal of an offender aged 16 to 17 years &ndash; and up to 21 years &ndash; to St. Patrick's Institution; committal of an offender aged 17 to one of the prisons designated to cater for committals of adults remanded or sentenced by that court; or where an unruly certificate under the Children Act 1908 exists, committal of an offender aged 15 and 16 years to an adult prison.</P>
      <P>I am not empowered to interfere with the exercise by a court of any particular option available to it under existing legislation.</P>

      <P>Before responding to the Deputy's question about a review of educational services for juveniles in custody, I will briefly outline what is provided at present by way of educational service for such offenders.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Education in the prisons for juveniles, as well as for adults, is mainly provided by the vocational education committees, vocational education committees, in partnership with the Prison Service and with a range of educational agencies in the community such as the public library services, the Arts Council, etc. Education units are in operation in all prisons and places of detention, with the exception of Cloverhill Prison where the arrangements for education are not yet complete. A cohort of teachers amounting to 215 full-time equivalents provide a wide range of courses &ndash;<Col N="272" /> from basic literacy to Open University, structured physical education, health education, social education, the arts in various forms, as well as more conventional subjects leading to junior and leaving certificate exams and accreditation by FETAC. However, set courses and examination work are but a part of prison education because of time restrictions, irregular intake and prisoners special needs and interests.</P>
    <P>St. Patrick's Institution, which is specifically designated to cater for male committals in the 16 to 21 age group, has a strong ethic of multi-disciplinary team-working which has resulted in the development of new programmes over the past two years for the rehabilitation of offenders including a drug-free wing, personal development group programmes and a positive sentence management programme. Work is ongoing in the Prison Service in relation to the following key targets in the educational area, as set forth in the Prison Service strategy statement: maintain the prisoner participation rate in education at 50% against the background of increases in the prisoner population; and review the education curriculum to ensure its continuing relevance to prisoner needs.</P>
    <P>An extensive review of the educational curriculum for all prisons and places of detention is nearing finalisation. It is expected that the completed review will be presented to the director general of the Prison Service and to me in the coming months.</P>
    <P>I am also arranging to forward the Directory of Prison Education 2002 to the Deputy. The directory, which gives more details of what is available in the education units of different prisons, is prepared annually by the Prison Service's co-ordinator of education.</P>

      <P>For the purpose of this question a juvenile is assumed to be a person aged under 18 years of age. I am informed by the director general of the Irish Prison Service that, for the years 2001 and 2002, there were no formal complaints made against staff by juveniles detained in either St. Patrick's Institution or Shanganagh Castle. The vast majority of prison inmates aged under 18 years of age would have been detained in either of these institutions during that time period. Any formal complaint made by a prisoner, regardless of their age, would of course be fully investigated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to the issue of complaints of mistreatment of juveniles while in the custody of the Garda Síochána, I wish to advise the Deputy that this information is not readily available and could <Col N="273" /> be obtained only by the expenditure of a disproportionate amount of staff time and resources.</P>

The committee is composed of lawyers, medical doctors, prison experts, parliamentarians, etc., from the member states and carries out its task by periodic and <i>ad hoc </i>visits. During these visits, the committee has the right of unimpeded access at any time of the day or night to any place where persons are detained, whether it be a prison, a Garda station or a mental hospital, and are entitled to speak in private to any detained person.</P>
      <P>The CPT visited Ireland for inspection purposes in May of last year and the report to the Government on this visit has been received in my Department.

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. McDowell Mr. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. McDowell)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Children Act 2001 contains a range of innovative measures on restorative justice for juvenile offenders in accordance with modern thinking and best international practice. Three Departments have a role in implementing the Act: the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, the Department of Health and Children and the Department of Education and Science. The National Children's Office has responsibility to oversee the implementation of the Act and co-ordinate regular working group meetings. During the passage of the Act through the Oireachtas, it was made clear by the Government that implementation would have to take place on a phased basis given its complexities.</P>
      <P>Significant parts of the Act have already been implemented. The first commencement order under the Act in respect of my Department was signed by my predecessor on 23 April 2002. The order, which came into force on 1 May 2002, provided for, <i>inter alia: </i>the establishment of the Garda diversion programme on a statutory basis and the introduction of a &ldquo;diversion conference&rdquo; based on restorative justice principles as pioneered in New Zealand; the establishment of the Children's Court; the introduction of a fines structure for children found guilty of offences and the payment of compensation by parents in respect of offences committed by their children; the introduction of a curfew for children found guilty of offences; court orders to parents to exercise proper control over their children; the updating of the law in relation to cruelty to children and persons who cause or encourage a sexual offence on a child; reversing the burden of proof on parents whose children are found begging; a limited &ldquo;clean slate&rdquo; in respect of most offences committed by children; provisions relating to the safety of children at entertainments.</P>
      <P>The Garda juvenile diversion programme provides that, in certain circumstances, a juvenile under 18 years of age who freely accepts responsibility for a criminal incident may be cautioned as an alternative to prosecution. The programme has proven to be highly successful in diverting young people away from crime by offering guidance and support to juveniles and their families. In the more serious cases, juveniles are placed under the supervision of Garda juvenile liaison officers, who are specially trained members of the Garda Síochána responsible for administering the programme at the local level.</P>
      <P>Part 4 of the Children Act 2001 introduced the concepts of restorative justice, specifically restorative cautioning and restorative conferencing, to the juvenile diversion programme. Essentially, these provisions provide for the inclusion, where appropriate and possible, of the victim, the juvenile's family and the wider stakeholding community in the process of diversion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To facilitate these innovative developments, most Garda juvenile liaison officers have now received training in mediation skills, with advanced training being provided to selected <Col N="275" /> officers. Ongoing evaluation of restorative justice practice is being carried out by the Garda research unit. It is intended that, as Garda juvenile liaison officers become more skilled in administering restorative justice, they will be able to focus on the more complex and high-risk offenders, with a view to further reducing the incidence of recidivism.</P>
    <P>In addition to the Garda juvenile diversion programme, there are 64 Garda youth diversion projects. These projects comprise a community-based, multi-agency crime prevention initiative which seeks to divert young persons from becoming involved &ndash; or further involved &ndash; in anti-social and-or criminal behaviour by providing suitable activities to facilitate personal development, promote civic responsibility and improve long-term employability prospects.</P>
    <P>As the Deputy may be aware, recent years have seen a dramatic increase in the number of these projects, from 12 in 1997 to 64 at present, a process made possible, in part, by funding under the National Development Plan 2000-2006. Funding of &euro;5.577 million has been allocated to these and related projects in the current year.</P>
    <P>The successful implementation of the community-based options under the Children Act 2001 will also require a very significant input from the probation and welfare service. The probation and welfare service, as part of its planning for implementation of the Children Act 2001 engaged trainers from the Department of Child, Youth and Family, New Zealand, for the intensive training of all senior probation and welfare officers as facilitators for family conferences to be convened and managed in accordance with the requirements of the Act as well as providing day seminars for all probation and welfare officers. In addition, the service will provide ongoing training through its staff development unit as required. Interviews for additional probation and welfare officers took place recently and a panel of suitable candidates has been established. Recruitment of these officers is due to commence very shortly.</P>
    <P>It is an underlying concept of the Children Act to expand the options a court will have at its disposal when deciding on how to deal with a young offender. These options are an essential feature of the Act as they will allow effect to be given to the principle that detention for young offenders will be a last resort. Thus, the Act envisages committals to custody of young offenders being availed of only in situations where other alternative diversions and community-based options have been resorted to and have failed.</P>

In the case of non-EEA workers who require a visa to travel to the State, if they arrive under the work permit scheme they must be in employment in the State for 12 months and have been offered a contract for a further 12 months before they can be joined by their families.</P>

      <P>I have been informed by the Garda authorities that the total number of hand-held speed detection devices available to the Garda Síochána is 368. These detection devices are allocated on a divisional basis as set out in the following table. However, from time to time these devices require calibration and-or repair. The number of devices operational is not readily available and the compilation of this information would involve a disproportionate amount of staff time and resources.</P>
      <P>The Garda Síochána also operates a range of other speed detection equipment, including in-car and motor cycle detection cameras, mobile speed detection units, i.e. GATSOs, and fixed speed cameras.</P>

      <Quest>if his attention has been drawn to the widespread distribution of scratch cards, often within the pages of national newspapers, invariably stating that the recipient has won a substantial prize but requiring that a lengthy phone call be made at premium rates in order that the prize can be claimed; if he is satisfied that the requirements of gaming and lotteries legislation are complied with by the promoters of these competitions; if so, if he has plans to amend the law in order to control or abolish them; if his Department has discussed with the Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources the need for improved regulation of the premium rate service in this regard; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. McDowell Mr. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. McDowell)</NameTxt>
      <P>All scratch card competitions must fully comply with current gaming and lotteries legislation. Where premium rate services are used such scratch card competitions must have prior authorisation from Regtel &ndash; Regulator of Premium Rate Telecommunications Services Limited &ndash; before they are launched. In addition, service providers providing such services must comply with specific sections of Regtel's code of practice. For example, in relation to promotional material, the cost of a call and its duration must be associated with the premium rate number used for that service. There are also specific conditions set out in the code of practice regarding the promotion of premium rate services. In particular, promotional material must not be misleading. In authorising such scratch card competitions the regulator stipulates that the cost of any individual call made to such competitions must not exceed &euro;8.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Regtel is the independent regulator and is a not-for-profit company, financed by the industry and is a supervisory body for the premium rate <Col N="279" /> telecommunication industry in Ireland. Premium rate services are regulated under S.I. No. 194 of 1995. This instrument makes provision for setting up the office of Regtel and it requires that premium rate service providers shall at all times comply with Regtel's code of practice and abide by instructions or directions from Regtel with regard to premium rate services. Neither the Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources nor the Commission for Communications Regulation have direct responsibility for regulating the content and promotion of premium rate services.</P>
    <P>I am informed by the Garda authorities that they have not, to date, received any direct complaints concerning this particular type of competition. On receipt of a complaint the matter would be fully investigated and the advice of the law officers sought.</P>
    <P>The recommendations of the report of the interdepartmental review group on the review of the Gaming and Lotteries Acts 1956-86 &ndash; published in June 2000 &ndash; including those concerning the conduct of various categories of lottery are being examined in my Department in light of the proposed legislation to amend and update the Gaming and Lotteries Acts.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. McDowell Mr. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. McDowell)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Disability Bill 2001 was published on 21 December 2001. Following concerns expressed by interest groups, the Government agreed to further consultations on future proposals for disability legislation, in particular the Disability Bill 2001. An expert consultation team was appointed in April 2002 to oversee the consultation process and comprised Ms Sylda Langford, Assistant Secretary in the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Mr. John O'Donnell, Senior Counsel, Professor Brian Nolan, Economic and Social Research Institute, Mr. Bernard Feeney, Senior Consultant, Goodbody's Economic Consultants, and Mr. Brian Crowley, Member of the European Parliament.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In addition, a group representative of people with disabilities, their families, carers and service providers, the Disability Legislation Consultation Group, DLCG, was brought together by the National Disability Authority, NDA, to facilitate dialogue at national level, both within the sector and with the consultation team. The DLCG presented the document &ldquo;Equal Citizens &ndash; Proposals for Core Elements of Disability Legislation&rdquo; to the expert consultation team in early February 2003. Having met with and received the views of key stakeholders, including the DLCG, <Col N="280" /> the social partners, the community and voluntary sector and relevant Government Departments, the consultation team completed its task in February 2003.</P>
    <P>The process of overseeing the preparation of the revised Disability Bill has been referred by the Government to the Cabinet Sub-Committee on Social Inclusion in view of the complex and crosscutting issues which fall to be considered. The Cabinet sub-committee will play a key role in facilitating cross-departmental co-operation in the development of legislative proposals over the coming months. The DLCG document has remained an important input to deliberations as regards the content of the legislation at each stage of the process.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment and Local Government (Mr. Cullen)</NameTxt>
      <P>I refer to the reply to Question No. 122 of 14 April 2003.</P>
      <P>The Government has taken, and will continue to take, a pro-active role in campaigning against reprocessing operations at Sellafield. An Agreed Programme for Government has stated that we regard the continued existence of Sellafield as an unacceptable threat to Ireland; that it should be closed, and that we will use every diplomatic and legal route available to us to work towards the removal of this threat.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government has taken an important initiative in pursuit of this policy objective through its separate legal actions, under the OSPAR Convention and the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea, regarding the Sellafield MOX <Col N="281" /> plant. These actions are proceeding on schedule and are challenging operations at the Sellafield MOX plant on economic, legal, environmental and safety grounds.</P>
    <P>Under the OSPAR Convention, we are seeking access to certain information necessary to carry out an independent evaluation of the economic case for the plant in order to ensure that it was justified as required under EU law. The UK response has been to refuse access to the information concerned on grounds of commercial sensitivity. Oral hearings of these proceedings took place in the permanent court of arbitration in The Hague in October 2002, and a judgment or award is expected shortly.</P>
    <P>The UNCLOS action is based on claims by Ireland that the UK is in breach of its obligations under UNCLOS regarding the threat to the marine environment from the continued operation and expansion of Sellafield, the threat to the Irish Sea from shipments of nuclear materials and the inadequacy of the 1993 environmental impact statement for the MOX Plant. The UK has rejected these claims. Oral hearings of proceedings will begin on 10 June 2003 and are expected to last three weeks.</P>
    <P>On 16 January 2003, I represented Ireland at the third ministerial meeting of the British Irish Council (Environment Group). This meeting was chaired by Michael Meacher, the British Minister for the Environment, and included environment ministers from the devolved administrations. Part of the group's agenda is the issue of radioactive waste from Sellafield, and a paper tabled jointly by Ireland and the Isle of Man will be considered on conclusion of Ireland's legal actions. Other issues for discussion at the next meeting of this group include highly active waste and long-term storage of plutonium at Sellafield.</P>
    <P>On 7 November 2002, I debated the motion &ldquo;That this house would shut down Sellafield&rdquo; at the Law Society in NUI Dublin. The British Minister for Energy, Brian Wilson, was present at the debate. I will meet Mr. Wilson again when he visits Dublin later this month and will take this opportunity to raise my concerns about Sellafield.</P>
    <P>I wrote to Michael Meacher on 7 January 2003 outlining my concerns regarding the proposed decision by the environment agency in the UK on future discharges of technetium 99 (Tc-99) from Sellafield. I also wrote to the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry, Patricia Hewitt, on 28 March 2003 expressing my concerns about the adequacy of security at Sellafield and received a response on 16 April 2003. I published this response in reply to Question No. 141 of 14 May 2003.</P>
    <P>My officials and the scientific staff of the RPII also continue to have regular contact with their UK counterparts through correspondence and meetings.</P>
    <P>All contacts between me and UK ministers, and at official level, are welcome, cordial and productive. However, while I believe there has been an increasing recognition among the UK auth<Col N="282" /> orities of the serious concerns of the Irish population, there remains a significant divergence in our respective views in relation to Sellafield. The legal and other options open to the Government in relation to Sellafield remain under continuous review.</P>

      <P>I have previously acknowledged the excellent work which has been done by the Irish Seal Sanctuary in rehabilitating small numbers of seals. However, given the limited resources available to my Department for wildlife conservation and protection, grant assistance in this area must realistically be targeted at projects which will maximise conservation prospects. There is an abundant population of seals in Irish waters and the species is not endangered in conservation terms. On this basis, I regret that funding of the Irish Seal Sanctuary facility by my Department cannot be justified at this time.</P>

      <P>Housing capital allocations to local authorities, including Dún Laoghaire Rathdown County Council, consist of Exchequer capital <Col N="283" /> grants combined with the use of internal capital receipts.

      <P>When the retail planning guidelines were published at end 2000, it was indicated that they would be reviewed following experience with their operation. I have been considering the activation of such a review in the light of discussions at Government level on maintaining the competitiveness of the Irish economy, <Col N="290" /> and have also conveyed this position in a recent meeting with RGDATA.</P>
      <P>In view of an indication that the company referred to had expressed an interest in entering the Irish market, I and officials of my Department took the opportunity &ndash; during the course of a visit to Scotland last February to my housing and planning counterpart, the Scottish Minister for Social Justice &ndash; to visit one of the stores operated by this company, accompanied by some of its senior managers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I subsequently received a letter dated 20 February 2003 from the company's UK property manager, which again stated the company's interest in setting up a store in Ireland. I replied by way of a letter, dated 17 April 2003, which conveyed that I was in the course of putting <Col N="291" /> arrangements in place for a review of the retail planning guidelines. The letter stated that the review of the guidelines would have regard to current and prospective economic and employment conditions in Ireland, as well as to competition and land use issues, and that there would be opportunity to make submissions in this regard in due course. I received a further letter from the company dated 12 May 2003 which acknowledged receipt of my letter.</P>

      <P>I understand that the document referred to was prepared by the Royal Town Planning Institute's Irish planning policy panel as a discussion document seeking views on key strategic issues for rural planning in both the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland. My Department did not have any role in sponsoring or financing the document's preparation or publication. Rural settlement policies in Ireland are a matter for the Government, and for regional and local authorities, with overall Government policy in this regard having been set out in the national spatial strategy, which was published on 28 November 2002.</P>

      <P>To date, my Department has issued one circular to local authorities on the operation of the Planning and Development (Amendment) Act 2002. A copy of this circular will be forwarded to the Deputy shortly.</P>
      <P>The Act provides for alternative options to the transfer of land in order to meet the conditions of Part V, including the making of a payment to a local authority fund to provide social and affordable housing. The decision, in individual cases, as to which option should be incorporated in Part V agreement is a matter for negotiation between the local authority and the developer concerned. In reaching agreement the local authority must ensure <i>inter alia</i> that this contributes effectively and efficiently to the achievement of its housing strategy.</P>
      <P>Draft guidelines have been prepared to assist those dealing with agreements under the revised Part V arrangements and, following a consultation process with relevant stakeholders, which is ongoing, these guidelines will be finalised and issued as soon as possible.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment and Local Government (Mr. Cullen)</NameTxt>
      <P>Current policy is that hunting with firearms is not permitted on State lands which are owned by my Department. Neither I nor my predecessor with responsibility for wildlife conservation have proposed any change of policy in this matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At the request of the National Association of Regional Game Councils &ndash; NARGC &ndash; my predecessor agreed, without prejudice to the above position, to participation by experienced departmental officials together with nominees of NARGC to examine the issue of hunting on State lands, from a scientific perspective only. A final report has been received, which is under consideration in my Department. When the report <Col N="293" /> has been fully examined I will address any issues of policy which may arise from it.</P>
    <P>While hunting with firearms is forbidden on State lands, some limited hunting with gun dogs, but without firearms and excluding killing, has been permitted on these lands for many years under licences issued to the Irish Kennel Club by my Department under section 22(9)(<i>c</i>) of the Wildlife Act 1976, as amended. This provision permits the granting of a licence to &ldquo;hunt, on such day or during such period of days, protected wild birds of a species so specified for the purpose of either training gun dogs for any field sport or holding gun dog trials&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>I am advised that this form of hunting, which does not involve the killing of the protected birds, does not interfere with birds during their nesting season. It is a means of training dogs to locate the sitting birds and pointing them to the dogs' owners. I am also advised that this arrangement has been of mutual benefit to both my Department and the Irish Kennel Club in that the National Parks and Wildlife Service is provided with the results of bird counts carried out by the club while training dogs on the mountains.</P>
    <P>It has been brought to my attention that, through an administrative error in my Department, the hunting licences issued to the Irish Kennel Club since 2000 do not cover gun trials without firearms and without killing. This lapse is now being rectified.</P>

      <P>On 23 January 2003, the European Commission issued Ireland with a Reasoned Opinion to the effect that the &euro;20 fee for the making of a submission on a planning application is contrary to the public participation provisions of Directive 85/337/EEC on Environmental Impact Assessment. A reply, which responds to each of the points raised in the Reasoned Opinion, issued to the European Commission on 16 May 2003 and contends that the imposition of a &euro;20 participation fee is not in conflict with the provisions of the relevant directives. I have no proposal at this stage to amend the relevant regulations which reflect an approach recently endorsed by the Oireachtas in the context of the Planning and Development Act 2000.</P>

      <P>The primary purpose of the students summer jobs scheme was to provide income support for less well off students who were not entitled to receive unemployment assistance during the summer months. As I have stated in the House on a number of occasions, there had been a significant decline in interest in the scheme due to the availability of alternative well-paid summer employment in recent years &ndash; see appendix following &ndash; and, against this background, it was decided to discontinue the scheme.</P>
      <P>In 2002, a total of 4,632 students participated in the scheme, of which 493 worked in schools. This figure relates to colleges and schools throughout the country, in both rural and urban areas. In the circumstances, I do not expect the discontinuance of the scheme will have major implications for rural schools.</P>
      <P>My Department does not have any plans to provide a specific scheme for rural schools, as referred to by the Deputy. I understand that many of the students working in schools under the student summer jobs scheme were involved in maintenance-type work. In this regard, the Deputy may be aware that the Department of Education and Science operates a minor works grant scheme, which provides funding for minor repairs and refurbishments of this nature in schools.</P>

      <P>The issue raised by the Deputy about the Grand Canal is the day to day responsibility of Waterways Ireland, a North-South implementation body for inland waterways set up under the British-Irish Agreement signed in March 1999. Waterways Ireland took over the responsibility for the Grand Canal with effect from 1 April 2000 and is responsible for the management, maintenance, development and restoration of the inland navigable waterways system throughout Ireland, principally for recreational purposes.</P>
      <P>I understand from Waterways Ireland that the first appearance of the zebra mussel in Ireland was in the Shannon in the mid-1990s and in the Grand Canal in 1998. I am advised by Waterways Ireland that no sustainable method of preventing the spread of the species has been identified to date. However, the issue is being kept under constant review by that body.</P>

Cohabiting couples are jointly assessed for means test purposes and qualify as a couple for most benefits and allowances. The exception is in the area of survivor type payments which include widows and widower's pensions and widowed parent grant. These payments are only paid on the death of a husband or wife. There are other social welfare payments for which the survivor of a cohabiting couple can apply, for example, those bereaved who have young children may, if they can satisfy a means test, qualify for the one-parent family payment.</P>

      <P>The person concerned applied for disability allowance on 17 May 2002. Following investigation, it was established that the cost of maintenance for the person concerned is being met in part by the relevant health board. As prescribed in legislation, disability allowance is not payable to a person who is resident in full-time residential or institutional care where the funding of that person's care and maintenance is met by a health board. Accordingly, she was refused disability allowance.</P>
      <P>She was notified of this decision and of her right of appeal to the independent social welfare appeals office. She appealed this decision and following an oral hearing in March 2003, the appeals officer upheld the original decision and disallowed the appeal. An appeals officer's decision is final and conclusive in the absence of any fresh facts or evidence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Since August 1999, existing recipients of disability allowance who are living at home can retain their entitlement where they subsequently go into hospital or residential care. In addition, people who are living in community based residences are eligible to receive disability allowance provided the relevant health board is not providing funding towards their maintenance. These <Col N="299" /> improvements mean that persons previously disqualified for payment under the disabled person's maintenance scheme because he or she were in residential care are now entitled to payment under the disability allowance scheme.</P>

      <P>The application for carer's allowance of the person concerned was disallowed by a deciding officer who, having considered the medical evidence furnished in support of the claim, and the views of the Department's chief medical adviser, decided that the care recipient was not in need of full-time care and attention as prescribed in the statutory provisions. The decision was appealed to the social welfare appeals office and, in the context of the appeal, the care recipient was examined by a medical assessor of my Department who also expressed the opinion that she was not in need of full-time care and attention. Following an oral hearing and having carefully considered all the available evidence, including that adduced at the hearing, the appeals officer disallowed the appeal.</P>
      <P>The person subsequently submitted further medical evidence for consideration by the appeals officer. This evidence was forwarded to the chief medical adviser of the Department for his observations as to whether it would have had a bearing on the findings of the medical assessor who examined the care recipient. The chief medical adviser stated that, in his opinion, it would not have made any difference as this evidence was already on file at the time of the assessment. Having received the further views of the chief medical adviser, the appeals officer considers that no new evidence has been produced and, as the appellant has already been afforded an oral hearing at which she had a full opportunity to present her case, that a further oral hearing would not serve any useful purpose. The person concerned has been informed of his decision.</P>
      <P>Under social welfare legislation decisions in relation to claims must be made by deciding officers and appeals officers. These officers are statutorily appointed and I have no role in regard to making such decisions.</P>

      <P>The Government will continue its policy of providing significant increases in pensions each year and in this regard An Agreed Programme for Government and the new social partnership agreement, Sustaining Progress, provide for a target rate for the basic pension of &euro;200 per week to be achieved by 2007. The improvements announced in budget 2003 saw the old age contributory pension increase to &euro;157.30 per week and the old age non-contributory pension increase to &euro;144.00 per week. In addition, the Government is committed to increasing pensions over a five to ten year period to 34% of average industrial wages and to increasing the payment for qualified adults, aged 66 or over, to the same level as the personal rate of the old age non-contributory pension. This process had already commenced in budget 2000 and a number of special increases have been granted since then. The rate of the qualified allowance on the contributory pension now stands at &euro;121.50 per week which is about 84% of the maximum rate of the non-contributory pension.</P>
      <P>From October 2002 new applicants for pension can arrange for the payment of the allowance direct to their spouse or partner. Improvements for the pensioners remain one of the Government's main priorities. In this regard, social welfare provision for this group will be kept under review and further improvements will be considered where appropriate.</P>

      <P>People who have been in receipt of disability benefit for at least a year can apply to transfer to the invalidity pension, if they satisfy the relevant conditions. In order to be eligible for invalidity pension a person must have been incapable of work for at least 12 months and be likely to be incapable of work for at least a further 12 months. People can qualify for invalidity pension at an earlier date if they have an incapacity for work which is of such a nature that the likelihood is that they will be incapable of work for life. In addition, a claimant for invalidity pension must satisfy the PRSI contribution requirements.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While many people who have been in receipt of disability benefit for more than a year transfer to the invalidity pension, there are others who, for a variety of reasons, choose not to do so. It is recognised that there is a significant overlap between the invalidity pension scheme and the <Col N="301" /> disability benefit scheme for those in receipt of payment in the long term. This overlap is one of a number issues which is currently being examined as part of a programme expenditure review of the various income maintenance payments for people who are ill and people with disabilities, which is being undertaken by my Department. The key elements of this study include clarifying the objectives of each scheme; identifying gaps and overlaps in the overall provision, with a view to producing a more simplified system which is consistent and comprehensive; examining the extent to which schemes support self-sufficiency &ndash; for example, as regards incentives to move into work/training/rehabilitation; and looking at possible alternative approaches to the design and delivery of social protection for people who are ill or disabled.</P>

      <P>Social assistance payments feature a means test which is intended to ensure that available resources are targeted at those most in need. In recent years, considerable improvements have been made to means tests to allow persons to qualify more easily for payments, to retain more of their income before payments are withdrawn or to withdraw payments more gradually if means exceed a certain level. In the most recent budget, the income disregard for carer's allowance was increased from &euro;191 for a single person and &euro;382 for a couple per week to &euro;210 for a single person and &euro;420 for a couple per week. It is estimated that this measure will cost &euro;5.34 million in a full year. The assessment of benefit and privilege for unemployment assistance recipients aged 29 years or more was abolished from May of this year at a cost of &euro;0.76 million.</P>
      <P>In line with the current arrangements for one parent family payment, the treatment of maintenance in the assessment of means for disability allowance, unemployment assistance, farm assist, PRETA, OANCP, widow or widower's pension and blind persons' pension was standardised at a cost of &euro;0.85 million. Any further changes to means assessment would require the allocation of additional resources and would have to be considered in a budgetary context.</P>

      <P>The farm assist scheme was intro<Col N="302" /> duced in 1999 as an income support scheme for low income farmers. It is a means tested scheme with a more favourable method of assessment, including disregards in respect of qualified children, than had applied under the previous smallholders' unemployment assistance scheme. The scheme was further improved in two ways from 2000. The child related income disregards were increased by &euro;126.97, bringing them to &euro;253.95 in respect of each of the first two children and to &euro;380.92 in respect of the third and subsequent children. The means assessment rate was reduced from 80% to 70%, thereby increasing the income from self-employment which a farm assist claimant can keep before the level of payment is reduced. Farm assist recipients also benefited from the improved capital assessment regime which was introduced in 2000. I do not have any proposals to make further changes to the scheme at this time.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 435 and 436 together.</P>
      <P>The back to education allowance is a second chance education opportunities scheme designed to encourage and facilitate certain groups who are receiving social welfare payments to improve their skills and qualifications and, therefore, their prospects of returning to the active work force. The number of persons who applied for back to education allowance but did not satisfy the eligibility criteria for participation in the scheme in the 2001-02 and 2002-03 academic years is as follows: 2001-02 academic year, 490; 2002-03 academic year, 626.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A review of the basic purpose underlying my Department's back to education provisions was carried out recently. In light of this, and in view of the expenditure constraints facing us this year, the scheme has been revised. In framing proposals to change elements of the BTEA scheme, my concern was to ensure that resources should be focused where the need is greatest. In line with this, payments under the scheme for the summer period have been discontinued, as people who had been previously unemployed often find work opportunities either at home or abroad during the summer months. Participants in the scheme who fail to find employment during the summer may <Col N="303" /> be entitled to an unemployment payment, subject to satisfying the usual qualifying conditions.</P>
    <P>Regarding changes to the scheme as it relates to postgraduates, I am satisfied people in possession of a third level degree have already attained a good level of academic qualification, which should impact positively on their employment prospects. In a time of financial constraint I want to ensure that supports are directed to those with most pressing needs. However, I recently asked my Department to liaise with the relevant bodies to identify postgraduate courses such as the higher diploma, H.Dip, which add significantly to a person's employability and to which the BTEA should continue to apply. Arising from this review my Department will continue to support those wishing to take up a higher diploma in all disciplines or a graduate diploma in primary school teaching.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that the new arrangements will ensure the back to education scheme continues to provide support to those people who are most distant from the labour market and whose need is greatest.</P>

      <P>The back to work allowance scheme was reviewed recently in the light of economic and labour market changes and, in particular, of the drop in unemployment levels since the introduction of the allowance in 1993. This review also took cognisance of an evaluation of the scheme by independent consultants who recommended restructuring of the scheme in the light of the transformed labour market situation and, in particular, that the scheme be refocused on the longer-term unemployed, that the non-financial supports be enhanced, and that the overall numbers on the scheme be reduced.</P>
      <P>Following on this review, the qualifying period for persons on unemployment benefit-assistance has been increased to five years with effect from 1 January 2003. Other social welfare qualifying payments are not affected by the change. It is important that my Department's employment support services retain their relevance to current employment and economic conditions and continue to focus on the most vulnerable groups. I will continue to monitor the scheme but I have no immediate plans to change the existing qualifying criteria.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 438 and 439 together.</P>
      <P>Family income supplement, FIS, is designed to provide cash support for employees with families on low earnings and, thereby, preserve the incentive to remain in employment in circumstances where the employee might only be marginally better off than if he or she were claiming other social welfare payments. The improvements to the family income supplement scheme instituted by the Government, including the assessment of FIS on the basis of net rather than gross income and the progressive increases in the income limits, have made it easier for lower income households to qualify under the scheme.</P>
      <P>In this year's budget, I provided for further increases in the FIS income limits with effect from January 2003. These increases raised the weekly income limits by &euro;17 at each point, adding an extra &euro;10.20 to the payments of most existing FIS recipients. The average weekly payment stands at &euro;60 per week, with a total of 12,067 families receiving a supplement under the scheme. The question of further improvements to the scheme is a matter for consideration in a budgetary context, having regard to available resources and Government commitments.</P>

      <AskConj>asked the </AskConj>
      <askee>Minister for Social and Family Affairs</askee>
      <Quest>if there is an issue for her Department and perhaps the Equality Authority in addressing the discriminatory practice whereby in the case of two parents being separated, unemployed and having their children 50% of the time, that neither parent appears to qualify for one parent allowance based on a flawed administrative decision which refuses to allow children's allowance or a one parent allowance to be divided, even where both parents are agreeable to such an arrangement.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan" hpid="Mary Coughlan Mary Coughlan">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Social and Family Affairs (Mary Coughlan)</NameTxt>
      <P>To qualify for the one-parent family payment, a person must, among other things, have main care and charge of at least one qualified child. Where one parent has care of a child for most of the week that parent may, subject to the other qualifying conditions, receive payment of the one-parent family payment. In cases where both parents claim joint equal custody, neither can be considered to have main care and charge of the child and so a one-parent family payment cannot be paid.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the case of child benefit, regulations provide that payment is made to the mother where a child is resident jointly with both mother and father. <Col N="305" /> The basis of the one-parent family payment is to support a parent who has main care and charge of a qualified child and is parenting alone without the support of a spouse or partner. The OPF scheme does not cater for joint equal custody-parenting and it would be difficult to cater for this without compromising the basis of the scheme or creating inequalities <i>vis-à-vis</i> other categories of claimants. The issue will be reviewed in the context of ensuring that the social welfare system responds effectively to the needs of different family situations.</P>

      <P>To qualify for participation in the back to education allowance scheme an applicant must, <i>inter alia,</i> attend a full-time third level course of study that is recognised by the Department of Education and Science for the higher education grant scheme or recognised by the Higher Education Training and Awards Council, HETAC.</P>
      <P>The Department of Education and Science does not recognise postgraduate courses of study in England for the higher education grant scheme and consequently, such courses are not recognised for back to education allowance purposes.</P>

      <P>As the Deputy will be aware, I have taken a number of initiatives recently which will develop and improve Government policy on the family and ensure that adequate supports are in place for families and groups vulnerable to poverty and social exclusion.</P>
      <P>The Family Support Agency is now in place and will further strengthen the institutional framework for the development of effective and responsive family support services. In addition, I have recently initiated a series of consultation fora on the family, which are designed to provide me with an opportunity to hear the views of a wide range of family members and those who work with them from different regions of the country. In particular, I am interested in discussing the challenges facing families today, the impact of current Government policies and programmes on families and what participants see as the priorities for supporting families and strengthening family well-being.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The outcome of these public consultations will also inform my Department's preparation for the tenth anniversary celebration of the United Nations International Year of the Family 2004. The National Anti-Poverty Strategy, NAPS, prioritises the enhancement of the quality of life of vulnerable groups, as well as their income, by targeting the reduction of consistent poverty. The Government has committed to reducing the numbers of those who are consistently poor to below 2% and, if possible, eliminating consistent poverty. Particular attention is being paid to reducing consistent poverty among vulnerable groups, such as low-income families and children. There are also a number of targets relating to education, health, housing and income which will contribute <Col N="307" /> to improving the quality of life for those on low income.</P>
    <P>In the current social partnership agreement, Sustaining Progress, the Government has reiterated its commitment to improving the quality of life for children. The agreement targets services as well as income to ensure a better start for all children and sets out a number of objectives which are to be achieved in consultation with the <Col N="308" /> social partners, the National Children's Office and other relevant bodies. The Government recognises the importance of supporting and protecting families and children and is fully committed to achieving the NAPS targets and the objectives in Sustaining Progress. I am confident these initiatives, together with the review of family policy currently under way will contribute to an increase in the quality of life for families on low income and children in poverty.</P>
