      <P>Before coming to the Order of Business, I propose to deal with a number of notices under Standing Order 31. I will call on the Deputies in the order in which they submitted their notices to my office. I call Deputy Connolly.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Connolly</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose the suspension of Dáil Éireann under Standing Order 31 to discuss a matter of urgent national importance, namely the ongoing public health doctors' dispute, which is now in its seventh week, and the fact that the chief executive officer's spokesman stated that the strike was causing great difficulty, particularly in the following areas: cancelled health examinations in schools; administrating of booster vaccinations for diphtheria, pertussis, tetanus, polio and MMR to four and five year olds; suspended developmental child checks of hips and hearing, etc.; non-processing of applications for nursing home subventions; and suspended medical examination of sexually abused children in some areas &ndash; all of which issues require urgent and immediate attention. We must remember too that we are only days away from the start of the Special Olympics.</P>

      <P>In accordance with the terms of Standing Order 31, I wish to move the Adjournment of the Dáil to discuss the following specific and important matter of public interest requiring urgent attention: the serious anomaly in the planning process whereby the members of a local authority, Cork County Council, having rejected a motion for the material contravention of the development plan, now find that the developers of a proposed toxic waste facility can now appeal to An Bord Pleanála without reference to the county development plan, and in view of the importance of this issue I hope that you will agree to this request.</P>

The workers have been locked out of employment for the past 12 weeks and for that period have received no payment. In view of the importance of this matter and the fact that the ADM workers are in the Public Gallery today, I hope you will agree to this request.</P>

The Minister for Health and Children should immediately allocate the &euro;15 million as promised for the upgrading of Ennis General Hospital.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle An Leas-Cheann Comhairle">
      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny" hpid="Mr. Kenny Mr. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no reason the Dáil should not sit next week. Second, we are dealing with a Government that has set out to strangle the Freedom of Information Act and yet is leaking sections of reports to the media. It is a disgrace that the people who elect Members of this House are not entitled to have these reports laid in the Oireachtas Library where the public representatives who have to answer questions day and night across the country, can read them. Journalists all over the country have freedom and access to sections of these reports enabling them to comment publicly on them on radio and television and in the print media. It is a disgrace that the Government allows this situation. I am opposed to the taking of the Order of Business for these two reasons. The Dáil should meet next week to discuss these matters because they are of public and urgent concern.</P>

      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>The proposal now before the House is the motion regarding the Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland (Charters Amendment) Bill 2002.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>I am bound to agree with Deputy Kenny. There is no reason or justification for the <Col N="1521" />House rising until 10 June. When the Government was dismantling the Freedom of Information Act this side of the House argued that the purpose was to go back to old ways of doing things and Deputy Kenny has drawn attention to examples of it this week. It now appears that the House is not going to get the reports that have been selectively leaked to various journalists. Notwithstanding the fact that the House has been waiting for a long time to read the conclusions of the three reports concerned, selected journalists are able to study the proposals and comment on them and we are entirely reliant on their assessment. I am surprised that the Tánaiste is colluding in this fashion.</P>
      <P>Dáil Éireann is now the last place that any Minister would choose to announce his or her plans on any measure affecting our society. Every day, Ministers actively collude in diminishing the stature of this House and in contriving through an army of publicly-paid PR people to make their announcements outside the Chamber. It is diminishing our democracy and diminishing the standing of this House.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent" hpid="Mr. Sargent Mr. Sargent">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
      <P>It gives us the opportunity to stress the failure of the Government to act as a Government in terms of dealing with a report, bringing it before this House and being accountable to Dáil Éireann. That is why we are opposing it. I ask you, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, to take into account that this House will not be able to operate as a Dáil if the information has been already given out and dissected elsewhere. There are more leaks in this Government than in the water piping system in this city. It is important that the Government bears in mind that it cannot operate as a Government if it continues to leak information outside the Dáil because what credibility it has will be lost.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CaoimhglinOCaolain" hpid="Caoimhghín Ó Caoláin Caoimhghín Ó Caoláin">
      <NameTxt>Caoimhghín Ó Caoláin</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to address the substantive issue of this motion, the proposal to take the report of the Joint Committee on the Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland (Charters Amendment) Bill 2002, without debate. Deputy Sargent made the point that this is a health issue yet taking the time to examine this Bill, it can be seen that the Minister for Health and Children has seemingly no role or function in the terms of reference or accountability of the Royal College <Col N="1522" />of Surgeons. It is only in the instance of by-laws that the Minister for Education and Science has any role or function. He is the only Minister cited with any scrutineering responsibility regarding the royal college.</P>
      <P>This Bill has been sectioned off. The whole control of private Bills going through the Houses of the Oireachtas means that there is limited opportunity for real scrutiny of what is proposed. The Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland is ostensibly a body dealing with the training of people in surgery and other related health care specialties. However, to all intents and purposes, it is a corporation which is very profitable, a significant property holder in the city and one that has charitable status and for whom no taxes are payable on its profits.</P>
      <P>This Bill seeks to retain all the powers vested in the college by the various royal charters issued during the course of the 19th century. However, further powers and opportunities are being conferred on the Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland through the course of this Bill. This Oireachtas will do a serious disservice to its responsibility for public scrutiny of legislation, and will fail to ensure full transparency in relation to what this Bill seeks to achieve, if Members do not deal with every detail of it in full and open forum. I am absolutely opposed to allowing this to proceed without debate. It should be discussed at every point before it is allowed to pass, for the very sound reasons I have outlined.</P>

      <NameTxt>Caoimhghín Ó Caoláin</NameTxt>
      <P>In conclusion, I appeal to the Tánaiste and to the Government to ensure that this Bill is properly scrutinised as if it is not, the Oireachtas will stand condemned, quite rightly in my view, for failing in its responsibilities. I oppose the motion to allow this matter to proceed without debate at this point&mdash;</P>

It is inappropriate and it does a gross disservice to human rights, particularly in the light of these reports, to end the Second Stage now, and we oppose the proposal in that respect.</P>

There have been damning revelations about current practice in the whole area of addressing refugees and asylum seekers. There is an almost automatic turnabout now with exit on the next flight being part of the practice being highlighted in recent days by Amnesty International and some of the other authoritative bodies looking at this issue. It is important that Deputies avail of the opportunity to debate this important Bill. The guillotining of it at 1 p.m. will not facilitate the widest possible debate and that is what we should have on this important legislation, which should be rejected by the House.</P>

      <P>That comes second, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle. The debate should be open-ended. Serious issues came into the public domain yesterday from the Amnesty report and these should be debated. It is an issue that has major concerns for asylum seekers fleeing persecution. It has been stated by a number of organisations that it is contrary to the universal declaration of human rights under the Geneva Convention of 1951. I do not think it is proper to have a guillotine on this issue at 1 o'clock. It would be much better to leave the debate open-ended so that anybody who wishes to speak on it should be allowed to do so.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>I am objecting to the fact that Dáil Éireann will not sit next week. A raft of legislation is being prepared. The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform is producing his proposals, yet we have not seen the legislation. The Tánaiste has published the heads of a Bill but it may be 12 months before it comes before the House.</P>
      <P>I am concerned about the fact that these health reports are in the possession of the Government and have been leaked to selected sections of the media, yet elected representatives, including the Minister of State, Deputy Brian Lenihan, have not had an opportunity to visit the Oireachtas Library &ndash; if he ever goes there anymore &ndash; to read these reports and answer questions, in so far as he can. For that reason, I am objecting to No. 3. The Dáil should sit next week and the Tánaiste should consider the matter seriously.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no justification for the Dáil not sitting next Wednesday and Thursday. Three weeks ago, the House divided on that issue when considering a motion of mine. While I do not particularly want to see that matter being rehashed, Deputy Kenny's point is a fundamentally important one. I am advised that the Brennan report, for example, is between covers and dated January this year. Since it has been made available selectively to certain journalists, I do not understand why it cannot be placed in the Oireachtas Library and made available to every Member of the House. I ask the Tánaiste to respond to that. There is no justification for the House rising until 10 June &ndash; I made that point three weeks ago when the House divided on it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent" hpid="Mr. Sargent Mr. Sargent">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
      <P>Apart from the fact that, overall, the House has sat for only a short number of days since the general election, it is important that we should not have a break next week because of issues that have arisen. I am thinking in particular of the Council of Agriculture Ministers which will meet when the House resumes. Food prices were raised under Standing Order 31 this morning and that issue has to be resolved before the World Trade Organisation negotiations in Cancún in September. This is vital not just for food prices and food quality but also for the livelihoods of many farming families and rural communities. It is nothing short of irresponsible for the House to go on holidays next week and, thus, not debate the CAP reforms in advance of the Agriculture Council. The Government should arrange a sitting next week so that we can debate important issues. While, obviously, we cannot debate them all, this is one that will not wait. It will be too late to do so when we come back on 10 June.</P>

We have been promised legislation from the Minister for Health and Children, which has been promoted in the newspapers and all over the media, to show just how effective the Government is. We now find that the reality is that the Government cannot even tell us when the legislation will be introduced in this House. Either we are talking about spin in the media or we are talking about real Government, which requires real effort and substantial work being done to ensure that legislation is brought to this House, instead of Ministers wandering around the country, making promises and this House being closed down, as it will next week, because the Government has not got its act together and has not got legislation to present to the House to be scrutinised.

There was an article in a newspaper last week which I assume refers to the education for persons with disabilities Bill. However, it had turned into the educational disadvantage Bill. Perhaps the Tánaiste might tell us which Bill will come before the House in the next few weeks? Will it be a watered-down Bill including access to education for all as well as for those suffering from disabilities, or is the latter group to have its own Bill? That issue must be clarified.</P>
      <P>Regarding forthcoming legislation, last year, just before the Bill was taken from the roster, there were major complaints in the Seanad that it had been rushed through at breakneck speed. Will we be given the Bill in good time in the Seanad and the Dáil so that we can analyse it and have some intelligent discourse rather than have to criticise the Government for not having brought it quickly enough? We would rather criticise the Government for the inadequacies of the Bill. However, the Government has had a year to put it together, so we hope that it will not be so inadequate. Perhaps the Tánaiste might tell us if it will come soon and whether we will have enough time?</P>

    <Speaker pid="DamienEnglishFG" hpid="Mr. English Mr. English">
      <NameTxt>Mr. English</NameTxt>
      <P>While I support the Bill I would like it to include further provisions. The question must be asked why we have asylum seekers in the first place and why people want to leave their own countries. Are we doing enough to solve the <Col N="1546" />problems in this regard? If the alliance that went to Iraq, with the help of many governments, to topple a dictator turned its attention to world poverty and inequalities with the same vigour and money that was used in the Middle East, I would not be at all surprised if the numbers seeking asylum started steadily dropping.</P>
      <P>I visited Slovakia recently where there is a major problem concerning the Roma people. Many of those people were leaving Slovakia and seeking asylum in other countries. That is only one example. If attention were turned to looking after those people in their own country, their seeking asylum in other countries would not be an issue. We must ask why these people want to leave their country in the first place and what we, as a country and a European member state, can do to prevent them wanting to do so. The political will to do this does not seem to exist for some reason. I am tempted in regard to Slovakia and many other countries to say that there is not enough oil involved so there is no real political interest, but this makes the case too simple. Political factors always seem to have a bearing.</P>
      <P>That Bob Geldof must return to a famine-ridden Ethiopia 18 years after Live Aid proves this point. Eighteen years ago the world, under the leadership of this great man, said no to famine, but 18 years later we are back to square one. We must use our position on the world stage to champion the need to eliminate poverty worldwide and at home. This would be one of the main ways of addressing the problem of economic refugees.</P>
      <P>I visited Ethiopia last September as part of an Oireachtas delegation. I went AWOL and wandered around by myself and met young people, most of whom, when they found out I was from Ireland and was a member of this Parliament, latched on to me and asked me to find out if there was any way I could get them a permit to live here. That is an example of the position in only one country and while the number of refugees from that country is not a problem here, a similar position prevails in many other countries. I am merely sharing that experience with Members.</P>
      <P>The fortress Europe policy does not work. Of all the countries in the world we, in Ireland, know what famine is and what it can do to people. We should never forget that our families were asylum seekers too when they travelled on the famine ships to seek a life away from the Great Famine in Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the Members and the Minister will bear with me, I want to extend this argument and ask the Government to rethink its asylum policy and include such policy provisions in this Bill. Current Government policies are having a negative effect on our attitude to racism in this country. The system we use to deal with asylum seekers and their entitlements is outdated. It often takes up to two years to process an application and the system involves too much paperwork and is shrouded in a veil of secrecy. This is leading to all non-nationals being classed as refugees who are sponging off the State, which is a dangerous <Col N="1547" />untruth. We need a radical change in this policy now. Perhaps the current policy is simple and transparent but it is not clear to the average person on the street how the Government works in this area &ndash; we need a system which treats everyone fairly and gives hard-hit taxpayers value for their money.</P>
    <P>Apart from this Bill, there seems to be no clear Government policy on this major issue or, if there is, members of Government are not telling anyone about it. Maybe the Government considers the Irish people to be like children and that information on everyday Government business is not our business or is dangerous to our health and so they will try anything, including repealing laws and imposing charges, to stop us from getting at the truth. This, coupled with the Government's unwillingness to take advice on the subject from people who work on the front line dealing with refugees on a daily basis and opting instead to listen to their own, often over-paid, out of touch spin doctors, will lead to a repeat of the problems encountered by our European neighbours. We must learn from the past or else we will repeat its mistakes. Many people from health boards, the Garda Síochána and other sectors have raised concerns with me about how asylum seekers and refugees are dealt with. They do not believe that their concerns are being listened to and although they are passing on their comments, they do not believe they are going up the line. I ask that we broaden our thinking on that issue.</P>
    <P>The direction taken by the Government in dealing with people who arrive here seeking work is wrong. If a job needs doing and if the skill required for it can be provided by a person who wishes for asylum reasons to reside in our country, we should let that person at it and sort out the paperwork later. Such people should be given temporary work permits until their applications are processed or assessed. If we do not have the skilled workers or expertise available in our own workforce, why not allow these people to work on public projects such as the construction or maintenance of road and rail projects such as the Navan-Dublin project or canal? They could do so in return for their keep and a wage to start a new life either here or in their land of origin, depending on the results of their asylum application.</P>
    <P>Many of these people who are waiting for their applications to be dealt with have called to my office during the past year since I was elected to this House although they did not call when I was a councillor. They bring all their paperwork and forms and ask me to help out and to do what I can for them. Many of these people want to and are prepared to work. Three qualified pharmacists called to my office during the year. I work with a pharmacist on the council and he has told me that he cannot get anyone to fill in for him when he wants to take a day off. There is a shortage of pharmacists, yet people who are qualified pharmacists must wait a year or two to be allowed <Col N="1548" />to work or to be sent home. That is a crazy situation and it is bothering people because it is costing us money to keep these people here. The current position is fuelling racism &ndash; racism on the basis of begrudgery, as I call it, rather than racism on the basis of colour.</P>
    <P>Recent Government cutbacks have ensured there will be no shortage of this work available and it will continue to be available until this Government is run out of office. A job completed benefits us all. With so much work needing to be done in this country and with no right thinking person wishing to be idle or out of work for long periods, it is a national scandal and a human tragedy that the system is preventing people from working.</P>
    <P>The reason I asked for more issues to be addressed in this Bill is that a high majority of Irish people believe that the Government's policy on immigrants is to maintain or pay people to do nothing while their paperwork is being processed. That is what the people believe. This is leading Irish citizens to believe, with some justification, that they are being cheated in some way and that the ordinary taxpayer of this country is forking out vast sums of money to keep people in a certain lifestyle. Secrecy in Government will lead to the spread of resentment and mistruth. I say secrecy because the Government is not doing enough to explain the true position to the people. This is very dangerous, as any form of resentment can too easily lead to racism, which is wrong and is a major problem in this country. I come across it every day of the week. I do not know if the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform holds clinics as do other Ministers but, if he does, I am sure he, too, encounters that.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. McDowell Mr. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>I certainly do hold clinics.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DamienEnglishFG" hpid="Mr. English Mr. English">
      <NameTxt>Mr. English</NameTxt>
      <P>I am delighted to hear that. When people call to my clinic seeking assistance, the first thing they say is that if they were from Romania, they would get whatever it is they are seeking. This type of belief must be stamped out. That is not true, but that is what people say because information in this area is not clear and people do not understand the overall Government policy in this area. More should be done in that regard and I thought this Bill might present an opportunity to make it clear what everyone is entitled to.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Conditions for the spread of this attitude can be fostered when people feel hard done by State agencies which they perceive are wasting money. State agencies can be single-minded in their approach &ndash; many do not consider it a priority to keep the taxpayers properly informed regarding the costs of dealing with the large amount of foreign nationals who wish to settle here and do not clearly tell us what each individual who makes a claim for asylum is entitled to and actually receives. Very often they only receive what they are entitled to under European law, the same as <Col N="1549" />any citizen of this country would receive if he or she lived abroad.</P>
    <P>This week the chief executive officer of the North Eastern Health Board went on radio and blamed refugees for the mess in which the health service in my region finds itself. He used the amount of money it is costing to house and look after them as the excuse in that regard. I do not believe he is racist or meant his comments to be interpreted in that way; I am sure he meant to say that such provision has used up billions of euro of the budgetary allocation that was not planned for a few years ago. The way in which his comments were perceived made people very angry and is causing racism. That is of serious concern to me.</P>
    <P>Information is power and so is the lack of it in the wrong hands or the hands of those who are misinformed. We have all heard the stories that asylum seekers receive cars, luxury apartments, large food baskets and special hair treatments paid for by taxpayers through different State bodies and health boards. While the truth of asylum seekers' State entitlements is different, the lack of real Government figures or statements on this allows these fairytale stories to persist and take root. Why is this the case? Is the truth so bad that the Government believes that the people do not deserve or need to hear it? If this situation is allowed to persist, it can only have one conclusion and that will be a sad one for us all &ndash; an increase in racism.</P>
    <P>How the Civil Service and justice system deal with asylum seekers has also become the subject of myth, half truths and damn lies as the absence of real and clear information from the Government persists. Such is the extent of this absence that I am led to believe that some of the good people who work in these institutions are beginning to believe the myths. In some cases this is leading to a perceived imbalance in the form of unfair or special treatment for some. This must cease immediately for the sake of us all.</P>
    <P>We must have an impartial system that does not recognise colour or creed, something that should be the cornerstone of our democracy. The level scales of justice and equality must never be tilted in any direction. As the saying goes, it is not good enough that it be done, it must be seen to be done. I am sure the Minister is happy it is being done, but it must be seen to be done, and that is where the problem lies.</P>
    <P>I blame the lack of Government information and guidelines on this subject. The Government should immediately come clean on the issue and tell us in clear terms what it costs the country to maintain current Government policy, or lack of it, on immigration. It is one of the most pressing issues facing the country. Is the Bill an attempt to hide the cost? If it is, it will not work because change is needed.</P>
    <P>It is clear what the Bill aims to achieve, as is its policy. The Government should adopt other clear precise policies that we can examine and with which we can identify. It should print clear, pre<Col N="1550" />cise and freely available information on what an asylum seeker is entitled to by law under the Irish and European welfare systems when he or she arrives in the country. It should make it clear to the people that not every coloured or non-white person in the country is a refugee but is quite possibly a legal, hard-working student or a tax paying professional adding a great deal to the country and who can quite possibly afford a house, a car, new clothes or a hairstyle. People who can and are willing to work should be allowed to do so. It should be made plain that the same rules apply to nationals and non-nationals alike.</P>
    <P>The Government should break the habit of a lifetime and listen to advice for a change. Let us get real value for money. Will the Minister examine the Bill to see if what I have suggested can be added to it to clarify matters, obtain better value for money for taxpayers and assist the country to be a more moderate, multicultural society, not a racist country into which it is turning rapidly?</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaulNicholasGogartyGP" hpid="Mr. Gogarty Mr. Gogarty">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gogarty</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not an expert on immigration but I was interested in speaking on the Bill in my capacity as tourism spokesperson. One development I have noticed in that role is the reports of different publications about this country. I have already quoted in the Dáil the <i>Lonely Planet</i> guide to Dublin which describes Ireland as a filthy, racist country. Unfortunately, it is becoming increasingly racist and this is partially the fault of the Government through its policies of not promoting a more inclusive society and not having a more sensible view on immigration.</P>
      <P>As I said, I am a beginner when it comes to immigration issues and racism, but sometimes being a beginner means one does not have inherent prejudices. My only inherent prejudice is that I am similar to other Irish people who have racist tendencies, but I try not to have them. Even discriminating positively towards a foreign person is a form of inverse racism. The sooner we treat people, no matter where they are from, as people and recognise their rights, the better.</P>
      <P>The Amnesty International report on this country which was released recently stated that it was concerned about racist violence, harassment of ethnic minorities and the inadequacy of legislation in this area. Amnesty called for an increased, independent monitoring body to investigate and monitor racism and discrimination. There is talk about the establishment of the refugee advisory board, which I welcome, but it does not go far enough.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The report went on to say that for the first time asylum seekers were detained during 2002 under the 1996 Refugee Act. The Garda Síochána detained large numbers of rejected asylum seekers in July and the Government announced plans to increase forcible deportations. In May of last year, the Bill under discussion, which includes provisions to penalise carriers allowing asylum seekers into the country, lapsed because of the <Col N="1551" />general election. It has been reintroduced and is being discussed now.</P>
    <P>My colleague, Deputy Boyle, mentioned the Human Rights Commission in his contribution and its submission to the Joint Committee on Justice, Equality, Defence and Women's Rights on aspects of the Bill. The commission stated in its submission that, with the UNHCR and others working with refugees and asylum seekers, it believed there is a number of areas where the Bill may breach important international protocols, including Article 14 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. Among the points made by the commission were that section 2 of the Bill proposes to penalise transporters bringing in aliens without proper travel documentation or entry permits. The Bill does not foresee any offences related to asylum, but the commission comments on that. I will deal with that later.</P>
    <P>The Bill introduces a number of measures, such as the determination of withdrawal in relation to applicants who have failed to comply with procedural requirements and applicants who have voluntarily withdrawn their applications, determination of refusal to grant refugee status in respect of claims deemed to be withdrawn, allocation of powers of prioritisation of cases to the Refugee Applications Commissioner and the Chairman of the Refugee Appeals Tribunal to speed up the processing of asylum claims, and provision between the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform in consultation with the Department of Foreign Affairs and the UNHCR for the resettlement of mandate refugees.</P>
    <P>The most important point the Human Rights Commission made related to liability of carriers. While carrier sanctions might be a legitimate immigration tool, such measures might also interfere with the ability of persons at risk of persecution to gain access to safety. States that have recourse to carrier sanctions should implement them in a manner consistent with international rights and refugee protection principles, notably, as Deputy Boyle said, Article 14 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights which, as the Minister is no doubt aware, accords each person the right to seek asylum, and Article 31 of the 1951 United Nations refugee convention which recognises that some refugees might enter a country of refuge without proper documentation. Circumstances might prevent them from obtaining valid paperwork before fleeing. Obviously a refugee who is being persecuted does not have his or her paperwork together. He or she is not a tourist but a refugee, and that is something that should be taken into account.</P>
    <P>Article 33 of the convention prohibits states from imposing sanctions on people who are forced to flee serious threats to their lives or liberty and who cannot arrange for passports, visas or other documentation prior to flight. By preventing asylum seekers with inadequate documentation from travelling to Ireland, the Government risks contravening Article 33 of the conven<Col N="1552" />tion which also prohibits the expulsion or <i>refoulement</i> of refugees to situations of danger.</P>
    <P>Amnesty International cautions against the implementation of the main thrust of the Bill &ndash; carrier sanctions &ndash; because such restrictions will only drive asylum seekers into the hands of traffickers and smugglers and will lead to other dangerous modes of transport being used. I would be interested in the Minister's opinion on this if he has not already stated it. Such sanctions, Amnesty states, will not stop people coming to the country.</P>
    <P>We have seen the use of containers which have put the lives of asylum seekers, refugees and economic migrants at risk, and that is precisely because of measures such as those in the Bill. Other EU countries have had similar laws for years and their experience demonstrates that carrier sanctions do not decrease the number of people arriving with improper documentation or hinder the efforts of traffickers and smugglers. If the Government introduces these carrier sanctions, more men, women and children will die in circumstances such as those endured by the Kurds who arrived in Wexford a few years ago. While these people thought they were going to Britain, they tragically ended up in Ireland. These carrier sanctions will only add to the problems.</P>
    <P>Section 2(7) states, &ldquo;A person guilty of an offence under this section shall be liable on summary conviction to a fine of &euro;3,000.&rdquo;  In many cases people will not have any documentation. How will officials be able to tell at source if a person is a refugee or an asylum seeker without giving them a chance to prove that fact? In many cases, people are turned away without being assessed.</P>
    <P>I now want to make some general points about the type of legislation that can be introduced to make Ireland a little less racist. Constituents often comment that refugees or asylum seekers receive a &euro;3,000 social welfare cheque to purchase a car. No matter how much one explains otherwise, the myth is being perpetuated. I raise this point as I hope the media will pick up on this and nail this myth once and for all. The Department has nailed this myth on several occasions and I hope the Minister will help to nail it now. A considerable number of constituents from various social backgrounds believe that favourable treatment is given to people of a darker skin colour. Obviously those with refugee status that have been granted rent allowance have the same entitlements as anyone else and this is as it should be. Asylum seekers do not have the same entitlements.</P>
    <P>There needs to be clarity about the diversity of people from various countries and cultures that are working and studying here and are not trying to defraud the State of its social welfare largesse. I do not know why anyone would want to come here given the lack of progress in the provision of social welfare and education. That is a debate for another day. I suggest that an information campaign be undertaken outlining the diversity <Col N="1553" />that exists in the country and nailing some of the common myths such as those I outlined earlier. One person heard about cheques for purchasing cars from an &ldquo;Auntie Nellie&rdquo; who knew someone working in the social welfare office. This is how racism is perpetuated.</P>
    <P>Racism is also perpetuated by draconian measures such as this which penalise carriers. This will not lead to an increase in the number of genuine refugees coming here or a decrease in those that are less genuine. It will drive the issue underground and lead to more illegal trafficking. In many cases, people who come here do not realise they are coming to Ireland, they just land here. As we have seen, sometimes they are dead when they get here. Does the Minister want more blood on his hands? More clarity needs to be given.</P>
    <P>Another issue that gets on people's goat is the timeframe.</P>

As I said, I am not an expert on immi<Col N="1555" />gration policy. I am an ordinary Deputy from a constituency that has a variety of socio-economic groups. I am retelling what people have said to me. This Bill does nothing to address the issue of processing claims more quickly. Nor does it do anything to ensure that refugees and asylum seekers will come here and be safer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. McDowell Mr. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>Has the Deputy read the Bill?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaulNicholasGogartyGP" hpid="Mr. Gogarty Mr. Gogarty">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gogarty</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes. However, I am not an expert in this area. Deputy Cuffe is an expert in this area and he has already made a statement and proposed amendments. While I cannot be an expert in every aspect of policy, I am an expert on what my constituents are telling me. While my constituents have what they see as genuine fears, these are often fuelled by ignorance. This ignorance needs to be addressed. While the Minister may not have created racist Ireland &ndash; perhaps it was always there waiting for immigrants to come &ndash; it is his responsibility to tackle racism head-on and welcome the increasingly multicultural nature of this society. Perhaps legislation could be changed, in consultation with other Ministers, so that people from outside the EU can come here and work if they so wish. The issue of asylum seekers and refugees is another matter. If a message was sent out that people from outside the EU can come and work here, although not be entitled to social welfare payments, they could fill jobs that are not being filled. Even though the economy is going down the Suwannee thanks to the negative policies of this PD-Fianna Fáil Government, there are jobs that are not being filled because people are not willing to do them. While we already know what Deputy Harney has said about education and a highly-skilled workforce, I will not go into it now.</P>
      <P>The main bone of contention my party has with this Bill relates to carrier liability. Will the Minister propose another Bill to deal with immigrants and asylum seekers in a more positive frame? Is he prepared to get rid of carrier liability given that EU experience has shown that it does nothing to deter trafficking and may lead to more innocent people dying in their attempts to escape persecution? It might also affect economic migrants and one cannot blame them for wanting to come to a rich country like Ireland.</P>
      <P>We need to see some common sense. That is why I asked if the Minister wanted blood on his hands. I can foresee more tragedies involving containers. Rather than telling me off for not being justice spokesperson and not having a thorough knowledge of immigration issues, I would prefer if the Minister would address me as an ordinary Deputy raising views on behalf of his constituents. Perhaps he will try to do something about the inherent racism in this society, as it will affect issues that are in my portfolio. From the point of view of my portfolio, it will affect areas such as tourism and education.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Will the Minister take a positive approach? My <Col N="1556" />colleagues, Deputies Boyle and Cuffe, have already gone into more detail on the Bill. I have reiterated that detail, but it is also important, more generally, that we take a positive approach to tackling racism here.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan" hpid="Mr. Durkan Mr. Durkan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad to have the opportunity of saying a few words on this legislation. Along with a number of people in the House, I hope the debate on immigration, which requires regulation and containment in law, can be dealt with in a civilised manner. We need to be very careful in the House not to give a bad example. I listened to some of the speeches from the Government side in the not too distant past and to say they were inflammatory and racist would be an understatement. I am not pointing my finger at the Minister sitting opposite; I am merely pointing out the seriousness of what we may inadvertently or otherwise lead ourselves into. I hope in the course of the creation of this legislation we will always be extremely careful that nothing we say or do could be seen as a lead towards racism or could encourage the racist tendencies of some people.</P>
      <P>I do not accept that this is a racist nation. It sometimes suits public representatives and other agents to cast themselves as such in order to achieve popularity with certain elements of the electorate. Some of the things I have heard in the House in the past six months have made me feel ashamed that we were participating in a national parliamentary debate on an issue which is highly sensitive and highly charged and is regarded by most people in most countries as an area in which we have to be politically correct. I am not saying we need to go overboard or that we should flood the country with unlimited numbers of undocumented visitors. It is a simple fact of life that we either do the thing according to the rules, or we keep our mouths shut.</P>
      <P>This legislation deals with the question of licensed carriers and penalties. I am not certain that the penalties as proposed will challenge the unfortunate, highly illegal and disgraceful practice by forces outside the State, possibly with the help of some inside the State, of herding innocent people into wagons and bringing them long distances, sometimes with catastrophic results, including, on more than one occasion, loss of life. This has happened not only here but in the UK and in other jurisdictions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I hope the provisions in the Bill will deal with this and will not militate against the victims, but I am not certain they will. It is obvious that mafia types have set up a practice, in Eastern Europe and beyond, whereby they undertake to move unfortunate, poor people to different countries. These people, who have no influence at all, feel that by paying exorbitant amounts of money to a so-called agency, they are investing their money in a good cause and ensuring that the agency will look after them. Nothing could be further from the truth because the only things these people want to look after are their bank accounts and <Col N="1557" />they do not care two pins whether the unfortunate victims come out of the wagons alive. In fact, it would be as easy for them if they did not.</P>
    <P>I know the Minister is fully aware of this appalling practice, which it should be possible to stamp out relatively easily. Putting responsibility on the carriers should help. However, we should not forget that if the organisation responsible for this transportation is big enough, it will take the risk of the penalty and of the carrier being caught. In this context, I hope the Department will engage in ongoing dialogue with its colleagues at the various ports of embarkation. There are a number of very sensitive areas, in Europe and elsewhere, in which we know people are herded together and brought on to containers, only to pop up in Waterford or Swansea. That is one of the things I hope the Minister and his Department have adequately researched and made provision for.</P>
    <P>Section 2(3) states:</P>
    <P>Where a vehicle arrives in the State from a place outside the State the carrier concerned shall, if so requested by an immigration officer, furnish him or her with&ndash;</P>
    <P>(<i>a</i>) a list specifying the name and nationality of each person carried on board the vehicle . . .</P>
    <P>What if the carrier does not mention any people at all? What if he or she is carrying dry goods or tea or anything else? How do we follow that up? We could go back to the source. I am anxious that an effort is made to ensure that wherever there is the possibility in foreign ports of a change in cargo, much time and energy should be put into liaising with the local police, although I fully understand that the local police might not necessarily be the best people to talk to in those circumstances. As we know, some European countries, including some EU countries, have a very laid-back attitude towards the application of the rules when it comes to facilitating transports of illegal immigrants through their jurisdictions. I do not want to mention their names, but I am sure the Minister opposite is fully aware of them. It is well known that even within the EU, not all police forces co-operate to the extent that they should in stamping out organised crime. This section deals with an aspect of organised crime and I hope it is sufficient to meet requirements.</P>
    <P>The question of administration is becoming very difficult. All of us, in the course of our weekly clinics, meet non-nationals who wish to have their visas extended and so on. The sad thing is that many of them have been here for five or six years, yet they are very concerned that they might be asked to leave. In most cases they have jobs and want to hold on to them &ndash; this is an old hobby-horse of mine &ndash; and sometimes they end up going underground because of a fear that should not exist at all. They simply disappear. This is due, incidentally, to the utterances of some public figures. I know there are people who have a tendency to operate underground, but genuine people have also done this, although <Col N="1558" />there was no necessity for them to do so because they were in the State quite legitimately.</P>
    <P>Section 5 deals with the advisory board and the subsequent parts amend section 19(2) of the original. Section 5(<i>b</i>) forbids the publication of material likely to lead members of the public to identify a person as an asylum applicant unless the consent of that person and of the Minister has been obtained. That is a good idea and an important development. As I mentioned earlier &ndash; other Members have mentioned this also &ndash; it may be expedient for a local political person or other public figure to identify, by virtue of his or her colour or name, a person in the locality as a refugee or an asylum seeker. That section could be useful.</P>
    <P>On passports and visas, politicians often spend a great deal of time addressing issues of extensions to visas and so on and the person involved then disappears off the scene for no other reason but that he or she was worried about his or her position or because of something said to them. People in this jurisdiction are also giving advice to non-nationals which is often incorrect. We must be concerned with those legitimately employed here. Telling such people on a Monday morning that they are no longer required and that they should go home is unfair. It is highly unlikely such a person will travel the 5,000 or 6,000 miles required or that he or she could afford to do so.</P>
    <P>Will adequate measures be taken to deal with the abuse of people coming into this jurisdiction by those who are liable or culpable in leading them here? We have already dealt with the issue of carriers. What happens to such people when they arrive here? It is obvious people have been transported here at huge cost by so-called &ldquo;consultants&rdquo;&ndash; everybody is a consultant nowadays &ndash; who are paid particularly well. There is in some jurisdictions, for some unknown reason, a great reverence and respect for people who set themselves up in such a business. People trust them and pay them enormous sums of money on the understanding that everything has been organised for their transportation to a new jurisdiction. Their belief that they need have no worry is the real killer and we are all aware of the consequences in that regard.</P>
    <P>Reference has been made to finger-printing and optical recognition. I am a little worried about heading in that direction. Optical recognition is invasive, insidious and dangerous. I am aware this system operates in many jurisdictions but it is not our way of doing things. I totally reject such a notion and ask that the Minister bear in mind the direction in which we could find ourselves heading if we go down that road. It is worrying that a person's movements can be detected and monitored by virtue of his or her having looked into a particular camera. I, personally, am not concerned about it but many people strenuously object to it. The alleged reason for this is to aid in the fight against modern terrorism. We are being led towards an acceptance of that way of thinking but I hope we do not take that <Col N="1559" />route which could have serious human and civil rights implications.</P>
    <P>Regulation is necessary and laudable. The Bill could be improved upon and I hope the Minister will be amenable to accepting reasonable amendments from the Opposition.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad to have the opportunity to contribute, even for ten minutes, to the debate on this Bill. I have a certain familiarity with the Minister's officials who are aware of my views on this issue from the raft of legislation I dealt with as Opposition spokesperson on justice during the lifetime of the previous Dáil. I am frustrated by the lack of joined-up thinking in the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform each time it comes up with a proposal in this area. I had hoped that a change of Minister would bring about a change of policy but that does not seem to be the case. It is simply more of the same.</P>
      <P>The approach of the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform in all the legislation on this issue has been bitty; it has been one of &ldquo;what is today's issue that needs tweaking?&rdquo;  In all such legislation there has always been, on Committee or Report Stage, a new element bolted on to respond to another pressure point in a crisis. Pressure in this regard has diminished somewhat from that which prevailed in earlier days when the number of asylum seekers here increased from a couple of hundred to several thousands a year. There was an element of panic when the structures were not in place. Now that they are, one would have thought we would have a calmer and more reflective approach to what is one of the most difficult &ndash; I readily acknowledge that &ndash; and thorny social issues facing us as a society.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have repeatedly said in this House that our response in our time here to this new phenomenon will set the character of Ireland into the future. In the beginning, I said there were three separate elements involved which were constantly jumbled up in the approach of the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform. The right thing to do was to separate the three substantial issues and set about a strategic approach to each that was fair, humane, met our international requirements and was unique in terms of Ireland's character. Part of that was an understanding of the need for societal change and an accommodation thereof. The first element related to dealing with asylum seekers. We have, by and large, put in place decent mechanisms to deal with the backlog. My initial proposal was to set a timeframe of six months as the maximum time within which to deal with asylum applications. In order to do so, I proposed, when the backlog stood at 10,000, to give some level of recognition to those already here by introducing a green card system to regularise their situation, reduce the <Col N="1560" />backlog and thereby deal with asylum seekers on a case by case basis. We would not then have the situation which had existed for years where people were coming to Ireland because they knew it would be years before their case would be dealt with and they could well establish themselves and have children here. At that time, Irish law facilitated an application for citizenship for a person born here and residency for his or her parents. I regret that that approach was not accepted.</P>
    <P>By and large, current mechanisms are working reasonably well, at least in the processing stage. I am not sure if the final stage, dealing with deportation, is working as well. I would be interested to hear the current statistics on the number of failed asylum applications which have gone through the entire appeals process and how many people actually leave the jurisdiction by warrant of the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform. I dare say many simply vanish into society, some of whom will go to the United Kingdom and come back here again.</P>
    <P>The second issue relates to immigration. The bulk of people I dealt with &ndash; particularly when Rosslare was used as a gateway for asylum applicants &ndash; were east Europeans from applicant countries wishing to join the European Union and they were, unashamedly, economic migrants. These skilled, competent and able people bluntly told me they could not live in their home country because they could not subsist on the wages available there.</P>
    <P>We have not had a rational immigration strategy. The Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment issued work permits on a bubble basis. They were not attuned to the skills base of people or to a rational, overarching migration and immigration policy that set quotas on a skills basis, such as countries like Canada and Australia implement, and invited applications from potential immigrants. Under such a system people would not have to arrive in Rosslare or Dublin and seek asylum under the Geneva Convention. They could honestly claim to be an economic migrant and apply under that heading. That was never done in a coherent and rational way. Now we see the immigration issue as something that can be turned off when there are economic pressures in the economy. The Tánaiste actually boasts that she can turn off this tap to remove the pressure.</P>
    <P>I regret the lack of an integrated, coherent strategy in the bitty proposals that have come from the Government in the past four or five years. The third element in the strategy I mapped out in the Labour Party document, &ldquo;Ending the Chaos&rdquo;, in November 2000 was the issue of integration and the need for coherent, strategic support for communities which were taken aback by the change in the culture that surrounded them. That is perfectly understandable and not racist. People were fearful of different ethnic practices, language and colour. We needed to address those needs, to be supportive of communities and to provide resources for integration but we did not <Col N="1561" />do that. We paid lip service to it and conducted surveys and analyses but, in essence, nothing else. We allowed ghettos to form in different parts of this city by not providing a proper integrational mechanism. These mistakes were made by other countries decades ago. We could not learn from their mistakes or put in place a strategic approach that met these demands in a coherent way.</P>
    <P>The latest in the raft of proposals in this area is strict carrier liability. Again, it is the approach of those who simply see asylum seekers not as people every developed, free and democratic society has an obligation to respect but rather as a burden we should try to off-load, discourage and keep out of Ireland. If people are genuine asylum seekers, we say &ldquo;Let them get their asylum elsewhere; let us make it as difficult as possible for them to arrive on this little island and thank God it is an island and there are no direct flights from Third World countries.&rdquo;  The rigid implementation of the Dublin Convention means these people will receive asylum status elsewhere. This is part of the same logic which states that we will keep the barriers to Ireland as high as possible, we will give lip service at international fora to the notion of democracy and the rights of the oppressed and asylum seekers but we will not, in a structured way, work proactively to ensure Ireland, a rich and developed country in the 21st century, carries its load.</P>
    <P>I remember the lovely sunny Saturday afternoon when I received a call in my clinic to go down to the business park on the outskirts of Wexford town. In the immediate aftermath of the Kurdish nationals being found, I spoke to the traumatised police officers and, when I went to the hospital, to the health staff who dealt with them. We do not want a recurrence of that and we need to structure our law in a humane way which will, as far as practicable, prevent it.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform is a humane man and his predecessor, as I often said, is also a humane man. The officials who work in this area are good humane people. However, we do not have the joined-up thinking and the structured policy that would constitute a unique, genuine, humane and generous response which would characterise a changed Ireland and redound to our benefit and credit in the years to come.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. McDowell Mr. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. McDowell)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Deputies who participated in this lengthy debate which covered many subjects. A number of contributions, representing varying opinions, went in opposite directions. Deputy Ring, Deputy Gogarty and others, for example, asserted that Ireland is a racist society. I do not believe that. In fact, I assert the opposite and I make common cause with the Deputies, including Deputy Durkan and Deputy Higgins, who contradicted it. Ireland is not a racist society.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Ireland is a society which, as Deputy Howlin pointed out, is confronted with rapid change in <Col N="1562" />circumstances in which it was not accustomed to multiculturalism, immigration and the like. It suddenly found itself sucked into a situation which many of us did not anticipate until it was upon us. However, looking at the streets throughout the country, the way the immigrant populations have assimilated into our community and the general attitudes in public and private discourse, I believe this country has been remarkably free from racism. There have been isolated attacks with a racist motive but people who attack other people and kick them on the ground, people who get drunk and use bottles on other people and people who carry knives with which they threaten others are not usually the most gentle or discerning elements of our population. However, apart from some isolated incidents of racist violence, the vast majority of people who have come here find this country a friendly place and find that the people of this country are well disposed towards them.</P>
    <P>Even those who are reticent about immigration as a phenomenon are generally free from racism as their primary motivation. We have not had race riots, thank God, and I hope we never will. We have not had groups of youths from a community assembling to threaten or use violence on other groups. We have been free of that so let us keep our comments about ourselves in proportion. We have equality laws which are among the most advanced in the world. Ireland cannot be characterised as a racist society.</P>
    <P>Travel guides are free to decide what they wish about Ireland and they can do it from any perspective on the ideological spectrum. If they wish to describe Ireland as a filthy, racist society, they are entitled to do so. We live in a democracy where there is freedom of speech. However, if something appears in print and falls into the hands of Members of the House, it does not mean it is true. This country has had racial issues for a long time. My constituency of Dublin South-East, for example, from the 1890s to the 1970s had a significant Jewish minority and there were racist, anti-Semitic aspects to Irish society when the Jewish community was in its heyday. Unfortunately, in recent times the numbers in the Jewish community in Ireland have declined. It could not be said, however, that Ireland was a racist society or that it was characterised by brutality of the kind seen in other societies which are historically described as racist.</P>
    <P>We have not seen the emergence of a far right party in Irish politics.</P>

      <P>I do not accept that. We have not seen the emergence of people who are campaigning or posturing in a negative way on race issues with any great success. Áine Ní Chonaill's Immigration Control Platform does not seem to be a mass movement and, whether it is due to its inherent organisational problem or whatever, it does not seem to have attracted huge support.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1563" />Our media, for that matter, seem to be multicultural and inclusive in their approach to all these issues. There are very few instances where one can say that Ireland has a media which reflects a racist society. I do not think that is true. I say those things, not out of a sense of complacency&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>Broadly, I would agree that we have been deficient in our assimilation policies, but that is not because this society is racist, it is because this society is struggling to grapple with an unforeseen problem.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>I was going to make the further point that there is a great tendency to ascend moral pulpits, particularly on this issue, and to say that somehow to believe that I have some moral insight into the issue which other unthinking conservative reactionary people do not have, that I understand Third World suffering in a way that other Members of this House do not, that I understand what it is to be &ldquo;a black person&rdquo;, quite frequently, is the tone of voice whereas you do not seem to understand this at all. There is a great sense of moral superiority on these issues. There are people in this House who feel that they alone have some unique insight into the issues which underlie all the public debate here and that they are simply not shared, not experienced, not understood by uncaring Neanderthals on the other side of the debate. That, I believe, is way off the mark. The vast majority of Members of this House and the other House see the problem in all its complexity and see the human side to every single aspect of it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It has been said here that the Government is not doing enough to promote interculturalism, inclusive approaches and the like, but the Government is doing a great deal. It has got to the point where the media are getting tired of the constant efforts that the Government is making to endorse inclusive equality measures and multicultural measures. One would want to see the budget that is expended on this matter. One would want to see the number of occasions Ministers, including myself, attend to promote and give public sanction and support to initiatives being taken at every level in society. One would want to see the resources that are spent on adver<Col N="1564" />tising campaigns, leaflets and voluntary groups &ndash; NGOs &ndash; who are working in this area. Right across the board, huge resources are put into this.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. McDowell Mr. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;not Deputy Howlin &ndash; are confusing migration and asylum seeking, and using the words interchangeably in the course of debate. If we allow ourselves to confuse those two issues, we will make a very serious mistake. <Col N="1565" />Every time I have spoken on this subject, I have emphasised &ndash; I do so again today in response to Deputy Gogarty's invitation &ndash; that the vast majority of people in our community who are not of Irish ethnic extraction and who are of different skin colour or different language to ourselves are here legally and properly, at our invitation, and are playing a very useful role in Irish society They have come here to play a role in our economy, for which we are all grateful and which we value very substantially. The vast majority of foreign people in our country have come here on that basis. I always say that because I always want to make it clear that whenever there are steps to be taken in relation to asylum seeking as a phenomenon, they are not directed at immigrants in our community and they have no relation to them as a group.</P>
      <P>Deputy Gogarty hid behind the suggestion that he was a novice in this area, but it did not inhibit him in the slightest from throwing out wholly unjustified insults to, say, the Minister, Deputy Harney, that her immigration policy was seeking out white Anglo-Saxon Protestants to come to work in this country. Go to any hospital and see if that is true. Go to any take-away and see if it is true. Stand at any check-out in a supermarket and see if it is true. It is a disgrace that people come into this House &ndash; maybe it is constituency envy or something like that &ndash; and imply that the Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment was conducting a migration policy based on a desire to recruit into Ireland white Anglo-Saxon Protestants. The poor Protestants must be even more insulted than anybody else by this.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>There was a look of mock horror and shock on the face of the Deputy when I challenged him on it. It is easy when you are in opposition and you are in your rickety moral pulpit, as he is, to throw out wholly unwarranted assaults on the Tánaiste's motivation in these matters.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">

      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>I refute that kind of lazy-minded, top-of-the-head garbage posing as political debate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Equally the Deputy said here that by introducing carrier liability I would have more blood on my hands, as if I had blood on them in the first place, in this regard. Second, the implication was that if you do what every other member state of the European Union not merely has done but is <Col N="1566" />required by European law to do, which is to introduce carrier liability, you will have blood on your hands. I ask the House, what kind of rhetoric is that. The last time we heard it was from the Deputy's party leader, Deputy Sargent, on the Shannon stopover issue. It is over the top, ridiculous, wholly inflated political rhetoric and it is absurd.</P>
    <P>Nobody has done more than the two Government parties to deal with illicit trafficking in people. We introduced legislation to deal with that issue a couple of years ago and it is being implemented continually. Very considerable Garda resources are going into making sure that people who are trafficking in people and exposing them to this kind of danger do not profit from their wholly immoral trade.</P>
    <P>Deputy Durkan stated that we have to be careful about the civil liberties issues of things we do, and I agree with him. I do not support a national identity card of a mandatory kind because I believe that among the common law countries, and I am a fan of the common law countries&mdash;</P>

It would make the police the enemy rather than the friend of the people. There are privacy issues and civil liberties issues to be considered.</P>
      <P>Deputy Deasy asked why there should be evidence of age cards for people under 21 entering pubs. I remind him that his very simple response to that was to prevent them from drinking at all under the age of 21.</P>

      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I am pleased to bring the Protection of the Environment Bill 2003 before this House following its passage through Seanad Éireann. Other than in a relatively small number of respects, I can reasonably say that the Bill was generally well received in the Seanad. I was struck by the constructive and helpful nature of the contributions of most Senators and I look forward to similar positive engagement in this House. Before turning to the contents of the Bill, I would like to make a few comments on which I think there will be unanimity across the floor of the House.</P>
      <P>Care for our environment is a key responsibility. It is sufficiently important to deserve to transcend party political divisions. This is not just for the sake of environmental excellence &ndash; a vital and laudable end in itself &ndash; but care for our environment is also inextricably linked to the objective of sustainable development. I refer to the idea that we need to achieve the right balance between economic, social and environmental issues so that we can take a comprehensive approach to human welfare and we can work for a better quality of life in all its dimensions. The protection and enhancement of our environment deserves everyone's best attention and commitment for these reasons. We wish to see the most modern and responsive licensing systems put into place, building on the frameworks laid down in the Environmental Protection Agency Act 1992 and the Waste Management Act 1996. We wish to ensure that the polluter pays &ndash; I am speaking literally in this regard. We wish to see people acting positively for our environment, right down to local level. Addressing these matters, with a focus on better environmental implementation and enforcement, is at the heart of this Bill.</P>
      <P>I expect that there will not be unanimity in this House on all the Bill's provisions. This is to be welcomed in some ways as it shows that the Legislature is doing its job properly. I look forward to what I expect will be vigorous debate on aspects of this Bill, especially regarding some of its proposals on waste management. I listened attentively to contributions in the Seanad on waste management, many of which, though not all, were well-considered and measured. I left that House more convinced than ever that progress, as opposed to rhetoric, is essential. We must intensify our provision of the high quality environmental infrastructure the country obviously needs. I refer, in particular, to waste infrastructure. Nobody should be under any illusions about the enormity of the waste management challenges we face. The broadly-based acceptance that we need to make significant progress in the waste management area is reflected in the new partnership agreement, Sustaining Progress, where the social partners have identified waste management as one of the key areas for special focus in the months and years ahead.</P>
      <P>We tend to get into difficulty when it comes to turning the awareness of the need for progress into concrete action on the ground. We no longer have the luxury of dancing around the issues. We all know the mix of waste infrastructure required and the difficult decisions that are needed to deliver this simply have to be taken.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let me refer to the link between care for our environment and the economy. Lack of environmental infrastructure holds a very real threat to our economic future. Potential inward investors need certainty about the environmental regime they will face if they are to commit to this coun<Col N="1571" />try. They need to know how they can deal with the inevitable environmental challenges they will face. Lack of infrastructure is a key threat to investment, with wider implications for jobs, creation of wealth and the level of social services we can deliver. Ultimately, there are potential impacts on the very lives, and livelihoods, of every man, woman and child in Ireland. It is that serious.</P>
    <P>As we embark on our consideration of the Bill, there is a choice to be made about how we deal with it. There is the constructive and responsible route or there is the option that is concerned with short-term political capital. I sincerely hope that we choose the former option. For my part, I will, as I have shown in the Seanad, be open to suggestions which will genuinely improve the provisions of the Bill. The primary aim of the Bill is to complete the transposition into Irish law of the 1996 EU directive on integrated pollution prevention and control, IPPC.</P>
    <P>By way of background, integrated pollution control, IPC, licensing under the Environmental Protection Agency Act 1992 and waste licensing under the Waste Management Act 1996 have been administered by the EPA since 1994 and 1997, respectively. In general, the licensing provisions of both Acts anticipated the provisions of the IPPC directive and have delivered substantial compliance with it.</P>
    <P>After nearly ten years of IPC licensing, 550 licences have been granted and are in force across 13 economic sectors with the potential, unless properly regulated, to cause significant pollution. The licensing system is generally acknowledged to have secured substantial improvement in the environmental performance of the industrial and other activities concerned, for example, reduced emissions to air and water; energy savings; moves to more environment-friendly processes; and lower noise emissions. In the EU context, Ireland was one of the first member states to implement integrated, as opposed to single medium, licensing. This was done in advance of the IPPC directive itself, and to this day we are recognised as among the leaders in this area. Building on the successor to date, the Bill brings national legislation fully into line with the directive by amending the licensing provisions of the Environmental Protection Agency Act 1992 and the Waste Management Act 1996.</P>
    <P>Turning to the amendment of the 1992 Act, a number of the key new provisions arise from the directive. Transposing the directive requires a move from integrated pollution control to integrated pollution prevention and control. This is the fundamental difference between IPC and IPPC. It is not just a new set of words or letters. On the contrary, it reflects the increasing emphasis we are placing on the prevention and minimisation of environmental problems at source rather than on controlling them after they have arisen.</P>
    <P>The key changes to the operation of the licensing system are contained in chapter 2 of Part 2 of <Col N="1572" />the Bill. This contains a single section, section 12, which replaces, in full, Part IV of the 1992 Act. The former sections 82 to 99 of the 1992 Act are being repealed and re-enacted with amendments in revised sections 82 to 99H &ndash; these 26 sections will constitute the core of the new IPPC code.</P>
    <P>The new section 83(5) changes the technical basis of the licensing system from best available technology not entailing excessive costs, BATNEEC, to best available techniques, BAT. Under section 7 of the Bill, BAT is defined as in the directive. The concept of BAT seeks to secure an appropriate balance between necessary environmental protection requirements and what is economically and technically feasible. It represents a process of continuous improvement in environmental performance and, as such, builds on BATNEEC, which was the cornerstone of the licensing requirements in the original 1992 Act.</P>
    <P>Section 83(5) also explicitly requires the efficient use of energy in the carrying on of licensable activities. This is common sense, both for industry in terms of working for the most cost efficient production practices and for the environment as we seek to reduce the adverse impacts of energy use. Section 86 relates to conditions to be attached by EPA to licences. Subsection (1)(<i>a</i>) makes it mandatory to include in licences conditions concerning key issues such as emission limit values; the minimisation of pollution; protection of soil and ground water; and what happens on the ceasing of the activity. While many of these issues are already addressed by the EPA in IPC licences, the Bill copperfastens this practice and, reflecting the terms of the directive, requires the inclusion of such conditions in licences.</P>
    <P>Deputies will wish to note that the inclusion of greenhouse gases in the definition of &ldquo;emission&rdquo; in section 5 will, in conjunction with subsection (1)(<i>b</i>) of section 86, enable the EPA to regulate greenhouse gas emissions in licence conditions. This is a useful additional measure to assist in meeting Ireland's obligations under the Kyoto Protocol. The start-up of emissions trading from 2005 will influence the longer-term use of this provision.</P>
    <P>Section 15 and Schedule 1 to the Bill extend the scope of licensing in light of the directive. While the 1992 Act sought to anticipate the details of the activities to be covered by the licensing regime, the directive as adopted contained some differences. The general approach I have taken in the Bill is to include the activities and thresholds specified in the directive or those already included in the 1992 Act, whichever yields the more demanding standard. I am determined &ndash; I am sure the House will agree &ndash; that we should retain what is best from the controls the Oireachtas put in place ten years ago, which have secured major benefits for the environment, and build on to them further improvements arising from the directive. Areas where the directive brings more activities into the licensing regime include poultry rearing, the <Col N="1573" />treatment and processing of milk, the slaughtering of cattle, the production of food from animal or vegetable raw materials and the production of paper or board.</P>
    <P>There are a number of transitional provisions in the Bill. The new section 82 of the 1992 Act, as inserted by section 12 of the Bill, proposes the following in relation to activities newly licensable by virtue of the directive: new activities will be licensable from the date that the section is commenced; activities which started in the period from 30 October 1999 to the commencement of the section will require to be licensed within six months of commencement or have a licence application submitted within that period &ndash; that date in 1999 is the operative one for the purposes of the directive; and activities which were already in operation on 29 October 1999 will be licensable in the period up to 2007, as provided for in the directive. Licences in force under the 1992 Act will remain in force and will be examined by the EPA for compliance with the directive. The agency will take appropriate action to ensure full compliance, again by 2007. This action can include the carrying out of a review of the licence, amending its conditions or declaring in writing that no further action is required.</P>
    <P>In addition to requirements arising from the IPPC directive, the second main focus of the Bill is to modernise the integrated licensing regime in light of nearly a decade of experience with it. In particular, amendments are proposed which facilitate better implementation and enforcement.</P>
    <P>Section 10 updates the level of penalties available to the courts. The maximum fine on summary conviction is increased from just under &euro;1,300 to &euro;3,000. I was urged to further increase this in the Seanad but the advice available to me from the Attorney General's office was that &euro;3,000 is the highest level to which it can safely go. However, I accepted amendments in the Seanad to increase the daily fine for a continuing offence on summary conviction to &euro;1,000 and the maximum fine for conviction on indictment to &euro;15 million.</P>
    <P>The new section 83(5) introduces a requirement on an applicant for an IPPC licence to be a &ldquo;fit and proper person&rdquo;. This includes being free of a conviction in relation to non-compliance with the IPPC and waste codes, and having the necessary skills and financial resources to carry on the activity in relation to which a licence is sought. I draw the attention of the House to the new sections 94 and 95, which introduce detailed controls in relation to the transfer and surrender of licences.</P>
    <P>In a further provision, the new section 97 allows the EPA to revoke or suspend IPPC licences where the &ldquo;fit and proper person&rdquo; requirements are no longer met and this occurs in such serious circumstances as to warrant this action. Section 99H enables any person to take Circuit Court or High Court proceedings where <Col N="1574" />an activity is being carried on in contravention of the Act. The inclusion of the Circuit Court in the section emerged from the debate on the Bill in the Seanad. In cases under the section, the courts can make such orders as they consider appropriate.</P>
    <P>Taken together, these measures represent a considerable strengthening and modernising of the powers available to the EPA in relation to implementation and enforcement of integrated licensing.</P>
    <P>Turning to the waste elements in Part 3 of the Bill, I am proposing, in addition to requirements arising from the IPPC directive, a number of other important amendments to the Waste Management Acts. Despite the obligation under the 1996 Act to make waste management plans, it was not until the Waste Management (Amendment) Act 2001 was enacted, that proposed regional waste management plans were finally adopted. It provided that making such plans would be an executive function and that the variation and replacement of plans would remain a reserved function, subject to the consent of the relevant city or county manager over an interim period of four years.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
      <P>The focus of local authority efforts since 2001 should have been to ensure the rapid and efficient delivery of the improved services and infrastructure provided for in the plans. To be fair to most authorities, good progress is being made but it appears that some councils are already seeking to review and amend plans, essentially to un-pick their provisions for an integrated waste management infrastructure.</P>
      <P>While I accept that plans need to be kept up to date, I remain strongly of the view that there is no merit in revisiting the foundations on which the plans are based. They have already been fully debated and decided upon. In order to safeguard and build on the progress to date, I propose to provide that the review, variation and replacement of a waste management plan shall also be an executive function for local authority management and, accordingly, section 19 provides for that. There will continue to be full public consultation with regard to any such variation or replacement of plans.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Last year, the issue of local authority waste charges again became contentious during the local authority estimates process. Seeking short-term political advantage some Opposition parties purported to oppose household waste charges, citing various but spurious justifications. The position is very simple, irrespective of who stands where I do today. &ldquo;The polluter pays&rdquo; principle <Col N="1575" />underpins EU environmental policy and legislation and must be applied by member states. Specifically, EU waste legislation requires that households &ndash; and I want to re-emphasise this &ndash; as well as other waste producers, pay for the costs of disposing of their waste. Therefore, household waste charges are mandatory and are here to stay, irrespective of who stands on this side of the House. If I appear to be blunt, it is for the simple reason that these are the facts. If we fail to respect fully &ldquo;the polluter pays&rdquo; principle, we will find ourselves before the European Court of Justice, as we have done on so many occasions. In that forum, a defence based on political expediency would not get us very far. Every Member of this House, and of the Upper House, knows this full well.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ArthurMorganSF" hpid="Mr. Morgan Mr. Morgan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morgan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister should stop trying to make me laugh. He is saying that household waste charges are here to stay only because, as we all know, his is an extremely right-wing Government. That is the only reason.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
      <P>To put our adherence to &ldquo;the polluter pays&rdquo; principle beyond doubt, I propose, in section 35, to insert a new section 75 in the 1996 Act, giving local authorities explicit powers to charge for waste services they provide. This section provides that the making and waiver of such charges shall be an executive function and is intended to facilitate the levying of charges on a &ldquo;per use&rdquo; basis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In section 22 local authorities are being given explicit power to discontinue the collection of domestic waste in the event of non-payment of charges. This addresses the consequences of a 2001 Supreme Court judgment, which found that local authorities currently do not have this right. As a result, local authorities could only seek recovery of unpaid household charges as a nor<Col N="1576" />mal contract debt through the appropriate courts &ndash; a system that is costly, unwieldy and unnecessary. I now propose to allow local authorities to respond in the most direct manner to those who will not pay for services provided.</P>
    <P>Further amendments are proposed to strengthen the 1996 Act in light of experience and to facilitate more effective enforcement and legal action to combat unauthorised waste activity. The main proposals in this regard are in section 21, to introduce a reversal of the burden of proof so that, for the purposes of prosecutions there will be a presumption that the carrying on of an unauthorised waste activity will cause environmental pollution, unless the contrary can be shown. Everyone in the House would welcome that; in section 29, to provide a new power to the EPA to revoke or suspend a waste licence, especially where a licensee can no longer be regarded as a &ldquo;fit and proper person&rdquo; to hold that licence; in sections 31 and 32, to extend to the EPA current local authority powers, enabling steps to be taken for the purpose of preventing or remedying environmental pollution; and in section 33, to provide explicitly for court orders where a waste activity is carried on other than under and in accordance with any requisite authorisation.</P>
    <P>A number of other amendments are proposed including provision in section 25 to empower the EPA to determine that, where a waste activity is carried on in a facility associated with an IPPC licensable activity, a licence under either the 1992 or 1996 Acts, but not both, shall be required, and in section 26, to introduce amended requirements regarding the extent to which the EPA shall have regard to environmental impact statements.</P>
    <P>The strengthened provisions in waste and IPPC law contained in this Bill, underpin my determination to secure appropriate and timely responses to polluting activity. Alongside the Bill, we will put in place an intensified enforcement drive, through the planned office of environmental enforcement, and the Bill will support a number of objectives in that regard.</P>
    <P>The final, substantive part of the Bill, Part 4, gives effect to commitments in the Government's litter action plan to strengthen the law against litter. Section 38 requires that articles or advertisements exhibited in public places include the name and address of the person on whose behalf they are being exhibited. It also prohibits advertising by means of placing items on vehicles. These changes are being introduced more effectively to tackle illegal posters and flyers as particular sources of litter.</P>
    <P>Section 39 allows local authorities to make general anti-litter by-laws for their areas. At present, under litter legislation, local authorities can only make by-laws to prohibit or regulate the distribution of advertising material to the public. That is a significant and important empowerment for local authorities.</P>
    <P>Section 40 increases the fines, and introduces conviction on indictment, for litter offences. In <Col N="1577" />relation to summary convictions, the current fine will be increased from &euro;1,900 to a maximum of &euro;3,000. The section also provides for the introduction of conviction on indictment for litter offences, with a maximum fine of &euro;130,000 and a corresponding maximum fine of &euro;10,000 per day for continuing offences.</P>
    <P>These are the main provisions of the Bill as it currently stands. I would like also at this stage to signal some amendments that I intend to bring forward for consideration on Committee Stage. First, I will propose a significant strengthening of the powers that the Environmental Protection Agency currently has under section 63 of the 1992 Act in relation to its role in ensuring that local authorities can, and do, exercise their environmental responsibilities. The amendments I will propose will serve to further deliver on the commitments in An Agreed Programme for Government to drive forward environmental enforcement and compliance.</P>
    <P>Second, I will make provision for the introduction of a producer responsibility initiative relating to end of life vehicles. This will not only meet our obligations under European law in this regard and allow us to give effect to the initiative agreed with SIMI and the other parties concerned, but it will ensure that we maximise recycling and reuse of the enormous resources that are tied up in scrapped cars. There is also a positive social dimension to getting all of these cars scrapped and recycled.</P>
    <P>Third, planning authorities already have the power to require developers to provide for waste infrastructure associated with housing or commercial developments. Some developers, however, are not addressing this issue in an effective way in their development proposals. Accordingly, I intend to include an amendment in the Bill which will make it mandatory to take account of the need for appropriate facilities for the handling of waste and recyclable waste in housing and commercial developments in future.</P>
    <P>Fourth, I will introduce a range of amendments of a more technical nature, including penalty provisions for businesses that fail to make timely payments to the Revenue Commissioners in respect of the hugely successful plastic bag levy, and further refinements to the IPPC and waste licensing systems.</P>
    <P>I look forward to engaging in more detail on these issues, and on the Bill generally, on Committee Stage. The Bill brings our national legislation fully into line with one of the more important EU instruments for environmental policy &ndash; the IPPC directive. It also proposes to make significant progress in a range of critical areas across the environmental agenda.</P>
    <P>The Protection of the Environment Bill modernises the law governing EPA licensing generally, provides an enhanced focus for the EPA to secure energy efficiency from licensable activities, and enables the agency to regulate greenhouse gas emissions causing climate change. It gives important new powers in the implementation and <Col N="1578" />enforcement of legislation on the environment, and it makes significant changes to the legislative codes relating to litter and, particularly, waste management.</P>
    <P>I commend the Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BernardAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome some parts of this long overdue Bill on which I note the Minister's request to have a balanced and reasonable debate. However, he proceeded to preach to us in a sermon-like way. He inferred the Opposition would be making political capital when he spoke about political expediency. That is a bit rich coming from the Minister and his party because I have in my possession a document indicating that when Cork City Council attempted to embark on a waste recovery and waste separation plan, the Minister for Health and Children, on the day we were making a decision, asked the Fianna Fáil councillors to dump the proposal for a material recovery facility. As a result the proposal, which was a vital cog in the waste management plan of Cork City Council, collapsed. Therefore, it is a bit rich for the Minister and his party to try to lecture us on being politically responsible. When the previous Minister for the Environment and Local Government, Deputy Dempsey, was proposing one plan, the Minister for Health and Children, in order to gain a few hundred votes in a particular area prior to the general election of 2002, proposed dumping the site plan. I had not planned to raise that issue but, since the Minister got involved in cross-political exchanges, I felt he should be answered.</P>
      <P>While Ireland has a reasonably good environment outside of the major growth areas, we must not be complacent. One of the biggest challenges facing this country is the question of waste management. It is against that background the Bill is being introduced to Dáil Éireann. While it is a Protection of the Environment Bill, under that title the Minister is giving powers to managers to impose charges for waste collection and taking this responsibility out of the hands of public representatives. Not only will the legislation empower managers to impose increased waste charges unilaterally, the principle will be to charge householders for their waste by weight. The Minister was quite clear about this in his recent statement in committee. He confirmed that the weight charge would be between &euro;600 and &euro;700 minimum per year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
      <P>What I said was that by moving to charging by weight people can reduce the cost&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BernardAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>It would be between &euro;600 and &euro;700 which is the current charge in some areas. The Minister is effectively removing the powers from the democratically elected local representatives and transferring it to managers who do not have to answer to the public. This year some local authorities were forced to increase their charges by more than 30% because of a serious shortfall <Col N="1579" />in Government funding. The Minister is now bypassing the councillors and giving to managers new powers to slap charges on the public in order to compensate for the serious shortfall in Government funding.</P>
      <P>Since taking office, the Minister, and indeed his predecessor, have spoken time after time about local government reform and strengthening local democracy in the lead-up to the 2004 local elections. The proposals contained in the Bill contradict in a fundamental way his stated goals. The proposals in this Bill and the lack of real local government reform in what is referred to as the dual mandate Bill 2003 &ndash; some call it the Michael Ring Bill &ndash; make a mockery of local democracy and represent a betrayal of the local authorities by making local councillors semi-redundant. The councillors themselves know it and members of the public know it, therefore, the local elections in 2004 are about electing people to bodies whose powers are being stripped because they are being transferred to bureaucrats and to central Government.</P>
      <P>The most recent example was a decision made last Monday in Cork County Hall when the elected representatives of the people decided not to rezone land for an incinerator. However, they will now possibly find themselves overruled by An Bord Pleanála, which does not have to explain to anyone the rationale behind its decision.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
      <P>It does.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BernardAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>It might explain its decisions to the Minister but I have yet to get a real explanation from An Bord Pleanála on the rationale behind its decisions. I have seen many decisions that confounded logic. The noose is slowly but surely tightening around local democracy. Instead of strengthening it, the Minister is choking it to death. He is availing of the protection of the Protection of the Environment Bill to introduce, through his agents locally &ndash; the managers &ndash; new taxes and new penalties on the people of this country. The reality on the ground is that the public will be paying more for fewer services.</P>
      <P>The main purpose of the Bill is to transpose the European Union Integrated Pollution Prevention and Control Directive into Irish law. It proposes also to make amendments to the EPA Act 1992 and the Waste Management Act 1996. The Minister set out in his speech some of the issues involved, therefore I will not repeat them. The Bill also proposes additional amendments to the current IPC licensing regime and provides a statutory basis for incorporating improved ground water protection into that regime. These provisions have been outlined by the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill is being introduced against a background of illegal dumping of commercial waste which is running at up to one million tonnes annually. Someone said to me recently that it is a case of &ldquo;see no evil, hear no evil&rdquo;, but the dump<Col N="1580" />ing goes on. The problem of Ireland's waste will not be dealt with effectively until the Government appoints an overall body to manage the waste question. There is no overall strategy and, in the absence of a strategy, the resultant uncertainty increases the cost of capital, so that Ireland will end up with a more expensive infrastructure. The lack of clear rules increases the risk to companies which wish to get involved in local management because it demands higher returns to justify the capital investment in the sector. There is currently a high level of confusion. There must be leadership at national level because local authorities are currently competing with the private sector for waste contracts. One can see the evidence of national leadership at present when the Minister for the Environment and Local Government proposes one thing and the Minister for Health and Children is saying &ldquo;dump it lads&rdquo; for votes.</P>
    <P>EU directives state that waste should be dealt with close to its source of origin and this directive is not being complied with in many cases. The roles of the local authorities and the Environmental Protection Agency must be clearly spelled out if we wish to have coherence in the waste management sector. The role of local authorities and the health research board, together with An Bord Pleanála, must also be clearly spelled out. As I said already, we had a situation in Cork this week where a decision was made by local county councillors not to contravene the county development plan, but An Bord Pleanála can simply tell them they are wrong. This surely undermines the whole concept of local democracy.</P>
    <P>Against this confused background, illegal dumping of commercial waste is running at up to one million tonnes annually. The illegal dumping scandal is going on unabated, with waste being transferred illegally to Northern Ireland and shipped out of Ireland illegally. An industry source states that illegal disposal of waste is running at between 500,000 to one million tonnes per year. Household and commercial waste in Ireland has increased by more than 60% in five years, with a volume equivalent to 600 kilograms per annum for every person in the State. That statistic is not a figure I made up, it is in the Environmental Protection Agency report, published in late 2002. It is a key indicator of Ireland's performance in relation to environmental protection and an indication of the challenge facing Ireland to deal with one of the key environmental issues.</P>
    <P>On top of that, under our commitment to the Kyoto Protocol to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, which is an international agreement, Ireland will also have to make significant reductions in its greenhouse gas emissions this decade.</P>
    <P>Groundwater supplies in many areas of the country show an unacceptably high level of bacteriological contamination and in some areas are polluted or at risk from agricultural nitrates. Despite what I have said, I believe that Ireland's environment is still generally of a high standard, <Col N="1581" />but it is now under considerable pressure because of economic growth in the last decade. The greatest challenge facing this country is therefore to maintain economic growth and protect our environment at the same time, and that is the issue that we are discussing.</P>
    <P>In only one area have we seen any progress, namely, the reduction in sulphur dioxide emissions. That was due mainly to industry switching to sulphur-free and low-sulphur fuels. In the energy sector, the rate of increase in demand has been less than the rate of economic growth. Greenhouse gas emissions from power plants have not risen as fast as expected because of the increased use of more efficient natural gas rather than oil for electricity generation, but the good news ends there. By the end of 2000, Ireland's greenhouse gas emissions were already 24% higher than in 1990, and, along with dealing with waste, bringing them down to 13% by 2010 is probably the most serious environmental challenge that we now face.</P>
    <P>The pressure on Ireland's environment is increasing faster than in other European countries owing to our rapid economic growth since 1995. Ireland needs a modern waste management infrastructure as well as an integrated, efficient public transport system to address the crisis in those sectors. The five main challenges facing Ireland are: to reduce pollution of inland waters; to protect the urban environment; to control greenhouse gas emissions; to protect our natural resources; and to manage the waste that we produce.</P>
    <P>The best way to deal with waste is, of course, not to produce it in the first place. Only strategic thinkers seem to realise that. Unfortunately, the Minister has not spotted that important strategic issue and therefore has not made it his priority. The Bill does not say much about fundamentally improving our deteriorating treatment of the environment. Provisions for alternative energy sources, recycling facilities and waste-eliminating strategies seem either flimsy or absent altogether.</P>
    <P>The questionable solution being put forward by the Minister is incineration. If we thought we knew all the pollutants produced by incinerating the wide variety of materials included in domestic waste, we would be scientifically naive. Equally, if we knew all the contributors to personal health ailments, including colds, asthma and terminal cancers, we would cut them out completely. However, we do not, and any chemistry teacher will confirm that incinerating something is one of the most radical transformations, with myriad known and probably some unknown by-products.</P>
    <P>It is therefore ironic and confusing on the one hand to have the Minister for Health and Children introducing a ban on smoking in all public establishments on health grounds, while the Minister for the Environment and Local Government appears gung-ho and committed to managing as much waste as possible by incineration, thereby dumping tons of gas by-products into the air that we breathe. It is time to get serious about waste <Col N="1582" />management and the protection of our environment. My party's position is very clear. We should invest in waste minimisation, recycling, composting and in the development of alternative energy sources.</P>

      <P>We should be letting the winds around our coasts feed our energy needs, thereby reducing the quantity of noxious and toxic gases that we breathe into our lungs. That we have a growing waste management crisis has been apparent for some time, but this sad little Government has failed to date to deal with the problem effectively. It produced a strategic plan for the waste sector in 1998, entitled Waste Management: Changing Our Ways. Five years later, there has been little progress but much agreement that the country faces a waste management crisis. As I said, every resident is now producing 60% more waste than in 1995, and of that, only 10% &ndash; it may be a little more &ndash; is now being recycled.</P>

A recent report estimates that the total volume of household, commercial and non-hazardous industrial waste produced in 2002 was 2.8 million tonnes, which is far ahead of previous projections. The regional waste management plans drafted in 1998 were based on assumptions that such a volume would not be reached until 2013. However, a report published in 2002 by Dr. Peter Bacon suggests that the figure could be exceeded much earlier than projected. Two regions, Dublin and Cork, stand out as having particularly acute problems. Deputy Martin's answer to that is to do nothing.</P>
      <P>It is accepted that Ireland is about ten years behind its continental European neighbours in its waste management infrastructure.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>Legislation is one thing and implementation another. It is grand to produce legislation.</P>
      <P>The economic benefits of operating illegally continue to be attractive, and the recent well-publicised discoveries of illegal dumps have pinpointed that growing problem. A major environmental disaster is only around the corner, and its impact will have disastrous effects on agriculture and tourism. Alongside illegal dumping, there is also illegal exporting of waste from this country. A great deal of industrial waste is ending up in Northern Ireland and further afield in Scotland, where landfill rates are on average 50% lower than the charges operating here.</P>
      <P>As far back as the mid 1980s I am on record in the Dáil as saying the lack of a national waste management policy was compromising our attitude to the United Kingdom, for example on Sellafield. We are seriously compromised by our dependence on our European neighbours to accept much of our industrial waste. I also stated that the lack of a national waste management policy would pose a threat to our economic and industrial growth. My view was expressed in this Dáil and the only other person who expressed them in 1998 was Gerard Brady from the Minister's side of the House. This was confirmed by the Forfás report in 2001 entitled Key Waste Management Issues in Ireland. The clear message is that we must change our ways and introduce waste prevention and waste minimisation. Even though these measures will not solve our problem they will contribute to an overall solution.</P>
      <P>Recycling, which will help to reduce the volume of waste requiring treatment or disposal and in this regard Ireland's performance has been, despite a figure of 14%, a bit pathetic because we only recycle less than 8% of our household waste&mdash;</P>

      <P>All of the health implications expressed as recently as today in the <i>British Medical Journal</i> have been investigated and either rejected or confirmed. If incineration is now introduced all other waste treatment programmes will suffer because of the massive investment that will be required in incineration infrastructure. Ireland should resist this lazy and expensive option until all other avenues have been examined and developed. Due to our rapid industrial development since the mid-1990s the nature of our waste has changed dramatically and most products and materials contain a cocktail of chemicals that would be released during incineration with severe consequences for human health and the environment.</P>

The recently published health research board's report which the Minister rubbished raised important issues and questions which must be dealt with before incineration is even considered. I am concerned that as recently as 1 April in this House the Minister seemed to dismiss the health research board's report. Today's disclosures in the <i>British Medical Journal</i> that children born to parents living in the vicinity of incinerators are at a high risk of spina bifida and other serious health problems is alarming.

    <Speaker pid="BernardAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>In many parts of the world incinerators are the largest source of toxic environmental pollutants such as lead, mercury and dioxins. Dioxins which are cancer causing are the most harmful chemicals known to science. In a report published in the 1990s the US environmental protection agency identified medical and municipal waste incinerators as the largest source of dioxin emissions into the environment, being responsible for about 84% of the total dioxin emissions in the United States. In Japan incinerators are estimated to cause 93% of dioxin emissions, in Switzerland 85%, in the UK 79% and in Denmark 71%. It is believed that over 200 toxic or potentially toxic substances can be emitted from the incineration of municipal waste alone, including heavy metals, furans, halogenated organic compounds and a range of other dangerous pollutants. These pollutants cause a variety of health problems, immune and reproductive system defects, respiratory diseases and conditions such as diabetes, hormone disruption and cancers. During incineration new substances are created many of which can be more toxic than those in the original waste. As a result of incineration pollutants are released into the environment in incinerator emissions and in the ash which is then spread into the environment. It is estimated that for every three tonnes of waste that are incinerated one tonne of ash is generated and that ash is usually landfilled or sometimes used in road construction.</P>
      <P>The attitude to incinerators in other countries has changed. At a recent conference that I attended in Philadelphia, with members of the environment committee, I learnt that in the United States alone over 300 proposals for waste incinerators had been defeated or put on hold since 1985. In the Philippines, for example, a national ban on incineration has been in place since 1999.</P>

      <P>In recent times incineration technology has improved. However, that improvement has not stopped all emissions to the atmosphere and the greater the reduction in emissions to the atmosphere the more toxic the residual ash becomes. Does the Minister accept that fact? As was stated at the conference there may be high-tech incinerators but there is no such thing as a non-polluting incinerator. The international attitude to incinerators is changing. The Stockholm convention agreed by over 100 countries in 2001 identified all waste incinerators as primary sources of dioxins, PCBs and furan. Under the treaty, governments have committed to eliminating these and other harmful chemicals and the treaty emphasises the need for other methods of waste management than those which could create dioxins. Is not that correct?</P>

      <P>Multinational vested interests present incinerators as a green energy source. However, recycling saves more energy than incineration. These sources advocate the incineration process as cost effective but this does not stand up to scrutiny. Incinerators, particularly those that have pollution reduction systems installed, are very expensive. Local authorities or regions that invest in incinerators often find they have far less money to invest in more sustainable forms of waste management such as waste minimisation and recycling and therefore incinerators rely on the continued generation of waste to support their high construction and operating costs.</P>
      <P>Incineration costs five to ten times more than land-filling and does not remove the need for landfill because the residual ash from incineration must be deposited.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Incineration is a costly, hazardous and lazy approach to waste management and rather than prevent pollution, it burdens the taxpayer with higher costs, ongoing pollution and environmental damage. We must have a more sustainable approach to the waste management problem and deal with it in a far safer and most cost effective manner. Waste and its management is a challenge, but it should also be looked at as a potential resource that should be recovered and brought back into the economy. Recycling and composting waste is a more sustainable approach <Col N="1589" />to waste management and can reduce costs and create jobs, as most recycling projects would remain in local communities generating local income, if properly managed.</P>
    <P>If we examine the experiences in Canada, Australia and Belgium, successful recycling programmes have brought about reductions of up to 70% in municipal waste. If incineration is pursued as a solution to the waste crisis, Ireland will not be in a position financially to develop the other more acceptable and environmentally friendly waste management options. Therefore, it is incorrect to say those other options can provide a sustainable solution to a national and global problem. Incineration certainly does not provide that solution.</P>
    <P>My party will vigorously resist the attempts by the Minister to further erode the rights of councillors and the powers of local authorities, as contained in provisions in the Bill. This Bill is being used as a vehicle to sneak in another series of stealth taxes by the Minister's agents in the authorities throughout the country. By giving managers the power to impose charges on refuse collections, the Minister will give them the power to review and to amend waste management plans. This is strangling local democracy with another set of centralised decisions.</P>

      <P>If this were budget day, this House would be full of Members anxiously scanning the statement of the Minister for Finance for new taxes or changes in our taxation code. There would not be a seat to be found in the press gallery, as representatives of the fourth estate would examine the statement of the Minister for Finance to see if any new taxes were being proposed which would impact on the people. Proceedings of the House would be broadcast live and people at home would watch and calculate what the impact of the budget would be on their household budget. Tomorrow's papers would be full of all of the examples showing how the tax changes would impact on the annual household budget of Duncan and Mary, the favourite couple of the Minister for Finance to whom he claims to have given so much tax back over the past five or six years.</P>
      <P>However, today is not budget day. It is a Thursday evening before yet another of the &ldquo;Bertie breaks&rdquo; that are now becoming so commonplace in this House, as the Taoiseach uses every public holiday and church festival to flee from the accountability of Dáil Éireann. I can understand well why members of the press and Members of the House might be tempted to treat the Protection of the Environment Bill as yet another routine Bill which goes through this House, a Bill which is transposing an EU directive on emissions licensing, about which there probably will not be a great deal of controversy since presumably everybody is in favour of protecting the environment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>Today is not budget day, but the legislation the Minister for the Environment and Local Government has introduced today will cost the average householder more than any single tax measure introduced on budget day in this House over the past ten years. I estimate from what the Minister has previously told us &ndash; I will deal with this later &ndash; that what this Bill will do is result in levels of household refuse charges of up to &euro;700 per household per annum.</P>
      <P>That measure is being brought in here under the cover of the Protection of the Environment Bill. It is being done in a way that is now becoming quite familiar. Last week when the Minister for Education and Science wanted to reintroduce fees he held up educational disadvantage like the political equivalent of a human shield to cover what he was trying to do. Today the Minister for the Environment and Local Government is doing exactly the same thing with the protection of the environment. Who after all can oppose the protection of the environment? Essentially this legislation which transposes the EU directive on licensing is being used here as political cover by the Minister to bring in by stealth an increased tax on the people. I do not believe there will be a great deal of controversy about this although Members may have some differences about some areas of detail in the Bill when we come to Committee Stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to deal with that in some detail because that will be done in three measures which are being introduced in the Bill. It will be done first, by the transfer of the power to make waste management plans and to levy waste charges from the elected members of local authorities to county managers, the making of that function an executive function rather than a reserved function; second, by giving the councils the power not to collect waste from somebody who has not paid; <Col N="1591" />and, third, under the provisions of section 30 to which I will return.</P>
    <P>The first question is the power to levy refuse charges being made an executive function? It is certainly an undemocratic measure. Elected members of local authorities have gradually in recent years been stripped of many of their functions. The two major functions which elected members of a local authority ended up being left with, in theory, were making of the county development plan and adopting the annual estimate for the local authority. The role of the elected members in making the county development plan has now been greatly undermined and eroded by the provisions of the Planning and Development Act 2000 and the way in which it is being interpreted by some county managers. The power that local authority members had to make and adopt the annual estimate for the local authority area is effectively being interfered with here by a measure which will give to the county manager the power to set and levy the charge for waste collection.</P>
    <P>I could understand why the Minister would want to do that if a significant number of local authorities had failed to adopt their annual estimate as a result of an inability to adopt waste charges, but not a single local authority in any year since waste charges came in has failed to adopt an annual estimate by being unable to adopt a waste charge. Some may have come close to it or may have had a great deal of difficulty. There may have been a great deal of pain in some local authorities as members struggled between levying a charge, the threat of abolition by the Minister and the desirability of keeping a local authority in existence. The fact is that no local authority has failed to adopt an estimate as a result of the charge.</P>
    <P>&nbsp;Why then is this being made an executive function? It cannot be argued that it is because of a failure on the part of the elected members of local authorities to carry out their statutory functions. The reason this measure is being introduced and the power to levy charges is being transferred from elected members to county managers is because the Minister wants these charges increased.</P>
    <P>I cite a piece of evidence for that, namely, the Minister's comments to a meeting of the committee on the environment and local government some months ago. When questioned on this issue, he chastised local authorities for not levying refuse charges which met the full cost of the refuse service. When I asked him what his estimate was for those charges, he said it was &euro;11 per collection. The average household with a black bin collection every week and a monthly collection of recyclable materials has a total of 64 collections a year which comes to &euro;704 on the Minister's calculations.</P>
    <P>That is what this measure is about &ndash; increasing charges for waste collection. The Minister knows it is highly unlikely that he would be able to per<Col N="1592" />suade elected members of a local authority, even those from his side of the House, to go the distance and impose charges of about &euro;700 per household for the collection of waste. That is why he is transferring the power to the county manager.</P>
    <P>That is not all. Section 30 is very interesting. I will go through it in detail because there is bad news in this for the average householder. We need to strip away the camouflage the Minister has introduced about protecting the environment and expose what he is trying to do in the legislation. Section 30(1) states:</P>
    <P>The operator of a landfill facility (other than an internal landfill facility), or such other facility for the disposal of waste as may be prescribed [and so on] shall impose charges in respect of the disposal of waste at the facility.</P>
    <P>In other words, the operator of a waste disposal facility, regardless of whether it is a landfill or incinerator or whether the operator is private or a local authority, will be required to impose charges for the disposal of waste for that facility.</P>
    <P>What order of charges will they be required to make under the Bill? According to section 30(3):</P>
    <P>The amount or amounts of charges imposed . . .  shall be such as the operator of the facility concerned determines is likely to ensure that the result specified in subsection (4) is achieved.</P>
    <P>What is the result specified in subsection (4)? It reads:</P>
    <P>(4) The result referred to . . .  is that the aggregate of the amount of charges imposed by the operator, in relation to the facility concerned, during the relevant period will not be less than the amount that would meet the total of the following costs (irrespective of whether those costs, or any of them, have been or will be met from other financial measures available to the operator), namely&mdash;</P>
    <P>(<i>a</i>)the costs incurred by the operator in the acquisition or development, or both (as the case may be), of the facility,</P>
    <P>(<i>b</i>)the costs of operating the facility during the relevant period (including the costs of making any financial provision under section 53), and</P>
    <P>(<i>c</i>)the estimated costs, during a period of not less than 30 years or such greater period as may be prescribed, of the closure, restoration, remediation or aftercare of the facility.</P>
    <P>This places an obligation on the local authority or private company that has the incinerator or landfill to levy a charge which covers the full cost of buying the site, the capital cost of establishing the facility, the cost of running it and the cost of closure, remediation and management of the site for at least 30 years after the facility is closed.</P>
    <P> The Minister said earlier that he wanted to be <Col N="1593" />blunt. I would like to give him an opportunity of being so. I would like him to tell the House and the people what that cost will be. I believe he and his Department have modelled this for incinerators, landfill and other waste disposal facilities and have totted up the cost of buying the land, establishing the facility, conducting the different studies that must be done in advance, the cost of running the facility and the cost of remediation for 30 years after it has closed. That is a large cost and we need to know what it is. The Bill is transferring that, lock, stock and barrel, to householders, and without taking account of State funding or any subsidy that might be received because the legislation explicitly states that the costs must be met irrespective of whether any of them have been or will be met from other financial measures available to the operator.</P>
    <P>Many householders, to be fair, understand in light of the polluter pays principle, that a cost is associated with having their waste collected, whether it is &euro;150 in some areas, &euro;250 or even close to &euro;300, as it is in my local authority area. They understand that and are prepared to contribute to it. What they need to understand now is that we are not talking about charges of the order of &euro;150, &euro;200 or &euro;300 a year for the collection and disposal of refuse but about substantial household charges. The reason the legislation is before us and this power is being transferred to county managers is to facilitate the increase in those charges.</P>
    <P>For those communities, and there are many, concerned about the health implications of incineration, and Deputy Allen referred to the report in the <i>British Medical Journal</i> which will be disturbing reading for many people in localities where it is proposed to locate incinerators, the Minister will not only impose incinerators on them, he will add cost to the injury. Not only will they have to endure incinerators under the Minister's policy, they will also have to bear the cost of them as well if it is to such facilities their waste is eventually transported.</P>
    <P>The Minister seeks to justify all this by relying on the polluter pays principle. His understanding of the principle and the way he has used it is a distortion. His definition of a polluter is that everyone is a polluter. We all are in some way. However, no attempt is made to attribute proportionate responsibility for pollution between householders and the original producers of the waste in the first place. The legislation is not making the polluter pay but making householders pay for the entire cost of the operation of waste disposal facilities. While many householders are quite happy to pay a proportional contribution to this, to introduce a system where they pay the full cost is quite disproportionate. In any event, it ignores the fact that the average householder has no choice regarding domestic waste. The average householder has no control over the way in which groceries and household goods are presented and packaged or the amount of waste they contain.</P>
    <P>The assumption underpinning &ldquo;the polluter <Col N="1594" />pays&rdquo; principle is that there is an available alternative. The concept of using a charge or environment tax that causes people to change their behaviour is something I support. While the Minister's predecessor has not had many complimentary things said about him recently, he successfully introduced such a tax in the form of the tax on plastic bags. This succeeded in changing the environmental behaviour of people and I acknowledge that it was successful. The way in which charges on waste are imposed here, where everything is charged for, does not encourage a change in environmental behaviour.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not doing this. We all know that recycling must be part of any waste strategy. What is the practice here? People have to pay for the disposal of both their black and green bins. They have to pay for material to be recycled; there is no incentive for recycling. The charging for waste disposal as operated here does not encourage a shift to recycling, nor can it. The Government's strategy has fallen down because of its failure to invest in a recycling infrastructure. The Minister talked about 14% of municipal waste being recycled. While it is recycled, most of it is recycled abroad and that is only the waste that has not ended up in landfill anyway. It is ridiculous.</P>

      <P>Paper goes to the Far East for recycling and Tetra Pak goes to Scotland and our glass bottle company has closed. The little that passes for recycling infrastructure is nothing more than experimental, pilot study or social economy activity. There is no serious recycling infrastructure here and until such time as there is, recycling will not be a realistic option.</P>
      <P>If we are unlucky, we will have had to endure eight or nine years of this Fianna Fáíl-PD Administration by the time its tenure is over. I acknowledge that by the end of this period the Government will have changed the way in which waste is dealt with. However, it is not a change I welcome. The major change that will have been made is one from the management of waste as a public service to the treatment of waste as a commercial business. If one looks at the changes taking place one will see the gradual privatisation of the disposal and management of waste. Deputy Allen spoke about the proposal for the incinerator in Cork and I am sure others will speak about similar proposals elsewhere. Private companies are making all these applications and will operate many of our landfill sites.</P>

      <P>It is not releasing more money for housing. It is taking money from the pockets of householders in the guise of &ldquo;the polluter pays&rdquo; principle. It is really a form of taxation. The Minister has perpetrated a confidence trick on the people. In every budget  the Minister for Finance has told people he is reducing taxes. Now the Minister is introducing legislation that will mean people will have to fork out &euro;700 or &euro;1,000 per year to have their waste collected and treated. This money will be paid to a private company. The commercially operated waste management system the Government is putting in place will last for the next quarter of a century and will be virtually impossible to reverse. It is a mixture of private companies, private incinerators, private landfills, private collection &ndash; if local authorities do this they will have to do so commercially &ndash; and a charging regime that will be administered through county managers.</P>
      <P>Apart from the environmental consequences of this and the cost to householders, it does not make economic sense. Deputy Allen and I attended a conference on waste disposal in Philadelphia some months ago. The technology for dealing with waste is developing and advancing.

      <P>It will lead to additional problems of &ldquo;fly-tipping&rdquo;. It is already leading to illegal incineration. I even see what are called &ldquo;garden incinerators&rdquo; being advertised in garden centres. Householders are encouraged to buy a contraption to put in their back gardens to burn their garden waste.</P>

      <P>Before long they will use them to burn household waste, or people will put it in the fire, and we will end up with a bigger environmental problem than we started out with.</P>
      <P>It is all very well to say that if one does not pay waste charges, waste will not be collected. I might pay my waste charges and my waste will be collected, but if my neighbour decides not to pay his waste charges, storing waste in his garden instead, what will happen then? This cannot be dealt with under the Litter Act because it only applies to litter in public places. It is simply irresponsible to absolve the public authority from taking responsibility for the environmental and health consequences of waste not being presented. If the Minister proceeds with this we will have to come back to it in the future, because we will have problems in neighbourhoods when people try to deal with their waste inappropriately by burning it, resulting in smoke billowing into their neighbours' gardens&mdash;</P>

It is being done in such a way that no resources are being pro<Col N="1597" />vided for it. The Minister is making environmental law, yet he is not providing resources or staff to monitor and enforce it. He is effectively handing over responsibility for good waste management, which the public authorities have traditionally had in this country, to private companies so that they may operate waste management as a commercial business and make the householder pay for it. This legislation will hit the householder in the pocket and it will hit the environment. It is bad legislation and the Labour Party will oppose it.</P>

    <P>I note that the Minister is absenting himself to confer with the County and City Managers' Association and I take offence at that. The Minister may have an answer to this, but our waste policy is being decided by the Minister in solemn conclave with the city and county managers, who have not been elected, have no democratic mandate and are not answerable directly to the people but only to their own councillors. This is a very disturbing trend. The major decisions in our local authorities are not being taken by elected members but by the city and county managers. The substance of this Bill &ndash; and one of its most appalling and draconian aspects &ndash; is to take away the democratic powers of a local authority and hand them to a county or city manager. I regard this as a savage attack on local democracy. <Col N="1598" />To take power from local authorities and councillors is a retrograde step and does not bode well for the future of local democracy.</P>
    <P>Many aspects of the Bill are worth commending. I applaud the mention of greenhouse gases and climate change within the Bill. I look forward to seeing tighter controls and an increase in fines. However, the Bill gives the green light to incineration and creates a permanent democratic deficit. On that substantive issue, my party will oppose the Bill.</P>
    <P>The former Minister for the Environment and Local Government, Deputy Dempsey, introduced a plastic bags levy, albeit many years after the Green Party first proposed it to his predecessors in Government. However, this time last year the Government stood idly by as the Irish Glass Bottle company in Ringsend closed its doors forever. We had a proper recycling facility in the heart of the nation's capital and the Government watched as it closed its doors and its employees joined the dole queues. That incident epitomised this Government's approach to creating employment in recycling and coming up with green initiatives.</P>
    <P>The Government then failed to take up our idea of a beverage container levy. There should be some kind of levy on a litre of milk or a bottle of Coca-Cola to encourage recycling. The Minister is not doing that, so our highways and byways are littered with empty plastic containers and aluminium cans. Why does he not take up our idea and introduce a beverage container levy to encourage recycling? As a child in the early 1970s I remember pulling up empty Cidona bottles from underneath bushes so I could get a shilling or five pence. This encouraged me to recycle. Why does the Minister not introduce this? Why does he not introduce more innovative measures to encourage recycling? It is not rocket science, it is simple enough, and we encourage the Minister to do it.</P>
    <P>When it comes to the environment, we have a huge amount to do. This is the worst country in Europe for climate change emissions. Our greenhouse gases are going off the scale while the Minister stands idly by. He is pumping money into new roads and increasing our climate change emissions. In a couple of years we will face draconian fines from Europe for our failure to tackle climate change seriously. While this Bill mentions the issue, it does nothing to encourage a reduction in climate change emissions.</P>
    <P>There are illegal dumps in the Garden of Ireland. Illegal dumping is continuing and will continue unless something is done about it. While I appreciate that the Minister is setting up an office of environmental enforcement, we need action, not words. Why does the Minister not set up a task force to tackle illegal dumping? Dumps covering hundreds of acres have been illegally placed all over the country, particularly in County Wicklow, and we have yet to see real action taken to combat this or to initiate a clean-up, especially of a particular dump that threatens Dublin's <Col N="1599" />water supply. This is the reality of what is happening to our environment &ndash; huge increases in climate change emissions and illegal dumps left, right and centre. The Minister should tackle this, but we have yet to see action on the ground.</P>
    <P>Within the Bill, there is a separate system for integrated pollution control licensing and the planning system. This system creates an artificial divide in relation to applications for incinerators or new industry. It is confusing to the general public and it confuses the procedure for dealing with the issue because one is making a very artificial distinction between planning and emissions. People find it hard to understand that one deals with the Environmental Protection Agency in respect of one aspect of the application and with the relevant local authority in regard to the other. I am not sure this is the best way to proceed.</P>
    <P>We also believe a separate appeal body should deal with integrated pollution control licences. If one is unhappy with a local authority's decision on planning, one can take the matter up with An Bord Pleanála but if one is unhappy with an integrated pollution control licensing application, the only course of appeal is to the EPA. That is not proper and does not provide an independent voice in adjudicating on the appeal issue. I had hoped this matter would have been dealt with in the Bill. It is not right that the body of appeal is the same one from which one seeks an application in the first instance.</P>
    <P>We also believe the Bill is fundamentally flawed in relation to our approach to incineration of waste. The &ldquo;burn baby burn&rdquo; approach is not the right way to go for Ireland. It threatens our agricultural and tourism industry. In March this year, I spent a week in Switzerland studying its waste management systems. I saw many incinerators and many enlightened approaches to waste management. On the issue of incinerators, they had no monitoring for dioxins on several of the incinerators and admitted in relation to one incinerator that the waste input goes up in flames at least a dozen times a year resulting in their having to call out the local fire brigade. I do not believe their approach to waste management represented the cutting edge of technology, nor, do I believe we should emulate a burn approach to our waste problems.</P>
    <P>This Bill has much smoke and mirrors and has a slight whiff of sulphur in its approach to our waste problems. Several months ago, the Green Party brought before this House a Bill which emphasised a zero waste approach to our waste management problems. It is an idealistic and visionary approach but it is a realistic one. It is based on what has been done in many cities and states in Australia, Canada and around the world. We believe we can tackle waste by proposing zero waste in 15 years time. In the interim, we should emphasise waste reduction, re-use and recycling and should have proper well-managed landfills for the waste created. It is realistic to propose zero waste within a 15 to 20 year timeframe and <Col N="1600" />I believe well-managed, modern landfill is better than incineration. The Minister is reducing democracy here in that people will be faced with high charges and will have their hands tied in relation to altering it.</P>
    <P>The Green Party opposes this Bill. The Minister is going for an end of pipe solution and should charge industry at source. The consumer does not want to buy four apples covered in plastic with a polystyrene base. They want to buy clean, fresh fruit. Why does the Minister not tackle industry and ensure that waste is tackled at source instead of passing the cost on to consumers? My colleague referred to the fact that waste charges may rise to &euro;600 per annum. That is a draconian measure. To insist that waste is collected and that councillors will have no input into policy is not the way forward. The Green Party advocates a zero waste solution and has put its legislation to the House. We are disturbed that the Minister has not put a similar and sustainable solution before the people.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Morgan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is unfortunate the Minister had to leave the House because I would have liked him to hear my sharp contribution. I am sure his expressions would have motivated me a little. That this Bill will destroy local democracy and introduce a new tier of taxation is motivation for any Deputy on this side to get stuck into it.</P>
      <P>This Bill, from the Minister for the Environment and Local Government, Deputy Cullen, is another blow against local democracy. He has already taken that course in previous legislation where he abolished what little democracy was increasing in local government terms. He tore that out, tore it up and probably threw it away. That anti-democratic thrust is what we have been getting from the current Minister for the Environment and Local Government and that is most unfortunate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While the Minister sponsoring this Bill may currently be a member of the Fianna Fáil Party, it is clear from all the features of this document, that he remains ensconced in the right wing, almost &ldquo;McDowellism&rdquo;, of the Progressive Democrats ideology. That is unfortunate for the people of Ireland if not for his current party. This Bill is an attack on local democracy and should not be accepted by anyone. I acknowledge, as other Deputies have, that it contains some good and positive elements such as the strengthening of anti-litter laws and the banning of flight posters. We have all had leaflets stuck under the wipers of our cars and seen other people remove them from their cars and throw them on the ground. That provision is to be welcomed as are the ones dealing with end of life vehicles and the new powers given to the EPA to deal with greenhouse gas emissions. The Bill contains a number of positive features which will go some way towards meeting Sinn Féin policy on these issues. The cornerstone of that positive environmental policy is to set in place a zero waste strategy. That is critical. Unfortunately, the positive features are <Col N="1601" />far outweighed by the anti-democratic elements of this Bill which, if passed, will leave local councillors with virtually no power.</P>
    <P>The Minister made a fundamental mistake in not introducing this Bill prior to the introduction of the Local Government Bill dealing with the abolition of the dual mandate. Members of this House know that if this legislation is passed it will not be worth their while being members of a city or county council because county managers are being given powers to do as they will. There would have been considerably less resistance to the Local Government Bill if that had happened.</P>
    <P>Section 19 amends section 22 of 1986 Act and shifts the power to make waste management plans from councillors, the elected representatives of the people, to county managers. I have a crow to pick with county managers. I sought an explanation from the Minister on an issue relating to an alleged case of bullying by the former county manager in Louth. The Minister told me he could not deal with that matter because it was outside his brief. I then wrote to the Committee of Public Accounts and asked it to investigate the matter only to be told it could not do so. Are county managers a law unto themselves? Can nobody hold them to account? How are people to get to the bottom of the shenanigans in which some county managers are engaged?</P>
    <P>We are shifting powers away from those elected by the people of this State to autocratic people to do as they will in terms of budgetary constraints, levels of charges and so on. That is fundamentally questionable and it is a negative step for this Government to take. It used to be said that if one paid taxation one was entitled to representation &ndash; that was one of the old principles of western democracy. People elect their representatives and they are already paying their taxes but they will have virtually no representation. What function will local authority members have under this legislation? They are powerless. If the county manager imposes charges of up to &euro;1,000 per year for waste collection services, the members can vote for or against it but the manager will impose them anyway.</P>
    <P>Not all backbench Members of the Government parties are in favour of this measure. The Minister said he had received wonderful support for the Bill in the Seanad and that there had been considered and measured contributions to the debate. County and city councils are far more representative than the Seanad of the people and the Minister should consult with members of those councils to find out what they think about this issue. However, Senator Mansergh, former adviser to the Taoiseach, said: &ldquo;I have grave reservations about removing responsibility for service charges from local representatives to the manager. A fundamental principle of western democracy is that there should be no taxation without representation&rdquo;. At least one Member of the Government parties understands the point I make.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1602" />Section 35 introduces a new subsection to section 75 of the 1996 Act and provides for a new explicit power to levy charges on waste services. It gives the county or city manager the power to introduce service charges. Most Members will be aware of the history of this issue. When rates were abolished in 1977, taxation began to rise in almost unquantifiable leaps because that was how local government was to be funded. There was no need for rates because the central Government would pay for local services. This was to be the means of funding local government. However, that did not happen. We have seen the battles that have taken place over the issue of service charges. In 1991, when the former Deputy Padraig Flynn was Minister for the Environment, Waterford City Council was under pressure from the Minister and was refusing to adopt the service charges or the crazy notion that its democracy could be overridden. One of the members of the council, who happened to be a Senator at the time, said he did not believe it would come to that. He said it was a question of nerve and that he had no intention of losing his nerve to Padraig Flynn and his Department. He went on to dare the Minister to appoint a commissioner to replace Waterford's democratically elected representatives. People will be surprised to learn that the person who made those comments is the current Minister for the Environment and Local Government. He was prepared not to lose his nerve on that occasion but his nerve did not survive the cauldron of the right wing Progressive Democrats-led Cabinet. He could not resist the temptation to introduce these service charges.</P>
    <P>This Bill is being sold as a polluter pays measure. It is nothing of the sort. It is about introducing incineration and damaging people's health. It is the wrong approach to take and we need to reverse it. I call on Government backbenchers to resist this measure and defend the people.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeHiggins" hpid="Mr. J. Higgins Mr. J. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I deplore the fact that the Minister for the Environment and Local Government has absented himself. The county and city managers could have waited to hear what the elected Members had to say on Second Stage. I would have liked to have sent the Minister to the county managers with his ears burning about what ordinary people, the taxpayers, feel about this proposal.</P>
      <P>This Bill, according to its Title, is about integrated pollution prevention and control. Everybody agrees with that and many measures in the Bill in that regard would be agreeable. However, the Bill is a trojan horse through which three provisions are introduced which constitute a savage attack on local democracy or what is left of it. It also provides a weapon to impose a new tier of local taxation on ordinary people. The Bill should be rejected out of hand.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 19, which gives the power of review, variation and replacement of a waste management plan to the city or county manager is simply <Col N="1603" />a means of facilitating incineration as a solution to waste disposal. That means privatisation as well, which contradicts the alleged aim of the Minister and the policy of the Department of the Environment and Local Government to reduce the amount of waste going for disposal to incinerators or landfill. Private ownership of waste disposal facilities means there is an incentive to increase the amount of waste rather than reduce it because profits depend on increasing amounts of waste, particularly in the case of incinerators. It will avoid the real solution to waste disposal which is waste reduction, programmes of re-use and recycling.</P>
    <P>Section 35 gives managers the power to set the level of bin charges. Councillors betrayed the people on this issue by introducing bin charges but at least they felt the hot breath of ordinary people and residents and this moderated the amount they were prepared to sanction in terms of the level of the bin tax imposed. Now it is proposed to give this power to unelected officials, who have generous salaries and do not know the struggle many ordinary PAYE workers have to survive. They will relentlessly raise the level of charge and that is the reason the Minister is giving them this power.</P>
    <P> Section 22 gives councils the right not to collect the bins of householders who have not paid the charge. This is a blatant attempt to try to break the widespread resistance to the bin tax and particularly to break the anti-bin tax campaigns in the greater Dublin area, where tens of thousands of households are rejecting this tax and refusing to pay it. The Minister included this provision because he believes he can break those campaigns.</P>
    <P>What is the Minister's real agenda? He hopes to bludgeon householders into an acceptance of the bin tax. He then wants the level of bin taxes increased annually to substantial amounts. The next part of the agenda is an attempt to restore the hated water charges. It is, in other words, the creation of a parallel tier of local taxation which will, in no time, reach &euro;1,000 per household. That is intolerable from the point of view of the ordinary working person, people on moderate to middle incomes and young people currently purchasing homes at the inflated prices developers are demanding as a result of their profiteering in the housing market. It will not be accepted.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Finance and the Government want to be able to come to the House on budget day, make provisions for the Exchequer finances and wash their hands of financing the local authorities and the level of charges set by the local authorities. They want to be able to say it has nothing to do with them. They want the local authorities to become tax levying organisations that are not accountable to the Dáil. The Minister can claim he is not responsible for them. I want to warn the Minister, and I appeal to his officials to take careful note of what I have to say since he is not here himself. The patience of ordinary <Col N="1604" />householders and PAYE workers has run out with this Government. Some 90% believe they were lied to by the Government in the course of the general election campaign. Some 90% believe the Government betrayed them with its raft of extra charges, stealth taxes, cutting away of the first-time buyer's grant and other measures that are hitting hard at the income of ordinary people. If the Minister thinks that this summer he can enact these measures to bludgeon them into submission with this legislation, he should think again.</P>
    <P>I am telling the Minister now, and the councils, that the first day they try to implement the provision of refusing to collect the bins of the decent taxpayers of Dublin or wherever, the campaigns, particularly in Dublin, will be fought on the ground. They will be met by mobilisations of people power and peaceful disobedience. They will not be allowed to enact, and to put into effect, this repressive measure in order to beat and defeat the decent taxpayers, who fund the bulk of the taxation system and the bulk of services and who are not prepared to go back to the bad old days of the 1970s and 1980s when the PAYE man and woman was hammered while multi-millionaires were salting their ill-gotten gains &ndash; in many cases in off-shore accounts. The Ansbacher men were thumbing their noses at the tax-gathering system and the PAYE people were hammered. They are not prepared to go back to that again. It will be resisted. There will be mobilisation in the communities against it and it will not be accepted so the Minister of State, Deputy Gallagher, can tell the Minister that at this stage he would do much better to withdraw these provisions from this legislation and then let the discussion proceed on what is worthwhile in the Bill.</P>
    <P>I absolutely reject this trite slogan of the polluter pays as being applied to the householder, as if the householder was in the same league as a chemical factory, for instance. According to the EPA's last nationwide survey in 1998, households account for only 1.5% of all that is going into landfill. I agree that the percentage can be cut back further. If the Government was to take effective measures to reduce the totally unnecessary and ridiculous packaging in the supermarkets and elsewhere which the householder is forced to take home, then that percentage could be cut back further. Householders are waste receivers, not polluters.</P>
    <P>There are polluters who could subscribe significant resources to beefing up and implementing good waste management practices. Big business corporations, to whom this Government is giving &euro;1 billion this year alone in reductions in corporation tax and in PRSI, could finance many measures as well as huge advances in waste management, waste reduction and recycling programmes.</P>
    <P>There are other polluters at whom we could look. There are stallions in Kildare which produce plenty of pollution on a weekly basis, but their billionaire owners are not hit for a cent of <Col N="1605" />taxation on their activities while the ordinary householder is faced with this kind of measure in an attempt to get more out of them.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister of State, Deputy Gallagher, to tell the Minister for the Environment and Local Government and I invite the Government to take note of that. We will not wait until the local elections next year to sort this out. It will be sorted out if they attempt to bludgeon decent people into submission. We will also carry the battle into the local elections but long before that this issue will be resolved through people saying enough is enough from this Government, that they will not accept this false pretence and attempt at a new taxation system.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnnyBrady" hpid="Mr. J. Brady Mr. J. Brady">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Brady</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to share time with Deputy Kelly.</P>
      <P>I am delighted to have an opportunity to speak on this Bill. The Bill includes proposals on the integrated pollution prevention and control licensing system, new waste management measures and amendments to the Litter Pollution Act 1997.</P>
      <P>Among the measures proposed in the Bill are provision for the revocation or suspension of licences where there are serious breaches of the &ldquo;fit and proper person&rdquo; requirements; increases in fines for breaches of licence provisions; local authorities are being given explicit power to discontinue the collection of domestic waste in the event of non-payment of charges; powers for local authorities to impose, as an executive function, charges for the provision of any waste service; increased litter fines; the variation or replacement of a waste management plan to become an executive function, that is, a matter for local authority managers; and new powers for by-laws covering issues such as the provision and use of supermarket trolleys and placing obligations on businesses to wash the public area outside of their premises.</P>
      <P>The Bill will fully transpose into Irish law the EU Directive on Integrated Pollution Prevention and Control. The Environmental Protection Agency Act 1992 established a strong and successful integrated pollution control licensing system to regulate industrial and other activities with significant polluting potential. Currently, 550 licences are in force.</P>
      <P>The 1992 Act anticipated and implemented most of the requirements of the directive, as well as addressing other environmental policy priorities of national concern. The new Bill makes legislative provision for the remaining elements of the directive and, while some of these are technical in nature, they all contribute to a significantly strengthened regulatory framework for environmental protection. In addition to provisions arising from the directive, the Bill also includes a number of further measures to strengthen the existing IPC licensing system, including in relation to implementation and enforcement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P> Among the key changes to the IPC licensing regime &ndash; now to become IPPC licensing &ndash; intro<Col N="1606" />duced by the Bill are a greater emphasis on pollution prevention and on minimising environmental problems at source; a change in the technical basis of the licensing system from best available technology to best available techniques; an explicit requirement for the inclusion of emission limit values in licences; increased emphasis on energy efficiency in the carrying out of activities; a new power for the EPA to regulate greenhouse gas emissions in IPPC licences; extension of the scope of licensing for the purpose of fully implementing the directive, bringing into the licensing system more activities in areas such as intensive agriculture, the treatment and processing of milk, the slaughter of cattle, food production, and the production of paper, pulp or board; a new provision for an objector to request the EPA to hold an oral hearing in relation to a licence application; a requirement for an applicant to be a &ldquo;fit and proper person&rdquo; as defined in the Bill, including being free from conviction under either the IPPC or waste management codes, and possessing the technical and financial capacity to carry on the business to which the licence relates; provision for revocation or suspension of licences where there are serious breaches of the &ldquo;fit and proper person&rdquo; requirements; a new power for any person to seek a High Court order where an activity is being carried out in contravention of licensing requirements; and increases in fines for breaches of licence provisions, including a maximum fine for summary conviction of &euro;3,000 &ndash; currently £1,000 &ndash; and a daily fine of &euro;600 &ndash; currently £200.</P>
    <P>To ensure that Ireland maximises environmental advantage and gain, the general approach taken in this Bill is to apply the requirements specified in the directive, or those already in place under the 1992 Act, whichever is the higher standard and to build on to them further improvements arising from the directive. In this way, Ireland will remain to the fore in this key area of environmental policy and action.</P>
    <P>In addition to changes due to the IPPC Directive, the Bill introduces a number of other important measures to do with waste management. Among the measures proposed is that the variation or replacement of a waste management plan will become an executive function and a matter for local authority managers.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Brady</NameTxt>
      <P>I have been a member of a local authority for 29 years. We are elected public representatives and we had some very difficult decisions to make in this area over the years. Some of us made those difficult decisions. Unfortunately there are times when some public representatives do not wish to take difficult decisions and that may be the reason for this provision. I would rather see the elected representatives taking these decisions but on occasions they have not taken the decisions, sometimes in the best interests of their county or their area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1607" />This Bill will ensure that regional waste management plans, most of which were only adopted after much deliberation and delay, cannot now be overturned because of short-sighted local considerations. The focus is and must remain on the implementation of these crucially important plans. If we are to avoid a waste crisis, we must pursue these plans vigorously to deliver the integrated infrastructure necessary to maximise waste prevention, re-use and recycle and ensure the environmentally sound disposal of waste that cannot be eliminated or utilised.</P>
    <P>The express provision in waste legislation is that local authorities have powers as an executive function to impose charges for the provision of any waste service, either by themselves or on their behalf.</P>
    <P>The &ldquo;polluter pays&rdquo; principle applies to the collection of waste. If some people pay, I do not see why everybody should not pay. We have all been forced to confront this problem regarding the collection of waste. I am aware of those in the waste business who do a very good job and comply to the letter of the law. Officials have hounded them &ndash; and rightly so &ndash; to ensure that they do a good job. What worries me is that only some people must observe the law. There are people who observe the law but, even in my own county, a few miles away from those who observe the law, others are flouting the law on a daily basis and seem to get away with it. That is not good enough. The people who observe the law do not understand why others seem to get away with it. Will the Minister instruct the county managers and officials of county councils to see that this does not continue and that everyone is treated in the same manner?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this Bill. The Government is committed to an ambitious programme on the environmental agenda. Without a strong framework of rules and regulations, we will not achieve the environmental quality to which we aspire and to which the Government is committed.</P>
      <P>This Bill strengthens the law dealing with those industrial and other activities which have the potential to do the most damage to the environment. It will have an impact on all the key environmental media. It gives an enhanced focus for action by the EPA to secure energy efficiency and to regulate greenhouse gas emissions causing climate change. It contains important new provisions to improve the implementation and enforcement of environmental legislation.</P>
      <P>It contains a number of key issues which the Government regards as essential to further strengthen Ireland's approach to waste management. The Bill is a substantial addition to Ireland's environmental legislation and it signals the Government's determination to ensure that the environment receives the protection it deserves.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill brings national legislation fully into <Col N="1608" />line with the EU directive by amending the licensing provisions of both Acts. In the context of the Environmental Protection Agency Act 1992, there are a number of key new provisions arising from the EU directive. Transposing the directive requires a move from integrated pollution control to integrated pollution prevention and control. This change of wording reflects the increasing emphasis placed on the prevention and minimisation of environmental problems at source rather than on controlling them after they have arisen.</P>
    <P>The EU directive brings more activities into the licensing regime, including poultry rearing, the treatment and processing of milk, the slaughter of cattle, the production of food from animal or vegetable raw materials and the production of paper or board. A focus of the Bill is to modernise the integrated licensing regime in light of the experience of a decade. Amendments are proposed which facilitate better implementation and enforcement.</P>
    <P>Recently, the issue of local authority waste again became contentious. The position is simple. The &ldquo;polluter pays&rdquo; principle underpins European Union environmental policy and legislation and must be applied by member states. Specifically, EU waste legislation requires that households as well as other waste producers pay for the cost of disposal of their waste. Household waste charges are therefore mandatory and are here to stay under Irish and EU law.</P>
    <P>It is up to everybody to minimise waste and to recycle. It is up to us all to keep the cost down. If each individual plays his or her part equally and fairly then the cost will not be big because it will be the polluter who pays. Some people can keep their premises tidy, clean and hygienic and others do not seem to be able to do so.</P>
    <P>Our purpose is to create a proper waste management infrastructure which will be to the benefit of all, including visitors and the tourism industry. Accordingly, the Bill proposes the insertion of a new section into the 1996 Act to give local authorities explicit powers to charge for provision of waste services. The new section provides that the making and waiver of such charges shall be an executive function and is intended to facilitate the levying of charges on a per-use basis.</P>
    <P>In section 22, local authorities are given explicit powers to discontinue the collection of domestic waste in the event of non-payment of charges. This addresses the consequences of the 2001 Supreme Court judgment, which was that local authorities do not have this right at present. As a result, they can only seek recovery of unpaid household charges as a normal contract debt through the appropriate courts, a system that is costly and unwieldy. It is now proposed to allow local authorities to respond in the most direct manner to those who will not pay for the services provided and who expect their neighbours to subsidise them for the collection of their waste.</P>

      <P>Ireland has sought to play a positive and constructive role in the evolution of the European Security and Defence Policy. This inclusive project has been conceived and elaborated with the engagement of all member states, including Ireland, which will continue to participate actively in its ongoing development. With other EU member states, especially the other neutral and non-aligned countries, Ireland has helped to influence the overall parameters within which the European Security and Defence Policy operates by placing an emphasis on the primary role of the UN Security Council for the maintenance of peace and security. This emphasis has been reflected in the conclusions of successive European Council meetings. Conflict prevention has also been at the core of the Union's approach and Ireland has worked to ensure that this important dimension of European Security and Defence Policy is given prominence. I wish to see the continued development of the EU's role in the area of conflict prevention.</P>
      <P>In the military capabilities area, the EU headline goal known as the Rapid Reaction Force provides that the Union should have between 50,000 and 60,000 persons available by the end of this year to undertake the full range of Petersberg Tasks. Ireland is playing a constructive role in contributing to the realisation of this goal. Up to 850 members of the Defence Forces have been committed from within the existing UN standby arrangements system to the pool of capabilities that has been created. Any decision to participate in an individual operation will be a sovereign decision for Ireland. In line with national legislation, such a decision would require a decision of the Government, the approval of the House and UN authorisation for the mission.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Progress is also being made in the civilian area. The Union's civilian crisis management capabilities continue to be developed across the four priority areas addressed at the Feira European Council: policing, the rule of law, civilian administration and civil protection. Concrete targets in each of the four areas have been exceeded through the voluntary commitments of member states and progress continues to be achieved in both conceptual and qualitative aspects. Ireland has worked to encourage a balanced development between the military and non-military aspects of crisis management. It is contributing actively to the development of the Union's civilian crisis management capabilities. Gardaí <Col N="1610" />drawn from the pool of personnel available for international police missions abroad are serving with the EU police mission in Bosnia-Herzegovina. At last December's European Council in Copenhagen, the Union indicated its willingness to lead a follow-on force to the existing SFOR operation in Bosnia-Herzegovina.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Additional Information.</i>Subject to UN authorisation, Ireland hopes to send personnel to the proposed EU-led operation in Bosnia-Herzegovina that may commence in the second half of 2004. Ireland and its EU partners must address the challenge of ensuring that the Union makes an effective contribution for a stable Europe and a more secure and just world. To this end, we will continue to work to influence the development of European Security and Defence Policy in close co-operation with the other Departments involved. I look forward to seeing further progress being made, including during Ireland's Presidency of the EU in first six months of next year.</P>

      <P>Does the Minister agree the handling of Ireland's membership of the Partnership for Peace has caused a lack of confidence among the people? They feel they are not being told the truth about European Security and Defence Policy matters. Being up front with the people from the beginning is the only way to ensure they are properly informed when a referendum takes place following the current negotiations on the Convention on the Future of Europe and to ensure that the referendum is capable of being carried. Does the Minister agree that the fact that we cannot contribute to an EU peacekeeping mission in Macedonia is a rather desperate situation for Ireland to be in? Does he agree that a European common defence is being proposed for the first time? The Amsterdam, Maastricht and Nice treaties said that it may happen, but the current draft treaty says that it will happen. Can the Minister tell the House if he favours Ireland joining such an EU defence entity or staying outside of it?</P>

      <P>On the question of Ireland's participation in the Macedonia mission, it is obvious that the Government can only work within the legislative framework that is available to it. In the Seville declaration, the Government made a political declaration for the purposes of satisfying the people on its position.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P> Given Ireland's foreign policy traditions, it is important that people understand that the negotiating strategy of successive Irish Governments has been to maintain the sovereign decision-making rights, in respect of future participation in this area, of the Government and the Parliament. Other developments, such as those relating to UN mandates, endorsements and authorisations, could not, perhaps, have been anticipated in the legislation of the 1950s. We have had the Brahimi report since then and we are very much conson<Col N="1611" />ant with UN developments. We have to make sure that our legislative framework reflects developments in the UN area. There is no question of ambivalence or ambiguity here. It is a question of being consonant with our foreign policy traditions and recognising the developments that have taken place in respect of UN authorising and mandating.</P>
    <P>I agree that we should ensure that we do not close off opportunities for Irish participation in areas which are totally consistent with our peacekeeping and peace enforcement tradition, such as in East Timor, on the continent of Europe or elsewhere. These issues must be approached rationally and on the basis of what is consistent with UN positions. If a review of our Defence Acts is required to ensure that we are consonant with recent developments, that is something we should approach in an obvious, pro-active and enthusiastic way. The Government and I are open, at all times, to ensuring that we do not close off opportunities for Ireland to participate in peacekeeping missions which are consistent with our traditions. We will make sure that that domestic legislative framework is up to date in respect of how the UN approaches these questions.</P>

      <Quest>the Government's position on control of the Iraqi oil resources and in particular the Government's views on a Security Council resolution which would give control of such resources to the occupying powers; and the arrangements he favours to follow the oil for food programme which is due for renewal in early June 2003.</Quest>
      <QRef>[14988/03]</QRef>
    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government believes the natural resources of Iraq should be returned to the stewardship of the people of Iraq as soon as possible, and that the Iraqi people have the right to determine their own political future. Security Council Resolution 1483, to which the Deputy refers, takes this as its starting point. This resolution also recognises that until the Iraqi people are in a position to exercise these rights, the occupying powers have specific authorities, responsibilities and obligations under international law.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The resolution does not give control of Iraq's oil revenues to the occupying powers. On the contrary, it provides that all export sales shall be made consistent with international market best practices and that this will be independently audited. It also provides that all proceeds from such sales shall be deposited into the development fund for Iraq until such time as an internationally recognised representative government is established by the people of Iraq. The development fund for Iraq will be subject to the scrutiny of an international advisory and monitoring board. Its members will include representatives of the UN Secretary General and the international financial <Col N="1612" />institutions, including the director general of the Arab Fund for Social and Economic Development.</P>
    <P>Therefore the Government is satisfied that under Resolution 1483, sufficient monitoring will be put in place to allow the United Nations and the international community in general to assess the manner in which Iraqi oil revenues are used.</P>
    <P>The oil for food programme was of critical importance to the people of Iraq while Iraq was under economic sanctions. The removal of sanctions on all but military supplies will facilitate both the resumption of normal trade and economic life for the people of Iraq, and the operations of international NGOs. These changes should eventually permit the essential needs of the Iraqi people to be met without recourse to the oil for food programme. Resolution 1483 allows for the programme's phasing out within six months to cover the transitional period and ensure that essential supplies are continued until conditions permit the use of alternative measures.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope the Minister will take the earliest possible opportunity to correct statements made by him, the Taoiseach, the Tánaiste and others, as to the existence of weapons of mass destruction which was invoked as the basis for Ireland's covert and overt support for an illegal war in Iraq.</P>
      <P>I asked about three specific matters in the question. Article 13 of the resolution to which he refers &ndash; 1483 &ndash; states that the funds in the development fund for Iraq should be disbursed at the direction of the authority, in consultation with the Iraqi interim administration, for the purposes set out in the following paragraph. I put it to him that this resolution represents the humiliation of the United Nations. It represents the recognition of the occupying powers. I put it to the Minister that this is far beyond the obligations in the Geneva Convention. The paragraph I refer to gives it the deciding powers in relation to the disbursement of funds from Iraqi oil. Another paragraph suggests that the Iraqi people will pay for the total costs of reconstruction, for the inspections and for the will-o'-the-wisp hunt for weapons of mass destruction. All that will be paid for out of Iraqi oil. That is in the resolution. In regard to the question of security for the delivery of the food programme which I asked about, what will replace the 40,000 odd distribution points for food for the Iraqi people when all the people who have been members of the Ba'ath Party have been eliminated from consideration in distribution? The Minister referred in his reply &ndash; and he is right &ndash; that there is a paragraph winding up the United Nations food distribution programme. I put it to him that having been conned on the basis of an illegal and immoral war he is now being conned in relation to the role of the United Nations. He is also being conned in regard to the structure of humanitarian relief and the pumping, sale and use of Iraqi oil for the Iraqi people.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not accept the assertions made by the Deputy in regard to the rather colloquial phrase about the UN being conned. The UN adopted the resolution in the Security Council, which has the same validity as previous resolutions, including resolution 1441. I do not accept that the United Nations is not involved; in fact, any objective observer would recognise that the role of the UN has been greatly enhanced from the first draft that was put forward by the UK and the US in this matter.</P>
      <P>The development fund for Iraq will be subject to the scrutiny of an international advisory and monitoring board. It will involve representatives of the United Nations Secretary General and the international financial institutions, including the director general of the Arab Fund for Social and Economic Development. Therefore, the assertions that the Deputy has made are not reasonable in the circumstances. I do not accept that the United Nations does not know how to protect its own position in the context of a unanimous resolution, with the exception of Syria which gave a reason for its absence. We have to accept their validity on the basis of their unanimity &ndash; whether we like the contents of resolutions or not.</P>

      <P>As regards the other wider issue to which the Deputy refers, in regard to weapons of mass destruction, in its Resolution 1441 last November, the United Nations Security Council recognised the threat posed to international peace and security by Iraq's weapons of mass destruction. This view was based on the fact that since 1998 Iraq had refused to permit the return of the weapons inspectors with the consequence that they had been unable to fulfil their mandate. Subsequent to this resolution and when faced with the threat of force, Iraq accepted the return of the inspectors. However the degree of co-operation&mdash;</P>

      <P>It is an important point. However, the degree of co-operation which Iraq extended to the inspectors was described by them as, less than full. The reports of the inspectors made it clear that many questions remained unanswered about Iraq's holdings of weapons of mass destruction. Whether weapons of mass destruction are discovered in Iraq will not alter the fact that the mandate of the arms inspectors remained unfulfilled at the time of the US-led invasion.</P>

    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government's position on security and defence issues has been clearly stated at the convention, having been reflected in the proposed amendments to the draft treaty articles brought forward by the Government's representative to the convention, the Minister of State, Deputy Roche.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is already provision for a possible European Union common defence in the current <Col N="1616" />treaty. Such a decision would be a matter for the European Council acting unanimously and member states in accordance with their respective constitutional requirements. The possibility of a common defence has been agreed by the people on three successive occasions in their decisions to approve the ratification of the Maastricht, Amsterdam and Nice treaties.</P>
    <P>The article of the draft constitutional treaty, proposed by the Presidium of the convention, and to which Deputy Gormley refers, proposes &ldquo;closer co-operation&rdquo;, on an optional basis, in the area of mutual defence. Under this proposal, a member state which opts to participate in this arrangement and is the victim of armed aggression on its territory would be able to request aid and assistance from other participating states. Participation would be optional; member states opting not to participate in this arrangement would be under no obligation arising from it.</P>
    <P>This proposal for &ldquo;closer co-operation&rdquo; as regards mutual defence, as well as some of the other proposals which the Presidium of the convention has brought forward in the security and defence area, have provoked a substantial amount of opposition within the convention. Reservations have been expressed not only by neutral and non-aligned countries, including Ireland, but also by some EU partners who see their security and defence requirements being best and satisfactorily met through their membership of NATO.</P>
    <P>The draft treaty articles in the security and defence area remain the subject of deliberation at the convention. There will undoubtedly be further debate on these issues in the convention and, most likely, the subsequent intergovernmental conference, before any final decisions emerge.</P>
    <P>In accordance with the amendment to the Constitution, approved by the people by referendum in October last year, Ireland cannot adopt a decision taken by the European Council to establish a common defence where that common defence would include the State. Specific reference is made in the amendment to the relevant provision of the Treaty of Nice.</P>
    <P>While a formal decision will only be taken when a new treaty has been negotiated, it is clearly highly likely that a further referendum will be required for Ireland to ratify the treaty. Should the existing provision on common defence be amended or added to in any way, the Government would obviously have to take this into account in framing the proposal it puts to the people, in line with the substance and spirit of the recent constitutional amendment.</P>
    <P>In summary, there is no question of the Government agreeing to Ireland's participation in a mutual defence commitment, other than with the approval of the people expressed in a referendum.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnGormley" hpid="Mr. Gormley Mr. Gormley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gormley</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for his reply <Col N="1617" />and wish him well when it comes to the Intergovernmental Conference. However, if the present wording stands, it would be completely unacceptable to my party. The constitutional amendment on the Nice treaty states clearly, &ldquo;The State shall not adopt a decision taken by the European Council to establish a common defence pursuant to Article 1.2 of the treaty referred to in subsection (7) of this section, where the common defence would include the State&rdquo;. The Minister has just quoted part of this.</P>
      <P>Referring to Article 30.7, although the numbering has since been changed to 1/40, the second paragraph states clearly that the common security and defence policy should include the progressive framing of a common Union defence policy. As Deputy Gay Mitchell has pointed out, this would lead to a common defence when the European Council, acting unanimously, so decided. Point seven is the crux of this, if the Minister will bear with me. It is very legalistic and technical but it is important because it refers to closer co-operation. It states&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gormley</NameTxt>
      <P>All right, I will ask a question. Is it not the case that we are talking about closer co-operation, which involves mutual defence? As it stands, this does not require a referendum. If the wording stands and we do not manage to delete or reform it in any way &ndash; the Minister has said others have misgivings about this &ndash; I am afraid it does not require a referendum. Therefore, Ireland could participate in closer co-operation which involves mutual defence. My reading of it is that it does not require a referendum.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy knows, having been a member of the defence policy working group in the convention, we are in a consultative phase prior to an Intergovernmental Conference. Unless we finalise the arrangements and the texts, it is hard to be definitive but I would make the following point, in order to be helpful to the Deputy. It is clear that we cannot enter a common defence without a referendum. Therefore, that would require a formal decision at the European Council, probably beyond foreign affairs level. As regards our negotiating strategy &ndash; I mentioned this in response to Deputy Gay Mitchell's priority question &ndash; we must retain discretion, as a matter for Government and Parliament, as to whether we engage in areas of defence co-operation. In other words, we will retain that discretion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That being the case &ndash; I made this point when I addressed the Institute of European Affairs &ndash; if we can retain national discretion in our negotiating strategy, I suggest we will not be in a position where there are other foreign policy traditions within the European Union who wish to consider how they want to proceed with what is, I agree, beyond enhanced co-operation to closer <Col N="1618" />co-operation, short of common defence. Therefore, we have an issue with the common defence position.</P>
    <P>As we are still in a negotiating phase, I do not want to be definitive but whatever arrangements are agreed on Union policy, I would like to see a situation whereby any effort by a group within the European Union would be subject to full Union scrutiny or mandate at the General Affairs and External Relations Council. Given that the situation is evolving, as the Deputy realises, that is the best answer I can give him at this stage.</P>

      <Quest>if he has raised with the British Government allegations that an agent known as Stakeknife operated on both sides of the Border; and the current state of implementation of the Good Friday Agreement.</Quest>

    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>The allegations regarding the activities of the agent known as Stakeknife are a matter of deep concern to all of us who believe in accountability and the rule of law. Accompanied as they were by disturbing <Col N="1619" />accounts of kidnapping, torture and murder, they are particularly distressing to the families of victims named in the course of the very extensive media coverage. However, there is a need to proceed cautiously. The reputations of a number of individuals, confidence in the rule of law and the memory of loved ones lost in the conflict are all affected by these allegations and their veracity. They remain allegations. There are no facts issued by an authoritative source on which any judgment, much less action, can be based. The individual named in the press as Stakeknife has publicly rebutted the allegations and is considering legal action.</P>
      <P>The allegations concerning the Stakeknife affair have not arisen in a vacuum. Allegations about the role of agents and their handlers in various intelligence branches of the security services featured strongly in the case of the late Pat Finucane. The Government's conviction on the need for a public inquiry in that case was strengthened by the findings of Stevens III, that there was collusion between elements of the security services and loyalist paramilitaries.</P>
      <P>Sir John Stevens reported that murders could have been prevented and were not. He sought to determine whether both sides of the community were dealt with in equal measure by the RUC and found that they were not. Judge Peter Cory, formerly of the Supreme Court of Canada, was appointed by both Governments to investigate six cases of public concern. He has completed his work on the Finucane, Hamill and Wright cases and he expects to have finished the three remaining reports later this year. The two Governments have agreed that, in the event of a public inquiry being recommended in any case, the relevant Government will implement that recommendation.</P>
      <P>Given the general context of allegations regarding the activities of intelligence agencies and their informants, the Government is right to be concerned with these further and very disturbing allegations. I set out our concerns, including allegations against British military intelligence operations in our jurisdiction, to the Secretary of State last week at the British-Irish Intergovernmental Conference. It is imperative that both Governments be in a position to give assurance to the community that these issues can and will be dealt with in an appropriate and effective manner.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <i>Additional information.</i>As co-guarantor of the Good Friday Agreement, we want to see the agreement implemented in full. Progress has been made in key areas such as policing, criminal justice, security normalisation, human rights, equality and North-South co-operation. The Joint Declaration by the two Governments on 1 May is both a comprehensive audit of the progress made under the Agreement and a blueprint for the implementation of its out<Col N="1620" />standing aspects. Progress politically has stalled, but we are determined that the current impasse be resolved. The key to progress is holding elections to a new Assembly.</P>
    <P>In the context of so many disturbing allegations that undermine confidence in the administration of justice, it is all the more important to establish the primacy of politics and local accountability. It is essential that politics remain the driving force of this process and that the people understand our determination to make this so. Only through politics will we see the fair society envisaged by the Good Friday Agreement fully realised.</P>

      <P>I do not know whether the person named is Stakeknife. I do not intend to refer to that person because I have no evidence, one way or other, with regard to whether he is Stakeknife. In any event, that is not the issue.</P>
      <P>Will the Minister indicate whether he has been able to independently verify, from our own security sources, that an agent named Stakeknife existed and was licensed, so to speak, by British security sources to operate North and South of the Border in the way that has been alleged? The Minister stated that he raised this matter recently with the Secretary of State. Will he relate to us the response of the Secretary of State? The Taoiseach indicated that there was not much point in raising this issue with the British Prime Minister because he knew the sort of reply he would receive. What reply did the Minister receive?</P>
      <P>Does the Minister agree that, since there is evidence of collusion with loyalist paramilitaries, it would not be surprising to see this sort of collusion with so-called republican paramilitaries? That an allegation that a foreign Government, or agents acting on its behalf, authorised or licensed a person to take life or to be involved in terrorist incidents, North and South of the Border, should not be responded to is not acceptable. It is a most serious breach of our sovereignty and a most serious allegation in respect of the murder of innocent people. What did the Minister say to the Secretary of State and what reply did he receive? What steps will he take to pursue the matter further?</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>In regard to intelligence services generally, the Deputy will be aware, in light of his previous experience in the Department, that the culture of secrecy is very much part of their work. States have a responsibility to ensure that anyone who acts illegally on their behalf must be dealt with by due process of law. That is the standard states set for themselves, regardless of standards that may be set by others. That general point would, therefore, be strongly made by the Government in respect of these matters.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As stated during the debate on Northern Ireland earlier this week, we cannot seek to chart a future predicated on agreement on the past because, unfortunately, people disagree about the past. However, investigations conducted by State agencies &ndash; such as Stevens, Judge Cory and <Col N="1621" />others &ndash; highlight the need to restore public confidence in the future and provide the context in which issues of collusion and illegal actions should be addressed. In the past, we have dealt with issues of this nature based on evidence that held up in court, by way of individual prosecution, or, where a wider confidence issue arose for the State, by way of public inquiry.</P>
    <P>In respect of cases being investigated under the Weston Park arrangements and agreements with the British Government, successive Governments have been quite firm that anything resulting from such investigations, which should provide a context in which the confidence necessary for the future, will be dealt with appropriately and extensively by way of public inquiry. We retain that position and we are prepared to await Judge Peter Cory's recommendations with regard to cases which are, in some respects, deeply controversial in both the Nationalist and Unionist communities. There are 1,500 unresolved murder cases as a result of the conflict. Unfortunately, given the length of time that has elapsed, the prospect of successful individual prosecutions recedes as time goes on.</P>
    <P>In bringing closure to these questions, the Weston Park agreement remains the template by which these issues should be dealt with following the recommendations of an eminent international jurist.</P>

      <Quest>if he will make special financial provision to help organisations in view of the funding shortfall for voluntary organisations in 2003 which deal with emigrants in the UK; if he is fully committed to the implementation of the recommendations made by the task force on emigrants; if he will report on the stage of implementation of its recommendations; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>
      <QRef>[14989/03]</QRef>
    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>The task force on policy regarding emigrants was established in December 2001, on foot of a commitment in the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness, to address the special needs of those Irish emigrants abroad who are particularly marginalised or at greatest risk of exclusion. The purpose of the task force was to develop a coherent, long-term approach to our emigrants and their needs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The task force presented its report to me at the end of August 2002. It contains many wide-ranging and far-reaching proposals and I am deeply appreciative of the work of the task force. Many of the recommendations require additional resources, but they also call for a new attitude to emigration and a new culture of communication and co-operation on the part of all those concerned in official and voluntary agencies. The task force has set the question of emigration in a modern context and provided a template for a new approach to meeting the needs of our emi<Col N="1622" />grants abroad, particularly those who are most vulnerable and disadvantaged.</P>
    <P>Last October, I established an interdepartmental working group to consider the recommendations of the task force with a view to the submission to Government of proposals for future action. I regret that, because of the budgetary situation this year, it was not possible to secure additional resources for services to emigrants. The new social partnership agreement, Sustaining Progress &ndash; the successor to the PPF &ndash; contains a chapter on special initiatives which will be addressed during the lifetime of the programme. One of these initiatives is migration and interculturalism and, included under this heading, is a provision, arising from the conclusions and recommendations of the task force, for the development of a coherent set of initiatives in consultation with the relevant interests. The arrangements for carrying out this work are being developed at present and will help provide a mechanism for advancing the implementation of the task force's report.</P>
    <P>With regard to the DION fund, which provides financial support for voluntary agencies that assist Irish emigrants in the UK, the position is that the responsibility for the fund was transferred to my Department from the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment on 5 February 2003. This was in line with a recommendation of the task force on policy regarding emigrants, which proposed that all Government funding for emigrant services should be brought together under the Vote for Foreign Affairs. I am pleased that we were able to quickly make this important structural change. While the DION fund for this year, at &euro;2.573 million, is 5% less than the figure for 2002, the appreciation in the value of the euro since then means that the sterling value of the fund will be maintained in 2003.</P>
    <P>I take this opportunity to express my appreciation to all those in the UK, and further afield, who work so hard on behalf of Irish emigrants, particularly the vulnerable and the elderly.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JerryCowleyIND" hpid="Dr. Cowley Dr. Cowley">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Cowley</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for his comprehensive reply. The report, which has been sought for a long time, is welcome. However, I regret that it is gathering dust. I appreciate the help the Government is giving to emigrants. Safe-Home, the National Repatriation Centre, has repatriated 130 people, thanks to help from the Government, the Tánaiste and DION. However, what is happening is cruel.</P>
      <P>The Minister said that DION would contribute more than &euro;2 million.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The report suggested, for what it said were very sound reasons, that all that money had been sent home in the shape of immigrants' remittances. At a time when we had no money in this country, those were the people who helped us. To say now that we cannot help them for economic reasons is cruel in the highest order. Some &euro;11 million was to have been given in 2003, building up to &euro;21 million in 2005. Would the Minister even consider <Col N="1623" />granting some of those recommendations, such as free travel, during the short time that the emigrants will be at home? The overseas agencies are doing very good work, as the Minister is aware. I know that he appreciates it. At the same time, he said there had been a reduction in their funding granted on the sterling equivalent. Would he not even consider those two recommendations covering free travel and the overseas agency? Does he not find it cruel that they are being left without the funds promised to them? They never pleaded the poor mouth with us, so why should we do so with them?</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>I recognise the very genuine, practical and progressive approach that Deputy Cowley has taken during his involvement in this matter, and I commend him for it. It was not a question of people being promised anything. I told the task force to go away and, without reference to me or budgetary parameters, put forward what it felt would be the optimum way to proceed. I told it to be free in its recommendations. I made it clear that I was not trying to tie it into my own budgetary constraints.</P>
      <P>Rightly and predictably, the task force came forward with quite specific and ambitious proposals dealing with the immediate future quite apart from longer-term issues. I have no problem with that, for its job was to put forward the best possible case for services to emigrants. I appreciate that and respect its work. Incidentally, I am very glad to hear when I go to the United States and elsewhere the appreciative words for the committee who went to listen to what emigrant groups have to say. It was the first time that they had been asked about their requirements.</P>
      <P>The important issue that came out of the taskforce was that we should all recognise that the stereotypical view of the 1950s and 1960s emigrant is no longer the reality, though there are unfortunately people of that era who require our help and whom I would genuinely like to help in future. I must work within realistic budgetary constraints. The taskforce served the very important purpose of helping us update our understanding of emigrants' problems so that we do not simply have a stereotypical view inherited from the past. The Deputy mentioned some practical approaches, and I am very open to any initiatives as part of our efforts. I will have to examine them in the context of future Estimates debates with the Department of Finance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I make the important point, as I did when the task force handed me the report, that the timing of its production was such that it had bypassed the Estimates process for this year and that it was not possible to rejig the situation at that stage. I also made the point to it quite honestly and openly that, while I very much respected its very ambitious programme for the future, I did not see how I could move from the current level of support to its projected level so quickly or so soon, and I feel it accepts that. Its job was to <Col N="1624" />give me its optimum position for me to work with and to proceed as quickly as possible. In an ideal world, we would all move far more quickly than usual.</P>
    <P>We have a template for the future, an up-to-date, interactive report that dealt with emigrant groups abroad and those who have concerns at home. I respect all the task force's members, who compiled a good report. I do not intend for it to gather dust, but it would also be very unrealistic to think that it could be implemented immediately, given the increased level of resources that it sought so soon after its publication. I made that point very clear to it when it gave it to me. They were honest with me about what it saw as the required levels of support, and I was honest in return about what I could do in the immediate future.</P>
    <P>The report's value is not just short-term, but also medium and long-term. It will form part of my future discussions, as will suggestions from Deputy Cowley and others in the House who have practical initiatives which would not entail mind-blowing expenditure. They will be incorporated into my discussions with the Department of Finance as we prepare for the next financial year. To say that we do not have the sort of money being spoken of in 2003 means no resiling on the part of this or any future Government but a question of recognising how far we must travel to meet a modern country's requirements in its response.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment and Local Government (Mr. Cullen)</NameTxt>
      <P>I have only today become aware of the report referred to in these questions. Deputies will appreciate that my Department has not had an opportunity to study it in detail and therefore is not in a position to respond definitively at this stage. I will make a number of points arising out of this report but before I do will first place the matter in context. In August 2001 my predecessor commissioned the health research board to commission a study to provide an objective and expert analysis of information regarding the likely effects of landfill and thermal treatment activities on public health and the environment. The report was published by the HRB last February and I welcomed it as a lengthy and detailed body of work which merits careful consideration. I have indicated that I will make a fuller statement on the report once my Department's consideration of it, which will involve the Environmental Protection Agency <Col N="1626" />and the Department of Health and Children, is completed.</P>
      <P>In addressing the health effects of landfilling and the incineration of waste the HRB report referenced more than 120 studies or assessments. The report referred to in the Deputies' questions was not among these. Having taken account of all these reports the report came to the view that while incinerator emissions have been associated with respiratory symptoms this may not have been a causal factor noting that incinerators have tended to be located in industrial areas. In addition, the report concluded that evidence of association with other potential health effects is also inconclusive. The report was careful to point out that almost all of the available research relates to old facilities whereas new facilities would have to comply with much more stringent environmental and operational standards. Accordingly, the performance of older facilities is not directly comparable with that of new designs.</P>
      <P>Turning now to the study which was referred to in media reports this morning I understand the study's objective was to investigate the risk of still births, neonatal death and lethal congenital abnormality among babies of mothers living close to incinerators and crematoria in Cumbria, north west England, in the period 1956 to 1993. I will examine this study carefully. At this point, while I am reluctant to pick out particular parts of the study for comment, there are a number of points which need to be put on record. First, it should be noted that the study's authors have indicated that they cannot infer a causal effect from the statistical associations reported in their work. This is similar to the conclusion reached in the HRB report and as in that report the need for further study is highlighted. Second, they warned that their findings need to be interpreted cautiously. Third, the study period, in so far as incinerators are concerned, stretches back over 30 years. Mass burn incinerators as they were and as they are today are like chalk and cheese. I propose therefore to have appropriate consideration given to the study alongside consideration of the HRB report and the related inventory of dioxin emissions to the Irish environment. As I have mentioned already that consideration will involve my Department and the EPA, as well as the Department of Health and Children, which has also been contacted in this regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the meantime the EPA will continue to implement its rigorous environmental licensing system in respect of all significant waste facilities with the objective of ensuring that such activities do not present a significant risk to public health or to the environment. On the more general point of where I stand on the question of thermal treatment I will again put the record straight here. My aim is to put in place an effective basis for addressing our waste management responsibilities through the Changing Our Ways policy statement on waste management; the Prevention and Recycling Waste Delivering Change policy statement; the waste management plans largely pre<Col N="1627" />pared on a regional basis adopted by the local authorities; and the comprehensive regulatory framework now in place regarding waste.</P>
    <P>The Government's approach is based on the internationally recognised waste management hierarchy of prevention, minimisation, significantly increased levels of recycling, energy recovery and utilising landfill as a last resort for residual waste that cannot otherwise be recovered. The Government's priorities on waste management are now focused on implementation. While much work remains to be done, we have within recent years made considerable progress on a number of fronts. I am carrying out a national overview of the state of delivery of the objectives and targets in the local authority waste management plans. I will consider what further steps may be necessary in light of this exercise which I expect to complete shortly. I intend to fully consider this research study in the context of examination of the HRB report and to issue a full response on the matter in due course.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FergusODowdFG" hpid="Mr. O'Dowd Mr. O'Dowd">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dowd</NameTxt>
      <P>Given that applications for incinerators are proceeding in Cork and in Counties Louth and Meath will the Minister introduce an immediate moratorium on all planning applications whether with the EPA or with the planning authorities until he has a definitive response to the health research board report? Is it not a fact that the health research board reported that Ireland has insufficient resources to carry out adequate risk assessment for proposed waste management facilities, and that our health information systems cannot support routine monitoring of the health of people living near waste sites?</P>
      <P>There is an urgent need to develop the skills and resources required to undertake health and environmental risk assessment in Ireland and while the Minister is sitting back these applications are going on. People are deeply concerned about the health impacts of incineration. Is it not a fact that the director general of the EPA wrote to the Department of Health and Children which then wrote to the Minister in March about their concerns about the health research board report? What will the Minister do about it? Will he not bring in that moratorium now until he has all of the facts? He cannot proceed and put the lives of people living near these facilities at risk.</P>

      <P>This issue has been misinterpreted consistently in regard to the HRB report partly because the body of the report does not particularly address or discuss current Irish capabilities <Col N="1628" />or practice. Risk assessment in the context of the HRB recommendation does not mean the site-specific risk assessment that is routinely carried out by the EPA before it grants a waste licence to a proposed new facility. Instead, the report is referring to a perceived need for health information systems to support routine and long-term monitoring of health for people living near waste facilities. That is the context notwithstanding people's legitimate concerns. I accept that there are concerns but let us put them in context. We have nine incinerators here. In 2000 their combined emissions contributed 0.015% of total emissions in the air.</P>

      <P>By comparison, again for the information of the Members &ndash; so that we can deal with this discussion in a very accurate and calm fashion &ndash; burning of domestic waste, as we speak, is contributing more than 2,600 times more emissions than the nine incinerators are contributing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnGormley" hpid="Mr. Gormley Mr. Gormley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gormley</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
      <P>Accidental house fires contribute more than 750 times more. Domestic heating and cooking contributes more than 300 times more. Hallowe'en bonfires contribute more than 130 times more and transport contributes more than 140 times more. We need to put this in context in order that the people get factually correct information and are not subject to incredible scaremongering.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Assuming we put in place by 2010 thermal treatment of one million tonnes of municipal waste, the estimated dioxin emissions to air &ndash;<Col N="1629" />which is what I believe Deputy Gormley was referring to &ndash; would amount to 0.5 grammes or 1.65% of total projected emissions to air. That is what we are talking about if all these facilities are in place by 2010. Taking account also of hazardous waste incineration, total dioxin emissions to air would amount to 0.55 grammes or 1.8% of total projected emissions to air. They are the facts. If we continue the way we are going compared to putting all these facilities in place by 2010, dioxin emissions from domestic burning of waste will be 30 times higher; dioxin emissions from accidental house fires will still be nine times higher; dioxin emissions from domestic heating will be over twice as high, and there will also be dioxin emissions from bonfires.</P>
    <P>In the context of having a calm and reasoned debate, I point out to Deputies Gormley, O'Dowd and others that I am trying to stop the huge emission source of dioxins from unregulated burning of domestic waste. It is 2,600 times higher in its dioxin emissions contribution than that contributed by the proper management of waste. We could reduced dioxin emissions to 0.5 grams or over 1% of total emissions by properly managing the process. This is part of a respected and recognised international hierarchy of waste management. I have emphasised over and over again minimisation, prevention and recycling, of which a residual is that two other factors must form part of the equation, landfill and thermal treatment.</P>
    <P>I would like somebody to explain the reason people do not want their waste properly managed in proper, highly technical, well run facilities, yet I am told waste management facilities in Sweden, Denmark and Austria are fantastic and asked the reason we cannot have the same facilities. The countries in question have all these facilities in place and are building new ones. They are closing down many of the older ones and putting in place modern, effective facilities, which we will also have.</P>

As <Col N="1630" />we get rid of older incinerators and build newer ones, is it not a fact that dioxins and harmful substances are contained more and more in ash? Does the Minister believe in the precautionary principle? If so, in the light of this report will he act responsibly and introduce a moratorium until such time as we are very clear on this?</P>

      <P>That is the nub of the matter. I would like the Minister to answer that question directly.</P>
      <P>I spoke about the Government, which consists of Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats. This proposal affects my constituency in regard to which I am trying to reassure the women of Ringsend and Sandymount. Have representations been made to the Minister by my constituency colleague, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform Deputy McDowell, who claimed in the run-up to the general election that, if elected, he would stop the incinerator in Ringsend going ahead? I have a document from which I do not want to quote directly because I know the Acting Chairman does not want me to do so. The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform said he was determined to stop it and that all that was required was the political will to do so. Does the Minister have the political will to do so? Does the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform have the political will to do so and has he made representations to the Minister on the matter? Has he expressed his concern? </P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
      <P>The answer to the Deputy's first question is, &ldquo;No, I am not&rdquo;. I have tried to put this matter in context. Having regard to the lives we lead in this modern world, I accept there are risks associated with a whole range of issues but thermal treatment in modern facilities is at the lower scale of risks in comparison to the way in which we are currently treating the environment. There are a range of issues which I want to resolve, on which the Deputy does not seem to focus or about which he does not seem to be bothered about, and which are contributing enormously to dioxin emissions and damaging the environment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not. Deputy Gormley asked me a straightforward question, in reply to which I have said &ldquo;No&rdquo;, directly to him. I do not believe I can be clearer. &ldquo;No&rdquo; in the English language contains two letters. It is a pretty definitive statement &ndash; my answer is &ldquo;No&rdquo;. We will continue in parallel with progressing many of the facilities which have to go through the most rigorous EIA assessments and the most rigorous licensing systems, with which the EPA, an independent body, is charged. We are a long way from having them <Col N="1631" />in place because the process will involve an enormous amount of public consultation, which is only right. The people have to be directly involved in their regions in order that they will know exactly what is going on. I will ensure this happens.</P>
      <P>All of the facts have to be made available in order that the people understand them. They should not be eschewed with the result that there is misinformation designed for political capitalisation and which seeks to suggest there is a way of dealing with waste that consists of all the soft options. There are no soft options. Across the system there are a range of balanced measures under an integrated approach. As regards my colleague, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform is well able to answer for himself.</P>

      <P>As a mother &ndash; I do not take from the fact that the majority of men in the House are also parents &ndash; I point out that, following on today's report, mothers, whether expectant or the mothers of very young babies, are not impressed by dioxin levels, whether they derive from the burning of domestic waste, thermal treatment of waste or incinerators. They are not impressed because their main and overriding concern is the health of their children, whether before or after birth or in the early stages of life. Taking on board everything the Minister said, it needs to be pointed out that the majority of the incinerators about which the Minister talked are located in the Ringaskiddy area. That is a fact. They are privately owned.</P>

      <P>I know that. It covers a 37 year period. Normally studies of this kind cover a much shorter period. It shows there has been a 17% increase in the incidence of spina bifida and a 12% increase in the incidence of congenital heart defects. These figures cannot be explained in any way other than by the location of the mothers and where their children were born. We cannot dismiss the findings of the study by talking about the levels of dioxin emissions and the safest way to manage waste. The facts remain. While I accept the argument that these are old facilities and that new ones would be put in place, that is poor comfort to mothers living in such an area who consider their babies would be at risk. As Deputy O'Dowd said and to use the Minister's own words, we must proceed &ldquo;with caution&rdquo; because of these latest findings.</P>

      <P>In case the Deputy believes this might be an argument that only involves men, I advise her that the most impressive person I met lately on this issue, with whom I shared a platform before an audience of 200 to 300, who spoke passionately about the facts with regard to thermal treatment and incineration, was a young woman who carried the day brilliantly. I take my hat off to her as a young woman who could demonstrate and convince an audience on the real facts of the issue. Men and women equally and all of us as parents are deeply concerned about all the issues involved which I would not for one minute dismiss out of hand. While they all have to be brought into the discussion and debate, I emphasise what the report states.</P>

      <P> The proposed emission levels for incinerators are significantly lower than the international norms and what is acceptable.

I asked him to examine the proposition of a ban, or even a moratorium, pending further clear and absolute information on the construction of waste incinerators in the light of this new study by researchers from the University of Newcastle, which has been published in the <i>British Medical Journal.</i> There can be no question about the level of concern this report will generate throughout this country regarding such significant increases in the incidence of spina bifida and congenital heart defects in new births.

I refer here to companies such as Indaver, which is seeking to develop a major incinerator near Drogheda in County Louth? Is the Minister aware that, contrary to what he said, plans for incinerators were not adopted by all local authorities and that many rejected his predecessor's plans in this area?

      <NameTxt>Mr. Crawford</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Ceann Comhairle's office for allowing me to raise this matter on the Adjournment.</P>
      <P>There is a crisis in agriculture that is particularly serious for farmers in Cavan-Monaghan. Staff shortages in the FDS mean that REPS applications are not being dealt with and grants under the scheme are not being paid. Farm waste and dairy hygiene grants are not being processed. They are not being paid, nor are new agreements being issued to allow work to continue.</P>
      <P>The Minister is causing serious problems as far as many farmers are concerned. It is serious and not a joke or a laughing matter. My secretary received a representation from a farmer in west Cavan who is awaiting a farm building grant for a slatted house. He has been told that, although the forms have been submitted, received and passed by an administrative officer, they cannot be passed to the superintendent to be signed for payment because one person is not available in the office. The same situation applies in County Monaghan. Would this happen in any other office? The man to whom I refer is a father of seven young children and has to pay his children's allowance to the bank to keep it satisfied and allow the business to continue. I understand from my council colleagues in the area that a person would have to see the situation to understand its seriousness. Also on the list is a young man who came through the trauma of the Omagh bombing when his fiancée was seriously injured. He has not been able to receive payments of any kind for the last number of months. How are we going to encourage young people to come into farming and how will they be kept there? Another woman with her own problems cannot get grants or REPS payments. The chairman of the IFA in the county telephoned me in desperation. He told me there is going to be a serious crisis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This has nothing to do with the major national dispute, it relates to the problem with farm development. I understand the man from Monaghan has already received his letter of appointment but he will not be released from Navan. Can the Minister of State justify that farmers in Monaghan should have their money withheld, or be prevented from doing work, simply because a <Col N="1636" />man is not allowed to move from Navan to Monaghan?</P>
    <P>The list continues and in many cases it is younger farmers who have made the effort to control pollution. Pollution and dairy hygiene grants were two of the issues that were fought for for years but were out of vogue for a while. These grants allow farmers to control waste. Farmers are under pressure from local authorities and the Department of Agriculture and Food to do this. They are also under pressure from dairies and the Food Safety Board to have their dairy hygiene grants put in place.</P>
    <P>I first brought this to the notice of the Minister many weeks ago and I have also spoken with civil servants. I do not think the Minister of State will be able to give me an adequate reply in the five minutes allotted to him. We need a further debate on agriculture in this House to discuss the crisis it is going through. There has been no debate on the Fischler proposals, WTO talks or the demise of farming. The number of people leaving the sector is unprecedented. There is a lack of support for young farmers.</P>
    <P>The national dispute that is affecting other areas must also be mentioned, as there is a danger of it spreading. I know it is before the courts and the Minister of State will tell me it cannot be dealt with. It will have to be dealt with eventually. The dispute is preventing stock from being sold. It is causing chaos, putting serious financial pressure on farmers and should not be allowed to continue.</P>
    <P>I am pleading with the Minister of State, on the day when the House will close for ten days, to deal with this issue conclusively and positively before we meet again. Otherwise, many farmers will be forced out of business and there will be serious consequences. While I do not want to spell these out, the Minister of State knows what I mean.</P>

      <P>The agricultural environment and structures, including the REPS area of my Department, operates from local offices throughout the country. The principal supervisory grades involved are district superintendents and supervisory agricultural officers. On occasion, vacancies in these grades arise due to resignations, retirements, holidays and sick leave etc. The normal arrangements over the years for dealing with these vacancies was to fill them on a temporary basis, by rotating staff from surrounding districts or to pay allowances to staff to perform higher duties until the permanent vacancy was filled or <Col N="1637" />the officer concerned returned from annual leave or sick leave. However, this co-operation was withdrawn by the IMPACT trade union a few weeks ago with the result that a backlog has developed in the processing of applications for approval or the payment of grants for work completed. The union decided to withdraw co-operation on temporary transfers and acting-up because the Department was refusing to concede to a request from its members, in the agricultural environment structures group, for additional remuneration in respect of a restructuring proposal from them for the same work area. The withdrawal of co-operation took place without the union lodging a formal claim for processing through the normal conciliation and arbitration scheme. A formal claim was only lodged at the conciliation stage yesterday. This claim will be processed through the conciliation and arbitration scheme in the normal manner.</P>
      <P>I am pleased to inform the House that the process for the filling of the existing vacancies in Cavan-Monaghan and other areas has been completed. The new officers will, I understand, all be in place by the middle of next month. Whilst the appointments which we are now arranging will solve the problems in the counties affected, further problems may arise in other counties if the union continues with its policy of non co-operation. We regret that the union has decided to take this action at this time. It is contrary to the terms of the Sustaining Progress agreement and the earlier social partnership agreements. Furthermore it has lodged a claim under the conciliation and arbitration scheme for the Civil Service and there is no reason why it should not allow the proper procedures under this scheme to continue.</P>
      <P>I trust this puts the matter in context. I am confident that with the new appointments we have made and with reasonable, honourable co-operation, we should be able to deliver the services to which farmers are entitled in Cavan, Monaghan and elsewhere.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Upton</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Ceann Comhairle for permitting me to raise this important matter. I regret that I find myself having to raise this issue again here in this House, as I believe it could have been resolved weeks ago.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I speak of the ongoing dispute between the Department of Agriculture and Food and employees in agriculture offices around the country represented by the Civil and Public Service Union. This dispute should never have been allowed to reach this stage. But for the inflammatory actions of the Minister for Agriculture and Food in suspending some 150 clerical and staff officers from the payroll on 1 April, this matter may have been resolved much sooner. Hundreds <Col N="1638" />of CPSU members have been picketing offices for weeks and the Minister's silence has been deafening.</P>
    <P>Essential services are being badly affected by this dispute. Farm development scheme offices, regional laboratories, local livestock offices and district offices, all of which provide vital support to the farming community, are being affected. This dispute is causing untold hardship for farmers across the country. For example, the dispute prevented the slaughter of a large brucellosis infected herd in Galway a few weeks ago and 15 other herds affected by TB cannot be destroyed. This is an unacceptable risk to animal and human health. The diseased herds cannot be removed as the paperwork cannot be prepared for the veterinary staff to allow the animals to be taken away for destruction.</P>
    <P>We now have the CPSU and individual farmers having to resort to the courts on behalf of their members to seek a judicial review of their suspension. There is also the prospect of civil servants in all Departments leaving their posts in support of their suspended colleagues. The adverse effect of the industrial action has now spread to affect farmers served by the DVOs in Sligo, Carrick-on-Shannon, Monaghan and Cavan.</P>
    <P>I have two principal concerns that I want to see the Minister address. Firstly, the lack of promotional opportunities for staff in the agriculture offices needs to be addressed and the Minister should enter into discussions with the CPSU to examine this issue. A unilateral and sudden decision to suspend workers without notice is not the way to do business. Secondly, the Minister is failing to protect the farmers who are being detrimentally affected by this dispute because of his unwillingness to intervene and bring it to a conclusion. This dispute now requires the direct intervention of the Minister to protect the farming community and ensure the integrity of the food chain is not compromised. An outbreak of food poisoning would be devastating at this time, the position being further compromised by the industrial action of public health doctors.</P>
    <P>The Minister should act responsibly and ensure there are no short cuts in the food chain. He should engage in meaningful discussions with the Civil and Public Service Union to resolve this dispute and restore confidence in animal health and food safety procedures.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. Treacy Mr. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to update the House on the ongoing dispute within the Department of Agriculture and Food. This dispute centres on the demand by CPSU members in my Department's local offices for an increase in the number of staff officer and executive officer posts at local level.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The CPSU members involved commenced industrial action on 18 March this year and this resulted in the removal of 263 staff from the payroll following their refusal to perform core duties. The actions by these members of CPSU is contrary to the Programme for Prosperity and Fair<Col N="1639" />ness and its successor, Sustaining Progress. This is a cost increasing claim under the social partnership agreements, which specifically preclude such claims and any form of industrial action. The dispute is limited to our Department's local offices in Galway, Mayo, Kerry, Limerick and Clonakilty in County Cork. Normal services are being provided by the other local offices of our Department throughout the country.</P>
    <P>The Department's officials have met with the CPSU representatives on a number of occasions and are in regular contact with them. These negotiations have been useful and we are constantly considering the situation and doing our utmost to resolve this matter at every level within the Department. Both parties have stated their respective positions and discussed a number of issues arising in relation to the dispute. However, no formula for resolving the dispute has emerged to date.</P>
    <P>Fourteen CPSU members from our Department's Clonakilty office have issued legal proceedings against the Minister for Agriculture and Food, seeking a judicial review of the removal of the staff in question from the payroll. The case was heard in the High Court on Tuesday and Wednesday of this week and judgment has been reserved. A number of applications have also been made to the High Court from various farmers seeking an injunction compelling the Minister to return their cattle identity cards or issue movement permits.</P>
    <P>We are fully aware of the impact that a prolonged dispute of this nature can have on many farmers and their families. We sincerely regret the inconvenience caused and we are hopeful that the ongoing negotiations between our Department's officials and the CPSU will lead to a resolution of the dispute as quickly as possible. I remind the House again that there are mechanisms within the partnership framework to resolve disputes such as this and I urge all of the staff engaged in this unnecessary dispute to return to work and follow the appropriate procedures to resolve their grievances.</P>
    <P>Our Department has endeavoured to limit the impact of this dispute on farmers in the five counties involved. It has temporarily suspended the necessity of obtaining advance clearance from the CMMS data for animals intended for local slaughter houses. The union has agreed to ease restrictions in relation to herds affected by tuberculosis and brucellosis. It has established a committee, with a representative in each of the offices engaged in the industrial action, which reviews applications to ease the restrictions temporarily on a case by case basis. There have been some difficult and sad cases.</P>
    <P>Generally speaking, the industrial relations climate in the Department has been relatively stable in recent years. This is directly attributable to the commitment by all parties to the various partnership agreements, which have had the support of this House over the years. It is acknow<Col N="1640" />ledged that a stable industrial relations environment benefits both the general public and the public service itself. However, though regrettable, it is to some degree inevitable that incidents such as the current CPSU dispute and the case mentioned by Deputy Crawford will occur from time to time, given the size of the Department, which has some 4,800 staff.</P>
    <P>I assure the House that the Minister, the Minister of State, Deputy Aylward, and I have discussed this matter with management time and again. Every effort is being made by the management team, in co-operation with the staff and the relevant unions, in both this case and the case we debated previously, to bring this matter to a positive conclusion. Members of this House would be the first to criticise the Minister if he interfered unnecessarily and beyond his capacity in any dispute. There are mechanisms, systems and structures in place as well as negotiation opportunities. If common sense prevails, I am confident that the matter can be resolved <i>quan celerimme.</i></P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Neville</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Ceann Comhairle for selecting this matter for the Adjournment debate and I welcome the opportunity of raising the conditions at Our Lady's Hospital for Sick Children in Crumlin. I put it to the Minister that it is crucial that the hospital has the capacity and capability to deliver the quality of paediatric service that is required in the twenty-first century. The Pollock report, an analysis of facilities provision at the hospital authored by Dr. Ronnie Pollock, MPA Health Strategy and Planning, was published last December. Its conclusion states:</P>
      <P>The defects and deficiencies in the hospital are very great indeed, and this after heroic efforts over the years to expand and improve facilities. I can see hardly any scope for improvement through &ldquo;patching&rdquo; the present framework, and absolutely no way in which currently accepted standards can be provided. The hospital is seriously outdated. It should be replaced.</P>
      <P>The hospital contains two groups of wards: the four storey block wards and single storey provision. The report states:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The &ldquo;block&rdquo; wards provision is seriously inadequate. The facilities provided for bed areas and the supportive facilities are all seriously below accepted standards and many functions now regarded as fundamental to an effective ward are not provided at all. There are virtually no facilities for parents and relatives, either in the form of rest rooms and <Col N="1641" />refreshment facilities or in provision for overnight stay beside an ill child.</P>
    <P>The Intensive Care provision is located in the Ward Block and it is very limited. The main 6-bedded unit's layout is poor with most of the available space clinically unusable, and the configuration fails to provide many of the key supporting facilities . . . </P>
    <P>Some additional ITU capacity is situated elsewhere in the block in St. Patrick's Ward which is however a mixture of an Intensive Therapy Unit (ITU) and a High Dependency Unit (HDU). It shares the space defects and absence of essential accommodation seen in the main unit. The two units are widely separated, creating additional problems in staffing and supervision.</P>
    <P>I pay special tribute to the staff, who have worked so brilliantly under the current conditions, to the management, who are continuing to do excellent work at the hospital despite its facilities, and to the New Crumlin Hospital Group, the parents' lobby for the redevelopment of the hospital. They are doing excellent work. I ask the Minister to respond quickly and favourably and get things under way.</P>
    <P>Like the outpatients department, the accident and emergency department mirrors the defects of the hospital as a whole. The report states:</P>
    <P>[T]he clinical functions have insufficient area to work efficiently, the staff and relatives provision is very poor, and many areas which are standard provision for an Accident and Emergency Department are totally absent. The net area . . .  is about 400 [sq. m.]. A department carrying this workload would expect to have an area of about 900 [sq. m.].</P>
    <P>The department is less than half the size required to carry out the duties of an accident and emergency department efficiently. In terms of diagnostic facilities, there is neither imaging nor pathology which matches up to current standards. The report states: &ldquo;In Imaging all the diagnostic rooms are too small, staff provision is minimal and, in a hospital with a tertiary role in neurology and oncology, there is no MRI.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The hospital was built in the early 1950s and was conceived as much as two decades before that, so we are really talking about a 1930s hospital that was planned 70 years ago. According to the report, &ldquo;It is its misfortune that during this period the whole social and philosophical climate surrounding child health care has changed more than that in any other field of medicine.&rdquo;  When I was in hospital as a young child, practically nobody was allowed in. One's parents were allowed in once a week. That has totally changed, and for the better. The report goes on to state:</P>
    <P>At the time of the hospital's origins, it was the norm for parents to give their sick child, in trust, into the care of the hospital and to visit the child on a limited basis. The change to the <Col N="1642" />present day position could hardly be greater with parents participating actively in their child's care and spending virtually unlimited time with them. . .  [T]he existing hospital is not well geared to that approach. . .</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to respond favourably and move ahead quickly in providing funding for a new hospital.</P>
    <Speaker pid="IvorCallely" hpid="Mr. Callely Mr. Callely">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children (Mr. Callely)</NameTxt>
      <P>I will respond positively to Deputy Neville's comments. I am quite familiar with the Pollock report and with the good work of the parents' group. On a personal note, I am delighted to say that my late father was involved in a voluntary capacity in doing work for the hospital for a period of about 40 years. Because I was in and out of the hospital during that period, I am familiar with the hospital structures and I acknowledge and accept what Deputy Neville had to say in that regard.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy is aware, the Eastern Regional Health Authority is charged with responsibility for commissioning health and personal social services on behalf of the population of the region and, thus, for Our Lady's Hospital for Sick Children in Crumlin. I am pleased to inform him that, on foot of an acknowledgement by all parties of the need for an overall development of the facilities at Crumlin Hospital, the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Martin, has approved the establishment of a project team to plan for the future development of the hospital. The team includes representatives from the hospital, the Eastern Regional Health Authority, and the Department of Health and Children.</P>
      <P>Many of the buildings within the hospital are, as the Deputy rightly said, nearly 50 years old and have not been upgraded in any significant way during that period. As a result, they do not now generally meet contemporary standards for paediatric hospital facilities. The first stage of the planning process involves writing a brief for the preparation of a development control plan that will set the context for future capital developments on the site. The team expects to complete the development brief by the end of this year.</P>
      <P>It is intended that a phased approach will be taken to new development and upgrading of facilities. The plans will allow for the prioritisation of developments according to the service needs of the hospital and the ERHA. I understand that infrastructural improvements in the haematology-oncology and cardiology departments have been identified as priorities by the ERHA and the hospital. A phased approach to the overall development will ensure that services continue to be provided at the hospital during the redevelopment of the facilities. The Pollock report indicates that we should move to a new greenfield site. I do not know if that is accepted by all concerned and that is why I say that services will continue to be provided during redevelopment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1643" />A number of additional major developments, funded by the Exchequer, are currently being put in place at the hospital. These include a &euro;30 million investment in the new operating department, with additional theatres and ancillary facilities and a new central sterile supplies department. This development is expected to increase the capacity of the hospital to meet additional surgery demands. In addition, my Department has approved the provision of an MRI facility at Crumlin at a total project cost of approximately &euro;5 million. This facility will significantly enhance the level of diagnostic services provided for children. A brief for this project has been drafted and is expected to be finalised by the MRI project team shortly. The detailed planning process for this facility will be progressed as a priority after the brief is finalised.</P>
    <P>The ERHA has allocated substantial additional revenue funding to the hospital in recent years to develop its cardiology services. Funding has been provided for the appointment of two additional consultant cardiologists and support staff to assist in the development of Crumlin's cardiology services. Funding has also been provided for the development of paediatric oncology and haematology services.</P>
    <P>The Minister has met, and I have communicated with, the new Crumlin hospital group, which comprises parents of children who regularly attend Our Lady's Hospital for treatment. It was this group that commissioned the Pollock report into facilities at the hospital. As I have already said, the deficiencies highlighted in the Pollock report are well known and accepted. The Minister and I are committed to the redevelopment programme at Crumlin and we have given the new Crumlin hospital group our assurance in this regard. The Minister visited the hospital as recently as yesterday and took the opportunity to review, with the board and management, the rate of progress in advancing the redevelopment programme.</P>

      <P>I thank the House for the opportunity to address the major crisis that exists in our health system in terms of a lack of services and ward closures. One year after the general election, many of the major issues in our health system have not been addressed in a planned and coherent manner. Successive Governments have failed to provide the necessary infrastructure to support vulnerable citizens.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I will not accept any excuses today. I am <Col N="1644" />demanding the elimination of all health, disability and social service waiting lists within a three year period. This can be achieved through prioritising public spending and using the money more effectively. We also need accountability from our decision-makers. The reality is that not enough money is being spent on health and disability issues. The Government has admitted that waiting lists will not be eliminated. Despite its promise to grant 200,000 additional medical cards, not one has been issued. There is an employment freeze on 800 jobs in the health service, 300 beds have been closed and all Dublin hospitals are facing a shortfall of more than &euro;100 million this year. In addition, the Minister and Government are sitting on their hands during a strike by the public health doctors. The Minister should pay them and let them get on with their jobs.</P>
    <P>People are angry and they are sick and tired listening to and waiting for health reports and strategies. They are demanding action and real solutions to the problems that exist. The health system is sick and we all need to work together to make it better.</P>
    <P>We are also faced with the nightmare scenario of people with intellectual disabilities. Some 1,711 people are awaiting residential services, 861 need day-care services and 462 people are without any service. Parents and service providers at St. Vincent's centre on the Navan Road and at St. Michael's House in Ballymun are crying out for funding and proper services, as a matter of right. This simply is not good enough. This is the Minister of State's watch.</P>
    <P>It is a disgrace that the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Martin, when discussing our health services on &ldquo;The Late Late Show&rdquo; last Friday night made no reference to the crisis that exists for families of children and adults with intellectual disabilities. Shame on him. If he was serious about dealing with this problem, he and the Government would introduce a supplementary budget on health and disability issues. I would support such a motion. The Minister can do it. The Cabinet was able to find the &euro;42 million required to bail out the Minister for Education and Science. Why can it not come up with a creative idea to fund our health and disability services and eliminate waiting lists once and for all? With the right political will, it can be done. It will take courage and vision and will require tough decisions in the interests of the poorer sections of our society, a just society for which we all work; it is not just an economy.</P>
    <P>It is time to stand up to the bully boys and girls in the House and tell them to keep their extreme economic brands of politics to themselves. The health budget is more than &euro;9.158 billion and staff costs are put at &euro;5 million. One does not have to be a rocket scientist to know that we are not spending enough on frontline services such as beds and accident and emergency services. The Minister should discuss that with his French and Spanish counterparts the next time he meets them at an EU meeting.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1645" />Last week, 25 patients had to await admission in the accident and emergency department of Beaumont Hospital. That happened on just one morning. That number will soon rise to 50 or 60 patients. The in-patient waiting list at that hospital is 2,513 and for the Mater hospital it is 2,167. This is the real state of our health system. It is not acceptable and this Government must act now.</P>
    <Speaker pid="IvorCallely" hpid="Mr. Callely Mr. Callely">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Callely</NameTxt>
      <P>I am happy to respond to the Deputy, who indicated that there is a crisis in our health services and that there is a need for prioritisation. He also said that not enough money is being spent and made other comments which might, possibly, make good by-lines.</P>
      <P>On the point of not enough money being spent, a previous Government, made up of Independents, introduced the Health (Amendment) No. 3 Act 1996, the accountability procedures of which are now being applied to hospitals and forcing them to operate within their budgets.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Callely</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to highlight the increased levels of funding the Government is providing for the health service. This year the approved level of spending nationally for health services is in excess of &euro;9 billion. The health service has received an overall increase of 162% since 1997. This is a clear indication of the Government's commitment to improving and maintaining the quality of services in difficult and changed economic circumstances. This extra investment in recent years has brought significant results, including record levels of activity in the acute hospital system and a range of additional services provided in the major programmes of care. This investment has been matched by increases in the quantity and quality of health care outcomes.</P>
      <P>We should guard against undermining the achievements of all who work in the health service. It is important to remember that every day thousands of patients have satisfactory experiences of the health service and successful outcomes. There are many good things happening in the health sector. While there has been a substantial amount of adverse comment about the service, nobody can deny that the system is providing more and better services than ever before.</P>
      <P>Activity levels in our acute hospitals continues to rise. In 2002 alone there were 963,000 in-patient discharges. This figure represents approximately 2,600 patients being discharged each day of the year and an overall increase of nearly 5% on the number of discharges in 2001. In addition, there were 1.2 million attendances at emergency medicine or accident and emergency departments and over 1.5 million attendances at acute hospital out-patient departments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Day activity is now a significant component of hospital based care. Evidence shows that much of the growth is the result of technological and <Col N="1646" />medical innovations such as less invasive surgery and advances in anaesthetics. There was an increase of 13% in the number of day cases between 2001 and 2002, similar to the increases experienced in preceding years. This increase reflects the increasing ability of the hospital system to treat more patients on a day basis where patients are admitted and discharged on the same day.</P>
    <P>Due to the nature of any health care system not all treatments can be made available to patients immediately. Hospital facilities must be used to best effect and it is sometimes necessary to place patients for non-urgent treatments on a waiting list. Our objective is to reduce waiting times significantly in the short-term with a particular focus on those waiting longest for treatment. Despite pressures on the acute hospital system and the influence of factors such as the winter vomiting bug, considerable progress was made by health agencies in reducing waiting times for public patients in 2002.</P>
    <P>There has been a significant reduction in the number of adults waiting longest for in-patient treatment. The total number of adults waiting more than 12 months for in-patient treatment in the nine target surgical specialties fell by 30% from 7,402 to 5,209 in the period June to December 2002. Some individual specialties have shown greater reductions. The specialty of cardiac surgery, for example, showed a reduction of 47% in the numbers waiting more than 12 months in the period June to December 2002 while the specialty of gynaecology showed a decrease of 45% in the same period. The total number of children waiting for more than six months for in-patient treatment has fallen by over 31%. The most significant reductions have been in the specialties of general and plastic surgery where the number of children waiting more than six months for treatment has fallen by 52% and 44% respectively in the period.</P>
    <P>The Eastern Regional Health Authority has reported a near 3% reduction in the in-patient waiting list between September and December 2002. This has been achieved at a time when the acute hospital system has been under pressure from increased demands on emergency services. The total number of patients on the public hospital waiting list represents just 3% of all discharges from acute hospitals in 2002.</P>
    <P>A sum of &euro;43.8 million is available to health agencies in 2003 under the waiting list initiative. A further &euro;3I million is available under the national treatment purchase fund, NTPF, to target those waiting longest for treatment. To date, approximately 4,300 long waiters have received treatment under the NTPF, the work of which has raised issues in relation to the accuracy of numbers reported to be waiting longer than 12 months for treatment. As a result, the Minister for Health and Children recently announced his intention to bring forward proposals, in consultation with the NTPF, ERHA and the health boards, for a new <Col N="1647" />system of management and organisation of waiting lists nationally.</P>
    <P>The single most important limiting factor for admission to hospital is bed availability. In this regard, the Department of Health and Children conducted a review of acute hospital bed needs, something I sought as chairman of the ERHA. As a result of this review, the Government decided to provide an additional 3,000 beds in acute hospitals by 2011. A total of 550 of these beds are in operation and the remainder will be brought into use shortly. My Department is examining the regional issues associated with the allocation of the remainder of the 3,000 acute beds. In relation to bed closures, it is a feature of all acute hospital systems that some beds are out of use for short periods due, for example, to ward refurbishment, essential ward maintenance, staff availability and infection control measures.</P>
    <P>Under the Health (Amendment) (No. 3) Act 1996, otherwise known as the accountability legislation, health agencies are required to deliver a level of service consistent with their approved budgets. Given the level of funding available this year, the structuring of overall service plans by health agencies for 2003 may involve some containment of service activity in order to manage within budget. We acknowledge that the Eastern <Col N="1648" />Regional Health Authority and the health boards have some difficult decisions to make regarding their service provision and priorities therein. The ERHA and the health boards are actively examining the most effective and efficient means to manage cost and activity in the context of working with available resources.</P>
    <P>I assure the Deputy of the Government's resolve to work closely with the various health agencies with regard to ensuring an efficient and effective health service that meets the needs of the population. Within the next four weeks the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Martin, will come to the House to make some major reforming announcements regarding the provision of health services in the years to come.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TomKitt" hpid="Mr. Kitt Mr. Kitt">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs (Mr. Kitt)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 6, 36, 47, 78, 99 and 160 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>From the beginning of the current conflict in Iraq I have stressed that, as Minister responsible for development co-operation and human rights, <Col N="1650" />my focus would remain on the protection and saving of human lives. This is the humanitarian imperative to which I continue to be absolutely committed.</P>
    <P>Reports from humanitarian agencies and organisations working on the ground are closely monitored and provide vital information on the prevailing situation. Reports from the World Food Programme, WFP, UNICEF and the Red Cross family have been particularly useful. The submission from GOAL to the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Foreign Affairs on humanitarian operations stressed, <i>inter alia,</i> the need to make the aid operation in Iraq a UN led operation. I support this view.</P>
    <P>The humanitarian situation in Iraq remains serious. There has been a breakdown in the delivery of essential services. Relief agencies are working in a very difficult security environment which is hindering humanitarian assessments and deliveries. Looting has been a particular problem. UNICEF and the Red Cross have placed a very high priority on the need for a safe and secure environment in which to operate. The ability of humanitarian aid workers to reach the neediest children is being impeded by a culture of lawlessness and fear. Contaminated water, poor sanitation and waste disposal have led to soaring rates of diarrhoea among Iraqi children. Malnutrition rates were very high even prior to the conflict.</P>
    <P>There are at the same time some encouraging signs. Inter-agency co-ordination is good and the UN agencies and NGOs are meeting regularly. The WFP has delivered over 200,000 metric tonnes of food, nearly 4000 truckloads, using five corridors through Turkey, Jordan, Syria, Iran and Kuwait. The objective of the WFP is to gear up for one of the largest humanitarian operations it has ever attempted. This means ensuring that 480,000 metric tonnes of food are available each month, to feed 27 million Iraqis for five months. This exercise will involve the movement of 48,000 trucks. The WFP estimates that after five months an Iraqi authority will be able to take over the operation. Full distribution to the entire population of Iraq is scheduled to begin on 1 June, using the existing public distribution system.</P>
    <P>The executive director of the WFP, Mr. James Morris, who recently travelled to Baghdad, is confident that serious hunger among the Iraqi people can be avoided. Mr. Morris will visit Ireland in July and this will provide a valuable opportunity for discussions on the humanitarian situation in Iraq and in other parts of the world, particularly Africa.</P>
    <P>Deputies will be aware that I announced, on 25 March, a &euro;5 million humanitarian assistance funding package to alleviate suffering in Iraq. As a result of reports emanating on the ground from humanitarian agencies, the key focus of this assistance is emergency support for health services, water and sanitation, food assistance and support for internally displaced persons. This funding has been delivered via the Red Cross family, UNICEF, the WFP, Concern, Goal and <Col N="1651" />Trócaire. Funding has also been provided to assist with the co-ordination of the humanitarian effort. This funding package is now on stream. Our partners have a proven track record of providing effective emergency relief to those most in need in difficult operating environments. I believe that Ireland's assistance is reaching the most vulnerable in an effective manner.</P>
    <P>I welcome the adoption on 22 May, by the Security Council, of Resolution 1483 and particularly the recognition of the vital role of the United Nations in the humanitarian and reconstruction effort. I have consistently emphasised that the UN has a substantial record of achievement in this area. I also warmly welcome the appointment of Mr. Sergio Viero de Mello as the new special representative for Iraq.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand that the Deputy's question relates to the conflict in Iraq and the situation there at present.</P>
      <P>The Government has from the outset called on all combatants to respect their obligations under international humanitarian law, both in regard to the status of civilians and in regard to prisoners of war. This policy is in keeping with the public pronouncements of UN Secretary General Annan and had been established long before the adoption of Security Council Resolution 1483. This resolution calls upon all concerned to comply fully with their obligations under international law including in particular the Geneva Conventions of 1949 and the Hague Regulations of 1907. The US and UK have publicly committed themselves to doing so. However, the situation on the ground remains volatile and difficult. The total collapse of the regime has created difficulties for the occupying powers in fully and immediately meeting their obligations under the Fourth Convention to ensure the provision of essential services to civilians.</P>
      <P>The Department of Foreign Affairs does not have a presence in Iraq. Thus any appreciation of the situation there is based on reports from other sources, including our Permanent Mission to the United Nations in New York and our embassies in the region, together with reports from the media and from non-governmental organisations.</P>

      <Quest>if he will report on the meeting of 25 EU and accession state foreign ministers in early May 2003 in Rhodes; the discussions surrounding the request for Javier Solana to draft a European strategic concept; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>EU Foreign Ministers had a very useful informal meeting in Rhodes and Kastellorizo on 2 and 3 May 2003. It was noteworthy as it included the ten accession countries for the first time. There were full and very useful discussions on a range of issues including the Middle East peace process, Iraq, weapons of mass destruction, transatlantic relations and the common foreign and security policy. As is the custom at such informal meetings there were no formal conclusions.</P>
      <P>On the Middle East Peace Process, there was agreement that the EU must maintain its involvement and commitment to seeing that all parties take the necessary steps to implement the Quartet road map. With regard to Iraq, all member states agreed on the importance of a central role for the UN. There was also agreement that the EU has a role to play, particularly in the area of humanitarian assistance. The Commission was asked to undertake preparatory work to advance the EU's contribution in Iraq.</P>
      <P>We also had a broad and forward looking discussion on weapons of mass destruction, transatlantic relations and the EU's common foreign and security policy. At the request of the Greek Presidency, I introduced discussion on the subject of transatlantic relations. In my presentation, I stressed the centrality of the transatlantic relationship to both the EU and the US. The relationship with Washington is one aspect of a &lsquo;policy triangle' along with a reinforced common foreign and security policy and a firm attachment to the UN. While differences with the US should not be over-stated, there was a need to reassess the nature of the EU-US relationship in a strategic manner. An effective EU CFSP-ESDP is an essential component for this process. So, too, is political will to reach common positions and adhere to them. A common view was that the best way to repair the transatlantic relationship was to focus on issues where there are mutual benefits and shared interests. One such area is weapons of mass destruction and it was agreed that the EU and the US should work together on this issue.</P>
      <P>One of the suggestions to emerge from the discussions was to prepare an EU Security Strategy for the 21st century, to which the Deputy refers. Dr. Solana, EU High Representative, was tasked with preparing an input for the European Council in Thessaloniki in June.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Work remains at an early stage and no title has yet been decided upon. I understand that the so-called security concept or strategy will seek to identify broad objectives which should inform the Union's conduct in international affairs, particularly, although not only, in the context of transatlantic relations. As was underlined in the course of my own subsequent meeting with High Representative Solana in Dublin on 21 May, EU partners are agreed that what is intended is a broad <Col N="1653" />concept of security extending beyond the purely military perspective. I have also expressed the view that particular emphasis should be placed on conflict prevention and upstream intervention, including aid in areas such as good governance, stable democracy, trade and poverty reduction.</P>
    <P>I consider that this initiative has the potential to be a very useful exercise. I hope it may assist in enhancing understanding between EU member states, with the US and with the wider international community as regards the EU's role in the world. I look forward to High Representative Solana's report to Thessaloniki and to further progress in the period ahead.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 9, 28, 44 and 143 together.</P>
      <P>On a number of occasions recently, I have set out the Government's position with respect to the situation in Papua.</P>
      <P>At the meeting of the External Relations Council which I attended on 14 April 2003, Ireland, together with our EU partners, adopted revised Council Conclusions on Indonesia. These conclusions reaffirmed the importance which we attach to the promotion and protection of human rights in Indonesia. The conclusions stressed the importance of bringing all perpetrators of human rights violations to justice, and also emphasised the importance of actively promoting peaceful solutions to the internal conflicts in Indonesia, including that of Papua.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With respect to the particular situation in the Wanema area of Papua, I am aware of military operations there in April 2003, and of allegations concerning the destruction of homes, churches, <Col N="1654" />schools and other buildings, as well as the loss of life. I also understand that a number of individuals were arrested, and allegedly beaten while in custody. These actions by the Indonesian military are of deep concern.</P>
    <P>Deputies will recall that I have reported previously on my meeting with the Indonesian Foreign Minister, Mr. Wirajuda, at the EU-ASEAN Foreign Ministers Meeting at Brussels in January 2003, when I raised issues of particular concern, including the human rights situation in Papua, and made the point that these matters impact on our national perception of Indonesia.</P>
    <P>Officials of my Department reiterated these concerns when they met with their Indonesian counterparts at the ASEM senior officials meeting, held in Jakarta, on 12 and 13 May.</P>
    <P>My colleague, Deputy Kitt, Minister of State for overseas development and human rights, recently met with Mr. John Rumbiak of the Institute of Human Rights Study and Advocacy &ndash; ELSHAM. Mr. Rumbiak briefed the Minister of State on the situation in Papua, including recent events in the central highlands.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State informed Mr. Rumbiak that the Government will continue to monitor closely the situation in Papua, and will continue to encourage the authorities in Indonesia to act with full regard to the rights and interests of the people of Papua.</P>
    <P>I hope to have a further opportunity to meet with Minister Wirajuda at the ASEM Foreign Ministers Meeting in July 2003, which he will host. Ireland, together with our EU partners, will continue to support the development of a strengthened dialogue and partnership between the EU and Indonesia, and see this as the most effective way at this time of addressing our serious concerns about the situation in Papua.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware of reports that Father Van Ly is a Catholic priest of the diocese of Hué in central Vietnam, who was arrested in May 2001 for allegedly inciting parishioners to seize land, for preventing them from assisting in irrigation work and for provoking security disorders. I understand from these reports that Father Van Ly, a national of Vietnam, was sentenced in October 2001 to 15 years' imprisonment, with a further five years of probation on release. Two nephews and a niece of Father Van Ly were also reported to be arrested between 13 and 19 June 2001. They were subsequently charged with being in contact with <Col N="1655" />&ldquo;reactionary&rdquo; organisations in the US, and of supplying them with information about the religious situation in Vietnam.</P>
      <P>The Government takes concerns about human rights in Vietnam seriously. While there is now a greater degree of religious freedom in Vietnam than there was a decade ago, there are still restrictions, and the Vietnamese Government still insists on control over religious institutions. There have also been worrying reports of a crackdown on ethnic minorities, and religious and political dissidents. The Vietnamese Government does not accept external criticism, and still implements the death penalty.</P>
      <P>On 15 May 2002, the EU and Vietnam adopted a new co-operation strategy. While its primary aim is to assist in the reduction of poverty, it also deals with cross cutting concerns, including the promotion of human rights. Indeed, article one of the strategy reads that &ldquo;respect for human rights and democratic principles is the basis for the co-operation between the parties and for the provisions of this Agreement, and it constitutes an essential element of the Agreement.&rdquo; Therefore, the EU Heads of Mission in Hanoi regularly raise human rights concerns in their contacts with the Vietnamese authorities.</P>
      <P>At the UN, Ireland is the lead sponsor on the Resolution on the Elimination of all forms of Religious Intolerance, at the Third Committee, and also at the Commission on Human Rights. Discrimination against ethnic and religious minorities in Vietnam was specifically referred to in the EU Statement at the Commission on Human Rights, in March 2003.</P>
      <P>Bilaterally, I met with the Vietnamese Foreign Minister, Mr. Nguyen Dy Nien, when both of us attended the EU-ASEAN Foreign Ministers Meeting, at Brussels, on 27 and 28 January 2003. I used this occasion to discuss our bilateral relations, and to raise issues of concern. I hope to have a further opportunity to meet with the Vietnamese Foreign Minister at the ASEM Foreign Ministers meeting in July 2003. The Vietnamese ambassador will be in Dublin later this year, in connection with the regular visit by non-resident ambassadors of ASEAN member states. I will take these two further opportunities to emphasise the Government's concern about the human rights situation in Vietnam and, in this regard, I will be very happy to raise the case mentioned by the Deputy. In addition, our ambassador at Kuala Lumpur, who is accredited to Vietnam, will also raise our concerns, including this specific case, at the next available opportunity.</P>
      <P>I would hope that the coming months will therefore see a number of contacts with the Government of Vietnam and that these will take up matters of bilateral interest, including our concerns about the human rights situation in Vietnam, the importance we attach to elimination of religious discrimination and the promotion of freedom of speech.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 11, 70, 82, 102, 152 and 153 together.</P>
      <P>As Deputies will be aware, the European Convention is entering into the final phase of its work. This week, the praesidium published its revised draft of the new treaty and there will now be a period of intense activity, including three meetings at plenary level, before the convention presents its final report to the European Council at Thessaloniki on 20 June. Its recommendations will be considered by Governments in an Intergovernmental Conference, due to begin its work later in the year, where final decisions will fall to be taken. It will then be for each member state to ratify the new treaty according to its own constitutional requirements, a process that normally takes about two years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1657" />There are many welcome aspects to the praesidium's proposals. The draft text reflects the consensus in favour of a single, simplified treaty structure which should make the Union's basic legal document more accessible to our citizens. In setting out the nature, values and objectives of the Union, the text achieves an admirable clarity. While they require a certain amount of fine-tuning, the draft articles on the distribution of competence between the Union and the member states should also contribute towards greater understanding of who does what and at what level. The clear statement that the Union exercises only those competencies explicitly conferred upon it by the member states &ndash; and its corollary, that competence that has not been conferred remains with member states &ndash; is particularly welcome.</P>
    <P>Progress has also been made on a range of other important issues, including the Charter of Fundamental Rights. While the Government will not reach a final decision on whether to support incorporation until the full and final package is available, the significant work carried out at the convention makes achievement of a consensus in this matter significantly more likely. Should a decision be reached in favour of its incorporation, the charter will apply to the Union's institutions and to the member states, including Ireland, only when they are implementing Union law.</P>
    <P>There are, of course, other areas where greater progress will be required if consensus is to be reached at the convention.</P>
    <P>On institutional matters, in bringing forward unamended texts, the praesidium has rightly pointed towards the need for greater discussion and thought on these subjects. There is a considerable degree of common ground, particularly among smaller member states, on the need to retain proper balance between the institutions and on the continuing requirement for equality, particularly as regards membership of the Commission. Institutional matters were discussed at the informal European Council meeting in Athens, on which I reported to the House on 8 May.</P>
    <P>On the common foreign and security policy, it is clear that as we move towards 25 member states, consideration needs to be given to maintaining and improving the capacity of the Union to make decisions. Decision-making by QMV is already possible in this area, for example when implementing common strategies. As I have said before, I will look constructively at proposals to extend its use if the necessary safeguards to respect the values and traditions of the member states are in place, and if such proposals will help bring about an enhanced EU contribution on the international scene. The existing provisions under which member states can protect vital national interests when a decision is being taken by QMV should, of course, continue to apply.</P>
    <P>We would also wish to see further work carried out on the draft articles on defence, on which I am answering other specific questions today. This <Col N="1658" />is, undoubtedly, one of the most sensitive issues being discussed at the convention and it is important that we get these articles right. I should add that there is no question of any extension of QMV to defence matters. We also remain firm in our view that unanimity must be retained for decisions on tax.</P>
    <P>The Government has been very active in advancing its case at the Convention and in related meetings, including that with the president of the convention, Mr. Valéry Giscard d'Estaing. The Taoiseach, the Minister of State for European Affairs and I have availed of every appropriate opportunity to raise key interests and concerns with our current and future partners. I am pleased that many of our concerns have been reflected in the new text published by the praesidium this week and that several of our amendments have been accepted. I can assure the House that we will continue to engage actively and purposefully in the final stages of the convention and in the Intergovernmental Conference.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court &ndash; ICC &ndash; entered into force on 1 July 2002. Ireland ratified the statute in April 2002, following the approval by the people of the necessary amendment to the Constitution. The Government is fully committed to the court, in line with Ireland's obligations as a state party to the statute and in accordance with the European Union's Common Position on the ICC. Ireland is currently participating in a review of the EU Common Position.</P>
      <P>Security Council Resolution 1422 arose from US concerns. These were based on the view that the claim of the International Criminal Court to jurisdiction over relevant crimes, committed in the territory of a state party to the Rome Statute by nationals of a non-state party, constituted an unacceptable erosion of a non-state party's sovereignty. In this context, the US expressed concern that its troops serving on overseas missions, or indeed its public figures at home, could be subjected to politically motivated prosecutions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The US therefore refused to agree to the adoption of the necessary Security Council resolution renewing the mandate of the UN peacekeeping operation, and the authorisation of the NATO-led mission, in Bosnia and Herzegovina, without the inclusion of a provision conferring immunity from arrest, detention and prosecution of personnel from a contributing state not party to the Rome Statute, either in the specific resolution <Col N="1659" />relating to Bosnia and Herzegovina or in a generic resolution.</P>
    <P>Ireland's view was that, while we understood the concerns of the US, we did not feel that such concerns were well founded and that the Rome Statute already contained adequate safeguards to protect all persons against politically inspired investigations or prosecutions.</P>
    <P>Ireland was a member of the UN Security Council at that time and made its views known to the UN Secretariat and to the other Security Council delegations, including the US, in the many sessions of informal, or closed-door, consultations of the Council as well as in the public meeting of the Council on 10 July 2002.</P>
    <P>These discussions culminated in the adoption of Resolution 1422 on 12 July 2002. Resolution 1422 requests the ICC, for a period of 12 months from 1 July 2002, not to commence or proceed with the investigation or prosecution of a case, if one arises, involving current or former officials or personnel from a state that contributed to a UN operation but was not a state party to the Rome Statute. The resolution also provides that the request may be renewed each 1 July for further 12 month periods.</P>
    <P>Ireland, like the other members of the Security Council with a principled attachment to the ICC, voted for Resolution 1422 with great reluctance, having secured concessions from the US side. It did so in recognition of the importance of continued US support for, and involvement in, UN peacekeeping and of the need to find a pragmatic solution, taking into account its historic commitment to UN peacekeeping and its active support for the court.</P>
    <P>Resolution 1422 expires on 1 July 2003 and Ireland has been participating in discussions with its EU partners on how best to prepare for the discussions that are likely to take place, inside and outside the Security Council, before then. I can assure the Deputy that, as the expiry of Resolution 1422 approaches, the Government will work to ensure that any outcome achieved is consistent with the EU Common Position and with Ireland's strong political support for the International Criminal Court.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 13, 18, 46, 90, 101 and 136 together.</P>
      <P>The so-called &ldquo;triple lock&rdquo; on Ireland's participation in overseas operations, including those carried out under the European security and defence policy, was set out in the National Declaration made at Seville in June 2002. This declaration made clear that Ireland would participate only in such operations that received the &ldquo;authorisation&rdquo; of the UN Security Council or General Assembly. This means that the Government will not consider Ireland's participation in an operation, unless that operation has been officially authorised by the UN.</P>
      <P>The Government has not given any consideration to modifying this triple lock on Ireland's participation in EU-led missions, nor has any proposal to amend the Defence Acts been brought before the Government.</P>
      <P>This general issue arose recently in relation to the possibility of Ireland's participation in an EU-led operation which was sanctioned but not established by the UN Security Council. This was the EU military-monitoring mission in the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, known as Operation Concordia.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While UN Security Council Resolution 1371 of September 2001 strongly supports the establishment of a multinational security presence in that <Col N="1661" />country, the Attorney-General advised the Government that this endorsement did not satisfy the requirement that the UN had either established, or authorised the establishment of the EU-led force. In the circumstances, and given that, under the Defence Acts, the Defence Forces can only serve overseas in an operation &ldquo;established&rdquo; by the UN Security Council or the General Assembly, Ireland was not in a position to participate in this force.</P>
    <P>In a broader context, there has been a significant rise in n recent years in the number of peacekeeping and peace-enforcement operations carried out by regional organisations or <i>ad hoc</i> coalitions, with the sanction or approval of the UN. This is partly due to the considerable increase in the number of peacekeeping operations, but also to the specialised nature of particular operations, the need for rapid deployment, or simply the availability of local resources and expertise.</P>
    <P>The provisions of the Defence Acts date from a period in which it was not envisaged that the UN would become increasingly reliant upon regional organisations to provide assistance with such operations. In view of the fact that UN reliance on organisations such as the EU is likely to increase rather than diminish, we will continue to monitor and assess the developing situation. I would emphasise, however, that it will be the Government's priority at all times to ensure public confidence in the arrangements for the deployment of Defence Forces personnel overseas and I believe that this position reflects the will of the majority of the Irish people.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>The EU-Russia Summit on 11 November 2002 agreed on transit arrangements for Russian citizens to and from Kaliningrad, the autonomous Russian region located between Lithuania and Poland. The agreement is due to take effect on 1 July 2003. This change to the current transit arrangements was necessary because, after enlargement, the provisions of the Schengen Convention will apply to Poland and Lithuania.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The General Affairs and External Relations Council on 14-15 April 2003, in implementation of the agreement of last November, adopted a regulation which establishes a specific facilitated transit document and facilitated rail transit document as well as a regulation on the uniform format of these documents. The new regulations have been prepared and adopted in close consultation with Lithuania and before the signature of the accession treaty so that the new arrangements <Col N="1662" />can be referred to in the Kaliningrad Protocol attached to the accession treaty.</P>
    <P>The EU has also expressed its interest in further assisting the economic development of the Kaliningrad territory. Since 1991, the European Union has committed nearly &euro;40 million in TACIS assistance under the Russia national programme. EU support has focused on a number of key sectors including border crossings, port development, waste management and human health.</P>
    <P>Kaliningrad will continue to be a priority region under the TACIS national programme for Russia and future priorities include environment, administration and law enforcement and public health. To support the effective implementation of these projects and programmes, a new TACIS  office was opened in Kaliningrad at the beginning of 2001.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government has made known to the Federal authorities in Nigeria, though the Nigerian Embassy in Dublin and our embassy in Abuja, its grave concern at the sentence of death by stoning for adultery imposed by a Sharia court in northern Nigeria on the person in question. Many of our EU partners have made similar bilateral approaches to the Nigerian Government about this case which has caused concern throughout Europe and far beyond, and rightly so. The Government believes that the sentence is in contravention of Nigeria's obligations under international human rights instruments, including, Article 5 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights which prohibits cruel, inhuman or degrading punishments, the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and the Convention on the Elimination of all Forms of Discrimination Against Women.</P>
      <P>In August 2002, the EU issued a declaration expressing its concern at the decision of a Sharia court of appeal to uphold this death sentence and its expectation that all opportunities for appeal at federal level would be made available to the individual. The case of the person in question was also forefront in the minds of the Council of the European Union when it issued a declaration in September 2002 expressing its deep concern at the continued use of the death penalty in many parts of the world and the use of particularly cruel forms of execution such as stoning.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At that time, the person in question lodged an appeal against her sentence and this is due to be heard by a higher Sharia Court of Appeal in the State of Katsina on 3 June 2003. This hearing will, of course, receive the close attention of EU <Col N="1663" />Heads of Mission in Abuja including that of our own embassy which has monitored this case for over a year.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government has not made any representations specifically on the use of cluster bombs or depleted uranium in the recent war in Iraq. However, the Government called on all combatants to respect their obligations under international humanitarian law, both in regard to the status of civilians and in regard to prisoners of war.</P>
      <P>The use of depleted uranium in munitions has for some years given rise to speculation about possible health and environmental effects. The impact of depleted uranium munitions in the Balkans has been the focus of particular attention. The United Nations Environmental Programme, UNEP, has released results of studies in Kosovo &ndash; 2001, and in Serbia and Montenegro &ndash; 2002, and Bosnia-Herzegovina &ndash; 2003. The UNEP study in Kosovo found environmental contamination was confined to impact sites, and that collateral contamination of water and vegetation was extremely low. The UNEP report on the effects of depleted uranium effects in Bosnia-Herzegovina, released in March 2003, found that recorded contamination levels are very low and do not present any immediate radioactive or toxic risks to human health. This study did confirm that depleted uranium has contaminated local supplies of drinking water in one site, but it stressed that the low levels are no cause for alarm.</P>
      <P>Having regard to the foregoing, it is clear the situation must continue to be monitored until sufficient information is gathered over a sufficient period of time to enable an informed judgment to be made about possible longer-term effects of the use of depleted uranium munitions. Ireland will continue to closely monitor developments in this area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The hazards posed by unexploded cluster bombs in a post-conflict context is of serious concern to the international community, which is endeavouring to address this question through discussions within the framework of the 1980 Convention on Certain Conventional Weapons, CCW. In December 2002, parties to the convention agreed to give a mandate to a group of governmental experts to negotiate a new instrument on &ldquo;post conflict remedial measures of a generic nature which reduce the risks of Explosive Remnants of War&rdquo;. Ireland will continue to be active in the ongoing negotiations with the aim of agreeing a legally binding instrument which <Col N="1664" />will address the issue of explosive remnants of war. In this connection, the Government recently co-sponsored an international conference on explosive remnants of war and development which was organised by Pax Christi Ireland and took place in Dublin Castle from 23 to 25 April. This conference provided both an opportunity to highlight the explosive remnants of war issue and a forum for governments, international and non-governmental organisations, researchers, representatives of the media and other experts to exchange views on the subject.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>As I stated in response to a question in the House yesterday, the road map for peace was the work of the Quartet of the European Union, Russia, the United States and the Secretary General of the United Nations. It was presented to the parties on 30 April and has now been accepted by both the Palestinian and Israeli cabinet as the basis for a settlement. The presentation of the road map was marked by a statement of the current Greek Presidency of the European Union, which welcomed the development and reiterated the well-known position of the Union. The road map and its implementation have been the subject of discussions by European Union Ministers at the General Affairs and External Relations Council on 19 May. The Council adopted conclusions reaffirming the commitment of the Union to the peace process and the implemen<Col N="1665" />tation of the road map. The road map was also discussed at the conference of foreign ministers of the Euro-Mediterranean states in the framework of the Barcelona Process, which took place in Crete earlier this week. Israeli and Palestinian Ministers attended this conference and were made aware of our expectations for progress on the road map.</P>
    <P>I would not accept that the road map is seen by the parties as the initiative of just one party. That may be how some like to present it to various constituencies, but I think that they are conscious of the reality that this initiative represents the consensus of the international community.</P>
    <P>All members of the Quartet are active in its implementation. Envoys of the Quartet have met twice during May to discuss the modalities for implementation and the resources necessary. A meeting at Ministerial level will almost certainly take place at Evian in France in the margins of the G8 Summit meeting on 3 June.</P>
    <P>The situation in the Middle East continues at the same time to be a matter of serious concern. The level of violence on both sides is frightening and willingness to engage for peace often seems subject to the latest atrocity. However, both sides have now accepted the Quartet road map, the Israeli and Palestinian Prime Ministers have met and agreed to continue to meet, the Syrian and Lebanese governments have indicated their interest in renewed peace talks and there is welcome evidence of greater engagement by the United States in the process. This may be the decisive period for the peace process and both Ireland and our European partners will continue to support the efforts of the parties, the Quartet and the regional actors.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>Sanctions were imposed and maintained by successive resolutions of the Security Council in order to ensure that Iraq was disarmed of its weapons of mass destruction. The responsibility for the continuation of sanctions until very recently lies with the refusal of the Saddam Hussein regime to co-operate fully with the arms inspectors mandated by the Security Council for this purpose. All member states are obliged under the UN Charter to accept and carry out the decisions of the Security Council. The Government could not accept the Deputy's contention that a decision taken by the Security Council was unjustified.</P>
      <P>Last November the Security Council adopted Resolution 1441 by consensus. In this resolution, the Security Council recognised the threat to international peace and security posed by Iraq's weapons of mass destruction. This was the view taken by the Security Council and it was based on the fact that Iraq had refused to permit the return of the weapons inspectors since 1998 with the consequence that they had been unable to fulfil their mandate.</P>
      <P>Subsequent to this resolution and when faced with the threat of force, Iraq accepted the return of the inspectors. However the degree of co-operation which Iraq extended to the inspectors was described by them as less than full. The reports of the inspectors made it clear that many questions remained unanswered in relation to Iraq's holdings of weapons of mass destruction. The Security Council met to consider the situation arising as a result, but was unable to reach agreement on what further steps to take to meet this situation. In these circumstances, the UK and the US decided to act on the basis of what they consider to be a mandate to use force conferred by earlier Security Council resolutions. Whether or not weapons of mass destruction are discovered in Iraq will not alter the fact that the mandate of the arms inspectors remained unfulfilled at the time of the US-led invasion.</P>
      <P>The Government welcomes the unanimous adoption of Security Council Resolution 1483 which sets out the way forward in Iraq and which lays the basis for the future democratic government and economic prosperity of that country and its people. This resolution acknowledges the fact of the US-UK occupation of Iraq and recognises the responsibilities and obligations of the occupying powers. It offers no judgment on the question of legitimacy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Resolution 1483 is essential to the reconstruction of Iraq and assures the UN and the international community a vital role in this task. Furthermore, in coming together in adopting this resolution, the Security Council has restored the unity so needed in fulfilling its role in maintaining <Col N="1667" />international peace and security. This resolution has Ireland's full support.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>At its meeting in September 2000, the UN Millennium Summit adopted the millennium declaration which included eight millennium development goals. The goals commit the international community to achieving a number of poverty-reducing development targets by 2015. The over-arching target is to reduce the proportion of people living on less than $1 per day to half the 1990 level by 2015.</P>
      <P>The international conference on financing for development, which was held in Monterrey in Mexico in March 2001, adopted the Monterrey consensus. The conference examined all possible sources of development finance, including domestic savings, trade flows, overseas development assistance, debt relief and foreign direct investment, that could be mobilised in support of the achievement of the millennium goals. A number of significant financial pledges were made by donors at Monterrey. The EU announced that its member states would increase their development assistance to an average of 0.39% of the EU's gross national income, from the 2002 average of 0.33%. The European Commission estimates that the fulfilment of this commitment will increase the EU's ODA by &euro;8 billion per year by 2006. The United States pledged to increase its core assistance to developing countries by 50% between 2002 and 2005, resulting in a $5 billion annual increase over the 2002 level of $10 billion, to a level of $15 billion per year by 2006. Other donors such as Canada and Switzerland pledged significant increases in their ODA.</P>
      <P>At its meeting on 20 May 2003, the EU General Affairs and External Relations Council discussed the Union's follow-up to the commitments made at Monterrey on the basis of a comprehensive report prepared by the Commission. In relation to the commitment on ODA, the Commission concluded that the trend in the EU is positive. In 2002, eight member states, including Ireland, had already met the target of spending 0.33% of their GNI on overseas development assistance. Ten member states will reach this objective in 2003. In addition, a dialogue has opened with the accession states about their plans to increase their ODA levels.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The UN General Assembly has asked the Secretary General to prepare an annual report on the progress achieved towards the implementation of the millennium declaration, including progress <Col N="1668" />towards the millennium development goals. The annual reports will focus on specific themes in the years up to 2005, when the Secretary General will present a comprehensive progress report covering all aspects of the millennium declaration. The 2002 report of the Secretary General indicated that the prospects for meeting the millennium development goals are mixed. While progress in Asia has been sufficient to reach all or many of the goals, much of sub-Saharan Africa is hardly advancing, or even falling back. The 2003 World Bank development indicators show that the number of people living in absolute poverty in sub-Saharan Africa rose from 241 million in 1990 to 315 million in 1999 and could reach 404 million by 2015.</P>
    <P>On current trends, therefore, it seems that the millennium development goals could largely be achieved by 2015. This success, however, would reflect reductions in the number of poor people in Asia and Latin America but not in Africa. The UN and the World Bank have concluded that achieving the goals in sub-Saharan Africa will require an increase in growth rates in the region up to 7% per annum, increased ODA targeted on countries committed to good governance and sound economic management, greater international support for the fight against HIV-AIDS and other infectious diseases and increased involvement by these countries in the international trade system.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>Policing in Northern Ireland has changed more in the past 18 months than in the previous 80 years, with the continuing implementation of the Patten reforms. The work of the Policing Board, the Police Ombudsman, the Oversight Commissioner, the Chief Constable Mr. Orde, and the Inspector of Constabulary has ensured that the vision of new policing set out in the Patten report is being made a reality.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The recent enactment of the Police (Northern Ireland) Act 2003 has given legislative effect to the commitments entered into by both Governments at Weston Park in July 2001. It brings key sections of the 2000 Act into line with Patten by enhancing the powers of the Policing Board and the ombudsman, as well as emphasising the importance of the core principle of policing with the community. It provides for secondments between the Garda Síochána and the PSNI. It will also act as a catalyst in the civilianisation process by making provision for giving police powers to police support staff. Along with these legislative changes, many significant changes are also being effected in police policies and practices, includ<Col N="1669" />ing, in particular, the development of a human rights ethos.</P>
    <P>The policing Oversight Commissioner, Mr. Tom Constantine, in his seventh report, published earlier this month, confirmed that &ldquo;excellent progress&rdquo; continues to be made in policing in Northern Ireland, citing in particular the improved emphasis on human rights, the success so far of the recruitment programme, the establishment of the district policing partnerships and the work of the Policing Board and the ombudsman. I would like to reiterate to the House the Government's support for these positive developments.</P>
    <P>I would also like to reaffirm our particular support for the work of the Police Ombudsman, whose office has done so much to instil confidence among the wider public in the development of acceptable policing. The Crompton recommendations on the activities and work of special branch arose directly from the Ombudsman's investigation into the Omagh bombing. I note that in his report, the oversight commissioner also drew attention to a number of areas where more progress needs to be made. He particularly emphasises the need for improved training through the establishment of a new police college and for further reform of Special Branch, through the implementation of the Patten, Crompton and Stevens III recommendations. We have stressed to the British Government the need to make rapid progress in areas where the oversight commissioner has expressed concern.</P>
    <P>Overall, a great deal of progress has been made in bringing about the new beginning to policing promised in the Good Friday Agreement. The Government looks forward to the continuing implementation of the necessary policing reforms &ndash; including those contained in the Patten, Crompton and Stevens recommendations and the package of measures agreed at Hillsborough &ndash; and also to Sinn Féin taking its place on the Policing Board, sooner rather than later. It is only in this context that we can have a police service that is representative of the community, that is supported by all sections of the community and that is held accountable by the chosen representatives of all sections of the community.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 24 and 61 together.</P>
      <P>The Government does not consider that suspension of the Euro-Mediterranean Association Agreement with Israel would serve any useful purpose. Any such action, as a practical matter, would have undesirable consequences, such as undercutting, as far as Israel is concerned, the role which the European Union has in the peace process, blocking Palestinian trade with the EU and rendering the continuation of our programmes of assistance to the Palestinian Authority and people more difficult to implement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Article 2 of the association agreement reinforces obligations which already fall to the signatories with respect to human rights. The European Union, especially at the meetings of the association councils with Israel, has conveyed its concerns to the Israeli authorities at the human rights implications of its security policies. Together with our partners in the Union, we will continue to take these opportunities to press the <Col N="1671" />Israeli government to respect fully its obligations under international humanitarian law, in particular the fourth Geneva Convention, and under Article 2 of the association agreement.</P>

      <P>The period ahead will be crucial in determining the conditions under which all the people of Kosovo &ndash; Albanian, Serb and others &ndash; can live together in peace, security and prosperity. The situation in Kosovo, which has implications for the whole western Balkan region, was raised in my discussions during my visit to that region between 12 and 16 May. During my visit to Pristina on 14 May I had detailed discussions with the special representative of the UN Secretary General, Michael Steiner, President Rugova, Prime Minister Rexhepi and Kosovo Serb representative Milorad Todorovic. I also met Irish citizens who are making a major contribution to the work of the international organisations and NGOs operating in Kosovo and visited the Irish Army contingent serving with the KFOR peacekeeping mission in Kosovo.</P>
      <P>I would like to pay tribute to the work of the UN mission in Kosovo in terms of the establishment of democratic and autonomous self-government, in accordance with UN Security Council Resolution 1244. Progress is being made in the face of considerable difficulty. The process of transferring powers to the provisional institutions of self-government is under way. The immediate priorities for the international community in Kosovo have to be the building of local administrative structures, the fight against organised crime, the development of sustainable economic structures, at a time when the official unemployment rate in Kosovo is 56%, and the return of displaced persons, who are primarily members of the minority Serb community.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is estimated that following the NATO intervention in 1999, most of the Kosovo Albanian population who had been forced to flee their homes returned to Kosovo. However, some 230,000 Kosovo Serbs and Roma left, and the vast majority have not yet returned. I share the concerns of Amnesty International and others at the conditions under which members of minority communities remaining in Kosovo are living and at the urgent need to create the conditions for the return of internally displaced persons to their homes. I have discussed this question with representatives of all concerned parties in Kosovo. The UN mission in Kosovo is working to accelerate the returns process by ensuring that all dis<Col N="1672" />placed persons can make a genuine choice for their future. It is important that returnees have complete and fair access to all public services, are guaranteed freedom of movement, access to their property and access to employment without discrimination.</P>
    <P>The only viable future for Kosovo lies in eventual integration into broader European structures. This process will take time and will only succeed if it is possible to build a society in which the rights of all the people of Kosovo, of whatever ethnic background, are guaranteed. This is essential for the minority communities, for the majority community and for the stability of the whole Balkan region. In my discussions in Kosovo, I urged all parties as a first step to make the necessary compromises in the weeks and months ahead to enable the opening of a practical dialogue between leaders in Pristina and Belgrade on everyday matters of mutual concern. I recognise that a decision to open such a dialogue poses major difficulties for both sides. However, I am convinced that it would be a vital contribution to the creation of the conditions under which all of the people of Kosovo could begin to have confidence in a future based on European standards, economic development and respect for human rights and the rule of law.</P>

      <P>I consider the 2002 Trócaire development review to be a thoughtful contribution to foreign policy discussion, especially regarding some of the issues which have arisen in the aftermath of the attacks on the US on 11 September 2001.</P>
      <P>The articles in the Trócaire review on the relationship between international development objectives and the reform of the EU Common Agricultural Policy are particularly relevant in the context of the WTO ministerial meeting in September next in Cancún, Mexico, which is intended to effect a significant advance in the Doha Development Agenda. In my view the Trócaire analysis on the intersection between trade and development represents an important contribution to the debate on the trade negotiations under the Doha agenda.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I believe that coherence between trade and development policies is important if maximum <Col N="1673" />effectiveness is to be achieved with the resources allocated to development co-operation. An increased share of world trade will greatly help developing countries to strengthen their economies and to lift themselves out of poverty.</P>
    <P>The continued engagement of the NGOs on these issues and the research and analysis provided in the Trócaire review are important assets as we develop our response to this critical development challenge.</P>

      <P>I propose to answer Questions Nos. 27 and 32 together.</P>
      <P>The food emergency crisis in Ethiopia is deepening. When I visited Ethiopia in January last, it was estimated that 11.3 million people would need food assistance. On 24 April, the Government of Ethiopia appealed for an increase in food aid. This new appeal reflects the findings of a multi-agency assessment and it now appears that 12.6 million people are desperately food insecure.</P>
      <P>Total food requirements for the year amount to approximately 1.54 million metric tonnes. At the moment it is estimated that there is a gap of over 300,000 metric tonnes between what is required between May and December and what is available. More than 80% of food needs are currently being met, but availability decreases dramatically from next September onwards. Thus it is essential that there is timely delivery of pledges to avoid a break in the food pipeline.</P>
      <P>I visited Ethiopia in January last to see the situation at first hand. I held discussions with Prime Minister Meles, as well as key development actors such as the World Food Programme, WFP, the EU Commission and the NGO community. We discussed ways of effectively mobilising resources for the millions who will require food assistance in 2003.</P>
      <P>On my return I wrote to my EU counterparts and called for a redoubling of efforts to tackle the crisis. I met with EU Commissioner Mr. Poul Nielson in February and we discussed the problems facing Ethiopia and ways of improving co-ordination among EU members in relation to the famine response. Mr. James Morris, executive director of the WFP, will visit Ireland in July. I hope to use this opportunity to raise the issue of food security in Ethiopia, and more widely in Africa, with him at that time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To break the cyclical nature of food insecurity <Col N="1674" />in Ethiopia, the structural problems affecting poverty and stability must be addressed. Ireland Aid is contributing to the long-term development of Ethiopia through its official programme of development co-operation with that country. The focus of this co-operation is poverty reduction, through the provision of basic needs and capacity building support. Food security needs are addressed as part of this programme.</P>
    <P>The Government has allocated &euro;3.7 million for emergency assistance to Ethiopia since the crisis emerged last year. These funds are being expended through development partners such as the WFP, Concern and GOAL. Additional funding is also being provided to NGOs in Ethiopia via the newly launched multi-annual programme scheme, MAPS, for NGOs.</P>
    <P>A senior official from my Department is currently visiting Ethiopia and will brief me on the situation on his return. The Government stands ready to provide further humanitarian assistance as required.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 29 and 154 together.</P>
      <P>The House will recall that I have addressed these cases in previous replies. My colleague, Deputy Tom Kitt, Minister of State with responsibility for overseas development and human rights, has met with the organisations concerned, and officials of my Department have met also to discuss these matters with members of the Irish Falun Dafa Association.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I stated previously, the two individuals in question are members of Falun Gong, which was banned by the Chinese authorities in July 1999. Falun Gong is regarded by the Chinese Government as an evil cult. The persons concerned are Chinese citizens, and are, therefore, subject to the laws of China while in that country. As they are not Irish citizens, Ireland has no consular func<Col N="1675" />tion in this matter, and the matter currently rests with the Chinese authorities.</P>
    <P>However, the Government takes concerns about human rights in China, including those of Falun Gong members, seriously. Human rights, including the treatment of practitioners of Falun Gong, are an integral part of our ongoing relationship with China. I raised this matter directly with the Chinese authorities during my visit to Beijing in January 2002. In December 2002, and again in February 2003, my colleague, Deputy Tom Kitt, Minister of State with responsibility for overseas development and human rights, reviewed these issues with concerned NGOs.</P>
    <P>The EU discusses key human rights concerns with China within the framework of the EU-China human rights dialogue. At the most recent session of the dialogue, which took place in Athens on 5-6 March this year, the EU conveyed its concerns in relation to the position of followers of Falun Gong. I am pleased to report that the Chinese interlocutors at the dialogue expressed a willingness to co-operate with the Office of the UN High Commission for Human Rights, and informed the EU side that they had extended invitations to visit China to the UN Special Rapporteurs on Torture, and the Right to Education, and to the UN Working Group on Arbitrary Detention. I particularly welcome the fact that China has also issued a formal invitation to the UN special rapporteur on freedom of religion, Mr. Abdelfattah Amor.</P>
    <P>At the External Relations Council in March this year, I discussed this matter with my EU colleagues, and it was agreed that the EU should convey its deep concern over reported violations of human rights in China, at the UN Commission on Human Rights, CHR. At the recent session of the CHR in Geneva, the EU urged China to take clear steps to improve the human rights situation generally, and more specifically with respect to freedoms of expression, religion and belief, which have a particular impact on practitioners of Falun Gong.</P>
    <P>Officials in my Department, both in Dublin and in the embassy in Beijing, continue to monitor these cases on an ongoing basis. </P>

      <P>It has been clear to Ireland and the EU for some time that the Government of Zimbabwe is not a willing partner in dialogue on human rights, democracy and the rule of law. So much so, that <Col N="1676" />a political dialogue initiated by the EU to address these issues was closed in February 2002 following the failure of the Government of Zimbabwe to protect human rights in that country and to engage on the subject at any meaningful level. Nevertheless, Ireland and the EU continue to be extremely vocal on the decline of democracy in Zimbabwe and the Government of that country can be in no doubt as to our stance on all issues pertaining to human rights, including freedom of speech and association.</P>
      <P>On 18 February 2003, the EU adopted a Common Position on Zimbabwe which noted the degradation in the political situation in Zimbabwe and renewed sanctions imposed on those the EU deems most responsible for the violation of human rights. Also in February, the EU issued a declaration expressing its concern at detailed incidences of arbitrary arrests and inhumane treatment of opposition members and civil society organisers and calling on the government to engage in a serious dialogue with the opposition. In March 2003, the EU condemned the violence and repression targeted against the opposition following their organisation of mass strikes in the country, and called on the Government of Zimbabwe to respect human rights and to call to account those responsible for the violence.</P>
      <P>The situation in Zimbabwe is grave and it is a particularly dangerous time for individuals who actively oppose the Government. I condemn utterly the abuses being carried out by State forces and other groups affiliated to the governing party and the lack of accountability on the part of the Government of Zimbabwe in these matters.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>The killing of Fr. Declan O'Toole and two companions in Uganda in March 2002 was a shocking tragedy. Two members of the Ugandan Army were quickly convicted of the murders by field court martial and executed. At that time, the Government expressed deep concern to the Ugandan authorities, both about the circumstances of the killings and the nature of the judicial process that followed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In response to our representations, the Ugandan Government established a five-person board of inquiry comprising senior members of the Ugandan Army to investigate the circumstances of the killings and the judicial process. This board has now reported and we have received a copy of <Col N="1677" />the report which we passed on to the O'Toole family and to the Mill Hill Fathers.</P>
    <P>A key concern on the part of the Government had been the suspicion of complicity in the murders by the Ugandan Army, arising from an incident two weeks prior to the killings in which Fr. O'Toole had been assaulted by a soldier. Our representative in Uganda made clear in his testimony to the board that the suspicion of complicity arising from this incident had to be addressed. He also expressed concern at the all-military composition of the board.</P>
    <P>In its report, the board states that it did not &ldquo;find any evidence indicating complicity of the army in the murder of Fr. O'Toole and that the murder resulted from a criminal act by two soldiers acting on their own. It concludes, in other words, that the murders were the result of a robbery attempt which went horribly wrong.</P>
    <P>The Government is currently considering the findings of the report, as are Fr. O'Toole's family and the Mill Hill Fathers, with whom we remain in close contact. Our understanding is that members of the family have not, so far, made any request for an independent inquiry into the circumstances of Fr. Declan's death.</P>
    <P>I would like to take this opportunity to reiterate the Government's deepest condolences on the death of Fr. Declan O'Toole and his two companions and to pay renewed tribute to Fr. Declan's selfless and dedicated work on behalf of the poor in Uganda. Fr. Declan stands in a great tradition of Irish missionaries who have devoted themselves at great personal sacrifice to the needs of the most disadvantaged people in Africa and elsewhere.</P>

      <P>I am aware of the statement to which the Deputy refers. The restrictions imposed by the Israeli authorities have recently been brought up with Israeli representatives by the Presidency of the European Union in both Athens and Jerusalem and by the European Commission in Brussels. I understand that the measures will be reviewed by the Israeli authorities in the next few days and I am hopeful that they will be lifted. Israel has legitimate security interests, of which we are conscious. However, it also has obligations to the population of the Occupied Palestinian Territories under the Fourth Geneva Convention. Any security measures necessary must be proportionate and take due account of the needs of the people of the territories and Israel's obligations under international humanitarian law.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to answer Questions Nos. 35, 87 and 140 together.</P>
      <P>The House will be aware that the basis for the draft treaty articles relating to security and defence lies in a specific report produced by the relevant working group of the convention. The Government was not represented on the working group, although Deputy John Gormley and Proinsias De Rossa, MEP participated in its deliberations.</P>
      <P>The Government and its representatives have engaged fully in discussions on these issues and will do so an ongoing basis. We continue to make clear that in Ireland's case, the constitutional position as regards an EU common defence is unambiguous. Ireland cannot join an EU common defence without the approval of the Irish people in a referendum.</P>
      <P>I have noted the proposals put forward for expansion of the list of so-called EU Petersberg Tasks. In several respects, these proposals are close to the Government's own views, particularly as regards the need for a more explicit conflict prevention dimension. I would, therefore, be open in principle to the ideas submitted in this area and which I would hope will allow for better coherence and effectiveness in the implementation of possible future EU crisis management operations. Moreover, a decision to launch any Petersberg Task can only be taken by the Council acting unanimously.</P>
      <P>On the issue of a possible &ldquo;solidarity clause&rdquo;, we remain open in principle to the idea of a provision that would assist in the EU's response to emergency situations and new threats arising from terrorist and non-State entities directed against civilian populations and democratic institutions situated within EU territory. In principle, Austria, Finland and Sweden also support a solidarity clause along these lines.</P>
      <P>In overall terms, I consider that the proposals put forward by the convention in the security and defence area, including the solidarity clause, will require further discussion and negotiation, both at the convention itself and at the forthcoming Inter Governmental Conference.</P>
      <P>The House will appreciate that, just as in other areas covered by the convention, it would not be appropriate for me to seek to commence those negotiations at this stage. However, I can assure Deputies that the Government's approach will take full account of Irish foreign policy traditions and principles and will seek to have those reflected to the greatest extent possible in the new EU treaty which finally emerges.</P>

      <P>A copy of the joint position paper on development co-operation in the new treaty for the European Union, which I signed on 1 May 2003 together with my development co-operation ministerial colleagues from Austria, Belgium, Germany, the Netherlands, Sweden and the UK, has been deposited in the library.</P>
      <P>The joint paper has been submitted formally by my colleague, Minister of State for European Affairs and the Government's representative at the convention, Deputy Roche, to the Convention on the Future of Europe. The following are the main principles set out in the joint position paper; the broad values and objectives of the EU expressed in the constitutional part of the treaty should reflect and reiterate the Union's commitment to sustainable development, human rights, the rule of law, democracy and good governance, peace and stability, and the eradication of poverty; the aims and principles of development co-operation and humanitarian assistance should be covered by separate chapters in the treaty. Humanitarian assistance should be carried out on an impartial basis and geared to responding to humanitarian needs resulting from natural or man-made disasters; the EU should take account of the objectives of its development policy, referred to in the treaty chapter on development co-operation, in the other policies that it implements which are likely to affect developing countries; the EU's development policy should be firmly based on the objective of eradicating poverty, a policy which concerns all developing countries and all European Community development programmes; and development co-operation and humanitarian assistance should retain the principle of the existing &ldquo;complementary competence&rdquo; between the EU and member states, whereby both parties can independently pursue their actions in parallel but working towards a common policy framework and common objectives, and increased coordination and consistency.</P>
      <P>These basic principles should be clearly reflected in a future constitutional treaty for the EU. It is essential that the convention give more attention to these important issues in their forthcoming deliberations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My colleagues and I were conscious in deciding to present our position paper that the EU is a major player in the development sphere. It is the source of more than half of the public aid efforts worldwide and is the main trading partner for many developing countries. It also has long-term relations and close political and historic ties with many developing countries. Bringing these features together, the Union has a tremendous <Col N="1681" />potential for being a strong force for global development.</P>
    <P>In my view, the discussion on a new constitutional treaty for the EU is an opportunity to realise this potential. By clarifying and making more effective the Union's approach to international development, Europe can make a significant contribution towards achieving the millennium development goals and reducing poverty across the globe. Effective development programmes could further galvanise an enlarged EU behind considerable resources and broad consensus for progressive pro-poor policies.</P>

      <P>I visited Serbia and Montenegro, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Kosovo and the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia from 12 to 16 May, as part of the preparations for Ireland's EU Presidency in 2004, during which the situation in the western Balkans will remain an important foreign policy priority for the European Union. In addition to discussing the development of the leading role the European Union is playing in the promotion of stability, democratic reform and economic progress in the western Balkans, I examined with all of the political leaders I met the areas in which we might develop closer bilateral relations. These could include the development of trade and tourism links between Ireland and the countries of the region, and appropriate assistance which Ireland might offer to the process of economic and administrative reform.</P>
      <P>In each of the cities I visited, I also met with Irish people working with international organisations and NGOs throughout the region. I would like to pay tribute to the contribution they are making, in often very difficult circumstances, to the work of building peace, stability, economic development and respect for human rights in the western Balkans. I visited the Irish Army contingent serving with the KFOR peace-keeping force in Kosovo, and was deeply impressed by their professionalism and their dedication. Their work is appreciated by the people of Kosovo, and I know that the House will join with me in expressing our pride in their contribution, which is in the highest traditions of the Defence Forces.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In Serbia and Montenegro, I had meetings with Federal President Svetozar Marovic and Foreign Minister Svilanovic, and with newly-elected President Vujanovic of Montenegro and Prime Minister Djukanovic. In Sarajevo, I met with the three members of the collective Presidency of Bosnia and Herzegovina, with Foreign Minister Ivanic and with the High Representative of the international community in Bosnia, Lord Ashdown, and the EU Monitoring Mission. In Pristina, I had <Col N="1682" />meetings with the Special Representative of the Secretary General, and head of the UN Mission in Kosovo, Michael Steiner, with President Rugova and Prime Minister Rexhepi and with Kosovo Serb representative Milorad Todorovic. In Skopje, I met with President Trajkovski, Prime Minister Crvenkovski and Foreign Minister Ilinka Mitreva, as well as with the leading representative of the Albanian community in the coalition Government, Musa Xhaferi, and with the EU Special Representative in the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia.</P>
    <P>Following more than a decade of conflict in the region, considerable progress has been made in recent years in the establishment of political stability. All of the countries of the region now have democratic Governments committed to reform and to the development of closer relations with the European Union. Inevitably given the recent history of the western Balkans, progress in the wide-ranging institutional, political and economic reform processes is somewhat uneven. However, all of the political leaders I met emphasised the importance they attach to the EU role in the region, which will be confirmed and clarified at the EU-western Balkans summit, to be held in Thessaloniki on 21 June, the day after the European Council.</P>
    <P>The European Union has taken the lead role in promoting stability, economic development and respect for human rights and the rule of law in the western Balkans, primarily through the Stabilisation and Association Process. The Thessaloniki summit will confirm the framework for the future development of relations with the countries of the region. It should issue a clear political message to the people of the region that their future lies in eventual integration into European structures, on the basis of clear and objective political and economic criteria to be met by the Governments of the individual countries concerned. Ireland will play its part in the development of this relationship, especially during our EU Presidency. I have emphasised to all the Governments of the region that we have no selfish political or economic interests to pursue in the region, but that we will attach great importance to the efficient management of all aspects of this foreign policy dossier during our Presidency.</P>
    <P>It is clear that the stability of the western Balkans is important not only for the people of the region itself, but also for the overall stability of the European continent. I would hope that we can play our part in working with the Governments of the region in the implementation of political and economic reforms, in the fight against organised crime, in establishing respect for human rights and the rule of law and in encouraging full co-operation by all parties with the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia. The political leaders of the region who are committed to reform have high expectations of the European Union, as have the people of the region, especially the young, who are particularly concerned at the high rates of unemployment <Col N="1683" />throughout the western Balkans. Following the Thessaloniki Summit, I expect that the long-term commitment of the European Union to the development of the western Balkans will be clearly stated, as will the obligations on the Governments of the region if they are to meet the hopes and expectations of their people.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 40 and 91 together. Rather than drawing any formal conclusions, the aim of the International Conference on Explosive Remnants of War and Development, hosted by my Department and organised by Pax Christi Ireland, was to provide a forum for governments, international and non-governmental organisations, researchers, representatives of the media and other experts to exchange views on the subject of explosive remnants of war. The conference was funded by the Government in conjunction with the Governments of Austria, Canada, The Netherlands, Norway and Sweden.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The conference also provided an opportunity to highlight the explosive remnants of war issue on which negotiations are taking place in the con<Col N="1684" />text of the 1980 Convention on Certain Conventional Weapons, CCW. In December 2002, states party to the convention agreed to give a mandate to a group of governmental experts to negotiate a new instrument on &ldquo;post conflict remedial measures of a generic nature which reduce the risks of Explosive Remnants of War&rdquo;. The co-ordinator of this group, Ambassador Chris Sanders, together with a representative of the International Committee of the Red Cross and representatives of several NGOs active in the field addressed the conference. The very useful and interesting papers submitted during the conference will be compiled and presented at the next meeting of the group of governmental experts which will meet in Geneva in June. We hope that these papers will provide a valuable input into their further deliberations.</P>
    <P>My colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Roche, in opening the conference stressed Ireland's strong support for and interest in contributing to the development of international controls to reduce the suffering caused by unexploded ordnance and other explosive remnants of war. The Minister of State, Deputy Kitt, who delivered closing remarks focused on the implications of explosive remnants of war for development and highlighted the contribution which Ireland Aid is making in support of organisations working with affected populations. Ireland will continue to be active in the ongoing negotiations with the aim of agreeing a legally binding instrument which will address the issue of explosive remnants of war.</P>

      <P>The Council continues to be alarmed at the ongoing illegal settlement activities and land confiscations for the construction of the so-called security fence, which are an obstacle to peace by threatening to render the two-state solution physically impossible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government has consistently taken the view that the transfer of its own population into occupied territory by an occupying power is a flagrant breach of the Fourth Geneva Convention. The settlements established in the occupied Palestinian territories of the West Bank and the Gaza Strip by the Israeli authorities are illegal and must <Col N="1685" />be dismantled. Land seizures by the occupation forces for the purposes of settlement are null and void.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>The overarching goal of Ireland Aid, the Government's official programme of development assistance, is to reduce poverty in developing countries. Within that overarching objective, the millennium development goals, eight targets promulgated by the United Nations at a series of international summit meetings, provide the basis for Ireland's engagement and, indeed, that of virtually all donor countries and multilateral agencies. The choice of development sectors in which Ireland Aid focuses its co-operation flows from those goals and includes education, health, agriculture and food security, water and sanitation, the construction of rural roads and good governance.</P>
      <P>Achievement of Ireland Aid objectives has been facilitated through substantial increases in resources in recent years pursuant to the Government's commitment to achieving the UN target for ODA of 0.7% of GNP by the end of 2007. This year, the Government has allocated &euro;374 million to Ireland Aid, while elements of official development assistance, ODA, expected to total some &euro;80 million in 2003, are administered by other Departments. Total ODA is therefore expected to reach &euro;450 million in 2003, the highest ever allocation in the history of the programme. Current indications are that this will equate to 0.41% of GNP, with the result that, in percentage terms, Ireland is now the seventh-largest donor internationally, just behind Belgium at 0.42%, and our performance is well above the EU average.</P>
      <P>Against the backdrop of recent rapid expansion and projected continued growth, the Government commissioned an independent review of Ireland Aid. The review led to the publication last year of a comprehensive report presenting a wide range of recommendations. The report, which was approved by the Government, concluded that the existing objectives and policy approaches of Ireland Aid have been correct and that those represent considerable strengths on which future development should be built. It provides the framework within which the Ireland Aid work plan will be designed over the next few years. Substantial progress has been made in implementing the report's recommendations and work will continue on this front in 2003.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As in previous years, the bilateral programme will constitute the centrepiece of the Ireland Aid work plan in 2003. The focus of the bilateral pro<Col N="1686" />gramme, which will amount to some &euro;254 million this year, is on six least-developed programme countries in sub-Saharan Africa and on East Timor, which was added as the seventh programme country in March 2003. The thrust of the programme in those countries is on basic needs, rural development, education, health, and democracy and good governance. Most support is delivered in the form of integrated programmes at regional or local level, selected in consultation with partner governments. Ireland Aid will also continue to work with governments and other donors on general budget support and sectoral investment programmes.</P>
    <P>Some &euro;23 million is provided in 2003 for Emergency Humanitarian Assistance. Support to date in 2003 has focused in particular on Iraq. We will continue to strengthen and deepen our support for the work of non-governmental organisations, NGOs, in 2003. The establishment of the multi-annual partnership scheme, MAPS, will place funding for five larger NGOs on a multi-annual, programmatic basis, and that represents a major strengthening of our co-operation with the civil-society sector.</P>
    <P>Some &euro;22 million will be allocated in 2003 through APSO. That increased budget includes provision for the new Missionary Development Fund, which was established late last year. Regarding multilateral assistance, our voluntary contribution to UN agencies will amount to &euro;38 million in 2003, while a further &euro;12 million will be allocated to the European Development Fund. Preparations for Ireland's Presidency of the EU, which covers the first half of 2004, will be a major priority on the multilateral side of Ireland Aid. In addition, our Presidency will involve a major co-ordination role for Ireland at a number of major international development conferences due to take place next year and advance preparation for those conferences will constitute a key element of the Ireland Aid work plan in 2003.</P>
    <P>The Government recognises that HIV-AIDS is a major public health and development challenge in poorer countries which are recipients of development assistance and that advances in poverty reduction in such situations cannot be made in the absence of an urgent and sustained response to HIV-AIDS. Pursuant to a commitment made by the Taoiseach at the UN special session on HIV-AIDS in 2001, Government support for the fight against the epidemic in developing countries has increased substantially, and this year we expect to provide more than &euro;50 million for HIV-AIDS activities across the various elements of the Ireland Aid programme. In addition to increasing levels of funding, Ireland will advocate a more urgent and mainstreamed EU response to the issue in the context of our forthcoming EU Presidency.</P>

      <P>The Government's national programme of assistance to developing countries comprises two elements.

      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 48,157 and 168 together.</P>
      <P>I remain deeply conscious of the enormity of the challenges facing African nations as they seek to build the foundations of economic and social development, often in a climate of war and starvation. Ireland continues to address these challenges bilaterally and with our partners in the European Union and the United Nations. The focus of the work of Ireland Aid, the official development assistance programme of the Government, remains on Africa, where most of the poorest countries of the world are located.</P>
      <P>Ireland Aid responds in two ways to the development needs of Africa and beyond. In the short-term we focus on saving lives in the most effective way possible, through direct assistance via the UN system and international agencies as well as non-governmental organisations. In the long-term, Ireland Aid's development programmes tackle the structural reasons underlying endemic poverty and insecurity, particularly on the African continent.</P>
      <P>Last year the Government intervened to provide emergency and recovery assistance on over 70 occasions in more than a dozen countries throughout Africa, including the major countries of the Horn of Africa namely, Ethiopia, Eritrea and Somalia. This humanitarian assistance amounted to more than &euro;20 million. These interventions were designed to reduce the effects of famine and conflict on some of the most vulnerable populations in Africa with a particular emphasis on women and children.</P>
      <P>To date this year we have assisted the following countries in Africa in addressing emergencies both natural and man-made: Malawi, Zimbabwe, Ivory Coast, Liberia, Uganda, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Ethiopia, Eritrea, Sierra Leone, Angola, Guinea, and Burundi. We have also assisted a number of regional programmes addressing emergency needs across international boundaries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Our direct humanitarian assistance is complemented by ongoing political action. In relation to food insecurity, we have been working closely with our partners in the EU and the UN to develop strategies on how immediate needs can best be met at national and regional level. We have also funded valuable applied research into food security issues through the consultative group on international agricultural research. Regarding conflict and war, we work closely with our partners in the EU and UN to support efforts <Col N="1689" />to prevent, mitigate and resolve conflict situations. Ireland has contributed to peace and democratic processes in Sierra Leone, Angola and Rwanda, as well as contributing to many small scale community-based human rights and democracy initiatives in countries such as Nigeria, Ghana, Kenya and Malawi. Ireland Aid has developed a strategic partnership with the International Committee of the Red Cross which focuses on protection of civilians in conflict situations in Africa.</P>
    <P>I have visited a number of famine-affected countries in Africa in the last year. I have communicated directly with my EU counterparts to urge a greater humanitarian response. I have also met with key figures in the EU and UN, including the EU Commissioner with responsibility for development, the deputy executive director of the UN World Food Programme and the secretary general of the International Federation of the Red Cross to highlight my concerns and to discuss ways of improving the co-ordination of assistance. Mr. James Morris, executive director of the World Food Programme will visit Ireland in July. This will provide a valuable opportunity for discussions on the food security situation in Africa and elsewhere.</P>
    <P>If we are to break the cyclical nature of food insecurity and conflict in Africa, the underlying structural problems affecting poverty and stability must be addressed. Ireland Aid has strong development partnerships with six countries in sub-Saharan Africa. Through these partnerships Ireland Aid engages with the Governments, donors, EU and UN agencies on the basis of poverty reduction strategy plans. The PRSPs outline how each country prioritises resources and policies with the objective of reducing poverty. These programmes contain a strong governance element throughout to assist in the building of democratic structures, the rule of law and a culture of respect for human rights.</P>
    <P>This comprehensive and African-owned approach by donors, governments and civil societies stands the best chance of reversing the downward spiral of economic and social indicators in sub-Saharan Africa, reducing conflict and hunger and facilitating real and positive change in the lives of millions of Africans.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>In July 2002, my Department and the Department <Col N="1690" />of Finance published a joint debt strategy. The strategy examined the effectiveness of the World Bank-IMF enhanced heavily indebted poor countries initiative, the current international response to the problem of the unsustainable debt burden on many of the world's poorest countries.</P>
      <P>The strategy concluded that the HIPC was not delivering a sustainable exit from the debt treadmill. It called for reforms to the way in which the World Bank and the IMF assessed levels of debt sustainability. It also indicated that the Government believed total debt cancellation to be a politically acceptable objective and one that it would support. The strategy made clear that debt cancellation would have to be funded through additional donor contributions and not from the existing resources of the IMF and the World Bank. Debt cancellation would also have to be closely linked with good governance and sound economic management.</P>
      <P>Since the publication of the debt strategy, the Government has promoted its conclusions and objectives at the World Bank, the IMF and in discussions with other donors both at the UN and in the OECD. I conveyed our views on debt directly to the President of the World Bank during his visit to Ireland in January 2003. The debt strategy was also highlighted by the Taoiseach in his address to the bank in March 2003.</P>
      <P>In April 2003, Government representatives attended the spring meetings of the World Bank and the IMF in Washington for detailed discussions with senior officials from these institutions on the issues raised in our debt strategy. In May 2003, the Government was also represented at a meeting of the finance ministers of the heavily indebted poor countries organised by Debt Relief International, an intergovernmental organisation supported by Ireland. This meeting included a technical debate between donors, including Ireland, the HIPC finance ministers, the World Bank and the IMF on the problems of debt sustainability based on a paper prepared by the Bank.</P>
      <P>In May, the Government was represented at the annual World Bank conference on development economics to participate in a panel discussion on the issue of human development indicators and debt sustainability which was based on many of the ideas promoted in our debt strategy. Ireland also participated in a meeting of European NGOs devoted to development financing issues, including debt sustainability.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At the EU General Affairs and External Relations Council on 20 May, Ireland welcomed the announcement by the EU Commission that it was initiating an analysis of debt sustainability in view of the current problems of many HIPC countries in achieving a sustainable exit from the debt treadmill. From these, and other international meetings, it is increasingly clear that many of the concerns raised by Ireland Aid and the Department of Finance on the issue of debt sustainability are now shared by other donors, by developing countries and by the World Bank and <Col N="1691" />the IMF. We will continue to participate actively in developing the international debate about debt sustainability and the need to ensure that efforts by the world's poorest countries to meet the millennium development goals are not frustrated by unsustainable debt burdens.</P>

      <Quest>if he remains committed to the education for all programme agreed at Senegal in 2000; if his attention has been drawn to the considerable concern that sufficient funding is not being allocated to ensure that the goals are met; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>Education is one of the most important instruments for reducing poverty and inequality and for laying the basis for sustained economic growth. The importance of every child in every country having the opportunity to complete primary school forms the basis of the Dakar Framework for Action agreed in Senegal at the World Education Forum in 2000. The Dakar goals were affirmed again as Millennium Development Goals at the UN Summit in September 2000. I am fully committed to the collective undertakings which we made at Dakar.</P>
      <P>Support for education is an integral element of the Government's strategy for reducing poverty and promoting human development in developing countries. Our overall aim is to assist partner countries to build sustainable education systems appropriate to their needs. We support not only the internationally agreed targets but also the achievement of locally set objectives which are developed in consultation with stakeholders in education in the country concerned.</P>
      <P>The depth of our commitment is evidenced by the considerable proportion of our aid budget which is allocated to education. In the last decade, even though the level of aid flows to education have declined worldwide, Ireland's financial contribution to this sector has significantly increased.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1692" />In 2002 a total of &euro;47 million was spent on education. The corresponding figures for 2001 and 1999 were &euro;37 million and &euro;15 million, respectively. Of this total expenditure, the largest proportion is allocated to basic education. In 2001, for example, primary education accounted for 79% of total expenditure.</P>
    <P>While our allocations to the education sector have been on the increase, this is not the trend at international level. I am concerned at the gap which is developing between the goals we agreed in Dakar and the achievements to date as outlined in the Education for All Global Monitoring report published in 2002. Progress towards the Dakar goals is insufficient and the world is not on track to achieve Education for All by 2015. It is estimated that US$4.2 billion annually will be required over the 15 year period if the education for all goals are to be met. This would require a tripling of the current level of resources. In view of the critical importance of education in poverty reduction, I will ensure that education remains a key priority for the Government's aid programme and that allocations to this sector reflect the emphasis attached to it at Dakar.</P>

      <P>My Department has raised the findings of the Amnesty International report, referred to by the Deputy, with the Canadian authorities. It was drawn to their attention that Ireland is committed to promoting and protecting the human rights of indigenous peoples, and calls on all states to respect their obligations under international human rights instruments to which they are party.</P>
      <P>Ireland voices its concerns on these issues in partnership with other like minded countries in international fora. At the 59th session of the Commission on Human Rights, which concluded in Geneva last month, Ireland co-sponsored a resolution on the Working Group on Indigenous Populations of the Sub-Commission on the Promotion and Protection of Human Rights and the International Decade of the World's Indigenous People. </P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 54, 56, 97, 145 and 162 together. I have been following closely, for some considerable time, developments in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. On a number of occasions in this House, I have articulated my concern about events there. Throughout Ireland's recent membership of the UN Security Council, we were constantly vocal on this matter. Several months ago, as a member of the Security Council, Ireland warned that the Council would need to continue monitoring closely the situation in the province of Ituri and to make, if necessary, the appropriate adjustments to the mandate of the UN peacekeeping force in that country in the light of the crisis.</P>
      <P>While there has been a great deal of progress, at the political level, in the peace process in recent months, this has not been reflected in developments on the ground in Ituri where the situation has been deteriorating. Widespread international attention has only recently been drawn to the widespread, savage, murder and maiming of civilians, which has been going on for many months.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is absolutely vital that the international presence on the ground be substantially strengthened as a matter of urgency in order to prevent the situation in Ituri and, in particular Bunia, from deteriorating further. The UN has approximately 700 MONUC military personnel in Bunia at present, but it has neither the mandate nor the <Col N="1694" />resources to come to grips with a crisis that has deteriorated badly. I share the concerns of Amnesty International, Oxfam, Human Rights Watch and other human rights groups regarding the need for the immediate deployment of a multinational force pending the expansion of MONUC. There is a clear obligation on the international community to respond urgently to this crisis.</P>
    <P>The United Nations Department of Peacekeeping Operations has been in contact with a number of states requesting them to participate in a possible interim multinational force to be deployed, under French leadership, to stabilise the situation in Ituri. Discussions are continuing in New York among Security Council members with a view to the authorisation of such a force by the Council. I understand that Council members are sympathetic in principle. However, a number of issues have yet to be clarified, including the attitude towards the deployment of any such force on the part of neighbouring states, particularly Rwanda. The UN Under-Secretary General for Peacekeeping has been in the region in recent days to explore urgently these and other questions surrounding the establishment and deployment of a force. Current indications suggest that while it is likely that such a force would have a UN mandate, with express authority to act under Chapter VII of the UN Charter, it may not be a UN force <i>per se.</i> Its deployment would allow time for the strengthening of the existing UN force in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, MONUC, which is due to be expanded this summer.</P>
    <P>Following contact between UN Secretary General Annan and President Chirac, a French military team is already on the ground in Ituri conducting a risk assessment in preparation for the possible deployment of such a multinational force.</P>
    <P>The urgency of the crisis in Ituri was raised last week at the meeting of the EU General Affairs and External Relations Council. Along with my European counterparts, we discussed what support the European Union could give to the international efforts under way to help alleviate the situation. We mandated the High Representative, Mr. Solana, to follow up on the matter, in co-operation with our representatives to the Political and Security Committee and in continued close co-ordination with the United Nations. The possibility of the EU taking responsibility for the multinational force is under consideration. The Government will strongly support every effort to address the crisis, including the need for the European Union to support the efforts of the UN Secretary General.</P>
    <P>Ireland has not yet been approached by either the UN or the EU regarding participation on our part in any new force that may be established. We already have two military officers serving with MONUC. Should we be approached, the Government will consider the matter in light of the mandate establishing the force as well as the nature <Col N="1695" />of the request and the availability of personnel and resources.</P>

      <P>I understand that the Deputy is referring to the Irish Human Rights Commission's strategy plan for 2003 &ndash; 2006, Promoting and Protecting Human Rights in Irish Society. The document, published in April, outlines the guidelines under which the Commission operates and sets out the key areas of work on which the Commission proposes to focus over the next four years. The implementation of its plan is a matter for the Commission itself.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy is aware the Human Rights Commission is a statutorily constituted independent body, established under the Human Rights Commission Acts of 2000 and 2001. In accordance with the legislation, the mandate of the Human Rights Commission is primarily to promote and protect human rights within the State; as such, most of the issues it will seek to address fall outside the remit of my Department.</P>
      <P>At the same time, a number of the issues which the Commission highlights in its strategy plan derive from the Good Friday Agreement, have an international dimension, or are of considerable importance in Ireland's human rights foreign policy. I welcome the Commission's interest in these areas, and will give careful consideration to any views or recommendations which it may wish to convey to me on these issues.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>On 23 March 2003 a referendum was held in Chechnya on a new constitution for the republic under which Chechnya will remain part of the Russian Federation but with some degree of autonomy. The Central Election Commission stated that <Col N="1697" />95.97% of votes cast were in favour of the new constitution. Due to security concerns, the OSCE Office of Democratic Institutions and Human Rights, ODIHR, did not conduct a standard election observation mission in respect of the referendum. A small ODIHR expert team which travelled to Chechnya in the context of the referendum acknowledged irregularities in the voting process but noted expressions of hope from voters that the referendum would lead to a political process which would bring peace and stability. Following on from the adoption of the new constitution, presidential elections are expected to be held in Chechnya before the end of the year.</P>
      <P>President Putin has made it clear in his statements that he believes the referendum to have been a success and that it marks the first stage of the reconstruction process in Chechnya. On 21 May, the state Duma, Parliament, gave preliminary approval to a Bill submitted by President Putin proposing an amnesty for rebels who disarm by 1 September and to others involved in the conflict, provided that they have not committed serious crimes such as murder, rape or kidnapping. The presidential administration has presented the amnesty as a second major move towards peace, following on from the constitutional referendum in March.</P>
      <P>As I stated in reply to a parliamentary question on 5 March last, Ireland, together with our partners in the European Union, supports continued dialogue with the Russian Federation on a range of human rights issues, including the situation in Chechnya. At the EU-Russia Summit in November 2002, the Danish Presidency raised EU concerns about Chechnya with President Vladimir Putin, and reiterated the European Union's belief that there must be a political solution there. The Chechnya issue will feature in discussions at the EU-Russia Summit in St. Petersburg this weekend which the Taoiseach will attend.</P>
      <P>Ireland has also raised the issue of human rights in Russia, including Chechnya, in international fora and bilaterally with the Russian Federation, through diplomatic channels. Most recently, my colleagues, the Minister of State, Deputy Roche, and the Minister of State, Deputy Kitt, have raised the Chechnya issue with the Russian Deputy Prime Minister Chizhov and in other bilateral contacts. They have assured the Russian Federation of our concern and interest in the issue and conveyed our hope that there can be an inclusive settlement which brings peace to Chechnya.</P>
      <P>I repeat my strong condemnation of the bomb attacks in the region on 12 and 14 May last in which more than 70 people were killed and hundreds more injured. The Government remains concerned about the security and human rights situation in Chechnya and the prospects for a peace settlement there.</P>

      <P>The Government's concern that the detainees in Guantanamo Bay be treated in accordance with the provisions of international human rights and humanitarian law has been communicated to the US authorities. In this regard I refer the Deputy to my reply given to Parliamentary Questions Reference Nos. 3976 and 3977 of 7 February 2002. In addition, as I stated in my reply to Parliamentary Question No. 9959 of 9 April 2003, in discussions of the matter with our EU partners, my Department has learned that a number of EU partners whose citizens have been detained in Guantanamo Bay are seeking to resolve issues relating to their treatment with the US authorities.</P>
      <P>I understand that, in recent weeks, a number of detainees have been released and returned to their countries. I also understand that the US authorities are in the process of setting up military commissions before which selected persons may be tried for terrorist activities, and have recently appointed two military lawyers who will take charge of the prosecution and defence in these cases. I continue to hold the view, previously expressed to the US authorities and others, that it is important to maintain the highest international standards at all times.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 64, 73, 74 and 86 together.</P>
      <P>The Government, in continuing partnership with the British Government, remains fully committed to the full implementation of the Good Friday Agreement, which is our template for future progress in Northern Ireland. In recent weeks and months real progress has been made. This progress is reflected in the Joint Declaration of the two Governments and associated documents published at the beginning of May. The Joint Declaration contains many elements that we can and will implement, for example in the areas of policing, criminal justice, equality, human rights and some aspects of normalisation. This work will be actively advanced through the British-Irish Intergovernmental Conference.</P>
      <P>It is regrettable that it has not proved possible to establish a basis for the early restoration of the devolved institutions in Northern Ireland. All of us have a collective responsibility to make this process work and we will continue to engage with the parties to try to resolve the impasse. This requires a cessation of all paramilitary activity, in accordance with paragraph 13 of the Joint Declaration, as well as achieving a stable and sustainable basis for the full operation of the institutions of the Agreement.</P>
      <P>When I met with the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland on 20 May at the British-Irish Intergovernmental Conference, we discussed the need to regain momentum in the political process. We agreed on the need for political parties to press on with dialogue with a view to developing a positive context for the holding of elections. In the Government's view these should take place at the earliest opportunity, and, regardless of any other considerations, no later than the autumn.</P>
      <P>I also availed of the conference to raise recent allegations of collusion and intelligence activities involving the security forces in Northern Ireland and expressed our serious concern at media reports in this regard. The conference will meet again in the coming weeks and will continue to reflect the determination of both Governments, as guarantors of the Good Friday Agreement, to fully implement it to the greatest extent possible, and to work towards the restoration of the devolved institutions at an early date.</P>

However, on 21 April 2003, the LTTE suspended its participation in the peace process, and demanded that an interim administration be established to govern the conflict zone, and announced that it would not attend an international donors conference, scheduled to take place in Tokyo, from 9-10 June 2003. The LTTE claimed that it is not receiving sufficient dividends from the peace process. Intensive negotiations are currently taking place to resolve the impasse. The international donors conference in Tokyo is expected to raise substantial pledges for reconstruction funding to Sri Lanka. The EU has committed to pledging over &euro;50 million in assistance to the peace process.</P>
      <P>Despite the suspension by the LTTE of its participation in the peace process, it continues to abide by the terms of the ceasefire. Although there have been a number of politically-motivated killings and attacks by the Tamil Tigers, the ceasefire is broadly considered to be holding.</P>
      <P>On 21 May 2003, I met with the Sri Lankan Foreign Minister, Mr. Tyronne Fernando, in Dublin. The Minister and I reviewed the peace process, and the current situation in Sri Lanka. Minister Fernando also met with the Taoiseach, and with my colleague, Deputy Kitt, Minister for Overseas Development and Human Rights. Minister Fernando also briefed the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs. During that meeting, he stated that the Sri Lankan Government believes that a transparent and incremental process is the only way to resolve the conflict, and that a military solution is not viable. He said that the Tamil Tigers are still committed to the peace process, and that he was hopeful that they would attend the forthcoming Tokyo Conference.</P>
      <P>The Government continues to monitor the situation closely with our EU partners. We support the mediation efforts of the Norwegian Government, and welcome the current talks taking place between Norwegian peace envoy, Mr. Erik Solheim, and negotiators from both sides in the peace process.</P>

      <P>The Department of Foreign Affairs is keeping the situation in Saudi Arabia under continuous review. On 14 May, in response to the tragic events of 12 May 2003, it issued travel advice to Irish citizens which sets out the current situation in the country and makes recommendations to Irish citizens residing there or intending to travel. In light of these very serious incidents and the general tension in the region, further such attacks in the Kingdom cannot be ruled out. Irish citizens are therefore advised against all non-essential travel to Saudi Arabia at the present time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1701" />For those Irish citizens travelling to or remaining in Saudi Arabia, we most strongly stress the importance of maintaining the highest levels of personal security. We advise citizens to continue to keep a low profile and to limit travel within the Kingdom to essential journeys only. We also advise citizens to be especially vigilant in places popular with foreign nationals such as hotels, restaurants and shopping malls. Finally, citizens are urged to ensure the safety of their vehicles at all times. Citizens who have not registered with the embassy are advised to do so immediately.</P>

      <P>My Department is up to date with the multi-faceted situation in Colombia, including the question of hostages, through our embassy based in Mexico City, which is also accredited to Bogotá, as well as through our EU partners with resident diplomatic missions in that capital. My own most recent direct discussion of the Colombian conflict with the Colombian foreign minister, Ms Carolina Barco, took place on 28 March last.</P>
      <P>As the House is aware from my replies to previous questions on this subject, Ms Ingrid Betancourt &ndash; a candidate in the 2002 Colombian presidential election &ndash; was kidnapped by the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, FARC, on 23 February 2002. She remains in FARC captivity, along with the former Governor of Meta province, a former cabinet minister, 12 regional deputies, 47 members of the State security forces, and several thousand ordinary Colombian citizens. Three US citizens are also being held captive. I share the concern that the lives of these hostages, including that of Ms Betancourt, are in danger. That concern has increased following the murder by FARC on 5 May last of ten hostages including the Governor of Antioquia province, Dr Guillermo Gaviria Correa.</P>
      <P>On 7 May 2003, Ireland and our EU partners condemned the murder of the kidnap victims and while expressing the hope that all possible efforts would be made to safeguard the lives of all the other hostages, emphasised that hostage-taking is recognised as an act of terrorism and called for the release of all the hostages without preconditions. Our EU statement also expressed the belief that every effort should be made to start up again as soon as possible the search for a humanitarian agreement on the specific hostage question as well as for a negotiated political solution to the overall conflict.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I have previously informed the House, on 31 January 2003 President Uribe established a commission to evaluate the possibility of a humanitarian exchange of hostages held by <Col N="1702" />FARC for terrorist prisoners detained by the state authorities. The three-member commission is composed of Monsignor Luis Augusto Castro, vice-president of the Colombian Episcopal Conference, Mr. Angelino Garzón, a former minister for labour, and Father Darío Echeverri, the secretary of the Catholic Conciliation Commission. As I have also told the House, FARC apparently responded by proposing a number of pre-conditions, including the restoration of the kind of clearance zone ceded to them by President Pastrana in 1998 but which he felt obliged to withdraw in 2002 when he judged that FARC had abused it. It is earnestly to be hoped that a way can nevertheless be found to alleviate the plight of Colombia's many kidnap victims, including Ms Ingrid Betancourt, and that of their families, while also working towards a negotiated solution to the conflict which afflicts that country.</P>

      <P>The Good Friday Agreement provided that consideration be given to the establishment of an independent consultative forum appointed by the two administrations, North and South, and representative of civil society on the island. At the fourth plenary meeting of the North-South Ministerial Council, which took place in Armagh on 28 June 2002, an outline structure for the forum was agreed. This involves a twice yearly conference, alternating between North and South and comprising representatives of civil society on the island. The planning and organisation of the first conference was to be undertaken by a steering committee drawn from the Northern Ireland Civic Forum and the social partners in the South. The steering committee would also invite representatives from a range of relevant organisations, North and South, to participate in the conferences.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The valuable contribution of the social partners to North-South partnership through a range of agreed actions and objectives is recognised by the Government. Under the new social partnership agreement, the social partners will continue to make this contribution, including through participation in the Independent North-South Consultative Forum, when established. Some progress had been made on implementing the North-South Ministerial Council decision to establish the forum prior to the suspension of the Northern <Col N="1703" />Ireland Assembly on 15 October 2002. However, with suspension, further progress was not possible. The two Governments remain committed to the full implementation of the Good Friday Agreement and, as envisaged in the Joint Declaration published on 1 May, it is our intention that the consultative forum will be established as soon as possible, once the institutions are restored.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>Under the UN Charter, the Economic and Social Council, known as ECOSOC, is responsible for promoting higher standards of living; full employment and economic and social progress; identifying solutions to international economic, social and health problems; facilitating international cultural and educational co-operation; and encouraging universal respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms. ECOSOC has taken a lead role in key policy areas in recent years. For example, at recent annual sessions, Ministers have proposed specific actions to address the digital divide which are currently being acted upon by the international community and by the UN system. In 2002 ECOSOC gave the first formal international endorsement of the New Partnership for Africa's Development, NEPAD. At this year's annual ECOSOC meeting, Ministers will consider how to promote an integrated approach to rural development for poverty eradication and sustainable development. There have been several reforms in recent years, including by the UN Secretary General, which have resulted in the streamlining of ECOSOC's working methods and making its work programme more relevant. These have included efforts to bring the Council closer to the Bretton Woods Institutions. ECOSOC has since 1998 held a high level meeting each April with the Finance Ministers who chair key committees at the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund and with the chair of the General Council of the WTO. Any more fundamental changes leading to a substantial alteration of the Council's mandate would require amendments to the relevant provisions of the UN Charter. Ireland has been elected by the General Assembly to take up a three-year term on the 54 member council from 2003-2005. We will use our membership to continue to support the efficient and effective functioning of ECOSOC in accordance with its mandate under the UN Charter. The issue of ECOSOC's transformation into a permanent economic and security council has been discussed from time to time at the UN, most recently in the debate at the International Conference on Financing for Development &ndash; April 2002. There has, to date, been no consensus on the proposal. Ireland believes that the UN General Assembly, to which ECOSOC reports, which includes all member states of the UN is the appropriate forum for high level debate on the issues which fall within ECOSOC's remit. We are not convinced that the proposal to establish a permanent economic and social council is either politically achievable or necessary. Such a body would, in our view, conflict with the present role of the General Assembly and <Col N="1705" />would not necessarily be in the interests of all UN member states, particularly small member states. Instead we prefer to work for improved coherence between the UN, including ECOSOC, the Bretton Woods Institutions and the World Trade Organisation. The International Conference on Financing for Development agreed measures to strengthen this coherence to which all of the relevant institutions have subscribed and which are now being implemented. Efforts to strengthen coherence between these institutions were examined at a special high level meeting including ECOSOC, the Bretton Woods Institutions and the WTO in New York in April 2003 and will be considered further at a ministerial meeting during the General Assembly in October 2003.</P>

      <P>The European Union Secretary-General-High Representative for the Common Foreign and Security Policy, Dr. Javier Solana visited Ireland on 20 and 21 May 2003. Dr. Solana regularly visits EU member states and his visit to Dublin was part of a programme of such visits. It had added significance as an opportunity to have the benefit of Dr. Solana's advice as Ireland continues its preparations for taking on the Presidency of the EU for the first half of 2004.</P>
      <P>During my meeting with Dr. Solana, we had a wide ranging and forward looking discussion on many of the current issues on the international agenda. We discussed the situation in the western Balkans in the light of my recent visit to the region. The EU will continue to take the lead role in the stabilisation and consolidation of the peace in this region and it will continue to be high on the EU agenda during our Presidency.</P>
      <P>We also discussed the situation in the Middle East Dr. Solana had just returned from a visit to the region and shared with us his assessment of the situation on the ground. We both emphasised the importance of the acceptance of the quartet roadmap for peace in the Middle East, and the need for early progress in its implementation. We also discussed the situation in Iraq, and anticipated the outcome of the negotiations in the Security Council in New York on the draft resolution on Iraq, adopted the following day as Resolution 1483. We both agreed on the importance of the adoption of this resolution as a demonstration of the united purpose of the international community to meet the needs of the people of Iraq.</P>
      <P>We had a good exchange of views on issues under consideration in the Convention on the Future of Europe, in particular on the proposals in relation to external relations and security and defence policy. Dr. Solana was already very familiar with Ireland's approach on these issues.</P>

      <P>The Irish Government agrees with Deputy Mitchell &ndash; as does the EU as a whole &ndash; that terrorism is a serious threat to international security, to peaceful relations between states and to the development and functioning of democratic institutions worldwide.</P>
      <P>Ireland and its EU partners categorically condemn all acts of terrorism as criminal and unjustifiable, irrespective of the motivation of the perpetrators.</P>
      <P>We must meet the threat of international terrorism on three levels. First, we must, as member states of the United Nations and of the European Union, do all we can to bring to justice the perpetrators, organisers and sponsors of previous terrorist attacks and to prevent further such atrocities. Second, we must combine in a longer-term initiative to defeat the monster of international terrorism; by choking off its funds, by cutting its supply of munitions and technical support and by denying it the bases from which it plans and prepares its actions. Third, we must redouble our efforts to put an end to the many conflicts and injustices, which, while they can never, ever justify terrorist atrocities, are exploited by the terrorists to garner support for their warped philosophies.</P>
      <P>Until such time as the values of peaceful tolerance and mutual respect come to be universally acknowledged, the international community has no choice but to persist in the concerted and multi-faceted response which it developed in the wake of the al Qaeda attacks of 11 September 2001.</P>
      <P>Resolution 1373, adopted by the UN Security Council on 28 September 2001, imposes obligations on member states under Chapter VII of the UN Charter and particularly emphasises measures that must be taken to combat the financing of terrorism. The Counter-Terrorism Committee, CTC, has broken new ground in its monitoring of the implementation of the resolution by UN member states, offering guidance to States on whether they need to raise their capacity in the areas covered by the resolution and, where appropriate, facilitating the provision of relevant assistance programmes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1708" />The UN also continues to apply sanctions against Osama bin Laden, members of the al Qaeda organisation and the Taliban. These include asset-freezes, a ban on travel, and a ban on supply of arms and related materials.</P>
    <P>On 21 September 2001, EU Heads of State and Government met at a special summit to agree an action plan on terrorism. Recognising the central role of the United Nations, the action plan comprises a comprehensive range of measures to enhance police and judicial co-operation, develop international legal instruments, freeze terrorist funds, strengthen air security, and shape the EU's external relations policy in ways aimed at limiting the scope for terrorists to operate. The action plan is being vigorously implemented in all its aspects.</P>
    <P>The recent attacks in Riyadh and Casablanca are a tragic reminder that the efforts of the international community to defeat terrorism will be long, and must be unrelenting.</P>
    <P>While it may never prove possible completely to remove the threat of terrorism, the international community must continue in the years ahead to deploy the full panoply of resources at its command with a view to reducing it to an absolute minimum.</P>
    <P>It should of course go without saying that all national and international efforts to combat terrorism must be conducted in accordance with the rule of law, and with full respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms as defined in the relevant international instruments.</P>

An Islamic terrorist group called Jemaah Islamiyah, whose aim is to establish a pan-Islamic state covering Malaysia, Indonesia, Singapore and the southern Philippines island of Mindanao, was blamed for the bombing.

He was formally charged on 21 May. On 30 April a suspected Jemaah Islamiyah member, Amrozi bin Nurhasyim, was formally charged. He is currently on trial on charges relating to the assistance he is alleged to have given the perpetrators of the Bali bombing. This is the first trial of a suspect in connection with the bombing and 30 suspects have been arrested. It is expected that more charges will be preferred over the coming months.</P>
    <P>On 27 January, during the EU-ASEAN ministerial meeting in Brussels, I met the Indonesian Minister for Foreign Affairs, Mr. Noer Hasan Wirajuda. I conveyed to him my sincere sympathy regarding the bombing in Bali. He pointed out that the majority of Islamic groups are moderate and that radical and extremist groups convey an incorrect impression of Muslims in Indonesia.</P>
    <P>On 14 April I attended a meeting of the external relations council and Ireland, together with our EU colleagues, adopted revised Council conclusions on Indonesia. These conclusions expressed the solidarity of the EU with Indonesia in fighting terrorism and recognised the serious challenges it faces after the severe terrorist attacks in Bali. The Council welcomed the significant steps taken by the Indonesian Government. It also noted the progress of investigations into the Bali bombings. It also confirmed the EU's offer of financial and technical assistance in the area of fighting terrorism.</P>
    <P>In July I hope to have a further opportunity to meet Minister Wirajuda, to review these and other issues, at the ASEM Foreign Ministers meeting which he will host in Bali.</P>

      <P>The person referred to is a Swedish citizen who is a practitioner of Falun Dafa. Although Falun Dafa is not a proscribed organisation in Thailand, I understand from reports that Thai police visited the place she was staying in Bangkok on 29 April. Having found and confiscated material relating to Falun Dafa practitioners in China, reports indicate that the Thai police revoked her visa and that of her husband. The reports suggest that as the person in question refused to leave Thailand voluntarily, or to agree to her deportation in the absence of a reason, she was detained by the Thai authorities.</P>

      <P>Amnesty International's recent assessment that the human rights situation in Guatemala has deteriorated in the past year is in line with con<Col N="1712" />cerns which have been expressed by Ireland and its EU partners in our contacts with the Government of Guatemala.</P>
      <P>The EU remains committed to the Guatemalan process of national reconciliation established by the 1996 Peace Accords. Their aim, <i>inter alia,</i> is to address the causes of conflict, consolidate the rule of law, put an end to impunity and to introduce genuine respect for human rights.</P>
      <P>The consultative group for Guatemala is the key mechanism for dialogue between Guatemala and the international community in relation to implementation of the 1996 Peace Accords. The group met on 13-14 May. It comprises representatives of the Guatemalan Government, delegates from donor countries, including the EU, and representatives of multilateral institutions and civil society. During the meeting Mr. Alfonso Portillo, President of Guatemala, and his officials, set out their view of the progress achieved to date, mainly in the economic sphere. They also indicated that efforts were being made to deal with corruption and, belatedly, to address the question of abolishing, as prescribed by the peace accords, the notorious military entity, the EMP.</P>
      <P>Representatives of the international community acknowledged that some significant progress had been made in the economic area. This included an increase in tax revenues which is regarded as vital to the implementation of the social justice dimension of the peace accords. Unfortunately, Guatemalan levels still remain among the lowest in Latin America. Nevertheless, they felt obliged to point out that the overall implementation of the peace accords had lost momentum.</P>
      <P>Deep concern was expressed at the worsening human rights problem. In the international community's opinion, impunity remains unchallenged and it is not yet possible to obtain justice for past crimes. Particular frustration was expressed at the overturning, just days before the consultative group met, of the conviction in 2002 of a military officer for the murder of anthropologist Myrna Mack in 1990. Attention was focused on the performance of the national civilian police, the public prosecutor's office and the human rights ombudsman's office.</P>
      <P>The EU urged the Guatemalan Government to make immediate efforts, more effectively to address the human rights situation as well as the related question of rampant violence and other key aspects of the peace agenda.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Speaking on behalf of the EU as a whole, the Greek Presidency identified the following key long-term priority areas as constituting the basis for the Union's future co-operative relations with the Guatemalan Government: acceleration of the implementation of the 1996 Accords, by improving the effective functioning of the justice system; improving the situation of indigenous peoples and the socio-economic situation in rural areas; the passing of land registration legislation; improved support for local municipalities and decentralisation; ensuring the strengthening of <Col N="1713" />democracy based on the rule of law and the promotion of human rights; promotion of actions against corruption and impunity; support for demilitarisation and the restructuring of the military; support for increasing Government revenue through a greater tax take and more effective tax collection system; and greater transparency and accountability over Government management of financial resources and higher social spending in order to improve social cohesion.</P>
    <P>The EU is committed to fulfilling this agenda by means of political dialogue and co-operation. The EU will work with the Government of Guatemala, other State institutions and civil society to develop a specific set of objectives, benchmarks and conditions. The EU is determined not to stint in its efforts to facilitate the reporting of significant progress to the next meeting of the consultative group, not least in the vital area of human rights.</P>

      <P>The Government is acutely conscious of the need to strengthen the UN in order to fulfil the commitment made by the Taoiseach and his fellow Heads of Government in the Millennium Summit declaration to ensure a more effective instrument for pursuing the fight for peace and development and against poverty, ignorance and disease.</P>
      <P>The Secretary General's report of September 2002 on reform of the UN system, Strengthening of the United Nations: An Agenda for Further Change, represented a further significant step in the reform process. In response to the Secretary General's report, the General Assembly, on 20 December 2002, adopted by consensus a comprehensive resolution on strengthening the UN system. The important task now is to secure implementation of the commitments contained in the resolution. As far as Ireland and its EU partners are concerned, the reform process is not a cost cutting exercise, but an essential series of steps aimed at strengthening and renewing the UN system and making it better able to carry out the purposes for which it was established.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>US arrears payments have eased budgetary pressure and added impetus to the reform process. Co-operation between the Security Council and countries contributing troops to UN peacekeeping operations has been strengthened. Ireland, as a permanent troop contributor, <Col N="1714" />pressed strongly for this while on the Council. Major reforms have been undertaken in UN peacekeeping operations based on the recommendations of the report of the panel on UN peace operations.</P>
    <P>Extensive administrative reform is under way in the implementation of the UN's development programmes. Far reaching reforms have been implemented within several of the UN's funds and programmes, involving the restructuring of management and the streamlining of operations.</P>
    <P>One of the most difficult issues facing the UN membership generally is the question of Security Council reform. The General Assembly decided in 1993 to establish a working group, open to all UN member states, to address this issue in a comprehensive way. Since 1993 the working group has met regularly in New York and Ireland is an active participant. To date progress on this complex issue has been disappointing. The key issues involved are enlargement of Security Council membership, its working methods and its decision making procedures including, crucially, the use of the veto.</P>
    <P>Ireland supports a small, regionally balanced increase in both the permanent and the elected membership to create an enlarged Security Council of between 20 and 25 members. We do not believe that this should be at the expense of smaller members. Ireland would like to see the veto eliminated. The Government recognises the strong opposition of the permanent members. It has proposed, in a spirit of realism and practicality, that they be invited to accept a limitation of the veto whereby they would exercise it only when the question in hand was one of vital national importance, taking into account the interests of the UN. At the same time, any new permanent members of the Council would commit themselves not to exercise the veto. Despite the lack of tangible progress to date, Ireland will continue to play an active and constructive role in seeking agreement on reform of the Council.</P>
    <P>Ireland will continue to support the UN reform process on a national basis. The EU also has an important role to play in supporting the UN reform agenda. The Government looks forward to developing further the EU's support for this process during Ireland's Presidency of the EU in 2004.</P>

      <P>I assume that the Deputy is referring to the European Development Fund moneys.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>According to the most recent information provided by the European Commission, as of the end <Col N="1715" />of 2002, &euro;32.8 billion had been made available to African, Caribbean and Pacific States in the sixth, 1985-90, seventh, 1990-5, and eighth, 1995-2000 EDFs. Of this &euro;29.9 billion had already been used in financing decisions, leaving &euro;2.9 billion still to be committed. With regard to the bulk of the &euro;2.9 billion still to be committed, &euro;1.7 billion is for country or regional programmes of which 40%, or &euro;680 million, is allocated to countries in crisis where aid cannot be implemented in current circumstances.</P>
    <P>Of the total &euro;29.9 billion already committed, a total of &euro;21.5 billion has been spent. Payments totalling &euro;8.4 billion, which have been committed having been approved already by financing decisions, remain unspent and have still to be made to complete projects. Total unspent resources amount to &euro;11.3 billion. This sum includes the &euro;8.4 billion in firm commitments but still unspent mentioned earlier together with the further sum of &euro;2.9 billion which has still to be committed. According to the Commission, annual payment levels are now significantly higher than the average for 1995-9.</P>
    <P>Forecasts of future commitments and payments are being prepared in the light of the outcome of seminars conducted by the Commission in the various ACP regions in February-March. Based on the experience of the recently enhanced process of decentralisation by the Commission to its offices in the field, it would appear that the third wave of decentralisation, effective in early 2004, will lead to a major improvement in the performance of the EDF. To commit the funds available under the current 9th EDF within five years to 2007 will necessitate a significant increase in commitments already made in 2003, compared with 2002. The Commission has taken measures to strengthen the ACP Directorate of EuropeAid, the Commission's agency responsible for aid delivery.</P>
    <P>Ireland's contribution to the 9th EDF in 2003 is &euro;14,260,000. Under the terms of the current contribution key this represents 0.62% of total contributions.</P>
    <P>I have been concerned about the volume of committed but unspent funds. On 20 May at the General Affairs and External Relations Council Ireland indicated strong support for a UK paper on a proposed action plan for reform of EC external assistance, submitted at the ECOFIN Council, especially the focus on poverty reduction and the need for activity based budgeting. While reform is progressing it needs to go further and deeper, including the ongoing reforms toward decentralisation.</P>

      <P>The World Summit on Sustainable Development held in Johannesburg, South Africa, in September 2002, built on the Millennium Summit held in New York two years earlier. It focused on the achievement of the eight millennium development goals. They deal with fundamental development issues such as poverty eradication, health, education, maternal mortality, HIV-AIDS and international partnership. The 190 countries that took part in the Johannesburg Summit reconfirmed their commitment to the achievement of these goals by 2015, with particular reference to water, energy, health, agriculture and biodiversity.</P>
      <P>The promotion of poverty eradication through sustainable development was at the heart of the summit's work. It was the first to treat all aspects of sustainable development &ndash; economic, social and environmental &ndash; in a coherent and integrated way. It also agreed a number of additional commitments including the goal of universal access to sanitation by 2015.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Progress in relation to the commitments made at Johannesburg will be measured in terms of progress towards the achievement of the MDGs and other targets agreed at the summit. In 2005 the UN Secretary General will present the first comprehensive global report on progress towards the MDGs since their adoption at the summit in <Col N="1717" />2000. The report, which will be prepared in collaboration with the World Bank, the IMF and the WTO, will give the international community a clear picture of how the commitments made at the Millennium Summit, and at the succeeding conferences including Johannesburg, have contributed to eradicating poverty. Already there is evidence emerging from World Bank and UN studies indicating that many countries in sub-Saharan Africa are falling behind in their efforts to reach the goals.</P>
    <P>The 11th session of the UN Commission on Sustainable Development was a functional commission set up to ensure effective implementation of the commitments made at the 1992 Rio Earth Summit and also at Johannesburg. Earlier this month it met in New York, at ministerial level, and adopted a multi-year programme of work for the period 2004-17. The Irish delegation at the meeting was headed by my colleague, Deputy Cullen, Minister for the Environment and Local Government.</P>
    <P>Ireland remains committed to supporting the work of the Commission in the coming years and to working with the international community to ensure that the Johannesburg plan of implementation remains high on the international agenda.</P>
    <P>Recently the EU Commission issued a communication proposing the establishment of an EU water fund to move forward the EU's water initiative announced at Johannesburg. The fund will be directed towards the achievement of the MDGs and the additional targets agreed at Johannesburg. The Commission has proposed that the water fund should be funded by unspent European Development Fund resources of &euro;1 billion. The Commission's communication has been warmly received by member states. It is expected that the Council will take a formal decision on the establishment of the fund in the near future.</P>

      <P>On 4 February the state union of Serbia and Montenegro was proclaimed in succession to the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. Agreement on the formation of the state union was brokered by the EU. It supported the establishment of the new federal institutions and the implementation of wide-ranging political and economic reforms. The stability of the new structures was seriously challenged by the tragic assassination of the Prime Minister of Serbia, Zoran Djindjic, on 12 March. <Col N="1718" />In response a state of emergency was declared in Serbia by the acting President, Natasa Micic but it was lifted on 22 April.</P>

With strong public backing, the new Serbian Government of Prime Minister Zoran Zivkovic, and the federal authorities, reacted by showing their determination to continue with the reform process, to step up the fight against organised crime and to implement major reform of the defence and military structures. Considerable progress has been made in stabilising Serbia. On 12 May, during my visit to Belgrade and Podgorica, I met federal President Svetozar Marovic and Foreign Minister Goran Svilanovic. I welcomed the progress which had been made in the reform process and in the fight against organised crime, and the signs of an improvement in the level of co-operation with the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia.</P>
      <P>All of the political leaders I met in Serbia and Montenegro emphasised their commitment to the pursuit of the wide-ranging reform process which is required for the consolidation of democracy and stability and for the development of closer relations with the EU. I assured them of the EU's support. The stability of Serbia and Montenegro and of the western Balkans region depends on further progress in the implementation of political, economic and administrative reforms, and on the development of closer regional economic co-operation.</P>
      <P>The EU is taking the lead in the promotion of this process, primarily through the stabilisation and association process. The EU-Western Balkans Summit in Thessalonika on 21 June will be an important point in the development of our relations with the region. I hope that it will result in a clear political message to the people of the western Balkans that the future of the region lies in eventual integration into European structures, on the basis of clear and objective economic and political criteria, to be met by the Governments of the countries concerned. Ireland will play its part in the development of this relationship, especially during our EU Presidency in the first half of 2004.</P>

      <P>I share the Deputy's concern about recent reports of the discovery of large graves in the vicinity of Bunia in the eastern part of the Democratic Republic of the Congo. I believe that he is referring to the appalling massacre of civilians that took place on 3 April in the area of Drodro, near <Col N="1719" />Bunia. In the past I have condemned this massacre and I condemn it again today.</P>
      <P>A UN team, comprising representatives of the UN peacekeeping force in the Democratic Republic of the Congo and representatives of the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights, are conducting an investigation to determine responsibility for this shocking act. The team is expected to report on its findings shortly. The UN will consider its report and Ireland will pay close attention to its follow-up.</P>
      <P>This Government continues to use its influence with our EU partners and in the international community to ensure that impunity in the Democratic Republic of the Congo is addressed. At the 59th Session of the Commission on Human Rights, which completed deliberations recently, Ireland took a strong line on the need to deal with impunity in the DRC, particularly on the importance of investigating serious violations of human rights and international humanitarian law. The Commission adopted, by unanimity, a resolution on the human rights problem there. The resolution, <i>inter alia,</i> calls on the DRC's Government to take specific measures to put an end to impunity and to ensure that those responsible for human rights violations and grave breaches of international humanitarian law are brought to justice in accordance with due process.</P>

      <P>As I have previously stated in the House, the Government has consistently taken the view that the transfer of its own population into occupied territory by an occupying power is a flagrant breach of the Fourth Geneva Convention. The settlements established in the occupied Palestinian territories of the West Bank and Gaza Strip by the Israeli authorities are illegal and must be dismantled. Land seizures by the occupation forces for the purposes of settlement are null and void. The Nassar case appears to be a particularly disturbing example of this policy in action. The case, originally scheduled to come before the Supreme Court of Israel on 27 April, has been postponed until 1 June. Our diplomatic officers in the region will continue to monitor developments.</P>

Since 1998 as many as 29 staff have participated in the centre for management and organisation development Gaeltacht scholarship scheme.</P>
      <P>The implementation of the official languages equality policy will be monitored as part of my Department's audit of local business unit business plans, scheduled for the latter part of 2003.</P>

      <P>IDA Ireland has statutory responsibility for the attraction of foreign direct investment to the State and its regions. The management of the IDA's industrial property portfolio is a day-to-day operational matter for the agency and not one in which I have a direct function.</P>
      <P>I understand from IDA Ireland that the building in question is owned by a private company and has been vacant for most of the past 20 years. On 2 January 1983 IDA Ireland took out a 35 year lease on the building, with rent reviews every five years. Up until January 2003 the annual rent was &euro;92,481 per annum. The agency is currently involved in rent negotiations with the owners.</P>
      <P>Upon receipt of the company's business plan, a formal response was sent to the company, expressing IDA Ireland's willingness to purchase the building and sell it to the company, thereby incurring a substantial loss. In addition, IDA Ireland offered grant assistance based on a number of commercial factors and limited planned capital investment by the company concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>IDA Ireland advised me that it is firmly of the view that the level and type of assistance offered is appropriate for the type of project proposed. It has no plans to alter its offer. It is conscious of the need to provide high value employment <Col N="1723" />opportunities in communities that provide sustainable long-term jobs. It has reacted to the proposal from the company in a positive and innovative manner and is in the best interest of all parties.</P>
    <P>To date IDA strategies have proved successful even in the most difficult of times. The level of foreign direct investment in Ireland, relative to the size of the economy, is one of the highest in the world and is one of the highest in Europe. I am confident that the strategies and policies being pursued by the IDA in Mayo, together with the ongoing commitment of Government to regional development, will bear fruit in terms of overseas investment and jobs for the people of Ballinrobe.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 112 to 114, inclusive, together.</P>
      <P>The Department of Defence follows Government policy on the use of the Irish language, a primary element of which is that any citizen who wishes to conduct his-her business with the Department through Irish may do so. This policy is reflected in the Department's customer service action plan which commits to providing quality services through Irish and informs customers of their right to choose to be dealt with through one or other of the official languages.</P>
      <P>The Department facilitates staff members' participation in Irish language training courses and scholarships as part of an ongoing Civil Service-wide scheme. The training courses are provided at no cost to Defence by the Language Training Centre, Department of Finance, formerly Gaeleagras. The amounts spent on scholarships to study Irish in the Gaeltacht were &euro;622.16 in 1999 and &euro;177.76 in 2003.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Similarly, Defence Forces personnel attend various Irish language courses, including courses held in military barracks and in Conradh na Gaeilge in Dublin and Galway. In addition, a week long Irish language training camp, available to all <Col N="1724" />members of the Defence Forces, has been held each year since 1993 in Dun Uí Mhaoiliosa, Galway. Excluding normal pay and allowances, funding in this area was &euro;2,539 in 1999, &euro;3,174 in 2000, &euro;4,000 in 2001, &euro;4,000 in 2002 and is &euro;5,000 in 2003.</P>

      <P>My Department's human resource strategy, published in 2002, sets out the actions being taken to ensure that there is adequate Irish language capability amongst its staff.

    </Speaker>
    <P>I have, however, taken into consideration the fact that meat plants can be affected by seasonal pressures and have therefore allowed flexibility in the operation of shifts in the first and second quarters of the year to enable them to meet their commercial commitments. I must point out that this arrangement was agreed on the very clear understanding that extra shifts used must be balanced by savings in later quarters to stay within <Col N="1728" />the budgetary requirement. Further concessions on an individual plant basis cannot be entertained.</P>
    <P>My Department has initiated a review of the meat inspection service with the aim of delivering a more cost efficient and effective service which takes account of the present day requirements of the meat processing industry while maintaining the highest levels of food safety and animal welfare. Discussions are taking place with all interested parties with a view to implementing new arrangements that will improve efficiency, broaden flexibility and deliver better value for money.</P>

The criteria used in assessing applications for herd numbers principally include independent management of the holding, separate housing and fodder, the availability of adequate testing facilities without the possibility of intermixing with cattle in any other herd. The general details in regard to applying for a herd number are outlined in the application form ER1, a copy of which I am arranging to send to the Deputy. As provided for in appendix 1 of the department customer service action plan 2001-2004, the staff in the local offices normally aim to finalise an application for a herd number within a 28-day timeframe.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 131 to 133, inclusive, together.</P>
      <P>My Department, as stated in its Quality Customer Service Action Plan 2001-2004, is committed to providing a high quality service to customers who wish to conduct their business in Irish. It actively supports the development of bilingualism especially across the civil service through Gaeleagras both by means of Irish classes and providing advice and assistance in relation to developing and implementing bilingual services to the public.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The main area of expenditure in the Department relating to the Irish language arises in respect of Gaeleagras na Seirbhíse Poiblí which was established in 1971 with the general aim of promoting the Irish language throughout the pub<Col N="1730" />lic service. It provides Irish language training for civil servants to enable them to deal with the public through Irish. Gaeleagras pursues this aim through a range of activities such as day and evening courses, proficiency testing of Irish among civil servants for promotion purposes, special courses for targeted groups and residential courses in the Gaeltacht.</P>
    <P>The amount spent from Subhead F &ndash; Gaeleagras na Seirbhíse Poiblí, of the Department's Vote by Gaeleagras in each of the past five years towards achieving these objectives is as follows: &euro;171,021 in 1998, &euro;175,894 in 1999, &euro;145,365 in 2000, &euro;189,191 in 2001 and &euro;184,039 in 2002.</P>
    <P>In addition to these amounts one higher executive officer and 1.5 clerical officers are currently engaged in providing backup administrative services to Gaeleagras. Further expenditure has also arisen in regard to translation, printing and advertising in Irish across the Department. However, precise information on the amount of such expenditure over the last five years is not readily available.</P>
    <P>Gaeleagras monitors the numbers attending classes and students are examined in relation to proficiency achieved. Attendees at classes and at scholarships complete assessment forms which are reviewed regularly to ensure that Gaeleagras is meeting the needs of civil servants with regard to the provision of service through Irish. In the context of the new Civil Service training strategy more formal evaluation systems will be put in place. Customer comment cards in Irish are also available in the reception areas of the Department's offices which are monitored by the quality customer services officer.</P>

      <P>An earthquake measuring 6.7 on the Richter Scale struck northern Algeria at approximately 8 p.m. on 21 May. This is the most severe earthquake to hit North Africa for over 20 years. The first earthquake was followed by three others, all measuring over five on the Richter Scale and all in heavily populated areas. The death toll has passed the 2,000 mark and many hundreds are still missing. Many thousands are injured. This is a devastating blow to the people of Algeria and they have our heartfelt sympathy.</P>
      <P>The Algerian Red Crescent was quickly mobilised in the aftermath of the disaster. ARC staff and volunteers were rapidly rescuing victims, administering first aid and transporting the injured to hospital. ARC teams are helping in the hospitals and distributing basic needs from disaster preparedness stocks. The ARC is part of the International Federation of the Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies and the federation has mobilised international emergency response units with specialised knowledge in disaster management.</P>
      <P>The IFRC has issued an emergency appeal for funding to assist up to 20,000 victims of the Algerian earthquake with food and non-food items over three months. Non-food items covered include tents, blankets, generators, plastic sheeting, medical supplies and psychological support. Under this appeal, help will also be given to the local ARC in disaster response and mitigation, through first aid training, monitoring, reporting and disaster management.</P>
      <P>The IFRC is a valued partner of Ireland Aid, the Government's official programme of development co-operation. The IFRC's rapid response to the disaster in Algeria emphasises, once again, the importance played by local organisations in responding immediately to local emergencies. Experience has taught us that many of the lives saved in the immediate aftermath of a disaster are saved by the local communities themselves and their organisations and agencies. International assistance is also vital, but there is an increasing emphasis now being placed on building local capacity for disaster preparedness.</P>
      <P>We have embarked on a strategic partnership with the IFRC designed, <i>inter alia,</i> to assist in building the capacity of local Red Cross and Red Crescent societies in Africa to build their disaster response capability. An initial amount of &euro;750,000 has been made available to the IFRC for this purpose. We will shortly be reviewing progress to date and I am hopeful that we will develop further our partnership with the IFRC.</P>

      <Col N="1732" />I have approved funding of &euro;500,000 to the IFRC appeal for victims of this earthquake.</P>

      <P>I have raised this matter with the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland on a number of occasions, including most recently at the meeting of the British Irish Intergovernmental Conference in London on 20 May.</P>
      <P>In the Joint Declaration published on 1 May 2003, the Irish and British Governments reaffirmed their commitment to work with the relevant regulators and broadcasting authorities to address the technical and other barriers with a view to increasing substantially the reception of TG4 in Northern Ireland. These barriers relate to issues of broadcasting rights in another jurisdiction, spectrum availability and financial issues.</P>
      <P>Officials from my Department, the Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources and TG4 are actively pursuing these matters with their British counterparts. A meeting for this purpose was held in my Department on 22 May and further work will be taken forward over the next few weeks with a view to discharging the commitment outlined in the Good Friday Agreement and restated in the Joint Declaration.</P>

      <P>It is the view of the Government that at this time, it is imperative that the EU engages constructively with Indonesia, so that the new democracy there can continue to develop and that human rights and fundamental freedoms are protected.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In September 1999, the EU adopted a four month embargo on arms sales to Indonesia in an attempt to increase pressure on Jakarta to respect the vote for independence in East Timor in August 1999. On the expiry of the embargo on 17 <Col N="1734" />January 2000 a review was carried out by the EU, and due to the developments in Indonesia at the time, which included the first ever contested presidential elections, a change of government and the relinquishing of Indonesia's territorial claim to East Timor, it was decided that the arms embargo was no longer necessary and should not be renewed.</P>
    <P>However, all exports of arms from EU countries must conform with the EU code of conduct on arms exports, which establishes criteria to control the export of arms. Ireland was involved in the establishment of this politically binding code, which was adopted by the EU General Affairs Council in June 1998. The code lists the factors to be taken into account when deciding whether to allow an export of military goods. These factors include respect for human rights and the internal situation in the country of final destination, as well as the preservation of regional peace, security and stability.</P>
    <P>I participated in the External Relations Council in April 2003, which adopted conclusions on Indonesia. The conclusions confirmed the EU's support for Indonesia's territorial integrity and reaffirmed the EU's aspiration to build a closer partnership with Indonesia. They stressed at the same time the importance that the Indonesian Government should further pursue its commitment to human rights and to ensure stability and security in Indonesia, with full respect for the law. The Council further urged the government to address humanitarian needs and make further progress in political, judicial and legal reforms.</P>
    <P>I met with the Indonesian Minister for Foreign Affairs, Mr. Noer Hasan Wirajuda, during the EU-ASEAN ministerial meeting in Brussels on 27 January 2003 and I hope to have a further opportunity to meet with Minister Wirajuda to review issues of common concern at the ASEM Foreign Ministers Meeting which he will host in Bali in July 2003.</P>

      <P>The Council continues to be alarmed at the ongoing illegal settlement activities and land confiscations for the construction of the so-called security fence, which are an obstacle to peace by threatening to render the two-state solution physically impossible.</P>
      <P>The Government has consistently taken the view that the transfer of its own population into occupied territory by an occupying power is a flagrant breach of the Fourth Geneva Convention. The settlements established in the occupied Palestinian territories of the West Bank and the Gaza Strip by the Israeli authorities are illegal and must be dismantled. Land seizures by the occupation forces for purposes of settlement are null and void.</P>

The restrictions imposed by the Israeli authorities have recently been brought up with Israeli representatives by the Presidency of the European Union in both Athens and Jerusalem and by the European Commission in Brussels. I understand that the measures will be reviewed by the Israeli authorities in the next few days and I am hopeful that they will be lifted. Israel has legitimate security interests, of which we are conscious. However, it also has obligations to the population of the occupied Palestinian territories under the Fourth Geneva Convention. Any security measures necessary must be proportionate and take due account of the needs of the people of the territories and Israel's obligations under international humanitarian law.</P>

      <P>As the world enters the third decade of the AIDS epidemic, the evidence of its impact is undeniable. By far the worst-affected region, sub-Saharan Africa is now home to 29.4 million people living with HIV-AIDS. Approximately 3.5 million new infections occurred there in 2002, while the epidemic claimed the lives of an estimated 2.4 million Africans in the past year.</P>
      <P>It is only in recent years that the international community has woken to the reality of HIV-AIDS and to the devastating threat this disease presents to human development in highly-affected countries. The response of the international community is guided by the Declaration of Commitment on HIV-AIDS, which was agreed at a special session of the UN General Assembly, held in response to the global HIV-AIDS pandemic in June 2001.</P>
      <P>In his address to the UNGASS, the Taoiseach emphasised the importance of political leadership, improved coordination and more financial resources in order to respond effectively to the HIV-AIDS pandemic. He announced that additional resources of $30 million, &euro;31.5 million, would be spent each year within the Ireland Aid programme as part of the Government's response to this crisis.</P>
      <P>In 2000 the Government published A HIV-AIDS strategy for the Ireland Aid programme. This strategy has provided the framework for directing the overall resources contributed by the Government to the international response to the HIV-AIDS pandemic. Since 2000, the volume of this contribution has increased tenfold.</P>
      <P>Our funding is directed at HIV-AIDS activities, primarily in Africa, and is channelled through international, regional, national and non-governmental organisations. In 2003 alone, over &euro;40 million has been allocated across a number of programmes, including the Global Fund for AIDS, TB and Malaria, AIDS vaccine research, and prevention, care and support activities implemented by NGOs and UN agencies who are engaged in the fight against HIV-AIDS.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1739" />The focus of the Governments support is on developing the capacity of partner Governments and national AIDS councils to prevent the spread of HIV-AIDS and to mitigate the social and economic consequences of the pandemic.</P>
    <P>The Government fully recognises the threat that HIV-AIDS presents to the attainment of the millennium development goals in the worlds poorest countries. We will continue to work closely with other Governments to ensure the international response to this global threat is sustained and strengthened.</P>

      <P>The core objectives of the Ireland Aid programme continue to be poverty reduction and sustainable development. Meeting the basic human needs of some of poorest people in the world and improving their access to food, water, health services, sanitation, education and employment are key goals of the programme, at both bilateral and multilateral level. The centrality of fighting poverty, which guides the range of activities supported by Ireland Aid, was reaffirmed in the report of the Ireland aid review committee in 2002.</P>
      <P>The main geographical focus of the bilateral programme is sub-Saharan Africa, the poorest region in the world. Ireland Aid provides long-term development assistance to six programme countries, Lesotho, Zambia, Tanzania, Uganda, Mozambique and Ethiopia, as well as South Africa, within the framework of three-year country strategy papers. In line with other donors, we operate in partnership with the Governments of these countries and agree our strategies with them in order to ensure that Ireland Aid programmes effectively respond to their development needs. This is standard practice in building up government capacity and strengthening their sense of ownership of the whole development process.</P>
      <P>It is of critical importance that the assistance which Ireland Aid provides reaches those for whom it is intended at all times. Our systems and procedures are designed with this in mind and are constantly under review. The bilateral country programmes are subject to annual external audit by reputable accountancy firms. The programmes and projects which form part of the overall programme are themselves audited. In addition, the valuation and audit unit of Ireland Aid carries out regular evaluations across the whole spectrum of Ireland Aid activities to ensure, <i>inter alia</i>, that the assistance which we provide reaches its targeted beneficiaries.</P>

      <P>The primary objective of Ireland's emergency humanitarian aid programme is to save lives and rebuild livelihoods in the aftermath of natural and man-made disasters. This objective is founded on the principles of a commitment to international humanitarian law, a commitment to needs &ndash; based programming and regular evaluations of humanitarian operations.</P>
      <P>Ireland's humanitarian programme is implemented through valued partners, such as NGOs, UN agencies and international organisations. These partners have the experience and capacity to deliver assistance to the most vulnerable in times of crisis and stress. While major emergencies are supported, particular attention is also given to targeting humanitarian assistance at the so-called &ldquo;forgotten or silent emergencies&rdquo;, especially in sub-Saharan Africa.</P>
      <P>Last year the Government intervened to provide emergency and recovery assistance on over 70 occasions, in more than a dozen countries throughout Africa and in over 20 countries in the rest of the world. These interventions were designed to reduce the effects of famine and conflict on some of the most vulnerable populations with a particular emphasis on women and children. To date this year we have provided emergency and recovery assistance to 18 countries worldwide, the majority in Africa.</P>
      <P>It is not possible to predict or indicate in advance specific locations for emergency humanitarian assistance. Responses are linked primarily to needs brought about by sudden onset emergencies and humanitarian disasters. However, given the prevalence of humanitarian crises of various kinds in Africa, it is likely that much of our aid will remain focussed on the Horn of Africa, central Africa and southern Africa in 2003 and beyond.</P>

      <P>The Treaty of Accession was signed in Athens on 16 <Col N="1741" />April 2003. Ratification by the member states and the acceding countries is proceeding. All the acceding countries apart from Cyprus are holding referenda on the question of accession. To date, referenda have been held and passed in Malta, Slovenia, Hungary, Lithuania and the Slovak Republic. Referenda will be held in Poland on 7-8 June, in the Czech Republic on 13-14 June, in Estonia on 14 September and in Latvia on 20 September. The Government intends that Ireland will ratify the treaty later this year.</P>
      <P>The ten acceding countries have been participating on a non-voting basis in most Council and European Parliament meetings since signature of the accession treaty. The Commission is monitoring the acceding countries' progress in the implementation of commitments made in the accession negotiations. The new member states are due to accede to the EU on 1 May 2004, during the Irish Presidency. The objective is for Bulgaria and Romania to accede in 2007, and they hope to conclude negotiations in 2004. If the European Council in December 2004, on the basis of a report and a recommendation from the Commission, decides that Turkey fulfils the Copenhagen political criteria, the European Union will open accession negotiations with Turkey without delay.</P>

      <P>The basic principles underlying the Partnership for Peace, as set out in the PfP Framework Document of January 1994, remain unchanged. This document sets out the political purposes of PfP which include the protection of human rights; the safeguarding of freedom, justice and peace; the promotion of democracy; the maintenance of the principles of international law; and the fulfilment of the obligations of the UN Charter, and of OSCE commitments. A key principle which applies is that of self-differentiation whereby each PfP country determines the nature, scope and limits of its participation.</P>
      <P>The number of non-NATO countries participating in PfP will fall from 27 to 20 after the accession process is completed for those countries that were invited in November 2002 to join NATO &ndash; Latvia, Estonia, Lithuania, Romania, Bulgaria, Slovenia and Slovakia.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A key aspect of PfP membership from Ireland's perspective lies in the core principle of self differentiation, whereby each country participates according to its own interests and priorities. Ireland in particular also will continue to benefit from experience being gained in the peacekeeping area, especially through the development of <Col N="1742" />enhanced interoperability which is improving our ability to undertake peacekeeping operations in a safe and effective manner.</P>

      <P>Ireland fully supports the European Union Common Position on Nigeria which pledges EU support for efforts to develop a democratic culture, build institutional capacity and alleviate poverty in Nigeria. As part of this process, the European Commission provided funding of &euro;6.5 million in support of the recent presidential and parliamentary elections in Nigeria. The funding provided for civic and voter education, capacity building and training for election observers and monitoring and technical assistance to the Independent National Election Commission.</P>
      <P>The elections, at the presidential, national, state assembly and gubernatorial levels went ahead in April 2003. This represents a notable achievement and marks the first time that Nigeria has successfully completed two democratic elections back to back since the country gained independence in 1960.</P>
      <P>The elections have been criticised by a number of international monitors, including the EU, for various electoral malpractices, and this is a cause of concern. It will be important for the EU to continue to work with the Independent Election Commission to strengthen its capacity for future elections. Nonetheless, the recent elections were generally peaceful and there was a high voter participation rate. The elections thus mark another important chapter in Nigerias development and they are a positive indication of the progress being made towards stability in Africa's most populous country.</P>
      <P>Nigeria is a potentially wealthy country by African standards with the seventh largest oil reserves in the world and a GDP in excess of &euro;40 billion. The problem with Nigeria is not one of absolute poverty but rather that long years of corruption have left its infrastructure and educational and health services in a very inadequate condition. International aid is largely geared towards addressing primary health and educational needs and building up civil society. In monetary terms, international aid to Nigeria corresponds to only a small fraction of the country's annual oil income.</P>
      <P>The European Union is the largest single donor to Nigeria and is currently implementing a &euro;550 million programme concentrating on water, sanitation and polio eradication. It has also recently embarked on an ambitious plan aimed at promoting good governance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1743" />In Nigeria, the Government's aid programme provides co-financing for Irish non-governmental organisations and missionaries in relation to small to medium-sized projects meeting basic needs in the health, education, water supply, sanitation, agriculture and rural development sectors. There are over 200 Irish missionaries and aid workers in Nigeria, whose presence is a reminder of the long history of Irish assistance to Nigeria which goes back well over 100 years. The Irish Embassy in Nigeria also assists in the administration of a number of programmes in the area of human rights and democratisation. In the past three years, 2000-2002, a total of &euro;3.5 million of Ireland Aid funding has been disbursed in Nigeria.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Mr. N. Dempsey)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not aware of the schemes in North America and New Zealand as referred to by Deputy. Responsibility for arranging insurance cover on school property and against public liability is a matter for the managerial authorities of primary and voluntary secondary schools, which are privately owned. Many reasons have been put forward by management authorities for the current insurance increases, ranging from school factors such as claims history, location, curricula offered, size of school and factors affecting the international insurance market. <i>Per capita</i> grants towards the operating costs of primary and voluntary secondary schools may be used for this purpose. <i>Per capita</i> grants have been increased significantly in recent years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At primary level, the capitation grant has been increased has increased from &euro;57.14, £45, in 1997 to &euro;111.58 in 2003. This represents an increase of 95% in the capitation grant over that period. In the case of secondary schools, the standard <i>per capita</i> grant of &euro;224.74 that applied in 1997 has been increased to &euro;266.49 in this school year. For disadvantaged schools the increase has brought the <i>per capita</i> grant to over &euro;300. In addition, secondary schools have benefited under the school services support initiative, since its inception some two years ago. This annual grant was increased by &euro;10 per pupil from January last. This latest increase has brought the support services <Col N="1744" />grant in the case of secondary schools to &euro;127 per pupil from 1 January 2003. The increase is in addition to the range of equalisation grants of up to &euro;15,554 per school, &euro;44.44 per pupil, per annum that was approved for secondary schools also in the last two years.</P>
    <P>Schools are afforded considerable flexibility in the use of these resources to cater for the needs of their pupils. In my view this is, in general, a preferable approach to putting in place grants for specific initiatives. Tackling the difficulties that are being caused by high insurance premiums is a clear priority for the Government and for my colleague, the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment. A key concern to which the Minister is giving priority is the cost and availability of liability insurance. Although the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment is responsible for the supervision of insurance companies, EU law prevents Government from intervening in relation to premium levels or the risks that insurers are prepared to underwrite. However, Governments are free to take appropriate action, which could influence cost reduction by the industry. A comprehensive set of measures is contained in the agreed programme for Government, the underlying purpose of which is to bring about an improvement in the functioning of the insurance market and in the system itself.</P>
    <P>In this context, last October, the Tánaiste announced a comprehensive programme for the fundamental reform of the Irish insurance market. Key initiatives in the reform programme include the establishment of the Personal Injuries Assessment Board, PIAB, and the publication of the action plan for the implementation of the recommendations of the Motor Insurance Advisory Board, MIAB. While the MIAB was essentially concerned with motor insurance, the recommendations also relate to other forms of insurance and to public and employer's liability in particular. The action plan reflects this.</P>
    <P>The programme for Government also contains a commitment to remove unwarranted constraints on competition in all sectors of the economy. As part of this commitment, and complementary to the reform programme, the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, in conjunction with the Competition Authority, is undertaking a study of competition in the insurance marketplace, with particular reference to motor, employers' liability and public liability insurance. Work on the study is in progress and it is envisaged that the bulk will be completed this year and that a report will be produced in the early part of 2004.</P>
    <P>The Government considers that these measures, taken as a package, constitute a programme that is capable of delivering very real reform and that reductions in insurance costs will translate into significant reductions in premia.</P>

      <P>Dealing with educational disadvantage remains a key priority of this Government and my Department has introduced a range of key interventions and programmes in primary schools aimed directly at tackling the problem of educational disadvantage. The early start pre-school pilot project is in place in 40 selected schools in designated areas of disadvantage. It is aimed at children who are considered to be most at risk of not reaching their educational potential and are aged between three and four years. Early start units have been established in 40 schools and all of these schools are benefiting from additional resources to cater for the pre-school children attending. Over &euro;1.8 million, exclusive of teachers salaries, was spent on this programme in 2002 benefiting 1,570 pupils in 16 full units and 24 half units, with 56 teachers and 56 childcare workers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My Department also funds the Rutland Street pre-school project which caters for 95 pupils age three to five years and which includes a pre-school centre, a special staff teaching allocation, classroom assistants, secretarial services and cooks, together with the provision of school meals.

The Deputy may be aware of the White Paper on Early Childhood Education, &ldquo;Ready to Learn&rdquo;, <Col N="1746" />which sets out a comprehensive strategy for the development of early childhood education for all children from birth to six years. The question of developing and funding particular pre-school initiatives or the extension of the early start project to additional schools will be considered by the Centre for Early Childhood Development and Education, which I recently established.</P>

      <Quest>the reason his Department will be withdrawing funding for St. Bridgid's secondary school in Goresbridge, County Carlow, and allowing it to close, in view of its academic record and its role as focal point for community activities.</Quest>
      <QRef>[15012/03]</QRef>

    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. N. Dempsey Mr. N. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Mr. N. Dempsey)</NameTxt>
      <P>The future of St. Brigid's secondary school, Goresbridge has been under review for some time. The school was owned and run by the Brigidine Order as a girls' boarding school until 1978. At that time, the nuns withdrew and the school was taken over by a local board of trustees and a local board of management who leased the buildings from the nuns and ran the school as a co-educational voluntary school. In April 1998 the board of management decided to phase out the operation of the school. The board's decision was strongly resisted locally and a community action group was set up to save the school. In June 1998 the board of management notified the Department that it had reversed its decision to close the school.</P>
      <P>Subsequently, in 2001, a group representing the various school interests made a proposal to my Department, in which approval was sought for the implementation of various measures which, it was considered, would result in the development of St. Brigid's as a viable school into the future. Following a thorough examination of the issues involved, including submissions to retain the school under the trusteeship of the VEC, I have concluded that the major capital investment which would be warranted to sustain a school of this size, could not be justified. Since 1995 enrolments at the school have remained steady at a figure of approximately 130. The school has a current enrolment of 129 pupils and a long-term projected enrolment of approximately 125 pupils. This is an optimistic assessment in that it assumes full student retention through junior and senior cycles and 75% of all fourth year pupils taking the transition year option. It is also based on a pattern of enrolment where in excess of 60% of the total first year intake comes from outside the catchment area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As part of its strategy to increase enrolments, the interest group representing the school, has sought adjustments to existing catchment boundaries and current transport arrangements. Any attempt to alter existing arrangements would be likely to provoke strong opposition from other <Col N="1747" />providers in the area. It could also be argued that this strategy for increasing enrolments could be viewed as verification of the school's non-viability for the future. Even with the interventions mentioned there would still not be a sufficient base to justify major refurbishment or, perhaps, a new building. Consequently, my view, is that educational provision should be phased out over a two-year period, with final closure in June 2005, and I have advised the owners and trustees in this regard. To facilitate an orderly closure, the school authorities are not accepting a first year intake in September 2003.</P>
    <P>In relation to any decision on the closure of a school, my Department's concern is to ensure that there are sufficient pupil places to meet demand in a given area. I am confident that arrangements can be made to facilitate the placement of pupils from St. Brigid's in neighbouring schools as the situation arises. Arrangements are currently being made to accommodate the remaining pupils during the phasing out of the school, through the provision of temporary accommodation.</P>

      <P>The process of assessing the need for new or additional educational facilities at primary or post-primary level in any given area entails consideration by my Department of all relevant factors, including enrolment and demographic trends, housing developments and the capacity of existing schools to meet the demand for places. My Department is at present concentrating on the areas of major development and population growth with a view to identifying where the most urgent need for new or additional facilities exists or is likely to arise in the future. As part of this process, officials of the planning and building unit consult regularly with local authorities regarding development proposals and their implications. In addition, standing arrangements are in place for officials of my Department's planning and building unit to meet on a regular basis with officials of the four Dublin local authorities to discuss development proposals and consequent site requirements for new schools. Liaison with existing schools is an important part of the process also, as the school authorities would usually alert my Department where, in their view, the need for additional accommodation is anticipated.</P>
      <P>In the event that the level of development and population growth in an area indicates a likely long-term need for primary or post-primary educational provision, a decision is made on the means by which that need should be met. Generally, this involves the provision of permanent accommodation in the form of a new school or an extension to existing facilities. High quality temporary or prefabricated accommodation is normally provided to alleviate short-term accommodation needs. Where appropriate, the local authority may be requested to reserve a site for educational purposes. In this way, every effort is made to ensure that there is adequate existing provision, or that timely arrangements are made to extend capacity where necessary.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 178 to 180, inclusive, together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As the Deputy will be aware, section 6(1) of the Education Act 1998 makes specific provision for the extension of bi-lingualism in Irish society and in particular the achievement of a greater use of the Irish language at school and in the community. Furthermore, it requires the maintenance of Irish as the primary community language in Gaeltacht areas. This position is reflected in the report of the Gaeltacht Commission 2002 which provides the basis for future policy on the Irish language and the Gaeltacht. In accordance with section 6(1) of the Education Act 1998, my Department's objective in relation to its expenditure is mainly on the following; the equipping of student teachers during their course of training to be competent teachers of Irish at primary level and capable of teaching through Irish in such schools as use Irish as their medium of instruction, the equipping of an adequate number of <Col N="1750" />teachers to teach Irish at second level and to teach through Irish in such schools as use Irish as their medium of instruction; the continuance of a body to advise the Minister and the Department of the ongoing requirements of the aforesaid provision and to support the provision of textbooks as required in accordance with section 31 of the Education Act to ensure that at first and second level curricula in line with best linguistic research and answering to the needs of learners are available to pupils according to their abilities, and providing for such in-career developmental training as is necessary to equip teachers properly to deliver the curricula; ensuring that competent teachers are provided to give a stimulating experience of Irish to students who attend coláistí Gaeilge; providing financial aid to third level institutions through the Higher Education Authority to provide courses through the medium of Irish, to employ oifigigh Ghaeilge to propagate use of the language within the institution and to encourage the use of Irish as a medium of conversation, and taking steps to ensure that Irish versions are available of all our published documentation.</P>
    <P>In December 2001, I established An Chomhairle um Oideachas Gaeltachta agus Gaelscolaíochta, under section 31 of the Education Act, to plan and co-ordinate the provision of textbooks and aids to learning and teaching through Irish, and to advise me on policies relating to the provision and promotion of education through the medium of Irish in recognised schools generally and in schools located in Gaeltacht areas. This body will provide support services and will conduct research into matters relating to the promotion of the Irish language. The inspectorate of my Department monitors the quality and effectiveness of the provision of education in the State. In the context of their general evaluative work, inspectors report to me on the delivery of the syllabi in Irish, the teaching methods and the overall outcome of teaching and learning. My Department has undertaken recently a major survey in conjunction with Institiúid Teangeolaíochta Éireann, ITE. The survey aims to measure progress in the teaching and learning of Irish among sixth class pupils in primary schools.</P>
    <P>The National Council for Curriculum and Assessment reviews curricula and examinations from time to time and will have access to the advice of An Comhairle um Oideachas Gaeltachta agus Gaelscolaíochta on matters relating to the teaching of Irish and teaching through Irish at primary and second levels. The State Examinations Commission provides external monitoring of the junior certificate and leaving certificate examinations. My Department does not keep data on the level of spending on individual subjects as the collection of such data would involve the expenditure of an inordinate amount of resources to collate it. While specific expenditure on grants to Irish language organisations, on individual promotion programmes dealing with aspects of the curriculum, and on in-service <Col N="1751" />courses would be available, the major element of expenditure on the Irish language each year involves the levels of teaching resources devoted to the subject at both primary and second levels. This information is not readily available in the format sought by the Deputy.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Mr. N. Dempsey)</NameTxt>
      <P>It is my intention that all children, including children with autistic spectrum disorders, ASD, receive education appropriate to their needs. All children with special education needs within the primary school system, including children with ASD, have an automatic entitlement to a response to their needs. The special educational needs of children with ASD can be addressed in special dedicated schools, in special dedicated classes attached to ordinary schools, or on an integrated basis in ordinary schools. Decisions regarding the most appropriate model of response in each particular case are based on the professionally-assessed needs of the individual child. Many children at primary school level, with disorders on the autistic spectrum, are capable of attending ordinary schools on an integrated basis with the support, where necessary, of resource teachers and, or, special needs assistants.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Where the level of the condition is of a more serious nature, provision is made by way of special schools or special classes attached to ordinary schools. All such facilities receive enhanced capitation grants and operate at a maximum pupil teacher ratio of 6:1. Special needs assistant support is also provided where required. There are currently 115 such classes for pupils with autism in the primary system. This includes three special classes for children with Aspergers' syndrome, which is on the autistic spectrum. My Department allocates additional resources to individual second-level schools to cater for special needs pupils enrolled in those schools. Applications for resources are referred to the national educational psychological service and each case is considered on its merits. There are seven facilities in the State delivering educational services using alternative educational methods for teaching children on the autistic spectrum, including the facility referred to by the Deputy. My Department has been funding this project on a pilot basis since its operation in September 2001. It catered for 12 children initially and has since been expanded to <Col N="1752" />cater for 24 children. The level of funding approved each year is determined following consideration of the annual budget proposal submitted by the promoters.</P>
    <P>A decision on the future of the pilot projects will be taken in light of an evaluation of provision for children with ASD currently being carried out by my Department's inspectorate. The evaluation process will also include educational services for children with autism in other settings such as special schools, special classes and children integrated in mainstream schools. It is envisaged that this process will be completed later this year.</P>

It appears that no such advice or instruction has, to date, been sought in the case of the student, referred to by the Deputy. If an individual applicant considers that he or she has been unjustly refused a maintenance grant, or that the rate of grant awarded is not the correct one, he or she may appeal to the relevant local authority or VEC. Where an individual applicant has had an appeal turned down, in writing, by the relevant local authority or VEC, and remains of the view that the body has not interpreted the schemes correctly in his or her case, a letter outlining the position may be sent to my Department. Alternatively, as already indicated, the local authority or VEC may, itself, in exceptional circumstances, seek clarification on issues from my Department.

      <Quest> his views on the conclusion of a person (details supplied), employed with An Bord Pleanála, that there is no evidence to suggest that either the State, the local community or the BMW region would have benefited had the proposed onshore gas facility at Bellanboy been allowed to proceed; and the way in which he proposes to redress that situation.</Quest>

      <P>An Bord Pleanála, in assessing the appeal made to them for planning permission in connection with the building of a terminal for the Corrib gas field development, was entitled to formulate its own views as regards the benefits or otherwise of the proposed development. While the precise impact of the Corrib development could not have been quantified before development work commenced, and would only have become apparent with the passage of time, such a development would have had many quantitative and qualitative benefits which would have benefited the State, the local community and the BMW region in a number of ways.</P>
      <P>Benefits to the State can be summarised as follows: increase Ireland's security of supply by providing a reliable, secure indigenous source of gas; provide significant tax revenues; improve Ireland's industrial competitiveness; encourage continued investment in oil and gas exploration in Ireland and help Ireland achieve its Kyoto objectives.</P>
      <P>In respect of the provision of goods and services the main contracts for the sub-sea, the pipelines and the terminal went to specialist international companies. There are no suppliers of these services in Ireland and only a few worldwide. However, a number of Irish companies were contracted as subcontractors. Pierse Construction and M. C. O'Sullivan Engineering Services, were to be involved with onshore civil works. Under the terminal contract, SIAC is responsible for site preparation, civil and structural works while Irish Industrial Fabricators, IIF, was to carry out all mechanical, electrical and instrumentation fabrication and construction. Killybegs would have continued to be the main harbour used by the developers. It is my view that the Irish goods and services sector had, to date, won a substantial proportion of the Corrib gas field development work for which it was qualified to compete.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The benefits of the Corrib development to the local community, as claimed by Enterprise <Col N="1754" />Energy Ireland Ltd , EEIL, comprise a mix of quantitative and qualitative factors. The number of direct construction jobs starts at 100, rises to 500 before falling back to 200 over the timeframe of the project. While EEIL did not provide any estimate of numbers, it was considered that there would be a substantial number of indirect jobs in such areas as catering, accommodation, transport, port services, plant hire and other miscellaneous services. The number of jobs to operate the terminal is put at around 60 over a three shift cycle. Again, there would have been a number of indirect jobs in the supply of services. EEIL has stated on numerous public occasions its policy to recruit and train locals to meet its terminal employment requirements. Given the number of Irish subcontractors engaged in the project, my Department was of the view that these companies would recruit some of their labour requirements locally. The continuous employment of some 80 to 100 persons in Ireland by EEIL is also dependent on the development of this gas field. In addition, the local community would have benefited from a &euro;1.25 million community fund to be set up by the Corrib Group for local community projects.</P>
    <P>As regards the benefits to the BMW region, numerous reports over the years have elaborated on the regional disparities in economic performance in Ireland. Mayo and the north-west perform poorly on most criteria in these comparisons. The availability of indigenous competitively priced gas should facilitate an improvement in the region's energy infrastructure and supply position and thereby help stimulate further investment in Mayo and the north-west.</P>
    <P>The development of the gas field would contribute to the potential economic and social regeneration of Mayo and the north-west region and to the sustainable development of the area, in that it would have: acted as a catalyst for the extension of the natural gas network to the west; facilitated the improvement of the region's infrastructure, particularly its electricity supply and distribution network &ndash; thereby removing a barrier to inward investment; significantly increased local employment, especially in the construction phase and the long-term by way of terminal jobs.</P>
    <P>As of now, I understand that EEIL is evaluating its options in respect of the development of the Corrib gas field and I await the company's deliberations in this regard.</P>

The question of providing funding in the 2004 to 2006 period will depend on the Exchequer funding available for coastal protection works generally and overall national priorities. Protection of the Dublin-Wexford-Rosslare railway line is a matter for Iarnród Éireann.</P>

      <P>I am considering the implications, from a range of perspectives, of the BBC's decision to offer its service on unencrypted satellite. The BBC's decision, especially if other UK terrestrial broadcasters follow suit, has implications for Irish audiences, Irish broadcasters and for those who sell television services in the Irish market. The BBC decision will also inform my consideration of the options for the introduction of digital terrestrial television in Ireland.</P>

      <P>The Nursing Home (Subvention) Regulations 1993 are administered by the health boards and the Eastern Regional Health Authority. There are currently three maximum rates payable &ndash;&euro;114.30, &euro;152.40 and &euro;190.50 &ndash; in accordance with three levels of dependency &ndash; medium, high and maximum &ndash; which are eligible for subvention. A health board may pay more than the maximum rate of subvention relative to an individual's level of dependency, for example, in cases where personal funds are exhausted. This is on foot of the Nursing Homes Subvention) (Amendment) Regulations 1996, which amended the Nursing Home (Subvention) Regulations 1993 by inserting articles 22.3 and 22.4 permitting health boards to contract beds in private nursing homes and to pay more than the maximum rates of subvention in such cases. However, the application of these provisions is a matter for the individual health board concerned in the context of meeting increasing demand for subventions within the board's revenue allocation as notified annually in the letter of determination. This is in keeping with the provisions of the Health (Amendment) (No. 3) Act 1996. As with applications for nursing home subvention, when an application for enhanced subvention is granted, the increased rate of subvention will be backdated to the date when all the appropriate documentation in respect of the application was received by the health board.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>The National Disease Surveillance Centre plays a key role in respect of the prevention and management of infectious diseases in this country. The Irish approach to infectious diseases outbreaks is based on sound internationally accepted principles such as: preventative measures; early identification of cases; effective clinical care including good hospital infection control; appropriate surveillance; and contract tracing and management of contacts.</P>
      <P>The procedures for dealing with infectious diseases are based on these principles. Many infectious diseases can be prevented by vaccine use. Immunisation against infectious disease has probably saved more lives than any other public health intervention, apart from the provision of clean water. Improvements in living standards have reduced the mortality from infectious diseases, but immunisation has also played a large role in the reduction of disease incidence.</P>
      <P>It would not have been possible to eradicate smallpox without vaccine, and the eradication of polio in the European region is also largely due to immunisation. In recent years, improved economic and social conditions, together with public health action, have virtually eliminated the pandemics of communicable diseases.</P>
      <P>I will continue to establish expert committees-groups to advise on the most appropriate action given the particular circumstances of the outbreak concerned. Guidelines and protocols on the management of many different types of outbreaks have been developed based on the principles referred to above. These guidelines also take into account guidance published by the World Health Organisation, the Centres for Disease Control in the USA and a number of other reputable international public health bodies. Most outbreak situations begin with the establishment of an outbreak control team, which manages the outbreak and puts in place whatever control measures are needed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Health boards have protocols and procedures in place for dealing with cases of infectious diseases such as measles, bacterial meningitis and septicaemia and incidences of food-borne illnesses such as e-coli 0157 and salmonella. Cases must be notified, in the first instance, by the diagnosing clinician to the relevant health board which in turn notifies the National Disease Surveillance Centre. Any further actions required such as implementation of control measures, contact tracing, surveillance and so on are then undertaken by the relevant board and the <Col N="1761" />National Disease Surveillance Centre, as appropriate. Furthermore, in the case of food-borne illness, environmental health officers carry out environmental investigations and implement appropriate environmental control measures.</P>
    <P>The current public health doctors' dispute has hampered the health boards' ability to respond to infectious disease cases. My Department, together with the ERHA and each health board, has put contingency plans in place to enable them to provide an emergency response to infectious disease outbreaks during the course of the strike. These plans include: the establishment of a national network of senior co-ordinators at health board level to monitor the contingency plans and report on suspect cases throughout the country; and the establishment of an incident room with a dedicated national call number in my Department, with reports are forwarded twice daily by health boards.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately, at present the capacity of the Eastern Regional Health Authority, the health boards and the National Disease Surveillance Centre to respond to any problems in the area of infectious diseases is compromised due to the ongoing industrial action by public health doctors. Every effort is being made to resolve this dispute.</P>

      <Quest>if there is a fixed charge for long stay patients who are pensioners, in district hospitals and community old peoples homes in the Southern Health Board, Kerry region; and the way in which the charges are calculated.</Quest>

      <P>As the Deputy will be aware, responsibility for provision of health services in the Kerry area rests with the Southern Health Board.</P>
      <P>The statutory authority to raise charges in geriatric hospitals and homes is governed by the Institutional Assistance Regulations 1954, as amended by the Institutional Assistance Regulations 1965 and the Health (Charges for In-patient Services) Regulations 1976, as amended by the Health (Charges for In-patient Services) 1987. These regulations allow health boards to provide institutional assistance &ndash; that is, shelter and maintenance &ndash; in a county home or other similar institution to older people who are in need of long-stay care. The Southern Health Board deems welfare homes, continuing care units and the majority of beds in its community hospitals to be within the term &ldquo;similar institutions&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Health (Charges for In-patient Services) Regulations 1976, as amended by the Health (Charges for In-patient Services) Amendment Regulations 1987 provide health boards with the statutory authority to charge for in-patient services where the person: has not full eligibility; has <Col N="1762" />no dependents; and has been an in-patient for 30 days or for periods aggregating 30 days in the past 12 months. In accordance with these regulations, the Southern Health Board charges eligible patients 80% of their pension &ndash; income towards their maintenance costs. The balance of the patient's income is made available to them for their own comforts or is lodged to a person/patient property account for their exclusive use. In deciding the amount to be contributed, the board has regard to the person's circumstances, allowance is made of any outgoings, and a reasonable amount of the person's income is left for personal needs. Where a person has dependants the charges do not apply.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 202 and 214 together.</P>
      <P>In recent days, my Department has advised the Not for Profit Business Organisation of an additional allocation of &euro;5.85 million to relieve the underfunding situation of its member organisations.</P>
      <P>Further claims amounting to over &euro;5 million have been made by the association and these claims are being considered by my Department, in consultation with the Eastern Regional Health Authority, the health boards and the association itself, having regard to the availability of funds. Additional claims for extra staff numbers will also be considered in the light of available resources.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The overall economic position in 2003 has had implications for all aspects of public investment, and this is reflected in the Estimates and budget adopted by the Government for 2003. Within this overall framework, however, some two-thirds of the additional funding available for non-capital investment in services has been allocated to the health services. This funding is being applied largely to maintaining existing levels of service across all service programmes including services for people with disabilities. While it is regrettable that the level of investment in these services <Col N="1763" />achieved in recent years could not be maintained in 2003, my Department will work closely with the health boards and other service providers in relation to service provision this year.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>Following the publication of the report of the joint review group on psychological services in the health services in March 2002, a major priority for my Department was to promote an integrated and co-ordinated approach by the health boards to its implementation over time. This applied, in particular, to the major recommendations of the report relating to the organisation and management of psychology services, entailing very substantial increases in the number of principal and director level psychologist posts.</P>
      <P>Given the key role of the health boards executive in fostering collective working and progressing organisational change and development in the health service, my Department secured the agreement of the executive to work with the directors of human resources in the health boards towards the implementation of the recommendations of the report. The current position is that the directors of human resources are in the process of individually considering the recommendations contained in the report and how their boards might propose to proceed with the implementation process in due course. This work is being undertaken in light of: service imperatives; funding priorities; and the budget 2003 announcement on public service numbers. In this context, it is important to bear in mind that the overall budgetary and economic position in 2003 has had important implications for all aspects of public spending, and this is reflected in the Estimates and budget adopted by Government for 2003.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Given these constraints, my Department, together with the directors of human resources in the health boards, is prioritising support for the implementation of a key recommendation of the joint review report relating to human resource planning through the provision of a substantial number of additional post-graduate training places in clinical psychology. This has resulted in <Col N="1764" />a threefold increase since end-1999, from 26 to 83, in the number of student clinical psychologists employed in the health services. This development, in enhancing graduate output, will help maintain an improved balance between demand and supply in human resource and service provision.</P>
    <P>My Department remains committed to working on an ongoing basis with health agencies, educational providers and the education authorities to ensure adequate provision of training places in clinical psychology, consistent with the medium-term human resource requirements of the health services and the important recommendations on investment in training and education detailed in the Action Plan for People Management published in November 2002.</P>
    <P>A particular priority is to secure the best return, in terms of graduate output, on the very significant financial resources currently being invested in the health services to support post-graduate clinical psychology training. Consequently, my Department, together with the health boards' directors of human resources, is currently examining the current model for post-graduate psychology training, with the objective of supporting training provision on a planned and sustainable medium-term basis.</P>
    <P>Responsibility for the provision of psychology services and human resource planning, including the monitoring and filling of psychologist posts, in the eastern region rests with the regional chief executive of the Eastern Regional Health Authority. The regional chief executive, in managing the workforce in his region, is responsible for determining the appropriate staffing mix and the precise grades of staff to be employed in line with service plan priorities, subject to overall employment levels remaining within the approved regional employment ceiling. My Department has, therefore, asked the regional chief executive of ERHA to investigate the matter raised by the Deputy and reply to him directly.</P>

      <P>Any resulting initiatives in relation to the development of a HEMS will need to complement other pre-hospital services such as the ground ambulance service, first responder schemes and other emergency schemes. Air ambulance services for emergency cases which cannot be safely conveyed by road ambulance are provided at present by the Air Corps and the marine search and rescue helicopter services of the Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources.

    <P>The State has no involvement in the funding of these schemes and there is no question of an injection of State funds into any semi-State pension fund irrespective of any considerations regarding a change in ownership. Any such proposal would run counter to established policy in this area and would, in any event, be challenged by the European Commission as a state aid. I <Col N="1769" />have, therefore, no plans to discuss any such proposal with the European Commission.</P>

      <P>The position relating to a PSO for Waterford must be considered in the light of a general review of the current PSO regime. In this regard, my Department is currently examining the effectiveness of the PSO air services programme and the related issue of regional airport policy generally. As the Deputy will be aware, the EU Commission turned down a previous proposal for a PSO air service between Waterford and Dublin on the grounds that such a service was not considered an essential air service as specified under the relevant EU regulation.</P>
      <P>Partly in recognition of the fact that Waterford Airport does not have a PSO service, the grant from my Department for marketing/promotion and security measures was substantially increased in recent years from &euro;250,000 in 2001 to &euro;650,000 this year. In this regard, I welcome the fact that the airport authorities in Waterford have secured a new carrier to resume the important Luton service. This service is scheduled to recommence on 9 June with Aer Arann Express.</P>

Among other things, I understand that the study will propose bus priority measures as a means of tackling traffic congestion in the city. While responsibility for the provision of bus lanes or bus corridors in Waterford rests with the city council, officials of my Department recently met officials of the council asking that proposals be brought forward to improve access in and around the city for public transport, including the introduction of QBCs, and in that regard financial support was offered.

      <P>The process of metrication of speed limits forms part <Col N="1770" />of a comprehensive review of speed limits that is currently under way. The review will address all of the major issues relating to speed limit policy including the range of speed limits deployed on roadways including roadways in residential areas, and in respect of particular categories of vehicles. The signage used to indicate speed limits and the implications of the adoption of metric values for speed measurement will also be central to the review.</P>
      <P>A broadly-based working group has been established to carry out this review and it is intended that the review will be completed this summer. The working group's report will make recommendations relating to the timing and administration of the adoption of metric values and will assist in determining the appropriate legislative requirements needed to underpin those recommendations. Earlier this month, my Department, in conjunction with the Department of the Environment and Local Government and the Dublin Transportation Office, published traffic management guidelines. The guidelines manual, a copy of which is available in the Oireachtas library, provides guidance on a wide range of issues including speed management and traffic calming on existing roads and the incorporation of speed restraint measures for new residential designs.</P>

      <P>Dúchas was the title of the organisational division and the brand name used by that division of my Department which had responsibility for the State's built and natural heritage functions. Following the recent Government decision announced by me on 16 April 2003, my Department will have responsibility for policy in respect of the built heritage and for both policy and operational matters relating to the natural heritage.

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 246 to 248, inclusive, together.</P>
      <P>My Department is committed to providing quality services in Irish and English as outlined in the Department's customer service action plan, 2001-04. Guidance has recently been provided to assist staff in arranging for the translation of documents into Irish and mechanisms are in place to measure and report on the service being provided in Irish. Progress in implementing all aspects of the customer service action plan, including the Irish language, is outlined in the Department's annual report. Copies of the annual report, 2001, and the customer service action plan, 2001-04, are available in the Oireachtas Library. The annual report 2002 will be published shortly.</P>
      <P>Substantial costs are incurred by my Department in the translation, advertising, and publishing of documents bilingually, in advertising in the Irish language media and in providing Irish language training for staff. However, the total amount of money spent on this per year is not readily available and its compilation would involve a disproportionate amount of time and work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Consistent with section 68 of the Local <Col N="1780" />Government Act 2001, arrangements for the establishment of an advisory group to provide guidance to local authorities on the use of Irish are being considered.</P>

      <P>In July 2002 local authorities were asked to submit to my Department proposals in respect of improvement works, including bridge strengthening works, on non-national roads which could be considered for funding under the EU co-financed specific improvement grants scheme in 2003. All applications submitted under this scheme were considered in my Department having regard to EU eligibility criteria, the need to prioritise projects, competing demands from other local authorities and the funds available for the scheme in 2003.</P>
      <P>Cork County Council's application for funding in 2003 under the EU co-financed specific improvement grants scheme included an application for funding of &euro;50,000 for the design phase of the R624 Cobh Road, Phase 1. However, this project was not among the council's 13 projects selected for funding in 2003. My Department will again be seeking applications under the EU co-financed specific improvement grants scheme later this year and it would be open to the council to apply for funding for this scheme in 2004.</P>

      <P>The conservation ranger post in Inishowen, County Donegal, is vacant arising from the transfer of the previous incumbent to another post within the national parks and wildlife section of my Department. Efforts to fill this vacancy, both internally from serving staff and externally from an existing panel drawn up by the Civil Service and Local Appointments Commission, were not successful. That panel has now lapsed. The commission has now been requested by my Department to proceed with the establishment of a new panel to fill this and other conservation ranger vacancies, and <Col N="1781" />advertisements inviting applications for this panel are expected to be placed very soon.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment and Local Government (Mr. Cullen)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Question Nos. 251 to 253, inclusive, together.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy is aware, it has been the policy of successive Governments to provide positive support for the Irish language, as our national language and the first official language under the Constitution. Irish is a vital part of the State's heritage and my Department has been given a mandate by Government to support the extension of the use of Irish countrywide and the maintenance of the Irish language in the Gaeltacht, the primary source of the living language.</P>
      <P>My Department's strategic objectives in relation to the Irish language are: to ensure better provision of public services through Irish; to strengthen Irish as the principal community language in the Gaeltacht, particularly in terms of passing the language from one generation to the next; to support Foras na Gaeilge in its task of increasing the use of the Irish language in everyday life throughout the island of Ireland; and to provide definitive Irish forms of the place names of Ireland for official and public use.</P>
      <P>A range of outputs, together with relevant performance indicators, have been identified for the purpose of achieving the furtherance of these strategic objectives. The monitoring system which examines achievement of the objectives includes formal and informal reporting and review by the Department and by other agencies as appropriate, for example, the Office of the Comptroller and Auditor General. The democratic process and customer service plans also have a role.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy will appreciate that it is not possible to clearly distinguish the proportions of expenditure within my Department's Vote that relate solely to the Irish or English languages, respectively, given the cross-over benefits under many programmes for speakers of both langu<Col N="1782" />ages. If, however, the Deputy has a query regarding specific expenditure on any particular subhead, I will be happy to provide whatever information is available.</P>

      <Quest>the contributions which are accredited to insurance numbers for a person (details supplied) in County Mayo, including pre-1953 years; if this person's record can be linked with their US social security record to enable them to get a pension; and if this person has sufficient contributions to qualify for a pension based on these combined contributions.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan" hpid="Mary Coughlan Mary Coughlan">

      <P>According to my Department's records, the person concerned has a total of 22 contributions paid since first entering insurance in 1948. This record is insufficient to qualify him for a standard rate of old age contributory pension or the special half rate pre-1953 pension. Under reciprocal arrangements with the US his Irish insurance from 1953 has been combined with his US insurance and he qualifies for a pro-rata old age contributory pension from 12 March 1999. The current weekly rate of the pension is &euro;5.80. He is also entitled to living alone allowance, the current rate of which is &euro;7.70. Details of payment arrangements have been requested and on receipt of these, the pension will be put into payment and arrears paid. Under social welfare legislation, decisions in relation to claims are made by deciding officers and appeals officers. These are statutorily appointed and I have no role in regard to making such decisions.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 257 to 259, inclusive, together.</P>
      <P>My Department, in recognition of the rights of customers to be dealt with in Irish if they so wish, makes every effort to ensure that service through Irish is available and of a high standard.</P>
      <P>It is not possible to quantify the amount of money spent specifically on Irish in any given year. Providing services for customers through Irish involves translation and printing of forms and leaflets, training of staff in written and spoken Irish, and providing public area signage with both directions and information on the availability of service in Irish. The cost of the Irish element is, in many instances, included in the total cost and cannot be separately identified.</P>
      <P>In anticipation of the enactment of the Official Languages Bill 2002, currently before the Oireachtas, my Department is providing specialised training courses in Irish for frontline staff in order to ensure that the requirements of the Bill as far as my Department's services are concerned are met. This is set to continue in future years as indicated in my Department's recently launched strategy statement 2003-05.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My Department's customer action plan includes a commitment to providing service through Irish and this objective is monitored as part of the overall monitoring of customer service. Since 2001, a comments and complaints sys<Col N="1784" />tem operates, allowing customers to express comments on the level of service they are receiving. This includes service through Irish and comments-complaints forms in Irish are available.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan" hpid="Mary Coughlan Mary Coughlan">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Social and Family Affairs (Mary Coughlan)</NameTxt>
      <P>The issue of people who failed narrowly to qualify for a pension, including self employed people who were already over 56 years in 1988 when compulsory social insurance was introduced for this group, was addressed in 1999. These people could not qualify for a pension because they could not satisfy the basic conditions required for pensions purposes, particularly the requirement to have entered insurance ten years before pension age.</P>
      <P>A special old age (contributory) pension was introduced in April 1999 for self employed people who were aged 56 or over in April 1988 and who have at least five year's contributions paid since then. Payment is at a flat-rate of 50% of the standard maximum rate with equivalent increases for adult and child dependants, where applicable. The special arrangement introduced in April 1999 represents a positive and reasonable response to the situation in which this particular group of people found themselves and there are no plans at present to make further changes.</P>

Following an examination of his case his claim was disallowed, in accordance with section 125 (5)(a) of the Social Welfare (Consolidation) Act, for a period of nine weeks, on the grounds that he lost his employment through his own misconduct.</P>
      <P>Notification of the decision and his right to appeal issued on 21 May 2003. The person concerned has been paid supplementary welfare allowance from 30 April 2003 to 28 May 2003. The person concerned did not apply for nor does he have an entitlement to disability benefit.
