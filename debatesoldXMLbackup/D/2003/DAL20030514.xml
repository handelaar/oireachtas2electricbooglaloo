      <P>Before proceeding with business today, I take the opportunity to welcome to Dáil Éireann our parliamentary colleagues from the Parliament of the Republic of Poland who are with us this afternoon in the Distinguished Visitors' Gallery. They are members of the Economic Committee of the Republic of Poland who are led by its chairman, Mr. Adam Stanislaw Szenifeld. On my behalf and on behalf of the Members of Dáil Éireann, I extend to you, Mr. Szenifeld and the members of your delegation a most sincere welcome. I express the hope that you will find your visit to be interesting, successful and to our mutual benefit.</P>

      <P>I have received from Deputy Bernard Allen who was suspended from the service of the Dáil yesterday, Tuesday, 13 May, for disregarding the authority of the Chair, a written and approved expression of regret in the following terms:</P>
      <P>Dear Ceann Comhairle,</P>
      <P>In accordance with the requirements of Standing Order 61(3), I am writing to express my regret over my interventions in the House on Tuesday 13th May 2003 during Taoiseach's Question Time which you ruled out of order.</P>
      <P>I regret that I ignored your ruling and the consequent disruption to the business of the House.</P>
      <P>Yours sincerely</P>
      <P>(Signed) Bernard Allen.</P>
      <P>In accordance with Standing Order 61(3)(<i>b</i>), I must now move: &ldquo;That the Order of the Dáil of 13 May suspending Deputy Allen from the service of the Dáil be discharged&rdquo;. Is that agreed? Agreed.</P>

      <P>This day last year the Taoiseach participated in a television debate prior to the general election. In the course of that debate he said that street violence is a very small aspect of crime. He said that if returned to Government, Fianna Fáil would eliminate waiting lists within two years and recruit a further 2000 gardaí. Let us look at what has happened one year on. The education building programme has been cut by &euro;88 million. The national drugs funding strategy has been cut by &euro;7 million. Government funding for FÁS and community employment schemes has been cut by &euro;86 million. The first-time buyers' grant has been abolished and overseas aid has been cut by approximately &euro;40 million.</P>
      <P>How can the Taoiseach come into this House one year on, a year after he sent a letter, with the imprimatur of the Minister for Finance, to the leaders of the parties saying that no cuts were planned in public expenditure in secret or by any other means when we now have cutback after cutback, waiting lists increasing and the decimation of public services, which is far from what we were told? At the current rate of Garda recruitment, it would be 40 years before 2,000 extra gardaí are on the streets. Public crime has increased from 45 incidents per day in 1996 to 117 per day now. Hospital waiting lists have increased by 4,300 between June and September last year and the Government and the Minister for Health and Children have not published any figures since then. I could give other examples, as can others. Will the Taoiseach not now admit, one year on in his second term of office, that the letter sent out and what he said in a television debate this day last year was the biggest political lie ever perpetrated on the Irish people in the last decade?</P>

We increased the social welfare budget by 6% and put &euro;550 million into the social exclusion fund. We said we would continue to maintain the economic growth of this country.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>I have listened to this type of reply for a number of months. Just a year ago the Taoiseach told the public, in a formal television debate to put himself forward for re-election, that he would eliminate waiting lists within two years, recruit 2,000 extra gardaí and deal with the other issues referred to in the programme for Government. The Taoiseach did not mention the 10,000 people waiting for elective day surgery. There are 1,900 people waiting in Beaumont, 1,900 waiting in Letterkenny and 800 in Limerick.</P>
      <P>The Taoiseach has failed the test of commitment to politics and to live up to the promises he made so solemnly last year. He has let down the integrity of politics and ruined, for many young people, the aspiration of ever owning a house. A clinical nurse said last week in Tallaght Hospital: &ldquo;In the 1980s, Charlie Haughey closed beds and bought shirts; this is 2003 and Bertie Ahern is closing beds and buying jets&rdquo;. These are the words of a senior clinical nurse and they epitomise what the population thinks about this Government. The end is not yet here but it is nigh.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>In reply to Deputy Kenny and the people he quotes, including the nurses, in the last year we have continued to increase the number of nurses. There are more nurses than ever in the training schools. In the Dublin hospitals alone, there are 6,800 more nurses than there <Col N="1069" /> were a few years ago. Over &euro;1 billion has been put into the health service to continue the major capital programme there.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach does not appreciate that he is almost permanently in &ldquo;comical Ali&rdquo; mode. There is no sense or reason to what he said. Deputy Kenny raised a number of issues from a single television debate in which the Taoiseach participated. It was the only television debate in which he participated during the election campaign and, for some extraordinary reason, the only one in his six years as Taoiseach. The doorstep interview, the 35 second soundbite, with which the media are so cravenly satisfied is the Taoiseach's standard.</P>
      <P>Deputy Kenny raised the deception in the promises advanced by the Taoiseach in that interview. I wish to ask the Taoiseach about a deception that was not promised. I do not recall the Taoiseach, Deputy Noel Dempsey or Fianna Fáil campaigning to reintroduce third level fees. Will the Taoiseach, for the sake of parents whose children will sit examinations in two weeks, lift this uncertainty once and for all? What is the position? The Government is divided. On 16 April, the Tánaiste confirmed in the House that her party opposes the reintroduction of third level fees. She has tatty posters in the third level institutions asserting as much. I read this morning that most of the lads on the backbenches are engaged in what Fianna Fáil is doing these days, bringing both sides of the road with them. Half of them are for it and half of them are against it.</P>
      <P>What is the position on third level fees? Young people are about to take their leaving certificate examinations and their parents do not know whether they will have to come up with serious money, after paying tax, to give their children an opportunity to enjoy third level education in an era when our society and economy demand that people have such education. Will the Taoiseach state, at least in respect of the next academic year, the Government's position? As somebody said at our annual conference last weekend: &ldquo;If there was a kite flying championship in the Olympics, Deputy Noel Dempsey would be the undisputed champion&rdquo;.</P>

      <P>I have done a huge number of interviews in the past year. It is good to move about and see what is happening but now Deputy Rabbitte has decided in his new strategy to neglect ordinary working class people and go for the upper and middle classes. The question asked by the Deputy is consistent with that. The Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Dempsey, has said there is a problem with access to third level for working people and people in the low socio-economic groups. Deputy Rabbitte is saying we should not look at this area.</P>
      <P>The Minister has stated that the issue of access has been around for a long time. Nobody is talking about taking away the rights of people on small or moderate incomes or even what would be considered high incomes. However, as the Minister said, there are inconsistencies in a situation where people who have enormous incomes and salaries, earned through shares and other means, do not&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach earlier talked about a difficult international climate. I want to return to the issue of climate change because the Taoiseach needs to clarify to the Dáil something he said in his last exchange with me on that matter in late April when he said that the Moneypoint plant would be changing to gas generation. Subsequently he wrote to me and included a copy of the Adjournment debate contribution by the Minister for the Environment and Local Government. It seems that the ESB and the Minister are not of that view and would be more inclined to say that there would be no change to gas in Moneypoint. That said, would the Taoiseach agree that at that point he may have inadvertently misled the House?</P>
      <P>How is his Government going to respond to the serious findings of the European Environment Agency that Irish emissions in 2001 stood 31% higher than in 1990, well over double the increase legally allowed between 1990 and 2008? Given that Ireland is at the rock bottom of the league, the dirty man of Europe, is it possible for the Government to face reality and recognise its climate change strategy is not working? Will it scrap that strategy and recognise that, in the interest of Irish competitiveness, as IBEC has said, the fine of &euro;1.3 billion on Irish taxpayers and Irish industry, according to the Department of the Environment and Local Government's annual figures, is going to severely dent competitiveness and will open this Government to further ridicule and discredit if it is not prepared to tackle this issue urgently?</P>
      <P>The Taoiseach keeps saying he is going to engage in emissions trading, as does the Minister for the Environment and Local Government, Deputy Cullen, who is trying to speak at the same time as me on this question. Are there any other serious plans, apart from emissions trading, which will work because the current plans in regard to the built environment are failing. The Government is putting five times more money into roads than into public transport and is underscoring seriously in delivering on wind energy compared to other EU countries. We can have some impact on all of these issues if the Taoiseach is serious about it. Apart from emissions trading, what is the Government's plan to tackle this serious international issue?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>As Deputy Sargent correctly states, we had this debate on a previous occasion and I said I would give the additional information which I have now passed on to him. That showed that while the ESB is looking at all other options as to what precisely it is going to do, it is involved in a &euro;200 million programme to take the nitrous oxide and sulphur dioxide out of the Moneypoint plant and to see where it will progress in that <Col N="1074" /> area. At the same time it has to be conscious of maintaining security of supply.</P>
      <P>Deputy Sargent is correct that our Kyoto emissions growth limitation target of 13% over 1990 levels by the end of this decade reflects our need for development against the 1990 base line, and the need to look at environmental emissions in addressing climate change. It was always expected that our greenhouse gas emissions would increase in the medium term. Preliminary indications are that emissions growth is peaking. Deputy Sargent is aware of those figures and we have published a figure of 31% growth for 2001 which was the last figure. That means we have the furthest to go among EU member states to meet our target. Ten of the 15 states within the EU burden sharing scheme are now off target. Most significantly our emissions growth rate has been considerably slower than our economic growth rate and our performance in decoupling emissions and economic growth is the best in Europe apart from Luxembourg, which has a better record than us.</P>

Our national climate change strategy set a ten-year policy framework to achieve our target and the Minister for the Environment and Local Government is now reviewing it to intensify its implementation, which he has announced recently in this House. Our progress report on the first year implementation which was published at the end of last year showed measures under way capable of achieving 20% of our target, which is substantial.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Taoiseach agree that a couple of the things he has said are not tenable? We have not decoupled economic growth from growth in greenhouse gas emissions. The European Environment Agency has stated that in black and white. I would like the Taoiseach to agree that the European Environment Agency knows what it is talking about. Would he agree also that we have not peaked by all the indications? We are continuing to grow our greenhouse gas emissions, in accelerating terms.</P>
      <P>I would ask for a scrapping of the climate change strategy. What is the Taoiseach going to do to address the clear failure of the strategy to date? Is he, for example, going to amend the national development plan in any sense, based on the predictions for climate change and the stated fallout from that climate change in terms of various difficulties including water scarcity, difficulties with farming, storm damage or floods, or is he simply going to buy waders to replace the wellingtons that served him so well when he was standing in the floods in Drumcondra? Will he give waders to everyone in the country if he is going to be so blasé about the whole issue.</P>

Emissions per unit of GDP are at <Col N="1076" /> 62% of the 1990 level compared with 78% for the EU as a whole. I did not claim that the problem was resolved but gave the factual position. Deputy Sargent asked what we are doing. The Minister and his officials have been engaged, not only with the Environmental Protection Agency but with all sectors, obviously including the ESB and the energy sector, as well as the IBEC and the farmers, in work on the issue. We are aware of our responsibilities and our position after the first year, and we will continue to deal with that. No one is failing to acknowledge the issue. I gave Deputy Sargent information on nitrous and sulphur oxide and said that the &euro;200 million investment in Moneypoint is significant. That is continuing and represents major progress in dealing with the issue.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 1 to 5, inclusive, together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Use of the ministerial air transport service requires my approval. Procedurally, requests for use of the service are made by Ministers' private secretaries to my office and are dealt with, in the first instance, by the staff of my office. Requests are examined by my staff with regard to the need and purpose of travel, the destination and other logistical details. Any necessary clarification or further information is sought at that point. All screened requests are then submitted to me for <Col N="1077" /> approval. Once approved, all operational matters are settled directly by the Minister in question and the Department of Defence or Air Corps.</P>
    <P>There are no plans at present to review the criteria. However, I expect that the guidelines will be kept under review in the context of the purchase of new aircraft for the ministerial air transport service.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle An Ceann Comhairle">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>Before calling Deputy Rabbitte, I draw the House's attention to the fact that there are a great many questions on Northern Ireland. Perhaps the House will be agreeable to take a supplementary on this question from each of the Members who have submitted a question and a final reply from the Taoiseach to get on to the Northern Ireland questions. It is a matter entirely for Members. Is that agreed? Agreed</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>I will cut to the chase and ask the Taoiseach the position on the purchase of a new Government jet or jets. Is the Taoiseach aware that my colleague, Deputy Sherlock, recently got an answer from the Department of Defence showing that the Gulfstream IV was available on 135 out of the 136 occasions on which its use was requested last year? Is the Taoiseach aware that the rest of us were under the impression that it was a clapped-out aircraft, which, his PR department had led us to believe was in danger of coming down over Lambay Island or some such place some day because it was in such bad shape? There were reports about the Taoiseach being stranded and so on. According to the figures here, the aircraft was available for 96.7% of its requested missions &ndash; 135 occasions out of 136. Is it still the intention to dispose of the jet and what are the Government's exact purchase plans?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny" hpid="Mr. Kenny Mr. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to comment on Deputy Rabbitte's figures. My figures show 134 out of 135 instead of 135 out of 136. Perhaps the disparity relates to the time the petrol cap fell off in Mexico. It appears that the Department of Defence has cancelled a whole range of contracts regarding other important elements of the Defence Forces and that this is the only contract that will be signed.</P>
      <P>Does the Taoiseach envisage that Boeing will go head to head with Airbus on the tender for the jet? Given that the previous Government, at the time of Ireland's Presidency of the European Union in 1996, leased, or &ldquo;wet-leased&rdquo;, as it was called, a number of aircraft, including crew and staff, would it not be more feasible to do that, taking into account that the availability and reliability rate of the current Gulfstream IV is 96%.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent" hpid="Mr. Sargent Mr. Sargent">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
      <P>I am familiar in Dublin North with the work of many aviation engineers and I have discussed this matter with them. Is the Taoiseach aware that Gulfstream aeroplanes have been in production for about 40 years, with most of them <Col N="1078" /> still in service? The Government jet has flown only 10,000 hours, about the same as an Aer Lingus A330 does in two years. That means that the jet is relatively new and requires maintenance rather than replacement. I therefore ask the Taoiseach if it is not the maintenance of the jet that we must focus on rather than its replacement.</P>

      <NameTxt>Caoimhghín Ó Caoláin</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Taoiseach have any idea of the running costs of the aeroplane and the service that it provides to him and his fellow Ministers? Are running costs taken into account in determining the appropriateness of each ministerial trip? One would expect that they should be considered. Given the very serious situation regarding accident and emergency services around the country, does the Taoiseach not agree that moneys being committed to a new purchase now might be better expended in helping to create an emergency helicopter ambulance service for the more remote areas of our island?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeHiggins" hpid="Mr. J. Higgins Mr. J. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>How can the Taoiseach justify the expenditure by a small state of four million people of at least &euro;50 million &ndash; in some estimates up to &euro;80 million or &euro;100 million &ndash; on the purchase of a new jet or jets when there are now scheduled airlines flying to virtually every corner of Europe to which any Minister might possibly want to go? That is where most business is conducted. Why can the Ministers not hack it like the rest of us when we have to go abroad for our work and divert the funds into the socially necessary areas that are currently crying out for them?</P>

      <P>Deputy Kenny asked me to stick to the content of the questions, but the trouble is that almost none of the questions asked is to do with the content. I was asked about the procedures. I am not engaged in the tendering process or the technical issues of the Department of Defence or the Air Corps, but, even if it is slightly out of order, perhaps I might say that the tendering process is under way. It is an open process in terms of the prices for leasing, purchase or any other financial arrangements. The National Treasury Management Agency and the National Development Finance Agency are involved in examining the best option. The Beechcraft, which is over 25 years old, rarely flies. It is easy enough to have an availability record of 100% when one is only available a small fraction of the time &ndash; that is my experience. I am not a technical person, but Deputy Sargent's eminent experts in north County Dublin are the same people who tell me that the mileage on our Gulfstream is among the highest of that type in the world.</P>

I <Col N="1079" /> do not want to say anything disparaging about any of the staff because they always do their best.</P>
      <P>According to expert opinion, apparently aviation prices are very low at the moment. It is therefore a good time to go to the market. I accept it is not a good time to spend enormous amounts of money. However, if we can get a good deal on a suitable replacement for the Gulfstream and Beechcraft we should go ahead. If the price is not reasonable we should not do so, but from what I hear, we can get a good deal.</P>
      <P>In reply to Deputy Higgins, I am lucky enough to have been using Government jets for a long time. There is no doubt, I readily admit, that there are far more years behind than ahead of me.</P>

There is a range of activities to be undertaken by a large exporting country.

      <P>The Taoiseach has managed to give the impression that we were talking about the Beechcraft. When one reads the text of what he said, he has slithered over the Beechcraft not being available when he wanted it. I put it to the Taoiseach, and I would like an answer this time rather than going around the house to avoid the issue, that the answer to Deputy Sherlock was that the Department of Defence shows that the Government's Gulfstream IV was available for 134 out of 135, or 99.26%, of its requested missions last year. Is that the case or is it not? The Taoiseach has again created the impression that he was on the tarmac while blokes were under the Gulstream 4 with spanners trying to fix it before he got on board. Why create the impression that there is something defective about the jet? Is this answer from the Minister <Col N="1080" /> for Defence, Deputy Smith, correct? Was the jet available for 99.6% of the missions requested? Let us not confuse this with the Beechcraft the helicopter or anything else. What is the story on the Gulfstream IV? Has the Taoiseach examined the possibility and is he minded to go down the road of leasing, which would release a lot of money for urgent purposes at the moment?</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no doubt that the answers given to Deputy Sherlock by the Minister for Defence are correct. I have no difficulty whatever with leasing arrangements or whatever proves most effective. Deputy Rabbitte can disagree if he wishes, but our system is inefficient, given the way it operates and that groups are always split and people have to travel the previous night when the whole group could travel in the morning. We should be able to carry journalists as every other country does and they would pay for that. That would be far more efficient and effective. If that can be done by leasing or under any other arrangement &ndash; there are many possible financing arrangements and we should be able to get a good deal &ndash; it should be done. If we cannot get a good deal we cannot do so.</P>
      <P>We need a replacement. From what I have heard about the Gulfstream, it is not efficient. There are problems of refuelling and maintenance. Perhaps Deputy Sargent is right, but there are many practical difficulties of which I am aware because I sign all the requests and I know what happens in effect. Leaving out the Beechcraft, the helicopter service and so on, the current system is not the most efficient. I am told by the powers that be that this is a good time to get a replacement because prices and oversupply in the aviation market, both in second-hand and new aircraft, should allow us to get a good deal. If that is possible under the procurement process we will go ahead with it, and I am advised that we should be able to get a good arrangement.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 6 to 57, inclusive, together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1085" />I reported to the House last week on recent developments in the peace process. Both Governments remain fully committed to the Good Friday Agreement and it is our template for future progress in Northern Ireland. In recent weeks and months real progress has been made. This progress is reflected in the Joint Declaration of the two Governments and associated documents published recently. The declaration contains many elements that we can and will take forward as part of the ongoing implementation of the Good Friday Agreement, for example in the areas of policing, criminal justice, equality, human rights and some aspects of normalisation, and that work is taking place.</P>
    <P>It is regrettable that it has not proved possible to establish a basis for the early restoration of the devolved institutions in Northern Ireland. I have made it clear that I disagreed with the decision to postpone the elections. I believe that this decision causes more problems for the process than it solves.</P>
    <P>Continuing strong partnership between the two Governments is essential to achieving progress and both Governments will continue to work together to try to create the trust and confidence necessary to sustain inclusive government in Northern Ireland. This was underscored at the meeting I had in Farmleigh last week with Prime Minister Blair.</P>
    <P>All of us have a collective responsibility to make this process work and we will continue to work and meet with the parties to try to advance matters. In this regard, I met the Leader of the SDLP, Mark Durkan, and his colleagues last week and I expect to meet the other pro-Agreement parties in the period ahead. For their part, the Minister for Foreign Affairs and the Northern Ireland Secretary of State will meet next week at a meeting of the Anglo-Irish Intergovernmental Conference and together also expect to meet the parties over the coming weeks.</P>
    <P>The Joint Declaration represents real progress across a range of issues which had proven difficult, if not intractable, up to now. This progress has to some extent been obscured by the inevitable focus on the remaining areas of difficulty. These remaining issues have now crystallised to this: on the one hand, the necessity to remove concerns around the commitment to exclusively democratic and non-violent means and, on the other, the need for each community to have confidence in the commitment of the representatives of the other to the full implementation of the Agreement. This means that we must have a response from the IRA which makes clear that there will be a definitive end to all paramilitary activity such as those referred to in paragraph 13 of the Joint Declaration. It means that we must have an unequivocal commitment by Unionists to the full and inclusive operation of all the institutions of the agreement.</P>
    <P>I welcome the progress that has been made by the republican movement and the most recent <Col N="1086" /> statement by the IRA. However, it is essential that we have the clarity necessary to move on.</P>
    <P>The agreement is the only sustainable basis for a fair and honourable accommodation between Unionists and Nationalists. The absence of trust and confidence is central to the current difficulties. The parties themselves must make a contribution to building trust by giving each other the reassurances that are needed to allow people to move forward together.</P>
    <P>I hope that the parties will use the time ahead to advance their dialogue with a view to rebuilding trust and confidence in advance of the elections in the autumn. It would also be helpful if the parties and community leaders used their influence to ensure that the people of Northern Ireland enjoy a summer free from trouble and tension. That would also be a major contribution to achieving a restored climate of trust and confidence that we can build on in the autumn.</P>
    <P>I also deeply appreciate the assistance of President Bush and his administration, particularly Ambassador Richard Haass, who has worked closely with us in recent months and whom I will meet again next week. I have no immediate plans to meet President Bush. However, I hope to visit the United States in the autumn. The programme for my visit has yet to be finalised.</P>
    <P>With regard to a meeting of the Forum for Peace and Reconciliation, this will be a matter for the chairman and the parties participating in the forum.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny" hpid="Mr. Kenny Mr. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>The allegations of recent days about the involvement of British intelligence in collusion with the RUC Special Branch have brought this to a new level. I am glad the newly-appointed British ambassador is in the House today. I met him this morning and wished him well.</P>
      <P>I express the widespread concern and anxiety that a great number of people here feel about the allegations made in recent days which build on reports in respect of the Dublin-Monaghan bombings, the 29th anniversary of which is on Saturday, and the shocking indictment represented by some of the details emerging from the Stevens report.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>After 14 years of investigation, Stevens recorded and found the secret co-operation within the RUC Special Branch and British military intelligence ranged from wilful failure to keep records to the absence of accountability, the withholding of evidence and information, the extreme element of using agents involved in murder and pointed out clearly collusion in the murders of Pat Finucane and Brian Adam Lambert, and further pointed out that it gave a basis for the public view that a dirty war was conducted by security forces in Northern Ireland against members of the Catholic community. Given that level of indictment from Stevens and the fact that the details of the report have not been published and given the level of outrage and the understanding of the hurt caused to the families of <Col N="1087" /> those involved in the Dublin-Monaghan bombings, compounded by the fact that Mr. Justice Barron has said he has not received proper co-operation from the British authorities, does the Taoiseach consider he should take this level, as leader of the Government, to the British Prime Minister, and have this sorted out in so far as it is possible to sort it out? Arising from the Stevens report, has the Government considered the question of a formal request for a public inquiry into the murder of Pat Finucane? Since yesterday, has the Taoiseach had any briefing and update on the allegations concerning the person referred to as &ldquo;Stakeknife&rdquo;?</P>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I join Deputy Kenny in wishing the new British ambassador well in his role and in his onerous task. I assure Deputy Kenny that over the years I have had direct responsibility for dealing with Northern Ireland matters. There is always an enormous range of issues on the agenda, issues about the past and what happened in the past. It is not always easy to re-write all of these issues as there is no truth and reconciliation commission. When I floated the idea of such a commission, some years ago, with the parties in the North there was no appetite for it. I used to think, five or six years ago, that this could have been the resolution. We all remember what we were told at the forum when Mr. Cyril Ramaphosa and others explained to us how the truth and reconciliation commission operated. I thought then that it would be a feature. However, there was no appetite for that but, perhaps, it will come back into focus again. Because of that and as the troubles end, and particularly since the ceasefire in 1994 which is now in operation close on nine years this September, a number of issues have come back. The big one is what is now the Saville inquiry, because of the horrendous issues of Derry which continued to feed into so many other cases, and the Stevens inquiry and what is being examined in that inquiry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Looking back over a large number of cases from the early 1970s and right up to the Rosemary Nelson and other cases in recent years &ndash; Rosemary Nelson being the last high profile one but not the last political murder &ndash; there has been a great deal of concern around these. The Stevens work is ongoing. We have seen what has happened there. At Weston Park two years ago we agreed with the British Government that there were a number of these high level cases and what we should try to do was to get completion, which is exactly what Deputy Kenny has said. We could not take all of the cases. We could not take thousands of cases as that would never work. I understand the upset that causes to families. I have met many groups, organisations and families and I have genuine sympathy for them all, because they are uncertain about what happened. It is not just a question of post mortems, they just do not know what happened. People disappeared and all the <Col N="1088" /> other things that happened. We try to deal with that issue and we try to get the information.</P>
    <P>However, we agreed to take a number of cases other than those being dealt with in the Saville inquiry and said we would get an international eminent judge with deal with them. Judge Cory, who in world terms is one of the most respected judges of the World Bar, will finish his report in the autumn and he has looked at a number of the high profile issues. In advance of that we have, at all times, supported the efforts and have called for a public inquiry. Normally, I do it each year on behalf of everybody in this House and the Irish people, on the anniversary to do with the Pat Finucane's case. This year I met the family and the British-Irish Watch group and the other groups who have dealt with this case for a long time. The Pat Finucane case is not just an Irish issue, it is supported by members of the Bar, journalistic groups and civil rights groups around the world, many of which have developed advertising campaigns. There should be a full inquiry. It will be for Judge Cory to come forward. We hope that justifies the call for a public inquiry. I am not sure if it will at this stage but, from all I know about that case and I know a fair amount, as do most people from all that has come out and all the examinations that have been done by British-Irish Watch, Stevens and others, there will be a public inquiry. That would not solve all the cases and we should not get into that. If we get into that we will go on forever. I do not say that in any disrespectful way, but I do not think it can be done. That feeds into the work done by the late Mr. Justice Hamilton who did so much work in this area, followed on by the work of Mr. Justice Barron. They also looked at a number of cases not just to do with the Dublin-Monaghan bombings but to do with Seamus Ludlow and other cases and he will report on them.</P>
    <P>The Deputy's last question was on the security issue. I can understand Deputy Kenny asking me this question but I do not want to go into it blow by blow. I have raised with members of the British Government, including the Prime Minister, many times, MI5 and MI6. I say, with the greatest of respect, I am usually less wise after I have asked the questions than before. That is why I do not want to go down that track.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputies know how hard I and others have tried to get the information from MI5 and others in relation to the tribunals under this House. That is difficult. The sequence then is the Saville inquiry and the the Irish Governments &ndash; I am conscious it was not just the Government I <Col N="1089" /> led, but a Government led by the parties of which Deputies Kenny and Rabbitte are members. They did an enormous amount of work in Opposition and we co-operated with them and followed it through. We got the Saville inquiry, which is important. I met the families involved in the Saville inquiry in London a few weeks ago. We know where the Stevens inquiry is at. The Cory inquiry is ongoing as is the work of Mr. Justice Barron.</P>
      <P>I have no new information that is worth sharing with the House on the so-called person of &ldquo;Stakeknife&rdquo;. If I had I would give it but I do not have any information.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>I join Deputy Kenny and the Taoiseach in wishing the new British Ambassador well. On the Weston Park agreement in 2001 and the appointment of the Canadian judge in that regard, as I understand it that was to look into a stated number of specific cases &ndash; Lord Justice and Lady Gibson, Rosemary Nelson, Pat Finucane and two or three other cases. Does the Taoiseach consider that there would be any merit in asking Judge Cory to have included in his terms of reference the &ldquo;Stakeknife&rdquo; affair? Would that be an appropriate way to have this matter examined?</P>
      <P>I join with Deputy Kenny in his references to the Dublin and Monaghan bombings and the implications of the weekend's revelations for those concerned in terms of their worst fears and their ongoing quest for truth and closure. Has the Taoiseach received any communication from Sinn Féin since the weekend's revelations? If so, what is his assessment, if any, of the implications of the weekend's revelations for the present state of the peace process and the need to maintain momentum?</P>
      <P>The Taoiseach is probably being entirely frank with the House when he says he cannot answer certain questions and that his protestations to the British authorities down the years in respect of some of these murkier matters have left matters less than clear to him. I hope that gives him some sympathy for the way he leaves us on this side of the House, but that is a different matter. Can the Taoiseach indicate that in respect of our intelligence services, nobody is acting in any capacity or with any kind of authority, either within subversive organisations or the criminal underworld, to commit crime of a similar nature to what has been reported over the weekend, whatever the truth of it may be?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand the Stevens inquiry team will investigate the Stakeknife issue. There is some information that the inquiry team was already examining aspects of this matter over the past months. In view of this, I do not think Judge Cory will become involved. The Deputy referred to the cases in which Judge Cory is involved, including the Kevin Callan case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have not received any communication from Sinn Féin regarding these issues. We are prepar<Col N="1090" /> ing for next week's meeting of the British-Irish Intergovernmental Council, but not particularly on the issues raised last week.</P>
    <P>I have no information on the Deputy's question about members of our intelligence services, although there is always a concern that a member of a force may be engaged in such activities. I have sympathy with the Deputy's concerns about the possibility that within a large force, somebody can communicate information or become involved in activities. We have been lucky in that there have only been one or two cases at that level. Given what has happened, it has occurred to me that it would probably be a good thing if there was a rotation of positions. That would ensure people are not confined to the same security positions, when these kinds of activity can arise, either on the official or unofficial side. I will refer the question to the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform although I hope, and have no reason to believe, that there would be anything sinister going on. However, in the modern world it is perhaps more a matter of hope.</P>
    <P>I do not wish to elaborate on the other matter raised by Deputy Rabbitte. According to my knowledge on the workings of intelligence, procedures in this country are not exactly similar to the British system, where there appears to be a Chinese wall arrangement. I do not believe that started only recently. I recall reading a long time ago a book by Harold Wilson in which he explained at great length how it operates. I have been brought up remembering that. I would say his experience was the right one.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny" hpid="Mr. Kenny Mr. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>

      <P>I cannot accept what the Taoiseach has said with the calmness and equanimity he has displayed. Why has he not contacted Prime Minister Blair in the past 48 hours? Leaving aside whether Stakeknife is the person named in recent days, it is credible to believe that such an agent existed. He may have been responsible for up to 40 killings on this island, including in this State, acting as judge, jury and executioner with the support of high levels in the British Administration. Does the Taoiseach regard this as a profoundly serious matter? </P>
      <P>I was going to ask the Taoiseach if he considers that the British Government routinely treats him and his Government with veiled contempt but he answered that question. The Prime Minister treats him with contempt when, as he has indicated, he is less wise after asking him about these matters than before. What will the Taoiseach do to get through this Chinese wall because it is not good enough that it is accepted that this is the way the spooks work and there is no fall-back?</P>

In his discussions with him will he ask where are the weapons of mass destruction that his Government told the Taoiseach existed in Iraq and which were the justification for the slaughter of thousands of people? Will the Taoiseach explain to Mr. Haass that day after day he attended the Irish Parliament and repeated faithfully &ndash; even parroted &ndash; the line of his boss, President Bush, that this was the justification for this criminal invasion? Will he tell Mr. Haass that he is duty bound to report back to the Irish Parliament on the truth or otherwise of this claim? It is patently obvious it was a fabrication on which a criminal invasion was undertaken. Does the Taoiseach accept he has a responsibility to put these questions to the representative of the American Administration next week and to report back to the Dáil on the reply he receives?</P>

      <P>Is the Taoiseach aware of the anger that exists across the communities in the North of Ireland at the cancellation by the British Government of the Assembly elections scheduled for 29 May? Does he share their concern and the concern of many throughout the rest of this island, at the vacuum that is being created in the absence of a democratic exercise as a result of this cancellation? Does he agree that this was done outrageously by the British Prime Minister because he feared the outcome of these elections? Does the Taoiseach also fear the outcome of these elections and can he say with certainty that he acted appropriately in insisting that they would be held, irrespective of his view of the potential outcome? There is concern and perhaps the Taoiseach would clarify the real nature of the relationship between both Governments in these matters as it would appear that there is not equity and a sharing of responsibilities between both Prime Ministers and their respective counterparts, the Secretary of State and the Minister for Foreign Affairs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Last week the Taoiseach welcomed the publication of the IRA statement. I seek clarification of the Taoiseach's comment that if the statement had come earlier, along with Gerry Adam's clarification, it might have ended the impasse. In light of the clarity which exists and which the Taoiseach has been recorded as welcoming, does the <Col N="1092" /> Taoiseach now believe he is in a position to press the British Prime Minister for a rescheduling of the elections of 29 May for the coming June? Will he do that rather than allowing for an open-ended position which may have no end at all? People fear, looking at the legislation presented at Westminster that the end of the year may come and go with a further extension of six months and we may see no elections at all.</P>
    <P>Given the further focus on the role of British military intelligence in the conflict which had waged mainly in the northern part of our island over the period 1969 to 1998, and undoubtedly since, what steps has the Taoiseach taken to press the British Government for the full and early publication of the report of the Stevens inquiry? What steps is the Taoiseach taking and continuing to take to press for a full, independent, international inquiry into the murder of Pat Finucane which was orchestrated by the force research unit under the stewardship of Brigadier Kerr, a serving member of the British Army?</P>

Is the Taoiseach shocked that a victim of the bombing which took place on 17 May 1974 in Dublin, who had further shrapnel removed from his person on Tuesday of last week, was refused assistance to proceed with the medical procedure involved on application to the relevant Department? He was obliged to seek support from the victims fund in the North of Ireland under the aegis of the British Government.</P>

      <P>In the brief time available, I extend my good wishes to the newly appointed British ambassador. He comes to the post at a serious juncture in the relations between our two countries if one goes by the recent newspaper reports. Do the reports have any truth in them? At the moment there is doubt and verification of the reports in equal measure. If it is found that a British agent was responsible for the killing of Tom Oliver in County Louth, will the Government seek that person's extradition to face charges of murder here? Is the Taoiseach putting serious, unresolved questions to the British Government which are already in the public <Col N="1093" /> domain and are raised time and again in the media as to whether the Government will insist on a date for the elections and state that the indefinite postponement is unacceptable? Even if it must be set <i>in camera,</i> the Government should insist that some date be set this year. Can the Taoiseach say if that will happen?</P>

      <P>Deputy Ó Caoláin asked a number of questions. The various statements by Mr. Gerry Adams were helpful and they brought matters to a new level of clarity in two vital aspects of the process. The first was the ending of the conflict and the second related to the decommissioning of paramilitary weapons. This has been acknowledged by both governments, but, as I said last week, it did not prove possible to provide sufficient clarity to convince everyone that paramilitary activity &ndash; the third issue &ndash; was definitively at an end. This third issue remains to be resolved and I say to Deputy Ó Caoláin that while we made progress on many issues, I hope we can resolve the third one. If he asks me if it is resolved now that clarification has been provided, the answer is &ldquo;no&rdquo;. It must be resolved in a way that everybody can understand. I said that the significance of Mr. Gerry Adam's clarifications was obvious and clear to many, but it was not clear to everyone or to everyone who will be party to the agreement. I said also that the statement of 13 April was supposed to have said it all and that I believed that an IRA endorsement would have been helpful, though I cannot say it would have been decisive had it come earlier. At the same time, I acknowledge and do not seek to minimise the significance and potential of that as we must go forward.</P>
      <P>I say to Deputy Ó Caoláin that nobody worked harder to convince the British Government to avoid postponing the elections than I. I did not stand on my box shouting about it, rather I tried to influence the decision before it was made and I did that to the best of my ability. I do not see that postponement leads anywhere easily, nor does it resolve matters. It creates many difficulties and a vacuum. To answer the Deputy's question, we did everything we could to convince the British Government not to make a decision we opposed totally. We acknowledge, as does Deputy Ó Caoláin's party, that we have to continue to work to deal with matters.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We will continue to press matters in regard to the Stevens inquiry to achieve early conclusions. I agree with the Deputy's statement on the matter. However, it is more important that those conclusions be full rather than provided quickly. Our position with regard to the Finucane case has long been on record. We wish to see a full, sworn tribunal into the matter and we continue to press for it. Deputy Sargent asked about the Tom Oliver case, but I do not have any information on the matter. There have been many stories about <Col N="1095" /> this and other cases over the years. However, I do not know whether they are factual. The British Government has made its position very clear &ndash; that its war is over, but that it wants to see a peaceful resolution to all of this.</P>
    <P>I have already addressed most of the issues to which Deputy Finian McGrath referred.</P>

      <P>No, we have had endless statements.</P>
      <P>It would be easy to make a statement, and there is no one better placed than I to do so, if it were just a question of adopting a one-sided point of view. I make this point with the greatest respect to Deputy Finian McGrath and all those who raised this question. I could take the position in this process of being solely an Irish Government person and the leader of the largest republican party on this island; I could adopt a purely Irish position and not care about an all-island position. The difficulty is that the Good Friday Agreement is an inclusive one, which seeks to put every party which has a certain representation into government together under the d'Hondt arrangement. Therefore, taking the above view would not help one iota in getting republicans, Nationalists, loyalists and Unionists together. If I were to take that view, I would be working against an agreement which I, along with many others, worked hard to sign. Therefore, it would be an illogical position to take. That view is shared by all the parties in the House, including Sinn Féin.</P>
      <P>I have asked Sinn Féin, the loyalists and the Unionists many times whether they want us to work together for an inclusive agreement, which brings everyone into an executive, based on the unique characteristics of Northern Ireland which have existed for hundreds of years. For me to get up and only give a Nationalist perspective,&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;my personal views, my instincts or the views my father held would not serve to make this process work. That is why I <Col N="1096" /> have to ask the Unionists to convince me that they will work the agreement in total, accept North-South participation and participate in the British-Irish Parliamentary Body. Deputies Rabbitte, Kenny and others supported a change to the rules of the House to allow all the islands in this region, including the Isle of Man, Jersey, Scotland, Wales and everyone else to participate in the body &ndash; I know the British ambassador who is here today will find that unusual. However, we could not get the Ulster Unionist Party to participate and they need to explain that to us.</P>
      <P>On the other hand, I have to say to my colleagues in Sinn Féin and, by extension, the people with whom they work hard to have some influence with, that I must be able to get the information from them to convince others that paramilitary activity has stopped. I cannot convince the Ulster Unionist Party to share government as long as it thinks paramilitary actions, such as spying in the office, are ongoing. That is the difficulty.</P>

It is unwise of the Government to place a guillotine on the Bill and it is unnecessary since it is likely that, with the degree of co-operation evident on Committee Stage, the proceedings on Report Stage could be concluded in normal time, without a guillotine.

      <P>No. 2, the Garda Síochána (Police Co-operation) Bill 2003, is in part to do with the implementation of the North-South policing arrangements. I met Chief Constable Orde recently and one of the issues raised was the requirements for remuneration and allowances for members of the Garda who might join the PSNI under the terms of this Bill. Will that require secondary legislation? If so, I urge that it all be done together so that there can be no cause for delay. In other words, once co-operation is in place and the arrangements have been made for people from the South to join the Northern force or <i>vice versa,</i> there should be no further delay due to secondary legislation requirements dealing with financial arrangements or allocations.</P>

      <P>I accept Deputy Kenny's point. I am not sure whether secondary legislation or regulations are required &ndash; it may be just procedure. However, I agree that there should be no delay. When we pass the legislation we should proceed quickly to the implementation stage. That is necessary for many reasons, including the ongoing work on the policing boards and the necessary arrangements and reforms that are being put in place. I know the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform is conscious of that and wants to move on with the regulations as soon as the legislation is passed. Deputy Kenny is saying that during the passage of the legislation, the other matters should also be dealt with. I am not sure whether secondary legislation is required but I know the Minister is anxious to advance so that once the Bill is passed there will be no great delay before implementation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment and Local Government (Mr. Cullen)</NameTxt>
      <P>At the time of the adjournment of the debate, I was about to respond to the points made by Members on the first three amendments, all of which are related. I had said to Deputy Gilmore in committee and had indicated in the House the issue in which I was interested in terms of his original amendment which he tabled on Committee Stage and resubmitted on Report Stage. I gave a great deal of consideration to this and wish to respond specifically to the Deputy. Other Members raised the issue subsequent to his initial proposal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A range of people are disqualified from election to or membership of a local authority. The <Col N="1110" /> nub of the issue is that, under the Bill, the same arrangements will apply to Oireachtas Members. They already apply to those Members who are Ministers, Ministers of State, the Ceann Comhairle, Cathaoirleach of the Seanad and MEPs. The same principle applies to Oireachtas Members who are councillors in that they are disqualified from election as cathaoirleach or leas-chathaoirleach of local authorities or from holding those posts.</P>
    <P>If and when the dual mandate ends, there is a danger that Oireachtas Members could stand for local elections to maximise votes for their parties. This would mean they were not being completely straight with the public in terms of whether they intended to stand. It is highly unlikely that Members of the Oireachtas would stand and, if elected, leave the Oireachtas to go to local government. If they want to do so, the decision should be taken in advance of seeking election to a local authority.</P>
    <P>The law as it applies to others will apply in an identical fashion to Oireachtas Members. That is important. A clear separation and commitment to local government is required. To legislate to allow Oireachtas Members to stand for local election with the sole purpose of ensuring they resign their parliamentary seat if they were elected would be wrong in principle. There would be little, if any, take-up of such an option. Such legislation would also be open to other difficulties, as I have flagged. Would it differentiate between different Oireachtas Members? Could the Ceann Comhairle, Ministers or Ministers of State stand for local election? To allow Deputies and Senators stand for election would muddy the waters in the context of the separation of the Oireachtas and local government and would be contrary to the principles underlying the ending of the dual mandate and to the law as it applied up to now.</P>
    <P>I have stated on numerous occasions in the different debates in this House and the Seanad that it is important we give clarity and certainty to this issue. The amendments seek to address the possibility of a Deputy or Senator standing for local election but not taking up the council seat. Real difficulty involving fundamental revision of current electoral count arrangements could arise to cater for such an eventuality.</P>
    <P>I accept the point Deputy Gilmore made and do not suggest it is an insurmountable issue. If we were to go in such a direction, obviously we would have to find the mechanisms to do so. Nevertheless, it is part of the mix in my consideration of these issues. The basic rationale for a clear separation of Oireachtas and local government is such that the case for treating Oireachtas Members separately in this way does not arise.</P>
    <P>On the principal issue, I take a strong view that local government and national Government are separate entities. They are complementary in many of their actions but are two distinct entities with complementary and overlapping roles.</P>
    <P>One argument made consistently and at some length previously was that for a person to be <Col N="1111" /> involved in local politics and local issues and represent the people who elected him or her, he or she must be a member of a local authority. I do not accept that, nor do I accept that membership of this Parliament means he or she is divorced from local issues. That is not the case. He or she is elected through a constituency-based system. Obviously the electorate has expectations that he or she will deal with many issues that are important to them. To base the ability to deal with these issues on being involved in local government is wrong. The thesis put forward that one must be involved in a local authority to be involved in local issues is not true and does not stand up.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment and Local Government (Mr. Cullen)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 119 and 120 together.</P>
      <P>The affordable housing initiative forms part of the housing and accommodation special initiative under the new national partnership agreement Sustaining Progress. Now that the agreement has been ratified, the steering group, representative of Government and relevant social partners, will shortly address arrangements for advancing the various special initiatives under Sustaining Progress, including the housing and accommodation initiative and arrangements for deciding how action will be taken forward on these initiatives.</P>
      <P>While the details of the new initiative have yet to be elaborated, it is aimed at further enhancing the supply of affordable housing. It is envisaged that this initiative will differ from the 1999 affordable housing scheme in terms of the target group and the fact that it will be designed not to have an impact on the Exchequer or general Government finances. Furthermore, it is intended that the initiative will not detract from the funding available for existing social and affordable housing programmes or effect the momentum of delivery of these programmes. Capital spending in 2003 on these programmes will be about &euro;1.7 billion, which will allow for the needs of over 12,000 households to be met this year.</P>
      <P>I welcome this initiative as another means of bringing more affordable housing on stream. In responding to the proposal, the Government is committed to an ambitious scale of delivery of affordable housing for the target groups concerned. We will work to ensure that the output from all affordable housing schemes is maximised. It will be important more generally to ensure the continuation of measures to maintain the overall supply of new houses.</P>
      <P>Work is well under way on implementing the homeless strategy and the local homeless action plans. Homeless fora have been established at local level to oversee the provision of services to homeless people and to draw up three-year action plans to tackle homelessness. Most of the plans have been completed and work is under way on implementing them. As part of the plans, a range of new accommodation and related services have been developed and funded.</P>
      <P>At national level, the cross-departmental team on homelessness is monitoring progress regarding the implementation of the strategy and the action plans. I have also asked the team to examine how best to evaluate the homeless strategy and action plan. I hope that this evaluation can commence before the end of this year.</P>

      <P>In view of the fact that the average price of a house in Dublin is now &euro;260,000 and the average house price outside Dublin is &euro;207,000, and considering that there are 5,500 homeless people, will the Minister outline his existing targets because the new agreement, Sustaining Progress, talks about 10,000 affordable houses in addition to existing targets? Will the Minister apologise to the voluntary organisations who are working so diligently with the homeless for the statement made by his Minister of State, Deputy Noel Ahern, that the increase to 5,500 of homeless on the streets is minimal? It may be minimal in his opinion but at a time when we were promised a drastic reduction in the number of homeless, that is an insulting remark.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
      <P>I will put the figures in context for the Deputy. In the Dublin area there were 2,900 homeless adults in March 1999 and in March 2002 there were 2,920. The number has remained static. That is in spite of enormous resources being put into the area. Neither I nor my Minister of State is denying for one moment that there is a problem. The Deputy has asked us what we have done. In 1999 only &euro;12.5 million was spent in this area although that was a reasonable sum at the time. This year, in spite of the restrictions on the&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BernardAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>I asked the Minister a question about his existing targets and not about what has been done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
      <P>I am coming to that. The Deputy asked me in a broad sense about what we are doing. The figure last year was &euro;43 million which is a significant increase and this year I have raised that figure to &euro;50 million. There are substantial resources being channelled into this area through all local authorities.</P>
      <P>Of course the Government wants to see people off the streets and homeless people accommodated. We are putting enormous resources into the various local authorities, into accommodation that can be used to take people off the streets and to move them on in the various services. In particular, homeless men have a range of problems and we need to deal with them in a cross-departmental approach because there are issues of alcoholism, drug abuse and mental illness, for example. I am aware of homeless men who, when offered accommodation, are unable for various reasons to see themselves fit into that type of restrictive situation because it does not sit well with their lifestyle.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This does not negate the Government's determination to deal with those who are homeless. <Col N="1114" /> We know what the figures are. There is a substantial review under way on this issue. That review is not simply to go back over what we have done but to elaborate on the directions taken by the previous Government and to examine whether we are meeting the need through the diversity and range of facilities being created. I am aware of the number of places and beds for homeless people that are available on any given night, specifically in this city, which are not being availed of. That is not the fault of the services in many respects, it is the system and the way that we have to deal with it. There are many issues in homelessness and one cannot think that it is simply a matter of transposing a cohort of people within the confines of bricks and mortar without taking into account all the other complicated issues. A large proportion of homeless people find it hard to go into settled living.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>The two questions relate specifically to the initiative which is contained in the partnership agreement, Sustaining Progress, which was intended to provide an additional 10,000 affordable houses. When the Minister in his reply states that the steering group will shortly address the initiative, when he states that the details have yet to be elaborated and when he tells us what is envisaged by this scheme, is he not telling the House in plain language that nothing has been done to advance this initiative since it was agreed in the partnership agreement?</P>
      <P>My second question is specific. The agreement states that this initiative on affordable housing has the objective of increasing the supply of affordable houses by 10,000 units. Will the Minister clarify what that means? Does that mean an additional 10,000 units per annum or does it mean 10,000 units in the lifetime of the partnership agreement, Sustaining Progress?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
      <P>The direct answer to the Deputy's first question is that an enormous amount of work is ongoing on the initiative in which I have been directly involved. I am in discussions with many different groups. State lands is one of the key issues. I am trying to get the assessment done as quickly as possible. The Minister of State in the Department of Finance is working on the issue of State lands.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>He is trying to sell State lands.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a great deal of State property which is not suitable for housing. I am talking specifically about land banks, which offer us a serious way forward. How this will fit in with the local planning guidelines must also be considered, including other facilities sun regard to the provision of 10,000 houses on an annual basis, this was part of the overall programme to try to add within the lifetime of the programme an extra 10,000 houses. It would be great if we could get more. If the Deputy is asking will there be an extra 10,000 houses by the end of this year <Col N="1115" /> through this methodology, the answer is &ldquo;No&rdquo;. However, we must try to put into the marketplace as many new and affordable houses as possible. There is a strata of people who have the means but perhaps they fall short because of the cost of housing. We must develop a cost base in terms of housing and location so that people can afford to get into the housing market.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BernardAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>The figures indicate 58,000 completions this year, 10% of which were bought by people on moderate salaries and 30% by investors. What steps is the Minister taking to allow people on moderate salaries to attain a home of their own? Is the 10,000 affordable houses a very flimsy fig leaf to sell the overall package of Sustaining Progress? In reality will the Minister's words be translated into action?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
      <P>They will. There was much debate on this issue during the discussions on Sustaining Progress. The social partners and the Government are very committed to this measure. However, I must go back to one aspect which seems to be missed. Like everyone else, when I look at the cost of housing today compared to what it was when I was first trying to buy a house, there is a substantial difference. The ESRI figures indicate clearly that in terms of net income, interest rates and inflation, the net cost of housing based on today's salaries show very little difference from what it was ten or 15 years ago.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BernardAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not true. They went up &euro;13,000 this year in Dublin.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
      <P>I am giving the Deputy the facts. It is an interesting study.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BernardAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>The prices increased by &euro;13,000 this year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
      <P>Then the Deputy must not accept what the ESRI is saying on anything. If we consider interest rates of 13%, 14%, 15% and 16%, inflation, people's salaries and the very high personal tax regime at the time and equate them to today's comparable figures, one will find that the net impact on salaries has not changed. However, it has changed in regard to the rented sector. We have now taken substantial measures to increase the stock of rented property which is crucially important for the increasing numbers of students. The cost of renting property has decreased substantially in recent times.</P>

      <askee>Minister for the Environment and Local Government</askee>
      <Quest>his views on the fact that the Government's recycling policy has to date been largely confined to the provision of bring-banks comprising four receptacles; his further views on whether this type of facility alone is inadequate; the type of facilities which exist for the physical recycling of waste, in particular glass and plastics; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>
      <QRef>[13132/03]</QRef>
    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
      <P>Government policy on waste management is committed to a major reduction in our reliance on landfill and a sustained expansion in national recycling performance across all waste streams, including both plastics and glass. Under my Department's waste infrastructure capital grants scheme, assistance is available towards the capital cost of a range of waste recovery facilities, including &ldquo;bring&rdquo; banks; civic amenity sites; transfer stations facilitating recovery activities; materials recovery facilities for &ldquo;dry&rdquo; recyclables; and biological treatment of &ldquo;green&rdquo; and organic household waste.</P>
      <P>I recently announced allocations of &euro;55 million under the environment fund. The majority of that funding has been allocated for local authority recycling and waste management infrastructure. This level of financial assistance is unprecedented and will support the provision of approximately 580 new &ldquo;bring&rdquo; bank sites throughout the country, in addition to about 1,400 sites currently, 25 new and five expanded civic amenity sites, nine composting facilities, one new and one expanded materials recovery facility, as well as the upgrading of many existing &ldquo;bring&rdquo; banks. In addition segregated domestic collection services are now being provided to around one-third of all households nationally.</P>
      <P>In relation to glass recycling, Rehab Recycling Partnership operates a glass cullet production plant in Ballymount, County Dublin, where the majority of bottles and jars collected in Ireland are pre-processed into crushed cullet. There are also a few smaller glass crushing plants in operation around the country. Most cullet processed in Ireland is now transported to a facility in Northern Ireland for use in the manufacture of new glass containers, with small volumes being transported to glass reprocessors in Britain. The recycling of post-consumer plastic beverage containers and other types of plastic packaging is generally more problematic than the recycling of other packaging materials, due to its light weight, sorting and pre-treatment requirements. Accordingly, the recycling rate of plastic packaging is generally lower than that of other materials.</P>
      <P>However, receptacles for the deposit of plastic containers are in place in a number of areas and further facilities are being provided with the grant assistance available from my Department. I am also aware of one indigenous company which has limited facilities for the sorting, washing and pre-treatment of used plastic beverage containers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ArthurMorganSF" hpid="Mr. Morgan Mr. Morgan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morgan</NameTxt>

      <P>The Deputy's constituency received funding.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ArthurMorganSF" hpid="Mr. Morgan Mr. Morgan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morgan</NameTxt>
      <P>My constituency got some funding but, unfortunately, there is a levy on recycling. One cannot get into the civic amenity centre without paying. People in significant numbers are now separating and recycling waste. The numbers going through the plant have trebled in the three years it has been in operation and the result is that people are now penalised to get in through the door. That is a retrograde step which is not very fair.</P>
      <P>In regard to the essence of the question on recycling, there are three stages in this &ndash; collection, processing and re-processing. What percentage of homes receive a separated waste collection service? I believe it is only a small percentage. Does the Minister have any plans to develop a glass recycling facility? Unfortunately, the Irish Glass Bottle Company was closed down. Significant volumes of glass come through the system and are available for reprocessing.</P>
      <P>There are seven waste management plans in the State. The one for the north-east was costed at over &euro;300 million but, unfortunately, 50% of that cost is for the development of an incinerator with which nobody, except the Minister's party, seems to agree. People are up in arms throughout the State in opposition to incineration. When will funding be put in place to facilitate separated waste collections which were supposed to be available in all urban areas of 500 or more houses? Are weighted collections part of the carrot and stick approach to encourage households to weigh waste? When will that be put in place or has the Minister any plans in that regard?</P>
      <P>My final question is on bring banks. In most places these are seen in groups of three or four units; the maximum is half a dozen. They are no substitute for the separated waste collection service. When will they be developed to realistic numbers where there will be at least a dozen different receptacles for the various products that can be recycled, given that there is now firm evidence that Irish people will recycle?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy asked a number of questions. It is a misunderstanding to think that I promote recycling on the basis that there is no cost involved. There are some costs in recycling and we must accept that. My point, however, is that recycling is a far more cost effective way of dealing with waste, from an environmental point of view, quite apart from the cost point of view, than the traditional methods we used in the past. The facility in Dundalk which I visited recently is a benchmark for the type of facilities I would like to see in all local authority areas. The people who are involved in that, in conjunction with the local authority there, are to be complimented. The usage of that facility is going through the roof. What is happening there is a great example to us all.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>About one third of all households segregate <Col N="1119" /> their waste. I believe we are approaching a critical mass figure which will produce an accelerator approach with regard to the amount of houses involved. This is local authority led. The Deputy asks what I am doing about it. I have done a great deal in terms of providing enormous resources for it. Some local authorities are well advanced and they are not being treated any differently from other local authorities by me. Much of it comes down to the will of the local authorities, the council members and the plans their officials are able to advance at a speedy rate. This system is based on local authority initiatives which will be supported in financial and educational terms and through the awareness and market development campaigns at the upper end of the scale which I am developing.</P>
    <P>The closure of the Irish Glass Bottle Company was unfortunate and disappointing, particularly for those who lost their jobs. If there is to be a new facility, it will be a commercial facility. If the Deputy is asking whether the State will develop such a facility, it will not. The Deputy will be aware that in some aspects of waste disposal, and I believe this is a good thing, we will take an increasingly all-island approach. One example is the fact that we have just signed off on an agreement with our colleagues in the Department of the Environment in Northern Ireland on the collection of fridges. There is one contract for the entire island and all local authorities will feed into it. We need to ensure that the different areas of our island have the capacity to deal with the different streams of waste being collected. That is important.</P>
    <P>Weighted volumes are utilised in some local authorities, but not enough. Progress on this has been slow and I want to increase it substantially. It is much fairer to charge by weight for the removal of waste. About five local authorities have moved on this and I expect all local authorities to do so in the next year or two. This is most important because it will encourage people. The more they recycle, the less waste disposal will cost them.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government has taken, and will continue to take, a proactive role in campaigning against reprocessing operations at Sellafield. An Agreed Programme for Government states that we regard the continued existence of Sellafield as an unacceptable threat to Ireland, that it should be closed and that we will use every diplomatic and legal route available to us to work towards the removal of this threat.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1120" />The Government has taken an important initiative in pursuit of this policy objective through its separate legal actions, under the OSPAR convention and the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea or UNCLOS, regarding the Sellafield MOX plant. These actions are proceeding on schedule and are challenging operations at the Sellafield MOX plant on economic, legal, environmental and safety grounds. As regards the OSPAR case, oral hearings took place before the Permanent Court of Arbitration in the Hague in October 2002 and a determination in the case is awaited. Oral hearings in respect of the UNCLOS case are expected to take place over three weeks beginning on 10 June 2003.</P>
    <P>In addition, the Government has developed a strong and constructive campaign against nuclear energy in general, and against activities at Sellafield in particular, that focuses clearly on the threat to Ireland from these activities based on genuine concerns regarding safety, security and sustainability.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BernardAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister agree that in the event of internal sabotage or the widespread devastation of the Sellafield plant by the high speed impact of a large aircraft, the consequences would be severe for this country and the UK? In scale with the Chernobyl disaster involving caesium-137, a total of 14 million people would be exposed to doses of radiation and approximately 540,000 cancer deaths would be caused. These figures come from a paper presented at a scientific meeting in this city some months ago. The devastation would be increased by the fact that there would be at least a 30-year half-life on some of the emissions.</P>
      <P>Does the Minister agree that the delay in getting a judgment on the hearings last October is effectively long fingering the problem? Does he agree that there is a renewed urgency to declare unconditional war on the British nuclear industry, in view of the figures I have presented? Aside from encouraging a postcard campaign to the British Prime Minister, funded by Fianna Fáil, what has been done to insist that Irish scientists from the Radiological Protection Institute and other institutions in this country be allowed access to the Sellafield plant to examine its security and operational aspects? Why has the UK Government refused to allow Irish scientists onto the site to assess the implications for this country, given the frightening statistics I mentioned?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy makes my point for me. His concluding question goes to the heart of the reason for the court cases in which we are involved. I do not believe the results of the court case under the OSPAR convention are being long fingered. The case was only heard in the last few months before Christmas&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
      <P>That is true. I had hoped we would <Col N="1121" /> have some indications by now but we do not. However, we expect these judgments in the near future. I hope that we have them before the UNCLOS case starts on 10 June, which is only some weeks away. These go to the heart of the Deputy's question in terms of access to information about security now and in the future, and the question of the nuclear industry. It is important that the Government takes a definitive route on this. To embark on legal cases in regard to these issues was a major step for this Government to take. I am glad it has done so and that the first case has been heard. We look forward to the second case. We will see how those cases proceed and what their results will be. There are other options open to us.</P>
      <P>One of the issues I have raised, however, is the question of trying to build a broader based political alliance with regard to the future of the nuclear industry. No country can continue to develop new nuclear facilities in isolation from the surrounding countries or, as I would prefer, from a European context because, as the Deputy has rightly said, the consequences of a disaster at a nuclear power plant are almost too horrendous to contemplate. These are not issues for Ireland alone. They should be issues for all of us as European people and all the peoples of the world. What happened in Chernobyl and the destruction it caused is unbelievable and, given our location, the impact of a similar or greater nuclear accident, or a terrorist event on this country, particularly an attack on the UK nuclear industry, would be devastating.</P>

      <P>The Irish Government was promised that there would be access to Sellafield for Irish scientists. Why is the British Government still refusing to allow scientists from our radiological protection institutes and other institutes to examine operations in the plant? Why is the Irish Government not insisting as a sovereign government on its rights regarding a promise that was made many years ago and still has not been honoured?

The Deputy is quite correct in suggesting that we are not satisfied. We exhausted all possibilities and then had to take the final step which was to go to the Court of Arbitration.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatTheCope" hpid="Mr. Gallagher Mr. Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment and Local Government (Mr. Gallagher)</NameTxt>
      <P>The recent CSO quarterly national household survey on voter participation and abstention provides valuable new information on attitudes to voting and on the causes for non-voting among the public. The survey establishes a strong correlation between turnout and increasing age of voters and indicates that 70% of those surveyed are very or fairly satisfied with the working of democracy in Ireland. Another interesting finding is that over 60% of the people responding to the survey did not have a preference regarding the day of the week on which voting occurs.</P>
      <P>In general, the results of the CSO survey indicate that publicly-funded awareness campaigns regarding electoral participation are properly targeted. Advertising of this kind has been designed to address younger voters in particular. In addition, much of this advertising budget is concentrated on the need for voters to register a priority highlighted by the survey finding that &ldquo;not registered&rdquo; was the most commonly cited reason for abstaining from voting. The challenge is to intensify awareness efforts in both these areas and to make them more effective.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Electoral (Amendment) Act 2001 addresses barriers to voter registration and voting that exist within the current system and provides for a range of measures which will make a positive contribution to encouraging voter participation. Among the measures included in the Act are provisions for photographs and party emblems on ballot papers, earlier opening of polling stations, the display of a large print copy of ballot papers in polling buildings, companion voting for persons with literacy difficulties, voting by poll workers and provision that a registered voter who changes address can apply for entry in the supplementary register. In addition, the Act pro<Col N="1123" /> vides a statutory basis for the introduction of electronic voting and vote counting which will be extended countrywide in 2004 following its successful use in seven constituencies at the second Nice referendum.</P>
    <P>The Referendum Act 2001 provided the Referendum Commission with a new function of promoting awareness of the referendum and encouraging citizens to vote. The recently published Referendum Commission report refers in positive terms to this additional function.</P>
    <P>As part of the PPF initiative, extended publicity campaigns to promote voter registration were undertaken in the three-year period to the end of 2002.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Additional Information.</i>
    </P>
    <P>
      <i>
      </i>Separate information campaigns were carried out to promote the introduction of electronic voting at the general election and the second Nice referendum in 2002 and an extensive campaign will also be undertaken prior to the countrywide roll out of the electronic system in 2004. This campaign will contain a strong focus on encouraging voter turnout.</P>
    <P>My Department will continue to keep under review measures which will contribute to improving voter participation having particular regard to the findings in the CSO survey, the Referendum Commission report and any other relevant research.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>Could I suggest to the Minister of State that he appears to have missed the point of the CSO survey, the most significant finding of which is that almost 60% of those who did not vote cite circumstantial reasons for not voting: they were not on the register or they were on the register in the wrong place; they were away from base on the day of the election or they could not get to vote, or reasons of that kind. The Minister of State has power to remedy all of those problems. Would he accept that the electoral registers to which we are operating are in a deplorable mess and that steps need to be taken urgently to ensure that the electoral register is accurate? Would he also accept that the present system of council officials going around on their bicycles looking in windows to see if somebody is resident where he or she is supposed to be resident is clearly not working and that a new system of drawing up electoral registers and maintaining them will have to be introduced?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Second, since the reasons that people give for not voting include that they could not get to the polling station or that they were too busy, would he consider extending the number of days on which an election might take place, holding elections at weekends or perhaps giving a facility to voters for advance voting when they know that they are going to be away from home? The system that we have at the moment of polling stations in school rooms is out of date and perhaps polling arrangements should be put in place <Col N="1124" /> to allow people to vote in their shopping centres or wherever they might be on the day or days when polling is taking place. If the Government improved the opportunities for people to vote that would probably contribute more than advertising campaigns to a higher turnout.</P>
    <P>Could the Minister of State agree, perhaps under the aegis of the Oireachtas committee on the environment and local government to set up an all-party group which in conjunction with the appropriate officials from his Department, would look at the CSO report to examine what practical steps can be taken to overcome the obstacles which are preventing so many people from voting?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>The information which has been made available to us through the CSO is helpful. It was published on 30 April and I have had an opportunity of looking at it quickly prior to the tabling of this priority question. The elector has a responsibility in this to ensure that he or she is on the register and it is no different in Donegal, Dún Laoghaire or Cork to any other part of the country. The question of establishing a new system is not something that we have considered. The current system has served us reasonably well. There is a difference in that in the past it was the responsibility of the rate collector, who called to every house. With the abolition of rates, that became the role, through the local authority, of the revenue collector, who does not have that responsibility, making it somewhat difficult. However, certain steps were taken. For the 1997 election, there was a supplement to allow for change of address, and that has worked reasonably well, but not as well as we would like. We would like to be 100% fool-proof.</P>

Whether I wish to vote in my local supermarket or school is not a major issue. The polling stations are reasonably near, and we must be realistic about that too. Who is to decide? Must we inform the local authority in advance of where we want to vote? We must examine all that, and it might be somewhat more attractive with the new electronic voting system which will be in place for the 2004 elections.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government's strategy is to increase housing supply to meet demand and to improve affordability, particularly for first-time purchasers. There is clear evidence that the strategy is proving effective. Total new housing output in 2002 was 57,695 units, representing an increase of 9.7% on 2001 and the eighth consecutive year of record housing output. The effects of that increased output are reflected in moderating house price trends. Average year-on-year house price increases have been reduced from a peak of around 40% per annum in 1998 to the current more moderate levels.</P>
      <P>When combined with Government measures and other factors, including high levels of economic growth, lower tax levels, increased disposable incomes, increased employment, lower mortgage interest rates and low inflation, that moderation in house price increases has impacted positively on housing affordability.</P>
      <P>Local authority and voluntary housing programmes have been greatly expanded. Last year over 12,700 units of social and affordable housing were provided, compared with just short of 8,700 units in 2000. Local authority housing output of 5,074 units was achieved in 2002, and the voluntary housing sector continued to play an increasingly significant role in the provision of social housing, with output of 1,360 units, the highest level ever recorded. Activity is also increasing significantly under the affordable housing and shared ownership schemes. Eight hundred and eighty two affordable housing units were built in 2002, about three times the output in 2001, and 1,686 households benefited under the shared ownership scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Demographic changes continue to drive the demand for housing, including social housing. The Government therefore remains committed to continuing measures to boost the supply of housing, seeking to bring moderation to the rate of house price increases and assist low income groups and those with social housing needs <Col N="1126" /> through the range of targeted social and affordable housing programmes.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Additional Information.</i>
    </P>
    <P>
      <i>
      </i>Total capital funding for housing this year &ndash;&euro;1.7 billion &ndash; is up almost 7% on the amount provided in 2002. It is anticipated that the funding will enable the needs of about 12,000 households to be met this year. The provisions under Part V of the Planning and Development Act 2000, as amended, will assist in the delivery of social and affordable housing, and the housing initiative included in the new national partnership agreement Sustaining Progress also seeks to increase the supply of affordable housing.</P>
    <P>The current level of public investment in housing is very significant, and the need to ensure that we are making best use of the available resources to meet housing needs is reflected in the new partnership agreement Sustaining Progress, which provides for a review of the effectiveness of programmes designed to assist low income groups, including those with social housing needs and special housing needs, such as elderly, disabled and homeless persons and Travellers. The Government will continue to monitor housing developments and review policies as necessary to ensure that the demand for housing is met in a sustainable manner.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
      <P>I hate to be disrespectful, and I know that the Minister is a decent and honest man who expects the best from everyone and we expect the best from him, but the reply that he has read out is the greatest load of gobbledegook that I have heard since entering this House over 20 years ago. I do not think that the Minister disbelieves me. I think that he recognises what I am saying. Having regard to what he has just said, it would take about 20 years to surmount the country's present housing crisis, by which time it will have escalated even further. It will be completely out of reach. I ask him what action he can take to address a situation where, in my constituency, for instance, of all so-called affordable housing built, 60% is bought by investment houses and speculators. The figure is not 35% or 38%, but in some cases almost every two-bedroom or three-bedroom, semi-detached, standard house that comes on the market is bought by speculators.</P>
      <P>What in God's name will the Minister do about this? The 5,000 people who were on the council housing list in my local authority area two years ago are still on it, with others joining them. What in heaven's name will the Minister do? Will he give some direction or instruction? I listened to the Minister of State on the radio the other night and was appalled by the apparent lack of knowledge regarding the true housing situation. What can the Minister do about it?</P>

    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
      <P>I disagree with the Deputy on one fundamental point in this debate. The whole problem that we had through consecutive Governments of recent years was that we were <Col N="1127" /> nowhere near supplying the demands of the marketplace. That is a fundamental issue. One can make every effort and engineer procedures, which can make an important contribution, but if one does not fulfil the basic principle of building enough houses to meet the demands of the people, one's efforts are as nothing.</P>
      <P>We have had eight years of record housing output. We have reached a point, at around the 58,000 mark, where supply is meeting demand. Do not take my view or that of the Government, but independent commentators, lending institutions and the construction industry indicate that we have reached a situation where supply in the Irish market equals demand. Achieving that this year is not enough, we must sustain that level of house production in the marketplace over the next few years. As the Taoiseach has said on numerous occasions on the Order of Business, that is way ahead of what any other EU country is doing. Equally, over 12,000 units are being supplied to people in need of housing in this country through affordable housing schemes, social housing schemes and shared ownership schemes. Those are the facts, but the profile of the people has changed dramatically.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BernardAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is showing a frightful level of complacency about this crisis. He talks of supply, but does he realise that 30% of houses being built are being snapped up by speculators and investors and that the ordinary man and woman in the street cannot afford a house? They were further insulted this week by the President of the Irish Auctioneers and Valuers Institute, who said that there had never been a better time to buy a house. That would be the case if one could afford to do so. People cannot afford houses, and young people's parents are going into hock to enable their children to buy houses. The Minister does not seem to realise that, for the first time ever, the number of applicants on the waiting list in Cork city has reached 4,000.</P>

      <P>Is it not the case that because the Government screwed first-time buyers by the abolition of the first-time buyer's grant and the increase in VAT and gave a leg-up to investors through tax breaks and various incentives, while we are now producing more houses, we are producing them for moneyed people rather than for those who need them? I will ask the Minister a simple question. We have heard much over the past few days of the 57,000 houses built in this country last year, but how many of those houses were bought by first-time buyers?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Timmins</NameTxt>

I fundamentally disagree with Part V of the Planning and Develop<Col N="1128" /> ment Act 2000 &ndash; the Minister's intervention caused the difficulty. I differ with some of my colleagues in that I believe that numbers were increased and that the Government introduced policies, but they were reversed and billions of pounds were drawn out of the economy as a result. I have one specific question concerning a matter that has come to my attention within the past few days. It has to do with a departmental circular, Circular 403, to local authorities. It is a draft circular which states that where there is any planning application for houses that will deliver five or more affordable houses to the local authority from private schemes the Department must vet that scheme. Will the Minister examine that, given that one of his stated policies is to bring houses on stream quickly? This is one more layer of bureaucracy. It is one more instance of interference by the Department in what should be a private industry. Circular 403 requires the Department to vet any application that will bring on stream five or more affordable houses. I do not like this prescriptive approach.</P>

      <P>What does the Minister intend to do about the cartel of developers, the dirty dozen developers and speculators, who control the supply of building land in the greater Dublin area? These are among some of Fianna Fáil's biggest campaign contributors and they are artificially maintaining a high price for building land in Dublin. Not only that, they are allowing new housing onto the market in a drip-feed manner so as to sustain an artificially high price. What is the Minister and his party doing to reduce the price of housing and to break up the cartels that are among his party's largest contributors to its campaign coffers? What is the Minister going to do about that?</P>

      <P>If the Minister is aware of the ongoing crisis in housing, particularly regarding the difficulties local authorities have in procuring land for housing, why is he allowing various Departments to sell off land that could be handed over to local authorities? The Department of Defence and other Departments have been selling off land to private developers instead of handing it over to local authorities to build houses, thereby solving one of the critical issues, that of land procurement for house building.</P>

It is based on one simple fact, the necessity to get supply up to the level of demand. The industry is at capacity. We have up to six years' serviced land available nationally and ten years' in Dublin. The industry and those in the housing market are building at absolute capacity at the moment. Any independent analysis would indicate that.</P>

      <P>The Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland, RPII, has been advised by the UK regulator, the Nuclear Installations Inspectorate, NII, that progress in the dismantling of this structure has been slower than envisaged. Originally the operator appointed a commercial enterprise to plan, oversee and execute the dismantling work on this pile. However, the contract foundered when, at a late stage, the proposed engineering solution was deemed <Col N="1130" /> unacceptable. The UK Atomic Energy Authority then took back overall control of the project and is now working with a consortium of contractors.

      <P>I tabled a question to the Minister in exactly the same words as today on 1 April 2003 and the Minister responded in exactly the same words as he responded today. That is why I tabled a further question. In the last sentence of his reply the Minister said that while the particular continued existence of the pile is clearly undesirable, it is not believed to constitute a serious hazard. That statement is simply misleading and wrong. All of the experts, including Mr. John Large, the leading independent nuclear expert, say that this is an extremely hazardous pile arising from the burn-out of the reactor in 1957. Will the Minister revisit this issue because of the report from John Large which indicates serious danger of a further reaction from the continuing radioactivity within the remains of this reactor which was put in place originally in the 1950s to provide material for nuclear bombs?</P>

      <P>I agree broadly with the Deputy's concerns because they echo mine and the Government's. We have pursued this issue constantly. The UK Atomic Energy Authority has taken back overall control of this project and is now working with a consortium of contractors. We want to see this pile completely decommissioned. What I said in my reply was in a context, that it is not believed to constitute a serious hazard in terms of its potential for giving rise to an incident with off-site consequences. From the Government's point of view, we are pressing the British Government in the context of its own domain with regard to this issue and we want to see it brought to a conclusion. The UK is establishing a new Government agency to deal with all of these matters. We want to see this brought to a conclusion. We are constantly in touch with the UK Government and The Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland is constantly dealing with this matter. We want to see it resolved. I wish I were in a position to directly intervene in the UK but I am not. Notwithstanding that, the UK authorities both at ministerial level and down through the system, are well aware of this Government's concerns on this issue.</P>

      <P>I thank the Minister for his further reply. The point I am trying to make is that there is a danger of an incident with off-site consequences, and John Large, in his examination of the pile, has specified that that is the case. He also specified that the building around the two tonnes of highly radioactive material that is there now has deteriorated to a point where it is about to collapse and in that collapse an incident could occur that could have off-site consequences as bad as the consequences of the original fire which spread radioactive contamination to Ireland and Europe as well. Will the Minister have the off-site consequences of an incident there re-examined and not take the word of British Nuclear Fuels or of the other British agencies for it because they have told the Government untruths &ndash; I know the word &ldquo;lies&rdquo; is not to be used even in that context. They were deceitful on a number of occasions previously until we found out for ourselves. I ask that the expertise of our own agency be used to establish this aspect of the case.</P>

      <P>At a minimum, they gave the wrong information. I am quite prepared to put that on the record. That information was available internationally and it was inaccurate and incorrect. There is no question about that, and it is a matter of deep concern to this Government and to me as it is to the Deputy and everybody else. The Radiological Protection Institute is the institute on which I depend for all of this information and I have to say, in fairness to it, that no day passes without it being directly involved and engaged in these issues. It comes back to an earlier question which I will not go into. There is a level of frustration and of deep concern to the point where we believe this Government, as a sovereign Government on behalf of the people, has a right to far more information on a whole range of issues that I will not go into again. That is why we have pursued the case under the OSPAR Convention and will shortly start the case under the UNCLOS Convention. If I have any more up-to-date information as we develop this case I will communicate it to the Deputy.</P>

Only recently, I wrote to the UK Minister, whom I met recently on the issue and hope to meet again for further formal meetings. I also avail of the opportunity at many other meetings that take place between Ministers to raise these issues. The point raised by Deputy Allen is at the nub of the issue. When we get an agreement in place the information supplied is interpreted differently by both sides. That is at the nub of the difficulty. We consider that the interpretation put on the information supplied to us by the UK authorities is too minimalist. We want more substantial information. We had tried every means to get that type of information to improve the relationship. In fairness, on a number of issues the relationship has improved and the flow of information has improved. However, we want that substantially increased. When we could not get that mutual agreement between the two partners we had no choice but to initiate the two court cases to which I have referred.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
      <P>Good progress is being made nationally in the provision of waste water treatment facilities to eliminate untreated sewage discharges in all areas. By end 2003, Dublin, Cork, Limerick and Galway, and many other smaller urbans, will have state-of-the-art waste water treatment facilities in place and operational. Since 2000, under my Department's water services investment programme, the provision of waste water collection and treatment systems has been completed in the major coastal towns of Dundalk, Drogheda, Midleton, Westport and Courtown-Riverchapel. The Ringsend waste water treatment plant, the largest such project hitherto constructed in Ireland, which is currently being commissioned, will deal with the waste water treatment requirements of all of Dublin city and south Dublin, significant areas of Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown and Fingal, and parts of County Meath. This scheme, which includes nutrient removal, will serve a population equivalent to 1.6 million people. It will produce the single biggest ever improvement in the quality of <Col N="1133" /> Irish coastal waters and will restore bathing water standards throughout Dublin Bay.</P>
      <P>This year will also see the completion of the major waste water treatment schemes currently at an advanced stage of construction in Cork, Limerick, Galway and Wexford. Other major coastal schemes under construction, or due to start this year, include the Carrigaline, Cobh, Dungarvan, Sligo, Tramore and Waterford main drainage schemes. Schemes for Bray, Bundoran, New Ross and Shanganagh are approved for funding to commence in 2004, together with the Arklow main drainage scheme, subject to the outcome of current legal proceedings relating to the proposed location of the treatment plant in the latter case. Completion of these schemes will eliminate all untreated sewage discharges down to 10,000 population equivalent.</P>
      <P>The urban waste water directive requires specific waste water treatment and/or collection facilities to be in place by 31 December 2005 for discharges from a graduated range of agglomeration thresholds. The current water services investment programme, which covers the years 2002-04, contains 380 waste water schemes, incorporating all the remaining waste water schemes needed for full compliance with the directive.</P>
      <P>At the beginning of the current national development plan, compliance with the 2005 requirements of the urban waste water treatment directive, which extends down to agglomerations of 2,000 population equivalent, stood at 25%.</P>
      <P>
        <i>Additional Information.</i>
      </P>
      <P>
        <i>
        </i>This will rise to 87% by the end of 2003. Full compliance by the end of 2005 is the target and the funding being provided for the advancement of relevant schemes approved under my Department's water services investment programme will ensure this is achieved.</P>
      <P>Overall, I am more than satisfied with the rate of progress being achieved in the waste water treatment area in response to the programme for Government target and our obligations under the directive</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>I acknowledge progress has been made in this area. However, my question arises directly from An Agreed Programme for Government which is specific and states that we will ensure that discharges of untreated sewage from our big cities and towns into the sea cease by the end of 2003. By the end of 2003 will untreated sewage go into the sea from big cities and towns or will that practice have ceased? The Minister gave a long list of towns where progress is being made regarding treatment. If the target will not be met at the end of 2003, from what cities and towns will untreated sewage continue to be discharged into the sea?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
      <P>Significant investment has been made in all areas in recent years. While we may not have all the state-of-the-art facilities there has been a major improvement in the way sewage is <Col N="1134" /> dealt with. Ironically, from my point of view, the big urban area that is not to be completed in 2003, out of the five county borough cities, is Waterford. Dublin is being commissioned. Cork, Galway and Limerick will have facilities in place this year. While Waterford is the only one left out, it is ready to roll and the treatment facility should be started this year.</P>
      <P>Sligo was one of those mentioned in another area. The delay is not just due to difficulties at my end but many planning issues have arisen. Under the directive, the target date for putting the facilities in place is 2005. I have said we will comply with the directive by 2005. Some schemes have advanced further than others, some are slightly behind, but this is normal in a project of this magnitude. By and large we are on target. It was always expected that some would proceed faster than others for the reasons outlined. I have indicated the others which are due to start this year.</P>

What plans has the Minister for the many coastal areas which have large tourist populations in the summer, such as Clifden, and many other seaside towns and villages in my constituency which still pump raw sewage into the sea? I welcome the Minister's information in regard to Galway, despite the fact that the main Galway city sewage treatment plant, although Galway has a population of over 70,000, is still discharging raw sewage into the sea. I am aware the scheme will be completed during 2003.</P>

All of these will be met within the programme. We will then look to the next round of areas that need to be dealt with. It is one programme which is proceeding well and we are largely on target. Significant investment is being made and the results are there for all to see. I want to see this programme fully completed as set out for 2000-04.</P>

    <Col N="1135" />
    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
      <P>The European Parliament's Committee on Petitions visited Ireland in April to examine, <i>inter alia,</i> representations made to it in relation to two public water supplies. In both cases measures have been taken by the local authorities to improve the level of service to consumers pending the completion of major infrastructure improvements that have been approved for funding under my Department's water services investment programme. A draft copy of the committee's report was furnished to my Department following the visit in which the committee acknowledges the Government's determination to resolve drinking water quality deficiencies. Copies of the draft report have been forwarded by my Department to the local authorities concerned and to the Environmental Protection Agency. A final version of the report has not yet been made available to the Department but it will be carefully considered on receipt.</P>
      <P>The Environmental Protection Agency publishes a report annually on the quality of drinking water in Ireland and a copy of the report for 2001 is available in the Oireachtas Library. This report confirms the fundamentally good quality of Irish drinking water, with an overall compliance rate of 94.3% and with prescribed standards for all supplies, based on 14 principal parameters. Following from recommendations made in previous years, documented procedures are in place or in preparation by a number of authorities to respond to detected breaches of quality standards. Future reports will highlight the extent to which deficiencies identified in EPA audits have been addressed.</P>
      <P>Ongoing investment by my Department in the development and upgrading of water supply infrastructure is intended to maximise compliance with prescribed quality standards. The National Development Plan 2000-2006 provides for investment amounting to &euro;1.59 billion on major water supply schemes, and my Department's water services investment programme, 2002-04, includes 218 public water supply schemes.</P>
      <P>Water quality deficiencies in group water schemes are mainly confined to those schemes that are dependent on private sources, including rivers, lakes and boreholes. The schemes involved serve 50,000 rural households. Since March 2000, all these schemes are eligible for a 100% grant for the installation of water disinfection and treatment equipment. Related civil works are grant aided at up to 85% of cost. In addition, a subsidy of up to &euro;197 per house is payable towards the operational cost of supplying domestic water to group scheme consumers. Earlier this year I announced a record annual allocation of over &euro;100 million under the rural water programme.</P>
      <P>
        <i>Additional Information.</i>
      </P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <i>
      </i>The planned capital spend this year is up almost 50% on last year's figure and is ten times greater than what was spent in 1996. This demonstrates the Government's commitment to eliminating the problem of quality deficient rural water <Col N="1136" /> supplies. While as many as possible of schemes with private sources will be connected to a local authority public supply, 500 will have to provide their own water disinfection and treatment facilities, all of which will be 100% grant aided.</P>
    <P>The 2003 allocation provides the means to put in motion, this year, a massive upgrading programme to improve supplies to 38,000 out of the 50,000 rural households dependent on schemes with poor quality private sources. Positive progress on these schemes this year will break the back of the problem. Funding to eliminate the remainder of the problem has been provided under the NDP. It is also intended to introduce a licensing system for the group water sector under the forthcoming Water Services Bill.</P>
    <P>Any breach of drinking water standards is a serious matter that must be urgently addressed. In that context I am satisfied that the measures being implemented and the strategies being pursued by my Department will resolve the remaining deficiencies in individual supplies in the shortest possible timescale.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PadraicMcCormack" hpid="Mr. McCormack Mr. McCormack">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCormack</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister indicated that 100% grant aid is available to improve the water quality of the group water schemes, which is mainly the concern of rural Ireland. Why are no grants available from the local authorities to upgrade pipe-size pumps etc., which are vital for the continuation of many such schemes? In my County Galway, grants are only available to improve water quality while nothing is provided to improve water quantity, increased pipe sizes or increased volume of water in the schemes. Is the Minister concerned at the findings of a recent survey, which shows that at least 25% of the group water schemes are in breach of the standards laid down?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
      <P>I re-emphasise that 94% of the water in the country is of a very high standard. It is equally important that we do not confuse the issues, particularly with the problems facing some rural water schemes. That is why I have provided so much in terms of resources &ndash; over &euro;100 million announced in the past few months &ndash; into these schemes. In fairness to the National Group Water Scheme Association, we have, working with them, agreed on a formula for moving forward involving the bundling of many of the smaller schemes to ensure maximum cost efficiency and usage. In many cases we could not find information on who runs these private water schemes. We had to try to get people together to progress matters. I am confident that we will eradicate this problem. That is my objective. In this regard, a minority of the schemes must be dealt with.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not sure what point the Deputy is making in terms of upgrading. Local authorities have substantial resources of their own to deal with a range of issues. If pressing issues arise, as the Deputy has outlined in his local area, it is open <Col N="1137" /> to the local authority to deal with some of them from their own resources.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister agree that on the question of the group water schemes, which began as part of a community effort to provide a water supply where none was available, part of the investment programme dealing with their upgrade involves the transfer of their effective control from the community groups which established them to the private companies engaged in the investment? Does he accept that while there is a welcome upgrade of the schemes in terms of water quality, an effective transfer of control of the schemes is being effected?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate the Deputy's point but I do not accept it. The management of many of the schemes has become much more demanding, especially as sophisticated equipment is involved. Even if I was involved in a scheme I would not have the knowledge or ability to operate it. I have met many in the communities which have benefited from these new schemes. Local community groups are directly involved, but given that the management of them has become a more sophisticated operation, they are pleased that companies are able to act on their behalf, especially as they do not have the capacity. It is a very specialised business. I have visited many parts of the country and where I have been involved in opening these new schemes with combined groups working together, they are delighted with the new arrangements and are very proud of their new schemes. There is not an issue here. It is a question of the transfer to a sophisticated form of management from a point where there was little or no management, which was the problem. It has been welcomed by all.</P>

      <P>I wish to speak specifically to amendment No. 1. There was not sufficient time to address a matter which profoundly affects very many Members of the Dáil. There was no need to impose a guillotine. I have been a local authority member for 11 years and a Member of the Dáil for six and I have a deep interest in the legislation. Deputies like me deserved more time to tease out the issues. The reason I opposed this Bill on Second Stage and oppose it again is that it does not deserve to be called the Local Government Bill 2003 as it is a sham and a pretence at reform of local government. It is designed to suit the agendas of Fianna Fáil in particular and perhaps the Progressive Democrats in terms of how they wish to position themselves for the next general election.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Bill downgrades severely by implication the responsibilities of Members of the Dáil and the standing of their service on local authorities. I have always rejected the media cliché and slur that members of the local authorities who are also Members of the Dáil are double jobbing. Representing working class communities, as I do, is not a job, it is a seamless mission to represent communities and people on local authorities and in the national parliament. There is no conflict <Col N="1140" /> between the two. People who see politics at local or national level in crude career terms as a money-making exercise describe this as double jobbing. As a representative of working class communities who lives on the wage of an average worker from all the representational functions I have no matter what they are, I reject that view. I do not see any contradiction between serving the community in the Dáil or in local government.</P>
    <P>The reason I used the words &ldquo;by implication&rdquo; when referring to the downgrading of Deputies who are local authority members is that the legislation specifically forbids Members from taking up membership of their local authorities. It does not exclude the real double jobbing and the real double jobbers who moonlight as publicans, barristers and landlords. Real conflicts of interest arise for those supposedly representing ordinary people while being deeply involved in their own business dealings. If the Minister were serious about the argument calling for more time for Dáil Members to concentrate on legislative matters without being distracted by local government responsibilities, why did he not clear out the real double jobbers through legislation? Why does the Minister make an exception of local government service by Members of the Dáil?</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>Given that I have only two minutes to contribute, I do not propose to rehash the arguments which have already been made. I return to the issue of the constitutionality or otherwise of this section of the Bill.</P>
      <P>The Minister will recall that on Committee Stage he was asked to publish and make available the legal advice he has received that the provision is constitutional. The constitutionality of this section of the Bill has been raised on several occasions in this House, at committee and in the Seanad which has given ample time for the Minister and the Attorney General to reconsider and re-examine the issue. It must have been the case that points of view expressed here and in the Seanad caused the Minister to ask the Attorney General to give a renewed opinion on this issue. On all occasions the Minister has been asked to address this question, he skirted around it. He has told us in the course of this Report Stage debate that any Bill presented to the House goes through the office of the Attorney General during drafting and that there is a presumption of constitutionality. That is not good enough given that direct questions have been raised about the Bill's constitutionality. Opinions have been expressed in the House, which is something we can all do, but at the end of the day the Supreme Court will determine whether the Bill is constitutional.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would have thought that in view of the fact that the issue has been raised on so many occasions and in so many ways that the Minister would have asked the Attorney General for a second or even third opinion as well as for reassurance. Given that he has been asked by several Members, including me, to provide a legal <Col N="1141" /> opinion, if the Bill brought before the House on the basis of presumed constitutionality is struck down by the President by reference or challenge in the courts, the Minister will find himself in an impossible position.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PadraicMcCormack" hpid="Mr. McCormack Mr. McCormack">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCormack</NameTxt>
      <P>Before we adjourned, the Minister stressed in his reply that he did not think local authorities would be weakened or that Oireachtas Members would not continue to have the same interest in local government. I dispute that strongly. It is quite obvious that there will be a conflict between the Oireachtas and local authorities when no local authority members are sitting here. When legislation relevant to local government is being debated by the Oireachtas no one is better qualified to examine it than Members of the Houses who are also members of local authorities. There are 123 of them at present. These Members have a direct interest in the legislation which might affect them at local authority level. If this Bill becomes law, no Member of the House will have the same interest as Members in this Chamber now have in such matters.</P>
      <P>It would satisfy many people if the Minister would tell the House when he proposes to make known the regulations he will introduce to protect the rights of Oireachtas Members who will no longer be members of local authorities in terms of their legitimate representations at local government level. If we knew what those regulations were to be, we might be quite satisfied. It appears the Government backbenchers have been satisfied in this regard as they are no longer participating in the debate. When will the regulations be introduced and how does the Minister propose to fully protect the rights of representation of Oireachtas Members in the local authority areas that they represent in the Oireachtas?</P>

      <P>Fianna Fáil backbenchers raised questions concerning the constitutionality of the Bill and the relationship between Oireachtas Members and local authorities as well as other issues. They behaved like mighty mouse in their constituencies but, like Mickey Mouse, many of them did not even speak &ndash; they drifted away. Have they been bought off with promises or do their own political ambitions take precedence over their political principles? I do not know the answer, but they are playing two sides of the road on this as well as on other Bills and it is fooling no one.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the Thursday before Easter, I and other spokespersons raised with the Minister the question of the constitutionality of the Bill. He said <Col N="1142" /> that, as with any other Bill introduced, he sought legal advice. However, we have all raised serious questions about the constitutionality of the Bill and I ask the Minister to make available the legal advice he received, for which there is precedent, so we can be satisfied that the Bill is constitutional.</P>
    <P>I have already said that it would be a political hanging offence for the Minister if, having heard all the warnings, this Bill were found to be unconstitutional. The Minister would have no choice but to resign. He may laugh, but that would be a serious and fundamental error of judgment in an important Bill. For his own sake, I ask the Minister to publish the Attorney General's advice because I am putting down a marker that, if it is tested and found to be unconstitutional, the Minister will be seen to have been grievously politically negligent in his capacity as the Minister promoting this Bill.</P>

This would not be the first Bill to come before both Houses and be found to be unconstitutional. However, I have no such expectation with regard to this Bill.</P>
      <P>The constitutionality of the Bill comes down to one issue, which is whether one is for or against the dual mandate. There is nothing in any section, specific sentence or aspect of the Bill which is unconstitutional. The issue is a red herring. The flag of constitutionality is being raised by those who want to stop the dual mandate. Interestingly, these are the same people who, just over two years ago, had exactly the opposite point of view and seemed not to have any problem with constitutionality.</P>

      <P>I will not delay the House on this matter. On Committee Stage, I asked the Minister to publish the regulations and I ask him again if we can have sight of them because of the justifiable reservations we have. I have set out my concerns and the reasons I want the situation to be firmed up in amendment form. I ask the Minister to publish the regulations and, if he will not, what his reasons are. Has the Minister shown these regulations to his backbenchers since they are not here today? Are they happy with them and, if he has shown them to the backbenchers why can the House not be provided with them so we can make a proper political judgment?</P>

    <Col N="1144" />
    <Speaker pid="PadraicMcCormack" hpid="Mr. McCormack Mr. McCormack">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCormack</NameTxt>
      <P>I was premature in my contribution on the previous amendment. We would be finished a long time before six o' clock if the regulations were spelt out. Using my political judgment, it appears to me that Government Deputies must be satisfied with what the Minister has spelt out to them on the regulations or else they accept the Minister's good faith in this matter. It is not so easy for us to do so because, like Deputy Allen, I would like the regulations spelt out to illustrate how the rights of Oireachtas Members, as representatives at local authority level, will be protected since they will be representing counties, cities or parts of them after this legislation is passed. It is all very well to say that there will be directives to county managers and everyone else. However, I know about this issue to my cost because I am in a different position to most local authority members in the House in that I resigned from a local authority in the last election, having been involved for 27 years on the county council. I did not stand for the county council, although I continued my membership of Galway City Council. I was probably unique in that I was on a county and city council at the same time. I know that my rights as an Oireachtas Member, still representing a large part of County Galway, at local authority level were impeded since I no longer remained a member of the local authority. I remain a Member of the Oireachtas for a large part of the county, yet I do not have the same privileges and rights as an Oireachtas Member as when I was a member of that local authority. No matter what the Minister says, I know from experience that my rights have been impeded as I am now no longer a member of one local authority in County Galway.</P>
      <P>Therefore, what assurances can the Minister give us regarding the regulations he will introduce? For example, a member of a local authority in County Galway has rights in matters of planning in that he or she has a right to table a prior notice on a planning application, whereby he or she will be notified a few days before the decision if there is a difficulty with the file. Sometimes those difficulties can be corrected and sometimes they cannot, but in most cases they are simple matters. Rather than issuing a refusal to the applicant, the time should be extended so that the difficulties can be dealt with. That right is no longer available to me as an Oireachtas Member in Galway county. It is available in Galway city because I am a member of the local authority there still. I am now asking the Minister whether that right will be available to Members of the Oireachtas who continue to be Members while representing large areas of local authorities. I just want a &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; or &ldquo;No&rdquo; answer to that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If we got the assurances we were looking for as regards the protection of the rights of Oireachtas Members as members of local authorities, there might not be nearly as much opposition to the Bill as there is now. It might be in the interest of the Minister to ensure better goodwill towards <Col N="1145" /> this Bill by spelling this out. I am sorry the Minister was not here to hear this, but I am sure the Minister of State will brief him on what I have said. I know from my experience that my rights since I retired from the county council have not been protected and are not the same as they were when I was a member. I do not want that to happen to me now, as a Member of the Oireachtas, in the part of the local authority I still represent in Galway city. If the Minister spells out the regulations he might satisfy the people on this side of the House as he appears to have satisfied the people on the Government side.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>I support these amendments, which are very important. I am disappointed &ndash; I share my disappointment with Deputies Allen and McCormack &ndash; that the Minister has not published the draft regulations that will be made under the Bill. There are a number of issues still swinging uncertainly in the air. What the Minister has said is that regulations will be made to govern the relationship between Members of the Oireachtas and local authorities.</P>
      <P>A phrase that has been used is that local authorities shall conduct their dealings with Members of either House in accordance with regulations under subsection (3). &ldquo;Dealings&rdquo; is defined to mean a dealing with a Member of the Oireachtas in his or her capacity as such a Member. I raised this point on Committee Stage and to be fair to the Minister, he confirmed that the regulations would make it explicit that the capacity of a member would not be defined in its narrowest sense &ndash; in other words, its narrowest law-making sense &ndash; but that it would include the normal representation of constituents, either as individuals or as groups, that is done on a day-to-day basis by Members. This was to be explicit in the regulations. I do not doubt the Minister's word on this, but we are flying blind as far as Report Stage of the Bill is concerned as we do not have the draft regulations.</P>
      <P>Regulations will also be made to govern the making available of local authority documentation to Members of the Oireachtas. This includes the agendas, notices and minutes of local authority meetings and other specified documentation or information. We do not know what &ldquo;specified documentation or information&rdquo; means. Does it mean, for example, that if the local authority is considering, let us say, a development plan for a city or county, the working papers for that plan will be made available to Members of the Oireachtas? When a draft is made by the council, will it be made available to Members? Will the maps associated with the draft be available?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are to be arrangements governing correspondence between Members of the Oireachtas and local authorities. We presume that means there will be a statutory obligation on local authorities to respond to correspondence from Members of the Oireachtas. However, that leaves a lot of things unclear. First of all, no time limit <Col N="1146" /> is indicated in the Bill &ndash; I do not know whether one is intended for the regulations &ndash; in which the local authority must respond to a Member.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
      <P>That might result in perfunctory responses.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>Of course. All of us receive perfunctory responses from public bodies acknowledging our representations and assuring us we will receive further correspondence in due course. Due course is a very open-ended period of time, as most of us know, in many of these cases. What Members of the Oireachtas, or anybody who makes representations to a local authority, want is a serious, substantive reply dealing with the issue that is raised, within a reasonable period of time. Again, that is not spelled out.</P>
      <P>I return to the point made by Deputy Allen during our discussion on an earlier amendment. It is significant that there is not a single member of any of the Government parties in the House for this debate. Nor, indeed, is there a single member of the Independents who normally support the Government. Given the amount of noise and opposition, perhaps in some cases mock opposition, we have heard in the press in relation to this measure from members of the Government parties and Independents, it is remarkable that none of them is here for Report Stage of the Bill.</P>

      <P>As Deputy Allen asked earlier, do they know something the rest of us do not? Have they been supplied with the draft regulations or with indications from the Minister of their contents so that they are satisfied? I invite the Minister to tell the House clearly what is to be in these regulations. I ask him to accept these reasonable amendments. If he does, we can conclude Report Stage now and the Minister can circulate the regulations to us, after which we can come back another day and take Fifth Stage of the Bill. We would at least be doing so in the knowledge of what is to be contained in the regulations.</P>

      <P>I support these amendments. I would like some clarification from the Minister on representations to local authorities. For example, county council members here may not be members of an urban, district or town council. Would the provision about representations be extended to include those other local authorities within the constituency? At the moment, our constituency office could make the representation. Perhaps the Minister will clarify that this is still <Col N="1147" /> to be the case and that representations are to be accepted by the local authority from our offices.</P>
      <P>I firmly support amendment No. 13. I would like clarification on the issue, which has been raised of reports coming through the local authority. Will those reports &ndash; draft plans, plans as adopted, amended county development plans, new county development plans &ndash; be available to Members of the Oireachtas under the new regulations that the Minister proposes to introduce? It would have been much better if we could have seen the regulations, but we got a firm commitment from the Minister on Committee Stage that the proposed regulations would embrace the issues that we, the committee members, raised. There is an element of good faith there. For members of the Opposition to take a Minister on good faith may be a challenge.</P>

      <P>Other Members have raised the fact that some message has gone out or some information has been imparted because either Fianna Fáil backbenchers would be here or the odd brave soul would be making his or her way to the plinth if they still had the types of objections many of them were known to have when this matter first came up for discussion in the House. In fairness to every elected Member of the Dáil, the Minister should say what information he has given about the regulations which he proposes to introduce. Have those regulations been already worked out? Are they there in black and white? If they are, why not share them with every Member of the Dáil rather than dealing <Col N="1148" /> with them in hushed and covert meetings in which none of us is able to participate?</P>
      <P>There is a need for the type of specifics contained in some of the amendments tabled by Deputy Allen. Despite the fact that the Minister is ending the dual mandate by decree, one can be certain that ordinary people in the constituencies will not make the same distinction as he is making. They will expect Members of the Dáil to be familiar with some issues of importance under the ambit of the local authority and to be able to advise them on those issues. It will not be good enough to say to them to speak to their councillors about those issues. Rather than putting Members of the Dáil through debating this unnecessary Bill, the Minister could have resolved this matter by leaving it up to the people to decide whether they wanted those who went forward to exercise a dual mandate by voting in or out Members of the Dáil who would have gone forward in the next local elections. The Minister could have imposed this in his party's constitution and that would have resolved the issue he wanted to achieve, which was largely for Fianna Fáil's advantage.</P>
      <P>Some of the people whom I represent will have some important issues they will want to raise with me as an elected Member of the Dáil which are really the responsibility of the local authority, for example, serious planning issues. In the case of west Dublin, they are vital issues, which I know people will want to raise, discuss, get advice on and give me advice on. I should be clear when voting for this measure what type of information I will be entitled to from the local authority on those and other issues. Therefore, it is unfair for the Minister to come into the House with essentially a pig in a poke, put this Bill through the Dáil and then not be specific about this aspect of it.</P>
      <P>In the event that this Bill goes through and is not knocked down by the courts or tripped up in some other way, if I want to attend a council meeting as an observer, will the Minister include such a provision in the regulations so that I would not be beholden to a councillor to do that? I am sure different local authorities have different standing orders, but some require a councillor to sign a person into the visitors gallery as an observer. I would like the regulations to provide that a representative such as me &ndash; this would cover membership of the Dáil but also all the functional areas of a local authority &ndash; would have the right to attend a council meeting as an observer without having to be beholden to a councillor. I might be in a local authority area where no member of my party is a member of the authority and other Members might be in the same position and be beholden to a councillor to attend and observe a meeting of the authority.</P>

      <P>I reject any suggestion that I would behave in such a manner. I have served long enough in Opposition in this House since 1987 and fortunately in Government also to respect the rights of all Members equally in this Parliament. I would not in any way undermine such an approach. I ask Members to accept my bona fides on this.</P>
      <P>The genesis of the debate of real concern on this matter which started when I introduced this Bill in the Seanad was based primarily on one point.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BernardAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>No.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
      <P>It was based on one fundamental point, although there were a number of other points.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BernardAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>There were five points.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
      <P>The first fundamental point with which I want to deal is that in the debate on the original Bill I said I would bring in guidelines. It was made clear that was unacceptable not only to members of my party and the Government but almost universally to all Members both Houses. It was pointed out to me that this measure was considered insufficient to deal with this matter and that unless I was prepared to change that proposal on the basis of good, sound, logical arguments to statutory regulations which would have the absolute force of law backing them, this Bill would have been deemed by Members to be fundamentally flawed in terms of their ability to interact with local government and local authorities throughout the country. I had no difficulty in accepting that point of view which was first made strongly by Senator Tuffy in some detail in the Seanad and also by Senator Bannon and Deputy Finneran and others in my party. I fully accepted that. I not alone then moved to change the specific part of the original Bill from guidelines to statutory regulations, I went substantially further than that, which surprised some people because I was not directly asked to do so by completely recasting section 3. I went into great detail in that section. One of the key elements that was brought into the Bill was the word &ldquo;access&rdquo;. It was an issue many Members said they wanted to see clearly spelt out in the Bill. I moved to bring <Col N="1150" /> that in and used that phraseology in the context of the Bill.</P>
      <P>I have covered all the points Deputy Allen laid out in his amendments in what I said on Second and Committee Stages and my intent is absolute in this regard. With regard to many of the issues, there is a fundamental uniqueness. The standard approach in countless Acts for many years allows for the relevant detail of an Act to be set out in regulations. However, section 3 does not use the usual formulation, namely, &ldquo;may make regulations&rdquo;, which is the normal standard procedure. I went substantially further by requiring that the Minister &ldquo;shall&rdquo;. There is a major difference between the two and I was commended by all Members for going that route, not only to make my views clear to Members of the Dáil or Seanad but also to make my approach in this regard explicit to local authority officials. The section requires that I shall include provisions for various matters and that local authorities shall conduct their dealings with Oireachtas Members in accordance with the regulations. That is fundamentally different from all legislation that deals with regulations. I went a long way beyond where one would normally be requested to go. I was not specifically asked to do this but I did it so that Members would be clear that I, as Minister, had no choice in this matter.</P>
      <P>I have an open mind and cannot decide on the issue of laying down timeframes. I have a concern in this regard in that they are usually dealt with by the perfunctory response to the effect that further information may follow. That is not what I want to happen nor, I am sure, is it what Members of either House want. There is an issue about what we mean and how the system is to be operated. Members have said that much of what is involved in this regard will depend on the interaction, relationship and trust that exists and local authorities gearing themselves up to deal properly and efficiently with this. Many Members have said that they have a very good relationship with local authorities and see no need for this measure. However, we cannot live in that era. We want to set out in detail how we will deal with this issue. As Members are aware, the regulations must be laid before both Houses&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;and I have no doubt they will take a view on that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have covered all the issues Deputy Allen has raised. I have stated my case even down to the point of dealing with planning applications. I have said on record that the regulations will cover Oireachtas Members in carrying out their general representational role and will require that notice of meetings, agendas, minutes, annual reports &ndash; I went further and made it explicit that the annual reports would not only have to be made available but sent to each Member in their local area &ndash; accounts, corporate plans and other documentation are supplied to Oireachtas Members, <Col N="1151" /> with planning lists. I have been more than clear and fair in removing the possibility of get-out clauses for me by the manner in which I have constructed section 3. This has largely satisfied all Members on both sides in terms of the procedures and my intent because I have gone so far on record in setting out the content of the regulations. I have covered much of the broad thrust of this by recasting section 3.</P>
    <P>The law allows members of the public or Oireachtas Members to attend local authority meetings, but I will consider what Deputy Joe Higgins said. Perhaps it should be explicit in the regulations that Members of the Oireachtas can, as a matter of course and right, attend local authority meetings. I do not have a difficulty with examining that as an addition. This is part of the reason I have not published this as we have gone along. I have wanted to take on board ideas as they have come forward throughout the debate. I have confirmed at every point the position I will adopt.</P>
    <P>By and large, the same arrangements that apply to councillors will also operate for Oireachtas Members. I cannot be more explicit than that. It is more than fair and upfront and I have removed much of the concern and sting by being very open in responding to Members in the Government parties and the Opposition. Deputy Allen's amendments are commendable and may be discussed when I draft the regulations. I have an open mind on these timeframes. I can look on them in one way and be positive or in another and be unsure about them. I would prefer if they were not in place because we might then put a better system into operation. I am not wedded to it in any specific way.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BernardAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to put on record the reasons my party opposes the Bill. They are: the question mark about constitutionality, the U-turn on directly elected mayors, the regulations under discussion, the right of Deputies to submit parliamentary questions and Senators to raise issues on local authority matters, and the broader question of local government reform. This Bill is a set of stand-alone proposals which ignore the need for local government reform.</P>
      <P>I find myself in difficulty. I came to the House having decided to call a vote on all these amendments and contest the issues, but I am almost convinced to have faith in the Minister and his sincerity in this regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On amendments Nos. 9 to 11, inclusive, which were deemed out of order because they are matters for the House, will the Minister and his party facilitate and support any moves by the House to incorporate the substance of these amendments in the Standing Orders of the House? They would make certain the right of Members of Dáil Éireann to submit parliamentary questions on issues related to local authority matters and to raise similar issues on the Adjournment and the right of Members of Seanad Éireann to raise simi<Col N="1152" /> lar issues in that Chamber. If we could co-operate on putting these proposals in place, perhaps we could have faith in respect of the other amendments. I believe the Minister is sincere in what he says.</P>
    <P>Regarding the empty Government benches, someone must have pacified the self-appointed shop stewards in Fianna Fáil who are regularly on the plinth raising issues about all legislation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept the Minister's bona fides and that when he puts something on record in the House, he intends to carry it through. However, it is remarkable that no one from the Government side who, we are led to believe, expressed views at parliamentary party meetings and publicly, and for two or three years fought a war of attrition on this issue, has presented for Report Stage, the final opportunity for Members exercised about this issue to say something about it, make a stand on it, protest or explain why they have been so concerned about it for the past two to three years. Deputy Allen raised the issue of the use of parliamentary questions on matters affecting local authorities. I take the view that any issue in a local authority which requires, or which is subject to, approval by the Minister or the Department, is a proper matter on which to table a parliamentary question. Issues of that kind should not be ruled out or order or should not be dismissed and the Minister should not state that he has no responsibility to the House for it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BernardAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister did that this week.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>That is something that I expect we will see increasingly asserted in the House in the new situation. Frankly, that might not necessarily be a bad thing for local government because if the end result is for the Custom House to leave to local government many of the things that it now insists on having every tittle-tattle approved by the Department, it might be a good thing in the long run. If the Department says it wants something approved then we can ask a question in the House about it. That is the rule.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraicMcCormack" hpid="Mr. McCormack Mr. McCormack">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCormack</NameTxt>
      <P>I too am heartened by the Minister's last contribution which I found convincing. I now understand and can grasp why there is no need for Government backbenchers to be here in the House because naturally enough if they were given the same assurances, and I am sure they were, as we are getting on the record of the House, I believe they would be satisfied.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I still have some concerns about the publication of the regulations. How long will it be until the regulations are published? The Minister spoke about minutes and agendas of meetings which I consider to be of lesser importance because they can always be obtained from a councillor, but there are statutory rights which councillors had built up by right or tradition. I accept that the Minister said that every right that is now available <Col N="1153" /> to a member of a local authority will continue to be available to a Member of the Oireachtas representing the area in the local authority when he or she is no longer a member of the local authority. If the Minister could finally satisfy me on that point, I would join with Deputy Allen in not pressing those amendments. In my opinion, the Minister has gone 95% of the way to convincing me and it would only take another 5% to convince me that he is serious about these rights. That will not stop me believing that it is a loss to the local authority not to have Oireachtas Members and it is a loss to the Oireachtas not to have members of local authorities.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister can finally satisfy me on amendment No. 13. To my cost I left a county council last election and I lost my rights in these matters. I continue to be a member of a city council but I lost my rights as regards the county council. Some county managers would be happy to see Oireachtas Members go from the councils because sometimes they think they know too much.</P>

      <P>I am brand new to politics. I may still be a little bit trusting on how things work and I never sat on a local authority. We have spoken a lot about how Oireachtas Members will be affected by not having access to local authorities. This may be an inappropriate question to the Minister. How does he think the performance of Oireachtas Members will improve when they are no longer sitting on the local authority and are not distracted by the work of the local authority? Will this improve the workings of this House? What is the basis of this Bill? I would like to hear his views.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ring</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to speak on the subject of correspondence from Members to local authority officials. According to the Ombudsman's report last week, the general public has lost faith in the Minister and in us. They believe they cannot get replies to queries and they are now depending on the Ombudsman. He said that the largest number of complaints concerned local authorities because of the way people were being treated regarding responses to queries.</P>
      <P>Will there now be better local government? There were a lot of jobs provided for the boys and girls. Will there be a specific official to deal with correspondence from Oireachtas Members? I have a copy of a letter I wrote in November to a local authority which was not replied to until February.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelRing" hpid="Mr. Ring Mr. Ring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ring</NameTxt>
      <P>I suppose I was lucky but it is not acceptable and I only received a reply because I asked about it two or three times. I expect to <Col N="1154" /> receive a detailed reply regarding the query that was made.</P>
      <P>The public are disillusioned by the manner in which they are treated by the public service. I am a member of the public service even though the Minister's officials may not think so. I am paid out of the same kitty and I do the same job on behalf of the people as they do. They must remember they do not have a God-given right to work for the local authority and can be protected by the system. They protect one another. I know that most public officials do an excellent job. They deal with people and their problems in a satisfactory manner. Some council officials think they are untouchable and they think they are protected by the system. I deal with them every day of the week and if they treat me like that, how do they treat the general public? That is why people are turning to the Ombudsman because they have lost faith in councillors, in Oireachtas Members and in the system.</P>
      <P>I compliment the Ombudsman who has recently retired. He was a civil servant and I was critical of his appointment because I believed that one civil servant would not deal with another. He was an excellent Ombudsman.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cuffe</NameTxt>
      <P>Much of the debate in regard to these amendments is focused on the issue of special treatment for Dáil Deputies in terms of the service they would receive from a local authority. Since the last time I spoke on this subject last week, I am delighted to report that I received a spanking draft development plan from Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council at no charge.

    <Speaker pid="CiaranCuffeGP" hpid="Mr. Cuffe Mr. Cuffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cuffe</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;of my concerns. I will look after that for Deputy McCormack or perhaps the Minister will. I am not convinced that this idea of a special consideration for Dáil Deputies is a good thing because any member of the public should receive a duty of care and a standard of service such as we would hope to receive. Given the pay increases within the local authority sector and the investment in the sector, I think any member of <Col N="1155" /> the public should receive a high quality of service and a detailed reply by e-mail or letter to correspondence. That is what we are looking for ourselves and it should extend to any member of the public. This morning I went out to the IPA to hear Professor Mark Landy from Boston College talk about local government, using the United States as an example. He was making the seminal point that good mayors make for good governments, and those mayors need to be given power. He made a strong point that directly elected good mayors have led to good city governments in many cities in the US, not just the big cities within the smaller states such as Cincinnati and Philadelphia. I will come back to that point later on my own amendment since dropping directly elected mayors is not a good thing.</P>
      <P>On the amendments before us, we should seek equality of care, equality of service and an improvement on what we now get. All members of the public should be entitled to this level of service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with Deputies Ring and McCormack. This is not just about servicing ourselves, which is a fundamental and important point. I expect customer care to be available to every member of the public in equal measure, as to us. I have been critical of some councillors and councils throughout the country on aspects of things that have not been dealt with. This House has made available enormous resources in terms of IT systems, management and so on to improve the functioning of local government. From all of that, I now want to see customer satisfaction beginning to emerge with regard to access to information, prompt replies and good replies for everyone, which is their right. If customers obtained this type of service there would be less need for people to approach councillors or TDs.</P>
      <P>In regard to matters pertaining to the Minister for the Environment and Local Government, the post I happen to currently hold, I answer a huge number of questions each day, either by way of the written or oral questions procedure. This will obviously continue in place. I am frustrated at times when some questions are disallowed, but these are the rules of the House. It would suit me on many occasions to take these questions. If this brings about a review in the context of the Members I would be quite happy about it.</P>
      <P>I would say to Deputy McCormack that obviously councillors as a body have statutory rights, as have we, in terms organising work programmes and so on. Obviously, as Members of this House, we will not give ourselves superior statutory rights on certain issues over councillors. That would not be tenable. As I said earlier, in terms of the generality of arrangements in terms of information and so on, I expect similar provisions to be put in place. I will not just request local authorities to do this, I will set it down by way of regulation to ensure it will happen.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Morgan</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 14:</P>
      <P>In page 4, between lines 33 and 34, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;4. &ndash; Sections 217 to 220 of the Principal Act are repealed.&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister is playing big brother in this section, or perhaps much worse, whereby any Minister for the Environment, not just this Minister, can stand over the local authority with a big stick and if councillors do not adopt the estimates he or she can abolish the local authority. We must see how this relates to the issue of local democracy. As we are cranking up for local government elections next year, prospective candidates are asking what will be their functions. I must say truthfully that part of their function will be to sit around a table, like mice, and nod &ldquo;yes&rdquo; to the county manager. The effect of nodding &ldquo;no&rdquo; to the county manager will be that he or she will simply go ahead and do the job in any event, the councillor will be ruled out of order and the various estimates or plans will be implemented. The county managers will simply walk over one and steamroll one aside. This is coming from a Government which told us we would see more democracy at local government level. It said it would empower local authorities, local authorities would now be paid and they would all do a wonderful job. Unfortunately, they will not have anything to do because unless they do exactly what the Government says, <Col N="1157" /> the county managers will overrule them. What is the point in a democratic process or local electoral process? Why have such a charade?</P>
    <P>I was pleased to have the opportunity to move the amendment and to have the issue debated. While it has been touched upon in other debates, it has not been dealt with in the proper fashion. It is grossly unfair for the Minister for the Environment and Local Government to make threats in this way. It is a threat to local authority members that if they do not do business exactly as the Department wants, it will be curtains. Is that empowering or disempowering local government? We know what it is all about. Local authorities are being lined up for the introduction of a finance plan which will replace the rates that were discontinued in 1977. What we are about to see is the introduction of service charges, which is where this part of the Act will be of significance. That is why it is so important to debate the issue in the context of this Bill. It gives us a chance to open the door on this subject. It will almost certainly mean the introduction of service charges sooner rather than later. What will be the consequences of this?</P>
    <P>When rates were abolished there was a massive increase in VAT and a whole range of other taxes. Gradually services were withdrawn and the refuse collection service was privatised in virtually all local authorities. Now we have the prospect of water services being privatised. Increasing privatisation is dismantling the public service element of local government. If this amendment is passed, it will end the big stick the Minister holds over local authorities. It would mean that if members moved and agreed estimates, the estimates would have to be accepted. If that were the case, would it be democracy? If the Minister or the Department does not like it, the people will hold the councillors to account. It is up to the public to do that. That is the name of the game in electoral politics, as I have been told since the mid-1970s. Let us have a bit of it from the institutions here.</P>
    <P>Look at the shenanigans that took place last year with the Waste Management (Amendment) Act. Four of the seven waste management areas refused to adopt their plans because they included incinerators. We talked earlier about Sellafield but we are going to build our own mini Sellafields with the incinerators.</P>

      <P>Unfortunately, as I pointed out earlier on Question Time, they are being penalised and charged for recycling instead of rewarded. I accept there is a cost involved.</P>
      <P>However, I will leave that issue aside and concentrate on the local government legislation and trying to get a little local democracy back for the people who bother to put themselves up for election, familiarise themselves with the issues and do the best they can to represent the people who elected them. They do not want to be sheep who go in to put up their hoofs for whatever the county manager nods to them. Local councillors next year will, hopefully, have some backbone but they need the co-operation of the Minister and the Government to facilitate that. They need the power and the responsibility to which they are entitled. They will take it on and implement it successfully if given the chance. I hope Deputies will support the amendment and that the Minister will accept it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PadraicMcCormack" hpid="Mr. McCormack Mr. McCormack">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCormack</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the amendment. This amendment is different from most of the previous amendments. It seeks to protect and strengthen the rights of local authority members, regardless of whether they are Members of the Oireachtas. It is not an amendment about strengthening the rights of Oireachtas Members when they are no longer members of local authorities but seeks to strengthen the local authority member. That is commendable, even though we oppose the concept of removing Members of the Oireachtas from local authorities or local authority members from the Oireachtas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There should be support for an amendment which strengthens the rights of local authority members. The rights of local authority members have been seriously eroded over the last number of years. Last year responsibility for the adoption of waste management plans was taken from the elected members and given to managers. This was done because waste management plans were not <Col N="1159" /> adopted in some regions. However, it was also done in areas where waste management plans were adopted by the elected members. Galway City Council adopted the waste management plan and did so with certain far reaching commitments. These have fallen back somewhat since the adoption of the Connacht waste management plan by the manager.</P>
    <P>Refuse in Galway was being separated in ten or 12 ways but now it is only being separated in six or seven ways. That is a backward step. There are various reasons for it and one of them is, I fear, that an incinerator on the outskirts of Galway city is now part of the waste management plan and there is not the same initiative anymore. People know that the local authority members have no right to adopt a waste management plan, irrespective of the support for or opposition to matters such as incineration. In that case it was opposition. That right was taken from the elected members.</P>
    <P>The rights of elected members are further eroded in this Bill with regard to striking service charges. That right is to be given to the manager. That is a backward step for the authority and rights of local authority members. It does not matter whether those local authority members are no longer Members of the Oireachtas or <i>vice versa.</i> They will still be local authority members who have to carry out their duties in every area. Even though we will no longer be members of local authorities, we should protect those rights. Ten or 15 years hence, when this Chamber is filled with people who are no longer members of local authorities and most of whom will never have been members of local authorities, I doubt that the desire to protect the rights of local authority members will be as strong. However, as long as we are here and have experience as members of local authorities, we should fight in every way, and this amendment is one such way, to protect the rights of local authority members. Those rights should be protected.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeHiggins" hpid="Mr. J. Higgins Mr. J. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister will probably say that this amendment is out of kilter with the rest of the Bill. In fact, it is as valid as anything else in the Bill. It calls the Minister's bluff. He has referred to this Bill as a significant reform and improvement of local government, a claim that is not sustained by the facts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The unfortunate record of the Minister's predecessor and of this Minister is that they have significantly damaged local democracy. If some of the legislation this Minister intends to bring before the Dáil is passed, he will have presided over one of the most serious attacks on local democracy for a long time. It is an attack which, when the time comes to debate it, will be strongly resisted both inside and outside the Dáil. The sections of the principal Act which are referred to here deal largely with the power proposed in the legislation for commissioners to run local authorities in substitution for members who are <Col N="1160" /> disqualified by a Minister for the Environment and Local Government because they have not fulfilled a number of conditions set down by Minister.</P>
    <P>I agree with removing the power of commissioners from the legislation. It is the provision of an unelected dictatorship at local level to replace elected local members. That legislation is designed to ride roughshod over local democracy so that the writ of the Minister for Finance and the Government runs in local authorities, despite the reservations and the objections of those who were elected at local level. We have seen this Minister's predecessor threaten local authorities, for example, when they were not willing, or at least not up to a late hour, to adopt significant increases in waste management charges. At some stage this Minister, or his successor, will introduce legislation for more local service charges and local taxes of various kinds, perhaps to try to bring back water charges. The provision that is proposed to be deleted is a guard against that and against the removal of the democratic mandate from locally elected persons after which the local community is subjected to unelected appointees of the Minister.</P>
    <P>The Minister claimed that this was a significant reform of the Local Government Bill. If we were entitled to range widely on the issues that we say should come under its ambit then perhaps it would live up to the Minister's claim. The main debate will have to wait for another day when the Minister for the Environment and Local Government comes with his draconian proposals to reduce further the local democratic rights of those elected to the local authorities, and to increase dramatically the power of an unelected manager.</P>
    <P>That is not local government reform. That is why I am unconvinced by the claims the Minister is making for this Bill which he alleges is to strengthen local authorities. He cannot have it both ways. He cannot argue that the Local Government Bill 2003 will lay the foundation for significantly improving local democracy and, on the other hand, come here in a few weeks with other legislation which attacks local democracy. That will remove responsibility for waste management at all levels from elected members and give it to an unelected manager with the right to raise any level of refuse tax which he or she wants to raise.</P>
    <P>The Minister cannot have it both ways and perhaps he will take the opportunity, which would be in order, to try and square that circle for us because I am puzzled as to how he can make both claims simultaneously. When he does come with his further legislation there will be more time on Second and other Stages to tease out his thinking, and that of the Government, if there is thinking behind it, in greater detail. As the issue has been raised in this amendment and because of the claims the Minister has made and how they contradict what he will be proposing in a few weeks, <Col N="1161" /> he might give us an initial résumé of his justification on this occasion.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to support Deputy Morgan's amendment. It is a pity that it was not tabled on Committee Stage because there are details in it that could usefully have been teased through on that Stage.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ArthurMorganSF" hpid="Mr. Morgan Mr. Morgan">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept that correction although there are ways around that problem with substitution arrangements and so on.</P>
      <P>The position regarding section 217 of the Local Government Act which provides for the holding of replacement elections is in a somewhat different league to the appointment of a commissioner but that is an issue of detail. The issue of principle which the amendment addresses is one with which I agree. Under this Government we are seeing local government, as it is understood everywhere else, being replaced gradually by a system of local administration with direct rule as far as policy is concerned from the Department of the Environment and Local Government.</P>
      <P>Whole areas which were previously the subject of policy making by members of local authorities have changed. Responsibility for roads has gone to the National Roads Authority. I recall as a member of the old Dublin County Council the debate over several meetings about the Westlink bridge and the toll scheme. That was once a decision to be made by a local authority but that is no longer the case. The Minister has plans up his sleeve to toll several roads around the country, none of which will be decided by members of the local authority. They will be decided somewhere else. Similarly, on the design of roads, there was a time when these issues were decided by members of local authorities. Now the design is subject to environmental impact study whereby a crowd of consultants or experts come in and write up a big book and a set of maps and nobody dares question it after that. It is signed off and nobody can ever change it.</P>
      <P>The environmental impact study process as we have it here is denying the public the right to participate in the process in a meaningful sense. There is a mock public consultation process which is more process than product and which is designed to give the impression that there is some kind of public consultation, when it is really an exercise in which the public is ignored. We see all of that taking place. In theory local authorities can make policy and that is becoming a joke. Dublin City Council, for example, can decide on a policy that Dublin city be a nuclear free zone but if somebody comes along now and proposes to build an incinerator in Ringsend the council has no say in that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The adoption of a county development plan was once the preserve of members of a local authority. The county manager of the local authority <Col N="1162" /> of which up to last Monday I was a member, has interpreted the new Planning and Development Act as meaning that the members of the council have now to comply lock, stock and barrel with strategic planning guidelines and all the documents emanating from the Department of the Environment and Local Government. If that interpretation stands up, and I have my doubts, it leaves little or no discretion in the adoption of a county development plan.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelRing" hpid="Mr. Ring Mr. Ring">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>Local authorities could also adopt the estimates. Now under the Bill that will come before us shortly we will have a situation whereby the county managers will decide what the level of charge is to be and the members of the local authority will have no option but to roll over and agree to it and if they do not they will be abolished and replaced by a commissioner. So the limited degree of local government and local democratic decision making which once existed in the local government system is now gradually being eliminated and replaced by a system of local administration. That is not local government, and the arrangement whereby the Minister can abolish a council and replace it with commissioners is highly undemocratic. It is probably unconstitutional now, given the provision which the people voted for and which the last Government promoted. Sooner or later that will be tested.</P>
      <P>I understand the thrust of Deputy Morgan's amendment to be that he wants to remove the right of the Minister to abolish a council and replace it with a commissioner. I support that amendment. I argued for that when the Local Government Bill, which is now the principal Act was being debated in the House and therefore I support the amendment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BernardAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>Time is running out and there are several other amendments to be taken.</P>
      <P>I have been a member of a local authority since 1979, with a short period out of office when I spent a little time in the Department of the Environment and the Department of Education. My family was also in local government. My grandfather was a member of the first republican corporation in Cork city and I am proud that his name was on the ballot paper with McSweeney and McCurtain during the black-and-tan era. His name was up front because the list was alphabetical in Cork City Hall.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I feel sorry about leaving local government and that I am effectively being forced out. I also feel sorry that we are reaching a time when, I sincerely believe, local authorities are losing many of their powers. Deputy Gilmore has outlined many of the powers that have been taken from elected members and I will not repeat them. However, there is a definite move to direct rule. Unfortunately we have direct rule in Northern Ireland. In many matters we will almost have <Col N="1163" /> direct rule from the Custom House. Communication will be between the Custom House and the manager, and the latter will make the decisions regarding waste management and refuse charges. The Minister has clearly signalled that refuse charges will now be by weight and that the manager will be in a position to recoup the deficit in his annual allocation by screwing the ratepayer, whether domestic or commercial.</P>
    <P>Let us face it, the days of the rates have returned. We are back now to the state of affairs before 1977, and it is ironic that Fianna Fáil, which abolished the rates in that year to get into government, are now moving towards the reintroduction of rates at a time when they have an equally big majority. The Minister clearly flagged last week, when he announced the grants for water conservation, that he will give local authority managers their heads regarding water charges. I presume he will now introduce metering.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="BernardAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>I am almost certain that the commission examining the funding of local authorities will introduce the question of metering and water charges. Effectively it is direct rule from the Minister through his civil servants to the manager. I am hearing, not from my own council, but from councils around the country, that managers are ignoring elected members. In some cases they are becoming intolerant of them.</P>
      <P>That has a knock-on effect on the public. People currently entering local politics are not doing so for its own sake. They see it as a stepping stone to Dáil Éireann &ndash; that is the reason many of them enter councils. Many good people are getting out because they cannot see any future, given the way things are going. Powers are now being eroded almost monthly. It is a sad thing to say, having spent so much time in local government, but I am leaving when local authorities are at their lowest ebb. The Minister's moves are increasing the influence and powers of the manager and reducing the powers of elected members.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelRing" hpid="Mr. Ring Mr. Ring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ring</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not wish to hold up the debate regarding local authority funding. Over the years people entered local government in this country as I did. I thought that I could change the world, but it did not work. Over the years we have given the powers to county managers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Perhaps the Minister will confirm to us whether he has plans to change the County Management Act 1940. The time has come for us to devolve the government of this country to give members of local authorities some power. Next year we will have local elections, and with the way people cur<Col N="1164" /> rently feel regarding politics, politicians and local government, I doubt that 30% of them will go out to vote. They are disillusioned regarding planning because the councils say that they have no authority over or input into it. Now the Minister is to bring to the Dáil the Local Government Bill 2003 dealing with waste management and giving managers more powers to determine charges. The same will be done with water. It was a great honour to be elected to this House, but now I cannot pretend that I am not disillusioned with what goes on here. I am sick and tired of it.</P>
    <P>We are being regulated now from Europe. Europe is regulating the Dáil, and the Dáil is regulating local government. In this country we are being over-regulated and the people have no say. They are angry with the planning laws and the way local authorities are increasing charges. They simply cannot take any more. People will react very shortly. They will not come out to vote or take part in the political process because they are disillusioned.</P>
    <P>The Minister is a member of a local authority and I have been in local government since 1979. I ask him whether he has ever in his life heard a county manager or finance officer say, during the estimates process, that the council would live within its budget for the year and would not need to increase some programme or other, be it on roads, housing or whatever. Why is it that every year they must spend more than they get? Has he ever heard the manager of a local authority say that the council had done well in the year concerned and kept within budget, and outline what was needed for the next year? They have to increase spending all the time to get more and more. No matter what budget one gives them, they will overspend.</P>
    <P>We have now entered a modern situation. Could we get a proper Book of Estimates at Estimates time that lets us see where the revenue came from, where it was spent and what is happening? I brought the Book of Estimates to an accountant last year and asked him to examine it. He told me that it was the greatest riddle he had ever seen, and he has a large business and deals with many people. He said that if he were at the tax office with that kind of Estimates book, he would be thrown out the door. He said that it was all doublespeak. He could see where the council had received money from central Government, what it had spent the previous year and what it proposed to spend the next year, but a great deal is being hidden in the Book of Estimates. Why is it not released to the public in a very simple form, explaining what the council needs and on what and how it is spending its money?</P>
    <P>Regarding the amendment before us, I do not believe that a local authority that does not set a rate should be abolished. The only people that can abolish a local authority are the voters. No commissioner should ever be sent in to run a local authority. Every local authority in the country had the opportunity to set a rate for refuse charges. Up to this year, every other place apart <Col N="1165" /> from the capital was paying its refuse charges. As an elected public representative, I tried to tell my constituents that if they wanted services, they would have to pay for them. Yet the first thing they threw back at me was the position in Dublin, where half the population live and where people do not have to pay charges. It is a matter for the local authority itself. If Dublin Corporation could do without the revenue, that is fine, but we could not do without it in Mayo.</P>
    <P>The Minister takes powers as Europe has taken powers from this House. I do not believe in what the Convention on the Future of Europe is currently discussing &ndash; a European constitution. We should get rid of Europe and start again because it has taken too much power from this House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelRing" hpid="Mr. Ring Mr. Ring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ring</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps we could do with the money. However, we have given those in Europe too much power, and people are angry about that too &ndash; some good regulations have come from Europe, but so have some very bad ones. The Minister is doing the same by taking away powers from representatives on local councils. Many of them are nothing but talking shops of yes-men and yes-women for the managers, and that is not good for democracy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
      <P>The debate is very interesting. I will try to deal with the amendment first. A whole range of issues has been raised beyond its scope, but I accept their importance. The effect of the amendment as tabled by Deputy Morgan concerns only certain parts, and that is related to a point Deputy Gilmore raised, about which he was correct. The effect of certain sections of Part 21 of the Local Government Act 2001 is to enable the Minister to remove the council but with no option for a new election to be held following such removal until the next local elections, even if the removal takes place in the first year of the council's term.</P>
      <P>I know from Committee Stage that the Deputy indicated he would be tabling an amendment to repeal Part 21, presumably in its entirety. I will deal with it on that basis. I believe the current system is fair and that election brings responsibility. Part 21 of the principal Act continues existing law which has been in place since 1941. These provisions enable a Minister to remove members from office but only in extreme circumstances where they have failed to perform certain statutory duties essential to the proper functioning of local government. The important point is that in over half a century only four local authorities have been removed and only one, Naas UDC, has been removed in the past 25 years. Given the way this issue is being presented by Members one would think councils were being removed on an annual basis.</P>

      <P>It is a matter for the councils whether they want to do their duty. We all have statutory functions to perform, including in this House. Local authorities are the same. The 2001 Act continues existing law and sets out the circumstances of removal from office. I considered Deputy Howlin, Deputy Gilmore's colleague, to be a very good Minister for the Environment when he had that portfolio in partnership with Fine Gael and brought in certain reforms. This was not a burning issue for either Fine Gael or the Labour Party then. I do not mean that in any negative way, but merely make the point.</P>

      <P>I do not believe Part 21 poses a threat to democracy. It is not being abused and it certainly has not been abused. It is a necessary part of the overall system of checks and balances. One of the issues raised by two Deputies who have left the Chamber but who may be back is that sometimes at local level we are the authors of our own problems. I was part of the local government system for a number of years in the early 1990s. I did not like a book of estimates produced by the county manager and wrote my own, line by line and page by page. I put it together, got it printed and arrived at the meeting with 27 copies, one for each of the officials and one for each of the elected members, to the absolute consternation of the manager and his officials. I circulated the copies and had the issue discussed. I did not get everything I wanted, but it changed the estimates process from then on. It took me a lot of time and effort to do it. I might have been wrong in some of the assumptions I made, but I was not wrong in everything I said. I equally challenged much of what the managers had set out in the estimates that year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeHiggins" hpid="Mr. J. Higgins Mr. J. Higgins">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
      <P>No. There was a community development fund, a very small element, which was very much supported by everybody. However, that is not the point. I make the broad point that there are mechanisms open to Deputies who are councillors to take a very active role in the estimates process. One aspect is not working. The corporate policy group, which is composed of the Chairs of the SPCs, must be consulted by the manager in the preparation of the draft budget. This is the law at the moment. I do not know of any council in the country that is actually exercising this power. The CPG may call in outside independent experts to assist and advise on this matter, but I do not know of any councils that have decided to do this. Perhaps they are not aware that this power exists and that the situation was changed in recent Acts. Elected members must use the tools which are available to them to exercise their role. That is the only <Col N="1167" /> way elected members can take ownership of the process. These powers are available to members, but they are not exercising them. That is partly because many council members spend too much time here and are unable to deal with issues on a weekly basis and attend SPC meetings and so on. Perhaps it is easier for Dublin members. I know it is not easy for members from other parts of the country but the result is that we are not taking ownership of the process.</P>
      <P>There are many faults in the system. Issues have been raised by Members on which I would agree with their views. However, there is a presumption among many councillors that somebody else will do their job for them. Doing the job of politics, as most Members in this House know, is very demanding. People either get stuck into it, get to understand it and try to do something about the issues or they do not. Local councillors have seen this situation begin to improve dramatically in recent years and I hope to see it improve ultimately with full-time positions in the years ahead. That is the type of effort that will be required. I can set out various powers in law or regulations, but there is not much point if people do not exercise them. There are already substantial powers in the estimates process available to councillors which they simply do not exercise, and because they are not exercising these powers, they are not taking ownership of the whole estimate process.</P>
      <P>The issue raised by many Deputies with regard to waste management is important but what nobody in the House has said is that for ten years, 20 years in effect because it started in the 1980s, local councillors have not grasped the nettle on the issue of waste.</P>

      <P>If they had we would not be in the crisis in which we find ourselves today. Waste collection was never an ideological issue, an argument which Deputy Higgins still makes, with which I disagree. It should not involve an ideological argument about whether a private company or a public company does it. The issue should be best value for the people we represent. What we now have is a tremendous mix of local public and private involvement in this process. The real issue is efficiency, cost effectiveness, management of resources and best value for money for taxpayers, the people we represent. I do not hold, even though I often get painted into the corner, with the idea of this being either right wing or left wing. These are not modern ideas &ndash; they are antiquated expressions. What we really need is to find the best way of doing business for the benefit of the taxpayers and of using the resources they give us over a whole range of areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Gilmore raised the question of the primacy of local authorities in relation to roads, an <Col N="1168" /> issue to which I will return. He is right in what he says, but he is presenting it in the wrong way. Local authorities had primacy within a small local authority area in the past. However, the world has changed. The Deputy cannot be seriously suggesting that major infrastructural projects which are for the benefit of the country should be undertaken bit by bit with every local authority involved in the planning process. We would be forever in a planning process and forever trying to get it done.</P>

I do not believe there is a move in this House or among political parties to break this up, with the result that we would get bad value for money and very difficult processes all out of kilter and out of sequence with each other. We could not do that and expect to be able to meet national requirements for major infrastructure.</P>

There is no question about that. Councillors can still deal with the totality of the issue in the estimates. If they do not accept what is being put forward they do not have to pass an estimate. I have also outlined that the chairs of the SPCs form the corporate policy group with which the manager is obliged to consult in advance of the estimates and it is open to the members to bring independent outside experts in going through the process. There are substantial levers of power, far more than in the past.</P>
      <P>I do not propose to remove the provision that is there at present. There is the possibility that if we get the sort of reform that should take place in local government it will raise issues of local government functioning and perhaps, in a much stronger reform package, we could begin to examine the issue of not being part of central Government. That does not mean that a local authority or we in this Chamber, or any Government, can act completely irresponsibly and decide, if we do not like the figures in front of us, not to pass anything. Nobody can operate on that basis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are statutory and public obligations within which one must operate as an elected representative in terms maximising the use of available resources. There has been no occasion that <Col N="1169" /> I recall where I would not have liked more resources to do more. As Minister, of course I would like to have more resources to do more. The resources are finite and the sources for getting them are not unlimited. I would remind Deputy Higgins, and I made this clear umpteen times, that I did not present this Bill as a major reform package of local government. I went out of my way to say the opposite. What I said was that it is a fundamental principle in the context of reform. It is only one issue but is an important one and it allows the possibility of going a good deal further in the context of the reform of local government and, perhaps, the reform of this House in regard to the way we sit and order our business.</P>

If that is the case, and with all the committees sitting, it will not be possible for the Deputy or anybody else to function fully and to the best of his ability here and operate fully in a local government structure also. Do those Members who have spoken, and who over the last two or three years have been involved in the estimates process, know the regulations and the law existed to allow them to do all of this?</P>

    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a matter for their professions to deal with. I have seen a change in the House since I was first came here. There was a time when many Members ran an outside occu<Col N="1170" /> pation in a fulsome way but that has largely disappeared.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the reason I want to move to make local government a full-time occupation. Local government should be a full-time occupation for those involved in it. The demands on the local government system and the development potential of local government is clear for all to see. It is a question of whether we want to take on the challenges. During this debate Members have consistently spoken about the rights of Members. I accept that, but with rights come responsibilities. Getting rights does not mean there are soft options with regard to the issues and the challenges which have to be faced. Resources have to be found to give the public what it wants in terms of services and quality of services. Those resources are not unlimited. We cannot spend all the resources in one area, as some Members pretend when they speak about a particular issue and call for more resources. Yet they ignore the fact that we have a population of less than four million. In excess of l.7 million people are working which is a remarkable achievement. Collectively, we can generate only so much income in the State and we have to try to maximise those areas to the best of our ability and use those resources to maximise the value to the public we serve.</P>
      <P>The other point that has been raised, and people continue to ignore it, is that the polluter pays principle underpins all EU legislation and for the most part Irish legislation in terms of how we deal with waste and other issues.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ArthurMorganSF" hpid="Mr. Morgan Mr. Morgan">

    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish I had the quote in front of me because Deputy Gilmore will be interested in the committee which recently investigated water quality here and which is chaired by the president of his party, Proinsias De Rossa, MEP. He stated that one of the biggest contributing factors to poor water quality here is that we do not charge for water. This was stated by no less a figure than Proinsias De Rossa, president of the Labour Party, in the past few weeks. He was wearing a European hat when he said that but it is a legitimate and honest assessment of one aspect of it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is taking liberties with what he said.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not, I had it here earlier in another context but I did not get to it. I will not be unfair to him as he is probably opposed to it, but he did make the point. He is chair of the committee that made that point. These are issues with which we have to deal. If something does not have a cost we tend not to regard it with any great merit, yet every Deputy knows we are spending billions of taxpayers' money on issues <Col N="1171" /> such as water quality, sewage treatment plants and so on which are important. We have to understand they are precious commodities and we have to manage them extremely well. We cannot fritter them away because the cost of producing them is enormous. There has to be a fair assessment of the issues. I hope that what I am now instigating across the spectrum over the next 12 months will bring all those issues to the fore. I do not know what the outcome will be and I am not predicting anything. One thing I do know, because every Deputy and Senator has said it to me, is that there are not enough resources available to local government. Everybody wants more. That is fair enough and I have no problem with that. I do not think any Member is saying we should reduce the health budget, the education budget or the social welfare budget. Nobody suggested that as a course of action to put more money into local government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>Reduce the tax breaks and the tax shelters.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
      <P>We have largely done that, as the Deputy well knows. They have almost disappeared. We would rather people invested here than taking their resources and investing them elsewhere, as is legitimate in any international economy. To do that, the same as other economies, one has to incentivise to try to get people to get results, to get jobs and to get investment in order to raise the whole economy here. We have done that successfully, particularly during the past decades through various Governments. This Government, more than any, took the view of reducing taxation at a personal level to recreate an enterprise culture more than ever.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
      <P>There are legitimate demands from the public for higher quality.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
      <P>That is contradicting the Deputy's position because the Deputy, legitimately, like every other Member and the other parties in this House, has gone abroad to look at local government structures. They have continually come back and asked why we cannot have the type of local government that exists in other countries and Olympic swimming pools in our villages and all the other wonderful facilities. That is fine. We will come to another argument on directly elected mayors later.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BernardAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>We will not.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
      <P>Members forget that the level of local taxation throughout the European Continent, and largely throughout the world, certainly <Col N="1172" /> the western world, is substantial. It is seen by the people in those countries as the best value for money rather than all the taxation going to the central fund. They prefer to see some elements of their funding going directly to the local government system where they have direct access and can see real value on the streets and pavements and the facilities in their communities for the money they have spent. I happen to subscribe to that view.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ArthurMorganSF" hpid="Mr. Morgan Mr. Morgan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morgan</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister think all this tax reduction that he continues to boast about is wrong? He cannot have it both ways.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
      <P>No, because that is at a national level which generates the economy and jobs. We had an artificially high cost both from an employer's and an employee's point of view in the 1980s which culminated in bankruptcy with 18% unemployment. We have reversed that in less than ten years. Of all the percentage reductions in income tax, only 1% was introduced when Fine Gael and Labour were in Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not the full picture.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
      <P>I would not negate the fact that the Deputy's party was involved in the process, but I disagree with his analysis.</P>
      <P>I have tried to deal with the issues raised by the amendment, although it is largely a red herring in terms of this debate. In the 50 years that this mechanism has been available to Ministers for the Environment, a Minister has intervened in such a manner on only four occasions and it has happened only once in the last 25 years, in connection with Naas UDC. As matters are presently constituted, the system is fair. If we get the kind of reform I wish to see, which I hope Members on the other side of the House will support, these issues may re-emerge because I strongly believe in the primacy of local government.</P>
      <P>However, I will not accept that those involved in the local government process will not accept their responsibilities. There is no easy get-out clause. If public life was easy there would be no point in having public representatives at local or national level. Public representatives have enormous responsibilities at local level and they should exercise them.</P>
      <P>On the question of planning, Members demanded that the national spatial strategy be published. I delivered on that in the first few months of taking office.</P>

      <P>I am trying to respond in a fair manner to the ten to 15 Deputies who spoke to this amendment, lest I be accused of ignoring any of the issues raised.

      <P>The Minister said the regions are debating the national spatial strategy, but the House has never debated it. The Minister never introduced it to the House to allow for a cross-party debate and scrutiny. The Private Members' debate this evening deals with the decentralisation aspect of it, but it is incredible that there has been no debate on the overall strategy. Will the Minister allow Government time for a proper debate, especially as it has been so often referred to in the context of local government?</P>

      <P>Unfortunately, the Minister appears to be rejecting the amendment, thereby giving up the opportunity to introduce real democracy to local government. It appears he does not wish to curtail the autocratic powers of county managers, nor does he wish to give local communities some democracy and control over their affairs.</P>
      <P>I call the Minister's bluff on the question of local democracy. If he does not accept the amendment and allow local authorities to have some say and democracy, his words on empowering local democracy will count for nothing. With rights come responsibilities. Local authorities should be given responsibilities. If they do not measure up their peers can judge them. Why should the Minister lord over them by imposing direct rule? We have seen enough direct rule in one section of this country and we do not need it in this State.</P>

      <Col N="1175" />The threatening hold of the Minister and his Department over local authorities is unfair.

I have seen members of the Minister's party quake in fear that their power and privileges at local level might be removed if they did not support draconian increases in charges, for example, the refuse tax. The Minister has a crisis with waste management because the Government is not serious about introducing a real waste management proposal. I look forward to the debate on this aspect when we consider the mis-named Protection of the Environment Bill. The Minister is not serious about waste when it is possible to find in any supermarket a doughnut placed on a foam tray and wrapped in plastic. That is allowed by legislation.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>In page 4, line 31, after &ldquo;state&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;concerned&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I welcome the Minister to the House to consider this important legislation. Perhaps when the Minister responds to my amendment, he might give us an indication of where we are at with it because the Bill was published in 2000, yet it has taken until now for it to reach this stage. The Bill is part of the arrangements to give effect to the action plan on organised crime which was agreed in Amsterdam in 1997, some six years ago. The date for ratification was extended to 2001, yet according to the informative memo the Minister gave us, only Austria and Germany have ratified it so far. Has the agreement been ratified by any other states? Obviously, Ireland has not yet ratified it and it is important we do so before our Presidency of the EU begins next year. It seems a pity that an organised crime plan, which seeks the support of all member states, introduced and agreed in 1997, should still be waiting to be passed through the Oireachtas. It does not seem like there is much interest in having this ratified in other EU states since only two have done so to date.</P>
      <P>This legislation is important because it deals with the trafficking of drugs on the high seas and into our territorial waters. That is a crime under our legislation but what was not dealt with was how the issue could be processed and whether the matter is dealt with in the flag or registration country of the ship or in the country where the offender resided. This legislation provides that the first preferential step could be taken by the country in which the ship resides.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 4, subsection (1) will state that the mas<Col N="1179" /> ter of the vessel &ldquo;shall be entitled to communicate with the authorities of the convention state concerned and the owner or operator of the vessel for the purpose of notifying them that the vessel has been boarded.&rdquo;  It is a technical amendment with the intention of making the section more specific. It is a little inelegant as it stands; this amendment would sharpen the intention of the section, making it clearer that it is the particular state to which we are referring.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. McDowell Mr. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. McDowell)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am grateful to the Deputy for the spirit in which he is approaching this matter. I intend to accept this amendment and I ask the House to do so as well. The Deputy asked about the present state of play in relation to this agreement. Austria signed the agreement on 14 December 2000 and ratified it on the same date. Cyprus signed it in 1997 and ratified it on 19 January 2000. Germany signed it in 1998 and ratified it in 1998 and it has already entered into force. Hungary signed it in July of last year and it came into force on 1 November 2002 &ndash; I notice that Hungary has a major maritime interest. Italy and Latvia have signed it. Lithuania has signed and ratified it. Norway has signed and ratified it. Romania has signed and ratified it. Slovakia and Slovenia have signed and ratified it; Sweden and the UK have signed it.</P>
      <P>I agree with the implication of the Deputy's question that progress has been slow on the signature, ratification and implementation of this measure. Although it may appear from the rate of progress that we are somewhat slow ourselves, we are certainly by no means unique in the time we have taken to implement the agreement. That means, effectively, that two member states of the EU have ratified it so far. We are likely to be the third. The Vienna organised crime plan has further advanced and perhaps overtaken it, with the Tampere Council conclusions, but now that we have got this far we might as well finish getting the Bill through the House and get it onto the Statute Book, even if others are slightly tardy about it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for accepting the amendment, which was proposed in a constructive spirit. Effectively, no member other than Austria and Germany has seen fit to implement the agreement up to now. It is interesting that none of our seafaring neighbours have done this. Both Austria and Germany are landlocked or almost so. The convention refers to illicit trafficking by sea. The Netherlands, France, Spain and the UK have not implemented it; neither have the Baltic states, other than Latvia and Lithuania, which are incoming countries. I would have thought that our neighbours in the EU which have a strong seafaring and merchant tradition would be most affected by illicit trafficking by sea and would feel a certain compulsion to ensure that every step was taken to prevent organised <Col N="1180" /> crime of that nature. It is not a good sign if the countries most affected by a particular resolution, who go to the bother of producing an agreement of this nature, more or less stand idly by and leave it to lapse without ratifying it.</P>

      <P>It might be of interest to the House to know that the reason the applicant states seem to be ahead of the existing member states is to do with the fact that as part of the process of joining the EU, the applicant states are required to fully implement the community acquis. This forms part of the acquis and that is why all the applicant states are being more alert and attentive to their duties than some of the existing member states. It explains why Slovenia, Slovakia, Latvia, Lithuania and the like are getting on with the job. All I can do is complete our obligations and hope that other member states quickly carry out theirs.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 2:</P>
      <P>In page 4, line 33, to delete &ldquo;prevent or&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>My second amendment aims to delete the words &ldquo;prevent or&rdquo; in section 4(2) so that it reads:&ldquo;An enforcement officer may delay communication under subsection (1)&rdquo;&ndash; that is, communication by the master of a vessel with the authorities of the convention state or the owner or operator of the vessel to notify them that the vessel has been boarded &ndash;&ldquo;if he or she is satisfied that such communication would obstruct the investigation of an offence.&rdquo;  It seems that &ldquo;prevent&rdquo; is not only unnecessary but probably wrong in this legislation. Surely the whole purpose of the subsection in that case would be that the enforcement officer about to board a vessel should prevent any action being taken by the master of the vessel or anybody else on it that would interfere with the process of the investigation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are talking about delaying the communication until such time as the action to board the vessel and the investigation had got under way and was proceeding. Surely at some stage there will be no need to prevent communication. The master of the vessel is not intended to be out of communication with the convention state or the owner or operator of the vessel forever. We merely want to delay proceedings so that the investigation can be properly carried out, and then surely the master of the vessel can carry out <Col N="1181" /> whatever communication is required in making contact with the commercial owner of the authorities of the registering state. There is no problem with that. What is needed is to delay communication, to conduct the investigation in relation to any suspected offence, and when the investigation is completed, to allow the master to go about the performance of his professional duties in keeping with his or her position or status.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. McDowell Mr. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>On Committee Stage, Deputy Moynihan-Cronin was advised that section 4(2) of the Bill derived from the provisions contained in Article 11.4 of the agreement. Article 11.4 of the agreement states that the master of a vessel which has been boarded in accordance with this agreement, shall be entitled to communicate with the authorities of the vessel's flag state as well as with the owners or operators of the vessel for the purpose of notifying them that the vessel has been boarded. However, the authorities of the intervening state may prevent or delay any communications with the owners or operators of the vessel if they have reasonable grounds for believing that such communications would obstruct the investigation into a relevant offence.</P>
      <P>This is a power which is part of the agreement we are seeking to ratify. I fully accept that it does not necessarily follow that we have to take all powers which are granted to an intervening state, but it is certainly contemplated by the agreement that states ratifying the agreement would fully live up to their obligations under it. There are cases imaginable where it would require not merely a delay of, but prevention of, communication.</P>
      <P>While there are probably more sophisticated and plausible examples available, one that leaps to mind is that if a vessel was being boarded and a radio was in the process of being used and it occurred to the boarding party that the only way to stop the transmission of a message, which was being used to enable the destruction of evidence, was to damage the radio in question, one could hardly say that was justified by a power of delay, whereas one could say that it was justified by a power of prevention. In other words, if one had to look to the text of this Act to say that the Act was lawful or unlawful and all one had was a power to delay the sending of a message, one might be on thin ice if one had to explain to a court that one had broken or destroyed a radio or thrown a communications device into the sea to prevent it from being used for such a purpose.</P>
      <P>This is part of the agreement; it is not an extra bauble that the parliamentary counsel has put into this Bill. This is part of the substance of the agreement that we are trying to implement. We are not claiming something for the Irish State or authority which is outside the agreement. It is specifically contemplated by the agreement. In the circumstances, I will not accept the Deputy's amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="1182" />
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>We do not have to accept the wording of the agreement. As the agreement stands, this is a power that may be exercised, not one that must be. Therefore, there is scope for flexibility in terms of what we insert in the legislation. We would be quite entitled to omit the words if we so wished and we would still be in keeping with the provisions of the agreement.</P>
      <P>My concern is that such extra power in terms of the words &ldquo;prevent or&rdquo; is excessive and unnecessary. I do not favour inserting a prohibition in terms of a prevention in legislation. The master of a ship may very well need to communicate with the owner of the ship and such communication would seem to be necessary. However, if the master of the ship was the person being arrested for the ship being used for illegal trafficking, that would be a different matter. There may be drugs, weapons or illicit materials on board of which the master of the vessel was not aware. In any event a commercial activity would be taking place. There is the flag state &ndash; the convention state &ndash; and the normal procedure would be to allow some communication with it and not to prevent that. It seems that once an investigation is carried out, the enforcement officer should be satisfied with the findings and at that point bona fide communication should be available to the convention state or to the owner or operator of the vessel.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>If at some stage some future lawyer looked back on this debate and saw that I had accepted the Deputy's amendment, he or she would be in a position to say that in doing so I had deliberately narrowed the scope of actions that could be taken under the convention. Two arguments can be made in this context. I accept that the wording of the convention is not mandatory in every respect, but it could be argued that we were deliberately choosing to surrender a capacity for the Irish State which was envisaged by the agreement. Second, it could be said that had the Deputy's amendment not be made, there were some classes of activities &ndash; it is hard to put a finger on them now looking forward &ndash; that would have been open to the Irish State to carry out in respect of any particular operation, but because the Minister of the day accepted the Deputy's amendment they were ruled out as a consequence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1183" />I will give the Deputy a more plausible example than the one I offered earlier. If two ships were travelling in convoy or at a distance, one was testing out the water for another to check the security arrangements or the two ships' masters were acting in concert, it could be necessary to prevent one of them from communicating with the home base or with the other so that an effective round-up of evidence could take place. That is as good as I can set out the position for the Deputy.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I will not dwell on this amendment. The section states that an enforcement officer may prevent or delay communication if he or she is satisfied that such communication would obstruct the investigation of an offence. All communication would be delayed until an offence is investigated and that would also inquire into whether there was an accompanying vessel. However, once the offence is investigated and the enforcement officer is satisfied, we are only talking about bona fide communication. It refers to only two matters. It refers to the authorities of the convention state who are unlikely to be criminals with whom the master of a vessel would get in contact. These are government officials. Second, it refers to the owner or operator of the vessel. If a vessel is carrying commercial cargo, it would be important to know where the vessel is and what is happening to it. If we give power to an enforcement officer, at his or her discretion, to say that he or she will not only delay communication until he or she has investigated the case, but that he or she will prevent any contact with any authority that is relevant to the vessel, cargo or flag ship state, I consider that the use of such power is unnecessary and unreasonable.</P>

      <P>In page 5, line 30, to delete &ldquo;it&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;the court&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This amendment, much like the previous one, is a technical one to clarify matters and make them more appropriate. The Bill states: &ldquo;Where a person who has been remanded under <i>section 6</i> and is before the High Court and it is satisfied. . . &rdquo;. It is unusual to refer to a court as &ldquo;it&rdquo;. I do not know if I have seen it referred to in such terms before. We must have proper cognisance of the authority and status of the court. The reference to &ldquo;it&rdquo; is of low quality and I would like to see the court referred to by its proper title. This would also clarify the context of the sentence.</P>

      <P>In page 8, line 23 after &ldquo;be&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;conveyed to or outside the frontiers of the State and there&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Section 17 states that any person committed under section 9, that is, where he or she has been arrested under this legislation, appeared in court and has been sent to prison, should &ldquo;be surrendered to such person as in the Minister's opinion is duly authorised by the requesting Convention state to receive him or her&rdquo;. We should strengthen that by having the person who committed the offence conveyed to or outside the frontiers of the State.</P>
      <P>It would be normal procedure in extradition matters that a person would be brought to the frontiers of the State. It appears to be a much more appropriate way of dealing with this matter than handing the person over to a foreign agent within the State. That does not appear to be the appropriate way. Any extradition or deportation order would require that a person be at least handed over at the frontier of the State or brought into another state.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is strange that it should be left open that the person could be surrendered to an agent of another state within the frontiers of this State. <Col N="1185" /> We should adopt a position more or less along the same lines as in an extradition or deportation case. Effectively, they are similar. It should be specified in the legislation that the person should be conveyed to or outside the frontiers of the State.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. McDowell Mr. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>It is my recollection that the extradition law was amended specifically to end the practice of requiring people to be handed over at the frontier of the State. A different formula was put in place in recent extradition law which specified that it can take place within the State, for example, to someone travelling on an aeroplane about to leave the State, so that a person could be handed over at Dublin Airport, for example, without their having to be accompanied and a formal hand over in mid-air or whatever conducted.</P>
      <P>There was a time when the extradition law required that people should be handed over at Carrickarnan on the Border and there was a great deal of huffing and puffing about the exactitude required when it needed to happen there. If there is extradition by sea, are we seriously saying that a garda must accompany someone to the 12 mile limit or whatever and then hand him or her over on a boat that has left the State? Likewise with air transport, do we want a garda to accompany a person being extradited and hand him or her over as they fly over the territorial limit of Irish airspace?</P>
      <P>The Deputy's point is probably unduly restrictive and we must be practical about this. It would not really add much to the value of the legislation if we were to say it had to happen at the edge of Irish territorial sovereignty. I have a feeling that at some stage the law was specifically amended to avoid that difficulty in extradition matters.</P>

      <P>My concern about this section is that it is silent as to where the surrender takes place. All it says is that the person in question should be surrendered to such a person who, in the Minister's opinion, is duly authorised by the requesting state. He or she could be surrendered in O'Connell Street or anywhere. It does not say that it must take place on boarding a ship or aeroplane.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is no monitoring or policing mechanism. The Minister is adamant that, when it comes to deportations, a sufficient number of gardaí are present to ensure a person is deported. If we are serious when dealing with illicit activities at sea, such as transporting drugs or weapons, there should be some element of monitoring or mechanism to ensure that, once the hand-over has taken place, the person leaves the State. Where does the person go to? What does it mean when he or she has been handed over? The legislation is silent on that. All I am doing is putting in place a mechanism whereby we can know that a person who is no longer allowed to be in the State because of the nature of his or her activities has been conveyed out of our jurisdiction. That is not <Col N="1186" /> reflected in the legislation and I would like to see some mechanism whereby it would be.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. McDowell Mr. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>This is not specified in other Acts, such as the international war crimes legislation, or in the case of extradition. It is an unnecessary complication and perhaps the Deputy would accept that. It does not add anything to the quality of the legislation. If I thought it did and was a technical improvement, I would, as I have shown in the case of two other amendments, accept it. I think it is a new constraint being added which, in my submission to the Deputy and to the House, is simply not necessary. The phrase that they be conveyed to or outside the frontiers of the State and there surrendered suggests that an individual cannot be a handed over at Dublin Airport or put on a foreign boat but must be brought out to the 12-mile limit for a hand over ceremony and then somehow that officer must be brought back by another boat or else he or she goes with the person the whole way. I do not think that would be a good idea.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I will not press the amendment. The motion is silent on what will happen to the person once they are surrendered. They are not to be conveyed anywhere and there is no further direction. They could remain in the jurisdiction for the next 12 years. They could apply for asylum but they are unlikely to do so. There is no direction as to what would happen other than surrender to an authorised person within the State. To my mind that leaves them in limbo.</P>
      <P>What will the authorised person do? Will he or she convey them outside the State or will he or she put them up in his or her own house? Clearly the intent is that they be conveyed out of the country because they were arrested and were suspected of being involved in illicit activities by sea. The fact that they are just put into the care of an authorised person means that they could be free to go anywhere and could become involved in anything. There could be better wording used.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 5:</P>
      <P>In page 10, line 34, after &ldquo;Minister&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;(and in the event of an application such as is referred to in <i>section 17(1)(a)</i> or <i>(b),</i> the Court so referred to)&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 22 deals with capital punishment. It states, &ldquo;the surrender of the person shall be refused unless that state gives such assurance as the Minister considers sufficient that the death penalty will not be carried out.&rdquo;  When a person is arrested and where an offence is punishable by death under the law of the convention state, the Minister can seek assurances that the death penalty will not be carried out. I suggest that the court should also be satisfied. The assurances should be made in the court in the first instance <Col N="1187" /> and the Minister should also be given the assurance and there would be a double insurance.</P>
    <P>We have abolished the death penalty and we abhor it. It is contrary to our international obligations. We should double-lock the Minister and the courts so that the assurances will be watertight and a person will not be sent back to a country where the death penalty might be used. I ask the Minister to accept this amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. McDowell Mr. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not disposed to accept the Deputy's amendment. The Deputy's suggestion is that the High Court should also have the capacity to effectively refuse extradition and to demand assurances from foreign states regarding their intentions. I believe in the separation of powers and relations between states are fundamentally a matter for Government under the international law convention. It is already the situation regarding extradition that the Government and the Minister come to a conclusion about the adequacy of the assurances given. It is not done at the court stage. It would be unnecessary duplication. The normal sequence of events is that the legal issues are disposed of and that one last issue is there. At that stage the Minister refuses to extradite unless and until he receives satisfactory assurances from the requesting state that the death penalty will not be carried out.</P>
      <P>It is difficult to see what additional benefit would be conferred if this was vested in the High Court. It is easy to see that it could be used for the purpose of delay because it would bring forward the time at which the requesting state had to make those assurances to the point when the matter was being considered in the Irish courts. In the last analysis, what would be the point if the High Court was satisfied with the assurances that were given because the Minister's function would be entirely residual? If the Minister was not satisfied then it would be a somewhat extraordinary situation.</P>
      <P>This is the norm regarding extradition. We are doing something unusual. We are not giving a lesser right than we do in our customary law of extradition and we are not giving a lesser protection. In the circumstances this would avoid unnecessary court proceedings. Supposing there was a perfectly straightforward case where the only issue was the death penalty and in every other respect a person being sought was obviously going to be surrendered, the idea that the court hurdle could not be dealt with until the death penalty issue was resolved and that at a later stage the Minister would have to be reassured a second time is in my view, unsatisfactory.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Our system is such that the Executive arm of the State handles international relations. Our courts do not normally receive assurances from foreign states and are not in a position to do anything about those assurances if they are not honoured. Under the Constitution, the Executive arm <Col N="1188" /> of the State is given the responsibility to deal with international relations.</P>
    <P>It is theoretically possible but extremely unlikely if somebody breached an undertaking in this respect, it would be for the Executive arm of the State to respond; the High Court could do nothing about it. If the extradition of an individual was requested and the High Court had a role in demanding assurances and those assurances were given and later broken, there is nothing that an Irish High Court judge could do in the circumstances. He or she cannot compel the attendance before him or her of a foreign power or of its ambassador or threaten to punish. We do not make orders which are in vain and we do not confer jurisdiction on people which they cannot enforce. That is why it falls to the Executive rather than to the Judiciary to receive assurances in this respect.</P>

      <P>The situation is that in a lot of areas we do not allow people to be extradited to  jurisdictions where the death penalty is in operation. This is where the convention state requests that the person be surrendered to its jurisdiction after he or she has been arrested in Irish waters and brought before an Irish court. We are seeking to ensure that if there is a death penalty imposed for the offence, we want a double assurance that the death penalty would not be imposed. It is a human rights issue to protect the person.</P>

    <P Just="Center">&ndash;notes that these failures are symptomatic of a general failure by this Government to deliver joined up Government which effectively delivers strategies which will provide urgent relief to the daily level of chronic congestion suffered in Dublin and which will promote balanced regional development; and </P>

    <P>Unfortunately, I missed last night's debate but I hope that anyone reflecting on the various contributions made will now appreciate the demands on the Minister for Finance as speaker after speaker made such eloquent cases for the inclusion in a new programme of decentralisation of towns right across the country.

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>The citizens of Ireland should be thankful that they have public representatives capable of advancing such convincing arguments on their behalf.</P>
      <P>Decentralisation is an important business for several reasons, not least because we are talking about the lives, careers and futures of real people and their families. It is also about maximising the efficient delivery of public services for the benefit of every citizen in the State and at a time when so much focus is placed on value for money. I will not be rushed by political pressure into taking decisions prematurely which will compromise the delivery of services to the citizens of this State. No one is more conscious than I am of the interest which decentralisation has generated both within and outside the House. We are all aware of the frequency with which the issue is raised in parliamentary questions or Adjournment debates and the coverage the issue receives in the media, particularly the provincial newspapers, is evidence of its significance throughout every part of this country.</P>
      <P>In this regard, I want to deal briefly with some, however occasional, media coverage suggesting that a number of decisions in relation to the forthcoming programme have been taken. I want to be very clear about this. No such decisions have yet been taken. Indeed, only within the past couple of weeks it was reported that one particular Government agency might be relocating to one of two midland counties.</P>
      <P>While I have no idea what the basis was for such a story, such speculation is unhelpful and unfair both to those working in such organisations and to the areas referred to in such reports. I want to assure the House that this report and others have no basis in fact.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Conscious, as I am, of the considerable anticipation which the subject has generated throughout the country, I consider it prudent to express a word of caution. Although not wanting to dampen the anticipation of any town or community, it is important to take a reality check at this point. Well over 100 urban centres throughout every county in the country have expressed a desire to be included in a new programme of decentralisation, through the presentation of submissions or through representations made on their behalf. An effective, efficient programme of decentralisation simply cannot accommodate anything like the number of centres from which submissions etc. have been received or on whose behalf representations have been made. The obvious, however unfortunate, conclusion is that a multiple of the number of those centres which can be included will have to be disappointed. While it is not that I take any pleasure in raining <Col N="1191" /> on anyone's parade, it is important that some sense of perspective should be brought to this debate. Notwithstanding this cautionary message, I am determined that we will deliver an ambitious, successful and significant programme of decentralisation and I am confident also that there is sufficient interest among Dublin-based civil servants in relocating to ensure its successful delivery.</P>
    <P>As much as I know that there is considerable interest in decentralisation, it is impossible to measure the extent of such interest. So it was with some bemusement that I read the Fine Gael statement on Monday which appeared to suggest that over 80% of Dublin-based civil servants had applied for transfers to provincial locations. Notwithstanding the undoubted attractions of Mayo and Galway, I am sure that neither Deputy Kenny nor Deputy Connaughton would seriously contend that only 20% of Dublin-based civil servants want to stay in the capital. The Fine Gael statement went on to suggest that there were more applications for relocation from the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform than there are staff in the Department &ndash; quite an extraordinary achievement. I am left wondering whether the Fine Gael statement is a reflection of innocent misinterpretation or deliberate mischief.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaulConnaughton" hpid="Mr. Connaughton Mr. Connaughton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connaughton</NameTxt>
      <P>It was a Dáil question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>Let me explain to the Fine Gael Party and to the House how these figures are compiled. When a civil servant is interested in transferring to a particular location it is normal that they would apply to any Government office in that location. For example, a person interested in transferring to Cork could apply to the Departments of Agriculture and Food, Social and Family Affairs, Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Foreign Affairs, the Office of the Revenue Commissioners, the Director of Consumer Affairs as well as the Garda Síochána and the Central Statistics Office. Furthermore, they are likely to apply to transfer to one or more neighbouring towns.</P>
      <P>The effect of this is that one person interested in transferring to Cork may be responsible for as many as ten or 12 of the applications referred to in the Fine Gael statement. The figures referred to in their statement must therefore be significantly discounted before they can be taken as any reasonable barometer of interest among Dublin-based civil servants in relocating to the provinces.</P>
      <P>The figures on which the Fine Gael statement is based necessarily reflect the existing spread of decentralised or locally-based offices and take no account of new locations which may be included in a new programme of decentralisation. For these reasons they cannot be taken as a clear indicator of interest in participation in a new programme of decentralisation and to continue to insist that they do is, to say the least, disingenuous, if not deliberately misleading.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1192" />The Fine Gael motion calls on the Government to outline the criteria on which decisions in relation to the new programme of decentralisation will be based. I have said before that there are so many imponderable and immeasurable factors which will impact on the decisions that it is not as simple as listing off qualifying criteria against which the merits of various towns can be measured. Decisions will be taken with a view to putting in place a substantial programme which will maximise the number of public servants relocating voluntarily without impacting adversely on the efficient delivery of public services. Indeed, it is my earnest hope that a new programme of decentralisation could result in an improvement in the efficiency with which the State delivers its services.</P>
    <P>This new programme of decentralisation will be announced and implemented against the background of the new social partnership agreement, Sustaining Progress, which provides for a flexible approach to working practices by individual public servants, management and unions in meeting the demand for improvements in the provision of public services. I take the view that the new start which decentralisation presents for so many can be availed of to move the modernisation agenda forward to achieve a public service which is quality, performance and results driven; achieves value for money; is focused on the needs of its customers; is accountable; responds flexibly and rapidly to change; and promotes equal opportunities.</P>
    <P>Much as it pains me to disappoint the Opposition, I must regrettably do so again this evening. I will not be drawn on a timescale for the implementation of the new programme. The timescale for implementation depends on a wide range of factors including the scale of the programme, the number and variety of locations to be included, the availability of suitable accommodation etc. Furthermore, there is the issue to which I keep returning &ndash; the efficient delivery of public services.</P>
    <P>Sourcing staff for a particular Department or office transferring to a provincial location means, in almost all cases, staff transferring into and out of that Department office from several others throughout the Civil Service. Implementing a programme which involves the relocation of elements of several Departments, offices or agencies multiplies the extent of the interdepartmental transfer of staff. It is naturally the case that this kind of interdepartmental transfer of staff can be very disruptive and my concern is obviously to minimise that level of disruption. Minimising the disruption necessarily means that the implementation of a substantial programme of decentralisation should be rolled out on a progressive and systematic basis over a reasonable period.</P>
    <P>As to when decisions will be taken, the answer is when the Government is ready. We have consulted widely and there is a considerable amount of advice, experience and information available <Col N="1193" /> to us. My Department has also been inundated with submissions, many of a very high standard, offering convincing arguments as to why particular towns ought to be included in the new programme. All of these have been reviewed and full account will be taken of them as part of the decision-making process.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I was somewhat amused by the suggestion that the decisions in relation to the new programme will be politically driven.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaulConnaughton" hpid="Mr. Connaughton Mr. Connaughton">

      <P>I presume the Opposition means that the decisions should be taken on the basis of criteria other than those used to decide that sections of the Department of Agriculture and Food and the Environmental Protection Agency should transfer to Johnstown Castle, County Wexford. Interestingly, those decisions were taken at a time when the two responsible Cabinet Ministers were from County Wexford. I commend the Government's amendment to the House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms Sexton</NameTxt>
      <P>Decentralisation makes sense. There are sound policy and efficiency arguments in its favour and, correctly carried out, decentralisation will make a contribution to the better government of this country. If it is incorrectly carried out, it could bring politics into disrepute and lower even further the public esteem in which politicians are held. The idea of Ministers shifting 20 or 30 civil servants to their constituencies is well past its sell by date. That approach did the Civil Service and provincial Ireland little good and it certainly did the Ministers concerned little good. The electorate is too sophisticated to be swayed by that type of stroke. There is no water left in the political parish pump.</P>
      <P>We need a real, substantial and coherent programme of decentralisation, properly planned and carefully executed. It should make sense in both administrative and economic terms. There is a compelling case for decentralisation. It would take the pressure off Dublin by reducing congestion and, in particular, by reducing pressure on the housing market. Decentralisation promotes balanced regional development. The regions must build critical mass in the provincial towns so they can develop into regional centres.</P>
      <P>Many civil and public servants would welcome the opportunity to work outside Dublin and enjoy a different quality of life. Decentralisation can help to improve efficiency in the public service. In the age of the Internet there is no compelling reason that the bulk of Ireland's administrative public sector must be concentrated in Dublin.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is a major public policy initiative and it should be treated as such. We should press on and implement a major decentralisation programme now. I support such a programme, as <Col N="1194" /> does the Government and my party, but it is important that we do it correctly. We should be ambitious in scale. Major chunks of Government activity should be shifted <i>en bloc</i> out of Dublin and into the provincial centres. There is no reason that whole divisions of Departments and, indeed, Departments should not be moved.</P>
    <P>We should also promote the idea of clusters. Early efforts at decentralisation were less than successful because of the negative impact they had on the careers of the civil servants. Promotional opportunities must be maximised for the people involved. We must create a network of interlocking regional clusters. No civil or public servant should be isolated in career terms or cut off from the mainstream. A civil servant in Waterford should, for example, be able to pursue promotional opportunities in Wexford. A civil servant in Longford should be able to pursue a promotional opportunity in Athlone or Roscommon.</P>
    <P>It is also important to identify the most suitable towns as centres for decentralisation. Every Deputy will push hard on behalf of his or her constituency and I will make the case for Longford and Roscommon. However, we know in our hearts that not every town in Ireland is suitable. One simply cannot place a Department in the middle of a country crossroads and expect it to work. There must be a checklist. Will there be suitable office accommodation available? Are there sites available? Is there adequate, affordable public housing? Are the public services and facilities able to cope with the large influx of residents? Are there good links to the capital?</P>
    <P>It is important to choose the right locations, even within the towns that are selected, to make this work. We also need to choose the right buildings. Public offices should be prestigious buildings. They should make a statement about our country and our culture, be examples of architectural excellence and they should occupy central positions in our urban streetscapes.</P>
    <P>County Longford experienced a small but significant increase in population according to last year's census. There is a budding confidence in the county. Disappointment over the postponement of the Cardinal Health project has given way to satisfaction with the recent announcement of the Abbott investment. The confidence of the county would receive a significant boost if it was to gain from decentralisation.</P>
    <P>Longford is like many places in the midlands, west and north-west. Whether it is Longford or Roscommon, Mayo or Leitrim, Sligo or Donegal, all stand to benefit significantly from the impetus that can be provided by decentralisation. All stand to gain from the influx of new blood and to benefit from the new investment. It is time to start the process of shifting Government activity out of Dublin and into the regions. Decentralisation will be good not just for the country but also for the capital city. It is time to get it started.</P>

      <P>Cuireann sé áthas orm <Col N="1195" /> deis a bheith agam labhairt ar an ábhar fíor thábhachtach seo. Unfortunately, my time is limited but I wish to address a few issues. I do not agree with the popular theory that Government should hand control of all decisions to people who are not elected. It is vital that with this most important issue the Government is at the heart of the decision-making process. I agree with Deputy Sexton that it should not be a question of looking after one's bailiwick. However, left to itself, the system will always take the conservative option. It will always give the reason things cannot be done rather than how they can be done. We need decentralisation and the Government has a clear policy on it.</P>
      <P>Deputy Connaughton said during this debate that I had stressed the importance of Dublin people understanding the need for development of the regions. He seemed to think this was a negative factor. We should have learned, in trying to solve the difficulties in Northern Ireland, that the best way of trying to solve a problem is to achieve a win-win situation for everybody.</P>

      <P>I said in Claremorris, and I stand by what I said, that it will be much easier to get movement on this issue if we persuade the people of this city of the merits of the move. I come from this city and I have seen the city strangulated and destroyed by over-growth at the expense of the rest of the country. Many people in Dublin would agree that it is as much in their interest as it is in the interest of the people of the less developed parts of the country that we achieve more evenly spread development. Given the realities and pressures of political life, it makes sense that if the people of Dublin were proactively in favour of such a policy and the development of the regions as not only solving the problems of the regions but also helping to solve their problems, it would be easier to implement these policies.</P>
      <P>One can bring a horse to water but one cannot make the horse drink. Deputy Connaughton served in a Fine Gael Government and he knows, as does everybody who has served in Government, that if people want to put a dris chosáin i do bhealach or to make things difficult, they can slow the political will down considerably. However, if there is national agreement across the board, and I believe we can secure a consensus that this is desirable and that investment must be made in the regions to bring it about, we will reach our agreed goal much faster.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Decentralisation must be done in the context of the spatial requirements of the country. It should not involve moving to areas that are already growing rapidly, such as the gateway cities. Those areas are now at a point where they are self starting and self growing. In fact, most of the problems of those cities relate to the time lag in providing the social and physical infrastructure <Col N="1196" /> to meet the needs of the growing populations. Decentralisation should kick-start areas that have been in decline or have been stagnant but that has to be done in a coherent way. I have already spoken to the Western Development Commission regarding this issue and the physical planning of counties in which it is involved, for example, the potential of opening the railway lines that exist, some of which are closed. Coherent decentralisation would have a much greater chance of success and social organisation than decentralisation carried out willy nilly without matching the very good infrastructure available in some places. In other places a very good potential infrastructure could be provided at quite modest cost and that would be worth developing if it was obvious that it was going to be a social and economic development with decentralisation to match. We also have to look at a number of other complex issues. We have to be realistic in making sure that when we decentralise we do so with regard to critical mass in terms of career structures, particularly in relation to Government Departments.</P>
    <P>There are many issues that have to be taken on board. All I can say is that the commitment to decentralisation is there. It will take careful planning and should be done in a focused way. It should go to areas that need it. Finally, it can be done only in an industrial relations atmosphere that is desirous and willing for it to happen. Persuasion will be needed and that comes from good planning, not a heavy hand and diktat. Obstacles will arise if we try to do it by a short cut.</P>

      <P>I welcome the Government's commitment to decentralisation, coupled with its spatial strategy programme. I support all that was said by Deputy Sexton a few minutes ago. Decentralisation should not be effected by virtue of the level of political pressure placed on the Minister but rather it should ensure that it reaches areas that can quite properly support it. It is also very important for the Minister to take into account counties and towns that have not in recent years secured the value of State sponsored jobs, by way of IDA investment or whatever else, provided those towns could support a decentralisation programme.</P>
      <P>The Minister referred to press statements regarding two counties in the midlands, which I presume are Laois and Offaly. I am quite dismayed that the Minister also says it is unfair to the towns and the organisations involved. I hope he will not be put off thinking about Laois and Offaly, even though unfortunately commitments have been made, and if one were to read the local papers one would presume that the Minister for Finance has no say whatever in the final package of decentralisation. I am glad to note this evening that it is this Minister who will have the final decision.</P>

      <P>There is no row. I thought I had lost part of the picture for the last few weeks. I am happy to hear the Minister confirming that he will be in charge.</P>
      <P>When the Minister comes to decide on the programme I am certain he will look at the opportunities that can be delivered from a county such as Laois, which is centrally located and over the years has not been favoured by State jobs. This is an ideal opportunity for the county. Rather than be parochial, I know it also has to match the criterion that it can support decentralisation, for reasons other than political ones, and that should be taken into account so it can be put in the fast track.</P>
      <P>Decentralisation has many advantages, not just for the counties that we support. A decentralisation programme can relocate Government offices outside the city, reducing the difficulties caused by gridlock and the huge problems caused by the demands for housing in the cities, and ensure that we have a properly located service not just in the cities but throughout the regions.</P>
      <P>I welcome the fact that the Government is committed to this programme. I see tremendous advantages from it.</P>

      <P>I welcome the opportunity to contribute to the debate in the few minutes that I have. Decentralisation has been bandied around for several years and I am delighted the Minister has come into the House and has given a commitment that it is going ahead. As a State and a Government, we cannot direct foreign industrialists on where to locate but in relation to decentralisation we can consider suitable areas. I welcome what the Minister has said about areas that have not benefited considerably from the boom over recent years. There is no point in putting the decentralisation programme into centres that are already growing at a rapid pace. We need to look after the areas that have not got a lift from the recent economic recovery.</P>
      <P>There are several reasons why decentralisation makes economic sense in relation to the enormous growth of Dublin and other cities and the cost of living in the major urban centres, particularly in Dublin, including the cost of housing and of providing an infrastructure. There are plenty of provincial towns that have modern communications and that can provide a service as good as any that can be provided in Dublin. There is no reason why Departments cannot function as effectively and efficiently in Kanturk as in Dublin.</P>
      <P>There are enormous benefits to living in provincial towns. There is a very strong sense of community there and a rural beauty, with favourable house prices to attract people and a long list of other advantages. Over the years we have built up the infrastructure with excellent schools and leisure facilities that would entice people. I gather from civil servants working in Dublin that they are fully informed and looking forward to the opportunity to move out of the city.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1198" />Finally, I ask the Ministers when they are making their adjudication to ensure the decentralisation programme benefits towns which have not benefited considerably from the economic boom.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Callanan</NameTxt>
      <P>I compliment the Minister and the Government on making decentralisation part of the programme for Government. Decentralisation is the best possible way of putting life back into rural areas. Moving Departments from Dublin, which is choked with traffic, to towns in the country shows that this Government is serious about rural areas. Towns such as Ballinasloe, Loughrea and Tuam in east Galway are well placed for Departments. Ballinasloe, where my home is, was discussed last night and is a great location for any Department. It has suffered from the closure of the AT Cross and Square D factories. It has a lot to offer: it is on the N6 Dublin-Galway route, close to Athlone and about an hour from Galway. It is a lovely place in which to live, a friendly town which will have a new leisure centre in a couple of months, a new marina, new secondary school and Garbally College which is well known, a new health centre and an excellent hospital in Portiuncula, which is also well known, and great hotels. It has many sports facilities and cheap houses which are half the price of those in Dublin. Therefore, I encourage the Minister to consider Ballinasloe for decentralisation.</P>
      <P>Industry must also move to the towns and if this happens people, especially farmers' families, can continue to live and work in rural areas and will not have to drive long distances in heavy traffic to work. Decentralisation is a first step by Government to make sure that rural Ireland survives. I ask the Minister to consider moving to the towns, especially Ballinasloe which is in dire need of a boost at the moment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Boyle</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to share time with Deputies Ó Caoláin, McHugh, Breen, Cowley and Harkin.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is not and has never been a policy of decentralisation in this country. Decentralisation relates to decision making. What has been promised, initiated to a small extent, and stalled by this Government is an office relocation programme. That has many benefits for those who are currently living in Dublin and wish to live elsewhere, and health benefits for the communities which have been promised that they will be locations for many of those sections of Departments and agencies. Real decentralisation, however, is about where and how decisions are made and who makes them. For people in Cork, the apparatus of many Departments and state agencies remains centralised. It matters not to a person in Cork if decisions are made nationally in Sligo, Longford or Athlone, for the Departments are still centralised. Having said that, the Government has been engaged in an exercise of deceit that coincided with the run-up to the general election and has persisted since then in an effort to win votes both from those many thousands of civil servants who want to leave the Dublin area and move back to <Col N="1199" /> local communities and from those local communities themselves that saw the opportunity of an economic fillip. On both those grounds, the Government deserves condemnation, and this Private Members' motion deserves support.</P>
    <P>The other element of what is being suggested here, and what the Government is being challenged on, is that, on the national spatial strategy, it is pursuing a policy of nonsense. It cannot pretend to be distributing infrastructure nationally that would allow the free flow of economic activity &ndash; of people travelling to places of work, education and general amenity &ndash; if the reality of its capital expenditure, such as it is, is still largely centred on the unmitigated growth of the Dublin region.</P>
    <P>The national roads programme, with its colossal over expenditure has now been reduced, for this and coming years, to a national roads programme for roads in, out and around Dublin &ndash; no further than 25 miles away. The Government can identify no national roads project that shows the potential of putting in place badly needed infrastructure on the western seaboard and between large centres of population in the rest of the country &ndash; Cork, Limerick, Waterford and Sligo and down to Cork.</P>
    <P>The railway programme, such as it is, is nothing but a load of unfulfilled promises. The Government has published two programmes in recent weeks, the strategic rail review and a specific rail review of suburban rail transport in Cork. Neither gives commitments to the provision of an alternative public transport system, and many of the recommendations in both reports pour cold water on and defeat the hope of many in regions outside Dublin of seeing adequate infrastructure put in place.</P>
    <P>A further example of the Government doing exactly the opposite of what it claims regarding reducing population growth in Dublin and properly distributing it throughout the rest of the country is the infrastructure surrounding Dublin Airport, where even more growth is being asked for in the shape of additional terminals and runway space. How does that square with the idea of having many population centres of importance in economic development and cultural life, something for which the Minister has some degree of responsibility in his Department?</P>
    <P>We are living in an &ldquo;unreality&rdquo; where decentralisation is talked about without being defined in any proper sense. The Government, mainly under the lead of the Taoiseach, who is a master of using words that mean nothing and ultimately deliver nothing, has seen to it that we have many people living outside the Dublin region experiencing zero growth in infrastructure and many tens of thousands of people stuck in the morass of Dublin City life who would rather be living, working and otherwise engaging in a more sustainable life which the Government, through its policies, lack of initiative and basic deceit, is not allowing them.</P>

      <P>The promise of decentralisation from this Government has become the modern equivalent of the once infamous promise to drain the Shannon. In his contribution to the debate last night, Deputy Michael Smith, the Minister for Defence, tried to refute the argument that the Government had failed to deliver on its commitments. He said:</P>
      <P>This is the first of a five year term and I challenge those on the other side of the House to sustain their arguments at the conclusion of our full term.</P>
      <P>I could hardly believe my eyes when I read that. I have pursued this matter closely since first being elected in 1997, and I know this Government's record extremely well &ndash; just as well as the Minister or any of his colleagues.

      <P>The Government's promise of a massive decentralisation programme does not go back to the Agreed Programme for Government in June 2002 but to the last millennium, as we all know very well. I have carried out some research on the matter, and the Minister for Finance first made the commitment in his Budget Statement in December 1999, and it was quite clear that Minister McCreevy said that the next round of decentralisation would be &ldquo;more radical than those to date&rdquo;. God bless the mark. He stated the Government's intention to transfer the maximum possible number of public service jobs from Dublin and move almost complete Departments and other public bodies to provincial centres. Ten thousand civil servants were to be decentralised, and the advantages for Dublin and the regions would be enormous. The promise was made, the commitment given and, of course, the expectation was therefore created.</P>
      <P>Six months passed from that Budget Statement of 1999, and I raised the matter again in a Private Members' debate in June 2000, pointing out that there had been no progress. In October 2000, in a written question, I again asked the Minister for Finance about the Cabinet sub-committee on decentralisation. He confirmed that the Taoiseach, the Tánaiste, Deputy Harney, the Minister for the Environment and Local Government of the day, Noel Dempsey, and he, the Minister for Finance, were on it. Deputy McCreevy stated, most significantly:</P>
      <P>I am satisfied that the Government will be in a position to take decisions in relation to the new programme by the end of this year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>He said that in October 2000 and yet tonight, on 14 May 2003, he said that he would not to be <Col N="1201" /> rushed into taking decisions prematurely. I quoted from 17 October 2000. The Minister repeated his statement during Oral Questions in the House on 26 October 2000. I questioned the Taoiseach in February 2002 &ndash; we will move the clock forward a couple of years &ndash; and he said that no announcements would be made before the general election but that enough work had been done for a new Minister for Finance to advance the programme. We did not get a new Minister for Finance, and we certainly did not see any advances in the programme.</P>
    <P>That brings us to the aftermath of the general election of only 12 months ago &ndash; happy anniversary to all concerned. The commitment to decentralisation was repeated in the Agreed Programme for Government between Fianna Fáil and the absent Progressive Democrats. I questioned the Minister for Finance again on 12 November 2002, and now, safely embedded back in his old position at the start of another term in Government, lo and behold the Minister told us that it was &ldquo;not possible for me to state at this time when the Government will be in a position to take a decision on the issue of decentralisation.&rdquo;  That decision was supposed to have been made a full two years earlier, for in October 2000 he had said that we would have the full programme by the end of that year. However, it certainly did not come for Christmas 2000, and it has not come for any Christmas since, for any of our communities or for the civil servants themselves. In that reply, the Minister claimed that the Government had not acted before the general election lest it be accused of doing so for political purposes. I suggest that the reverse was more likely. It did not go ahead because of political considerations. However, Minister Browne knows that not going ahead with something for political purposes never worried Fianna Fáil before, and I wonder why, all of a sudden, it became such a consideration in this regard. It was another excuse for inaction. This Government has been speaking out of both sides of its mouth on this issue. The reality is that we have had zero delivery on decentralisation. Accordingly, I have no option but to give my full support to the Fine Gael motion.</P>

      <P>For decades now we have had a very intense debate in relation to the need for balanced regional development in this country. Sadly, all we had was a debate. No matter how much talking needs to be done, there always comes a time for action. In relation to balanced regional development, the time for action came a long time ago but, unfortunately, it did not happen.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The publication of the national spatial strategy in recent months is the first major attempt by the Government to set the foundation for balanced regional development. That is the framework for the future. The country has to embrace that strategy to make it work so that the objective of a better geographical spread of economic activity <Col N="1202" /> and growth occurs right throughout the country. The spatial strategy is the foundation. However, we need to build on that foundation to give expression to the objectives of the strategy, to show to the regions that the spatial strategy will not be another report that will gather dust on the shelf.</P>
    <P>At the time of the launch of the spatial strategy the Minister told us that now that the strategy was published it was up to the State, semi-State and various developmental and statutory authorities to buy into it, to tailor their policies and inputs to gateways and hubs identified in the strategy in order to bring the promised fruits of the strategy to fruition.</P>
    <P>What better way for the Government to give a clear signal that this spatial strategy is for real and is the framework for the future than to decentralise Departments to the gateways and hubs identified in the strategy, particularly to the gateways and hubs that have not benefited to any degree from decentralisation previously &ndash; as the Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs, Deputy Ó Cuív said, preferably to the hubs &ndash; and, dare I join the queue and say it, preferably to east Galway and Tuam?</P>
    <P>Let me quote from the contribution of the Minister for Defence last evening when he said: &ldquo;The establishment of a new Government office in any provincial town has the potential to act as an economic catalyst for that area&rdquo;. The kick-start the spatial strategy needs now is that economic catalyst. I regret that I must part company with my constituency colleague, Deputy Connaughton, this evening because of the amendment moved last evening by Minister Smith, which refers to a commitment to move forward the progressive decentralisation of Government offices and agencies, taking account of the national spatial strategy. I will be supporting the Government amendment this evening.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Breen</NameTxt>
      <P>Following a period of enormous economic prosperity what is delivered to the west is a damning indictment of this Government. As I said before in this House, Ireland has been &ldquo;Dublinised&rdquo; and &ldquo;easternised&rdquo; and the Pale has been reinstated. Various Ministers, including the present Minister, have promised decentralisation to various parts of this country. Imagine what a Government Department would do for the economy of a town in the west at a time when industries are closing down and not being replaced. When the Minister visited Clare a couple of years ago, he promised that a Department would be decentralised to Kilrush. That was also promised during the general election campaign. Can we afford to do this, given the poor infrastructure in Clare? The long-awaited Ennis by-pass was supposed to start in 1999 and then in 2002. With the general election over, it is now promised to start in 2004.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If we are serious about the national spatial strategy, we need to consider moving Departments out of Dublin. The Government promised <Col N="1203" /> that 10,000 civil servants would be involved in such a move which is justified by the traffic gridlock. I ask the Minister to grasp the nettle and proceed with decentralisation as a matter of urgency in the interests of the ordinary people of this island.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms Harkin</NameTxt>
      <P>Decentralisation is a very important piece in the jigsaw that is balanced regional development. For many years now this Government has promised to decentralise jobs but we still await a comprehensive, strategically driven decentralisation programme. A few minutes ago Deputy Ó Caoláin outlined day and date regarding promises, promises and more promises from 1999, when we were promised radical decentralisation, to this very evening when the Minister told us that he would not be rushed. The question to the Minister this evening is the same as it has been for the past four years. When will he deliver on his promises to decentralise jobs?</P>
      <P>Decentralisation has been on the agenda of this Government for so long that every dimension must have been studied in detail and the people needed to staff decentralised Government Departments must be well identified. A number of Deputies, and the Minister for Finance himself, have referred to a report in a newspaper earlier this week which stated that there are plenty of volunteers to staff decentralised Departments. This, if it is true, is very good news indeed. It removes at least that excuse for the Minister for Finance not to move this process forward immediately. It seems that public servants are ready, but is the Government prepared to do the right thing rather than pull the party political stroke? It must deliver equitable and effective decentralisation.</P>
      <P>We can quite easily see a poor example of decentralisation in the problems being experienced in the Department of Agriculture and Food. The Department has failed to provide, within the programme of decentralisation, adequate opportunities for promotion. Decentralisation is not just about moving jobs from A to B. It is also about decentralising decision-making within Departments. We do not want a situation where all the major decisions and the most senior staff remain in Dublin.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I agree with the earlier comments of the Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs that what is needed is persuasion rather than a heavy hand when promoting decentralisation. However, I disagree with him on another issue. He said that gateway towns, being self-starters &ldquo;really should not be considered for decentralised jobs&rdquo;. I contend that a town such as Sligo, which has been earmarked as a gateway in the national spatial strategy, but which has not benefited from job creation over the past ten years to any extent, should be considered for decentralised jobs. It is horses for courses, and one cannot make a general statement that gate<Col N="1204" /> way towns should not be considered for decentralised jobs. Surely the spatial strategy must be taken into consideration in this programme. Otherwise, the strategy is meaningless. If an area has not benefited from the growth in job creation over the past number of years, surely decentralisation of jobs is one way the Government can help to re-balance the situation.</P>
    <P>Decentralisation programmes that have already been promised or were guaranteed before the last election &ndash; for example, the move of the Central Fisheries Board to Carrick-on-Shannon in County Leitrim which was absolutely guaranteed by the then Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources, Deputy Fahey, at the time &ndash; must be delivered. The office space is available in Carrick-on-Shannon and there is some urgency in the need to move premises from Dublin. That decision could and should be taken right now.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FergusODowdFG" hpid="Mr. O'Dowd Mr. O'Dowd">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dowd</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to share my time with Deputies, Timmins, Enright and O'Shea.</P>
      <P>The spatial strategy is a very important mechanism for ensuring that population is evenly distributed in the country. In particular, the dreadful overcrowding, overspill, total and absolute urban chaos in traffic, jobs etc., and the trend of everything going to Dublin must change. Six years ago when I was first elected to the Seanad I could drive to this House in roughly an hour. Now, if I leave home at 8 a.m. it takes an hour and a half to two hours. That is because all the development is taking place in Dublin and all the traffic is flowing into the city in the morning. It is a shame the Government has failed to tackle this issue.</P>
      <P>During the past few weeks <i>The Irish Times</i> carried a series of damning indictments of Government and local government policy regarding the spatial strategy. The counties of Louth, Meath, Kildare and Wicklow are destroyed because of the lack of a plan, a strategy and a cohesive decision by the Government to have proper infrastructure and planning for the greater Dublin area. Towns such as Drogheda which are in the BMW region have become commuter towns. There is a proposal before Louth County Council that the village of Dunleer, with a population of 1,030 souls, be transformed in the space of five years into a major urban city of 40,000 people. Effectively, what is happening is that the developments around the outskirts of Dublin are developer-led and developers are deciding how big our villages will become. It is developers who put their bulldozers and JCBs through fine rural communities which deserve proper and decent planning. The difficulty is that if there is a national spatial strategy one must also have county development plans and local area plans dovetailing into what is in that strategy. That is not happening at present.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That the cost of building land is so great in the greater Dublin area is driving development into parts of other counties which are neither suitable nor acceptable. The reality is commuters are <Col N="1205" /> going there because it is the most affordable place they can get a home. How do people commute from the Glen of Aherlow and Wexford? Why do people commute from practically all Leinster counties to Dublin? The reason is the Government has no coherent strategy to create development in the growth centres. It does not have the determination or the will to drive through local development plans and a proper, cohesive and decisive scheme through county councils.</P>
    <P>What has the Government done since it came to office last year? It has decentralised the Passport Office from Molesworth Street &ndash; 100 yards from here &ndash; to the town of Balbriggan which is practically in the city of Dublin. That has been done on the basis of spatial strategy. It is rubbish to say it has decentralised the Department to Balbriggan. The Passport Office should have been decentralised to south Louth. The two designated areas were north County Dublin or south Louth. The decisive intervention was made at a political level and in 2001 Balbriggan was identified as a location. There followed a process of looking at other areas. It was all a sham, it was a con.</P>
    <P>Drogheda, with a population of over 30,000 people was not included in the national spatial strategy and was dismissed in the Government's assessment of its needs. A greenfield site in Drogheda was turned down in favour of a site in Balbriggan. That is shameful and disgraceful.</P>
    <P>In regard to decentralisation, if other parts of Departments follow the same game plan as Balbriggan in terms of the Passport Office it would be a disgrace for the Government. When it comes to decentralisation of Departments, communities being considered should be informed and there should be openness and transparency about the choice and the decision making in that area. We will ensure that Government and all the works going on in the background will be exposed in situations such as what happened in Balbriggan.</P>

      <P>There are two issues in this motion &ndash; decentralisation and the national spatial strategy and the national development plan. The issue of decentralisation is of lesser importance as opposed to the larger concept. In Leinster there are the counties of Louth, Meath, Dublin, Wicklow, Wexford, Kildare, Carlow, Kilkenny, Laois, Offaly, Westmeath and Longford. My home county of Wicklow is out of place as there has never been decentralisation of any Government job to it. I am not sure but the same may apply in Carlow or in the part of the constituency I represent. That is unique. There are probably three or four counties that do not have Government offices decentralised. There is a higher proportion of civil servants living in Wicklow than in most counties. That it is in close proximity to Dublin should not debar it from consideration and I ask the Minister for Finance to take that into consideration.</P>
      <P>With regard to the larger issue of the national spatial strategy and the national development plan, the national development plan was put on stream as aspirational and populist a few years ago to produce the plan that, even with the best will in the world, will never work. If any of us are here in 20 years' time, perhaps Deputy Enright and the Minister of State, Deputy Parlon, will see that little of it will be implemented.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When we had bad times we went out and sought foreign direct investment and did not mind where it went. We were happy to take it anywhere. By the nature of its proximity to Europe, airports and the better infrastructure, they settled within sheet 16, the old Ordnance Survey map for the greater Dublin area. That is where the vast majority of those people settled. With the advent of congestion and inadequate infrastructure, the push came for a spatial strategy to go out to the regions &ndash; a policy with which I agree. However, we have missed the plot because we have chosen too many centres. We have a population of approximately 4 million. Almost every town is a hub or a gateway. It is absolutely crazy. We should have kept it to three or four, be it Waterford, Cork, Limerick, Galway and maybe Sligo centred around the universities because the investment that comes into the country involves science and technology. These companies have to be near a university and a competitive labour market. With the best will in the world there is no point in putting them where there is no competitive labour market. We have seen the fruits of that in the industrial dispute taking place in the Department of Agriculture and Food due to a lack of promotion opportunities. The same will happen in the private sec<Col N="1207" /> tor except that in that sector people will not tolerate it and will move on.</P>
    <P>It is a sad fact that companies will not locate in some of the locations we are talking about. What will happen is that the country will lose out due to the strategy we have outlined. The Government will not be foolish enough to follow the spatial strategy it will outline. It is difficult to tell somebody to live elsewhere. One has to put a strong incentive in place for them. There is no point in putting them in the middle of nowhere and hope it will work because it will not work. History has shown it will not work.</P>
    <P>With regard to a policy for the greater Dublin area, we have the strategic guidelines to which Deputy O'Dowd referred. I read some of <i>The Irish Times</i> articles but they were not that accurate. They gave a one-sided view &ndash; the An Taisce line, so to speak. In regard to the strategic planning guidelines which the Minister drew up for Kildare, Meath and Wicklow, Mr. Justice Quirke in a court judgment in An Taisce <i>v.</i> Meath County Council said they were fundamentally flawed. That happened six months ago and I ask the Minster of State and his officials to take note of it and advise what they propose to do about it. I do not wish to see it sent to the Mid-East Regional Authority to be deliberated on for two or three years.</P>

      <P>I compliment Deputy Connaughton on introducing this worthwhile motion. TheGovernment needs to outline its strategy on decentralisation and the criteria on which it will be delivered. We must ensure that it is fair, open and immune from opportunism, something that has been lacking in the Government.</P>
      <P>Deputy Timmins referred to the national development plan and the national spatial strategy. The former could be described as the plan with the money while the latter could be described as the plan with a vision. Unfortunately, they lack any real planning and were delivered in the wrong order. The national development plan promised to progress infrastructure and other types of spending around the country while the national spatial strategy provides a list of places where hub and gateway towns should be developed. No funding has been provided to allow for the facilities required. It means that there will be no convergence between the plan and the strategy, especially given the order in which they were published.</P>
      <P>I welcome the designation in my area of the towns of Mullingar, Athlone and Tullamore as a hub and I and my constituency colleague on the other side of the House hope it will work. However, unless the infrastructure is provided, including roads and rail services, nothing will happen. Similarly, unless there is funding to implement the national spatial strategy, the designation makes no sense.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The motion focuses on the question of decen<Col N="1208" /> tralisation. There is no doubt about the huge impact it can have on an area. Portlaoise and Tullamore within counties Laois and Offaly are good examples of the positive effect of decentralisation. However, it has been talked about for too long. I was elected to Offaly County Council in 1999, the year the Government made its original decisions on decentralisation, yet nothing has happened.</P>
    <P>The Minster for Defence referred to the complexity of determining the shape of the significant programme of decentralisation. I am sure there are some complexities, but none arises when there is decentralisation to Roscrea, when all the paper work can be speedily addressed and all complexities speedily resolved. I am not opposed to decentralisation to Roscrea because if it is extended to my area, jobs will be provided. If the complexities for Roscrea can be addressed they can also be addressed elsewhere. Objective criteria must be used, which is the point we on this side of the House are seeking to make.</P>
    <P>Deputy Fleming said the concern should be with people, not numbers. We are here to represent the wishes and the needs of the people, but we must ensure that we act on the basis of proper and objective criteria if we are to have any hope of delivering decentralisation properly. The Deputy opposed the Government's policy on road development and said it was a waste of national resources to construct motorways and by-passes. This is a change from his support for the Government's policy. I am glad he accepts that County Laois, where he lives, has been neglected by IDA Ireland and the Government.</P>
    <P>Deputy Fleming is correct to point out that every local authority has contacted the Minister on the question of decentralisation. Some 110 submissions have been made to date. It is time we agreed on the criteria on which these submissions will be considered. The Minister for Finance referred to what he called misleading figures used by this side of the House. The figures we use have been provided by the Government in response to questions we have raised. The remarks on the numbers applying for decentralisation makes our point. People are applying because of their determination to live in the country and to get out of Dublin and the rat race of commuting from Tullamore, Portlaoise, Mullingar, Kildare and so on.</P>
    <P>Our clinics are inundated on a weekly basis by people who are seeking to live near their workplace. They are willing to commute a certain distance, but they are unable to cope with family life when commuting to Dublin on a daily basis. That is why this issue is so urgent. Promises have been made. The Minister for Finance spoke of the media coverage of the issue and referred to one or two midland counties. The midland newspapers indicate that many more than one or two midland counties have been promised decentralisation. Indeed, every county appears to have been promised it. That is no longer acceptable. The Government must provide coherent criteria <Col N="1209" /> on which decisions will be made. It should stop making false promises, tell us what it proposes to do and how it will evaluate its decisions.</P>

      <P>Ar an gcéad dul síos ba mhaith liom mo bhuíochas a chur in iúl don Teachta Ó Dubhda as ucht a chuid ama a roinnt liom. Tá áthas orm labhairt sa díospóireacht thábhachtach seo ar conas mar a theip ar an Rialtas na pleananna maidir le díláithriú a chur i gcrích. Molaim Fine Gael as ucht an rún seo a chur os comhair na Dála agus brú a chur ar an Rialtas an feachtas seo a chur i bhfeidhm go luath.</P>
      <P>Yesterday, the Minister for Defence said the process of decentralisation was not as simple as listing a series of qualifying criteria against which the merits of the various towns should be measured and that for Fine Gael to suggest otherwise is opportunistic and cynical. In view of the Government's record, this is a disingenuous statement. In early 2002, the Minister for Finance spoke to the Cabinet on this issue. His speaking notes indicate that he wanted Ministers to proceed quickly on the question of ear-marking sections of their Departments for moves outside Dublin and to make definite proposals on a range of hard possibilities within a fortnight. The Minister said this would enable him to bring to Government a comprehensive memorandum on the issue within the next few months so that whatever arrangements on which the Government agreed could be put in train before the summer. However, as 2000 progressed, things began to slow down and it became clear that the Minister and the Government had bitten off more than they could chew.</P>
      <P>With regard to the Waterford constituency, Fianna Fáil indicated that the remainder of the Land Registry and the supply section of the Office of Public Works would be decentralised to Waterford and Dungarvan respectively. In November 2001, Waterford local radio broadcast a report to the effect that the then Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy O'Donoghue, indicated that the full decentralisation of the Land Registry was still on the cards for Waterford. The report said the Minister was responding to suggestions that Waterford would be overlooked in the decentralisation proposals. It pointed out that the Minister indicated that the Government had taken no decision on decentralisation but that Waterford's case was strong and that he would support it. The report went on to point out that in response to a parliamentary question from me, the then Minister of State at the Department of Finance, Deputy Cullen, said that the site purchased in Dublin by his Department would be developed to provide office accommodation for the Land Registry and the DPP. The report pointed to the response by the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to the effect that it would be a short-term measure. Perhaps the Minister of State, Deputy Parlon, could clarify this aspect.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In reply to a parliamentary question last month <Col N="1210" /> regarding proposals for a programme of decentralisation, the Minister for Finance replied that the Government remains committed to moving forward the progressive decentralisation of Government offices and agencies taking into account the national spatial strategy. He said that as he has previously indicated on many occasions, a wide range of important issues must be taken into consideration and that it is vital that all involved be consulted, be they staff concerned about their futures or departmental management concerned about the delivery of public services for which they have responsibility. He went on to say that given this wide ranging consideration, it would not be possible for him to state at this time when the Government will be in a position to take a decision on the issue of decentralisation.</P>
    <P>That answer is vague and open-ended. It contains no mention of the 10,000 civil servants the Minister announced in his Budget Statement of December 1999 would be decentralised. In the real world of politics this has become a hot potato for the Fianna Fáil Party and the Government. No decisions will be taken by the Government ahead of the local and European elections to be held next year. Subsequent to that, with a general election looming, no decisions will be taken in the lifetime of the Government. In view of this, I do not believe the Government intends to pursue this programme and in the interests of political integrity it should be honest enough to say so.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomParlonPD" hpid="Mr. Parlon Mr. Parlon">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Finance (Mr. Parlon)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am delighted to take the opportunity this debate provides to highlight the Government's decentralisation plan which forms an integral part of our regional development strategy. There is agreement on all sides of the House that too great a proportion of our public administration is concentrated in the capital. In the last decade, the population of Blanchardstown rose by more than 40%, which is a massive increase, but the population of Ballycroy, a small community in north Mayo, fell by 14%. Dublin has rapid population growth which puts pressure on public services and threatens to damage quality of life, while in parts of rural Ireland the opposite is happening. Population decline is putting pressure on the viability of public services and threatening to damage the quality of life.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This pattern of development is neither economically efficient nor socially sustainable. One of the obvious solutions to this problem is to commence the decentralisation of civil and public service jobs from Dublin to other parts of the country. Decentralisation has the potential to revitalise towns and villages and the impact of relocating civil servants will be felt far beyond the urban centres in which they work. Decentralisation will have a major positive impact on the quality of life of thousands of families. As a Government, we can build crèches and implement flexible working hours for State workers, but we will never tackle the stress of commuter workers until we relocate Departments <Col N="1211" /> and ensure that people do not have to get on the road at 6 a.m. to be at their desk for 9 a.m. The pressures on house prices in recent years means that a three-hour daily commute from Kildare to Kildare Street seems like a stroll in the park given that many people travel from as far away as Wexford, Thurles, and Tullamore. I am personally aware of many civil servants who travel on a daily basis from my own constituency to and from Dublin. Given the commuting time involved and the hours in the normal working day, this cannot be sustained on a long-term basis. The pressure being put on individuals and family life is very real.</P>
    <P>If economic circumstances force people to move that far away to achieve the perfectly legitimate aspiration of owning their own home, the least they should expect is greater accessibility to their place of work. It is important that any decentralisation programme embarked on by the Government uses objective criteria and that host towns are chosen because of the strength of the services they have to offer. Those towns with good schools, affordable housing and fine social, cultural and physical infrastructure should be considered favourably. The Office Of Public Works will be the agency which brings any future decentralisation plan to life. It will bring the decentralisation plan from the page to the public. Decentralisation should be located strategically within the chosen towns. Monolithic office blocks on the edges of small towns are not the way to proceed. We need to be imaginative and use decentralisation as an opportunity for urban regeneration and revitalisation. State offices should be flagship buildings which make a statement and represent a source of pride for local communities.</P>
    <P>Decentralisation should be used as an economic torch to shine light into areas that have not prospered in recent years. The programme should focus on towns that have not benefited significantly from the recent boom. Many of the towns included as gateways and hubs in the spatial strategy are already significantly developed and would not be economically transformed in the same way as smaller towns by decentralisation. No one can convince me that prosperous places like Wexford, Kilkenny or Castlebar need another Department, but I could highlight many places in the midlands that desperately do. Contributions to this debate and the many meritorious cases made show how difficult a task it will be for the Government to decide. I am confident, however, that the Government will face its task and make the difficult decisions in the best interests of all involved.</P>
    <P>We have had enough discussions about decentralisation and enough reports. It is time for action by a Government committed to the concept. We are committed to moving major blocks of our public administration from Dublin to provincial centres as an essential part of the process of regional development. Public servants are anxious to move. I support the commitment the <Col N="1212" /> Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Harney, made at the recent Progressive Democrats party conference on decentralisation. She is committed to making a start this year to get things moving. I look forward to Government progress on this important issue as a concrete indication of a commitment to balanced regional development and I commend the Government's amendment to the House.</P>

      <P>The most interesting comment in the Minister of State's speech is an example of Progressive Democrats speak. He says that economic circumstances force people to move far away to achieve the perfectly legitimate aspiration of owning their home. The Government response is to do something about moving jobs. This is the sort of thinking which has brought us to the crisis we are in. This country has a low density of population and ample opportunity to develop a sound urban structure in this city. There is plenty of land and a strong economy, but a dismal failure of political will means we cannot deliver to our people affordable homes in the city of Dublin. The Progressive Democrats' response is to shrug their shoulders and describe the phenomenon as an act of God. It is not an act of God, it is a failure of the Progressive Democrats and those around them to face up to their responsibilities. It is the task of Government to shape development, but this Government has introduced timid changes which have been swept away by market forces resulting in developer-led development. Developers leap-frog out to greenfield sites which can be developed quickly and cheaply, but which impose significant costs on the community. They damage its fabric while imposing lengthy commutes on people forcing them to place their children with carers early and to collect them late in the evening.</P>
      <P>The Minister of State says that economic circumstances are responsible and that it is just too bad. The real reason is that the Government has failed to address its responsibilities. It has permitted a planning process to continue which is a shambles. There is no budget to back planning processes, instead a crude zoning approach is adopted in which schools, hospitals and social services are in no way involved. The result is that hospitals and educational infrastructure are not delivered on time to match community development. I could take the Minister of State to schools which are holed up in prefabs because he and his colleagues failed to anticipate their needs. I could bring him to hospitals in my constituency where people are spending four and five days on trolleys because the Minister of State and his colleagues failed to anticipate the need for extra hospital capacity to cope with a growing population.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1213" />The process is not inevitable and Ministers cannot shrug their shoulders about it, speak in a pathetic manner and make politically opportunistic statements about decentralisation. This is an issue the Government must face to deliver proper planning for the first time in this State. The Minister of State referred to the need for a spatial strategy, but the Government introduced its national development plan long before it had any idea of introducing such a thing. Now we are expected to believe the strategy will shape development. We are told the strategy will be integrated sometime in the mid-term review which is like producing architect's plans half way through building a house. The Minister of State is well aware of what will happen. The toilets will have to be shifted around while the house is replumbed, floor boards are pulled up and walls are broken down in order to retrofit. We have already seen that with the railway strategy.</P>
    <P>Contractors will ride a coach and four across this and rub their hands in delight as Ministers change the commitments they have made. Developers will pile on extra expense and we will be left like the householder who has built a shiny new bathroom, but cannot afford to put in a toilet bowl. There is a &euro;98 million unit in Blanchardstown which the Government cannot afford to open. The Luas has doubled in cost while the port tunnel will not be able to accommodate the trucks we know will try to use it. This is all because we do not have adequate planning.</P>

      <P>When the Government launched its national development programme in 1999, which was the same year it announced plans to decentralise 10,000 civil servants, it said the result would be more balanced regional development.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That was in 1999 and yet, some five years later, the national development plan is running years behind schedule with many projects being put on the long finger. The outgoing Government ran scared of implementing the decentralisation proposals before the 2002 general election. The Taoiseach and his Ministers criss-crossed the country during the campaign and promised decentralisation to every large town. When the Minister for Finance visited Kilrush, he promised the town <Col N="1214" /> would be included and the good news made headlines in the local media. The Fianna Fáil-led Government promised the sun, moon and stars in return for a second term.</P>

      <P>The people complied and we are now paying the high price for trusting the word of the outgoing Government. No double-speak or second spin can detract from the fact that promises were made and broken. When the Government was returned to power in 2002, another clever promise-all document, the national spatial strategy, was launched by the Taoiseach and the Minister for the Environment and Local Government, Deputy Cullen. When he launched the document, the Taoiseach said it would bring a better spread of job opportunities, a better quality of life for all and better places in which to live. Even the Tánaiste, at the Progressive Democrat Party's conference some weeks ago, told members that the decentralisation programme would finally get under way later on in the year. However, the Department of Finance has warned that it could take up to ten years to complete the programme.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <P>Is the public being conned again? Of course it is. To put the programme on the long finger flies in the face of Government backbenchers and local party interests seeking a Government Department or office in their own home town. By spreading the process over ten years, the Government will be able to announce good news for certain towns without having to say, in the short-term, that other towns are not part of the programme.</P>
      <P>In the Clare constituency, Kilrush, which is part of the integrated Shannon decentralisation network, ISDN, in partnership with Listowel and Newcastle, has also prepared a submission. All three towns are ideal locations for Government Departments. Like other towns on the west coast, Kilrush has suffered depopulation in recent times. In 1986, Kilrush urban district had a population of 2,961 but by 1996, this figure had decreased to 2,594 and the 2002 figure will show a similar drop. These are the realities. Rural west Clare is dying and one Government Department for Kilrush would be like creating 10,000 new jobs for greater Dublin. Kilrush has the attractions, services, availability of building sites and a good quality of life, free from the traffic jams of our capital city.</P>
      <P>How will the Government deliver a Government Department to Kilrush, Listowel and Newcastle West? First, the constituencies of Clare, Limerick West and Kerry North have no Cabinet Minister, so there is no one to lobby their case at the Cabinet table. None of the towns is listed as a hub or gateway in the spatial strategy document and, as we all know, hubs and gateways are the terms used for potential growth areas where jobs or investments are targeted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The strategic rail review is another 20-year aspirational document that can be summed up in <Col N="1215" /> the six words, &ldquo;all railway lines lead to Dublin&rdquo;. Will Dáil Deputies continue to get the same standard replies to our parliamentary questions, such as &ldquo;submissions and representations have been received by my Department and a case for your town will be given consideration as part of the deliberative process&rdquo;? The time has come for action. The need to take pressure off Dublin has never been greater and this has been acknowledged by everyone. The people will not be conned again. Time is running out and payback time for the people will come in the local and European elections in 2004. If action is not taken to fulfil the commitment to transfer 10,000 of the 18,000 civil servants, who have applied for the Government's long-awaited decentralisation programme, the Minister for State and his colleagues will face the consequences.</P>

      <P>I welcome this debate which is important for all areas of the country and congratulate Deputy Connaughton on his initiative in bringing forward this motion. Certain areas were promised that they would be part of a decentralisation programme but there is a limited amount to go around. Promises were previously made in relation to Newcastle West and in recent days Deputies from the Government parties have made statements which suggest we can expect an announcement shortly that will be to its benefit and that of the rest of my constituency.</P>
      <P>Our expectations were raised prior to the general election that we would soon hear announcements in our favour. In reply to a parliamentary question regarding decentralisation to Newcastle West, which I tabled on 12 June 2001, the Minister for Finance stated: &ldquo;The position with regard to a new programme of decentralisation remains that it is my intention that the Government will be in a position to take decisions in relation to such a programme within the next couple of months.&rdquo;  Obviously, that did not happen. I wonder why. Was it something to do with the impending election and the various promises that were made? </P>

Everyone is claiming their town should get a Department or a section thereof. The ISDN project has been developed by Shannon Development, a State body, to introduce real decentralisation to a region rather than a town or city. It incorporates three different counties and I wish to highlight the uniqueness of the proposal in that regard. There is an opportunity to decentralise a full Department to a region in this case. This will offer an opportunity to those who transfer to the region of having a follow-up career path. They will be able to seek promotion and develop their <Col N="1216" /> career within the region because of the easy access between Kilrush, Newcastle West and Listowel and will also come to an area which is well-serviced. Limerick city has a marvellous university and institute of technology, as well as all the other facilities people would need.</P>

      <P>A number of issues have emerged in this debate over the past two nights. The proposal to relocate 10,000 civil servants has been dropped. Neither the Minister of State nor any other member of the Government has mentioned that figure. In my opening speech last night, I said that one of the reasons the programme was not going ahead was that there was dissension in the Cabinet. There was certainly dissent before the Minister of State arrived tonight. If he reads the Minister's speech, he will see that he said decentralisation will happen when it suits the Minister for Finance and the Government. He also referred to some of the parish-pump politics that had been going on in the midlands.</P>
      <P>We have learned new information during this debate, but we also had some information before it. We know that the decentralisation of Government Departments is a win-win situation for everyone. I do not have time to go back over all the ground but every area to which a Department has been decentralised has prospered. There are enough people around the country who want to live and work in their own area. The Government's fig-leaf that our figures are wrong is nonsense. The Minister for Defence, Deputy Smith, made a fool of himself last night when that was all he spoke about.</P>
      <P>At the end of the day, the Government did not clarify when this part of the decentralisation programme would start. It has spent three years at it. I predicted last night that it would not come into effect for several years and I am now saying that again. The Minister of State did not say anything to the contrary, nor did the Ministers for Defence or Finance.</P>

      <P>I do not know whether it is that they do not have the money or that they cannot agree among themselves, but whatever it is, they are doing rural Ireland a disservice by not giving an opportunity to the 110 groups all over this country that have ploughed their hard-earned funds into producing plans, which are a credit to them, to try to make the case for their areas. We asked for transparency. We wanted to know how <Col N="1218" /> it would be done and to make sure it would not be at the whim of a particular Minister. That is what the Progressive Democrats want too.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Healy</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad of the opportunity to raise this matter and to request that the Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment intervene in the continuing laying off of staff at John Ronan and Sons, Dudleys Mills, Clonmel, and make a statement on the matter.</P>
      <P>Approximately 100 workers have been laid off by this company, 90 in Clonmel and ten in a store in Dublin. The factory has three elements: a hide tannery, a sheepskin tannery and a hide and sheepskin trade. The 100 staff have loyal service to the Ronan family ranging from ten to 44 years, most at the upper end of that range. Many have more than 30 years service.</P>
      <P>The company laid off the staff on 1 April last for an initial period to the beginning of May with the intention of reviewing the position at that stage. It did that and extended the lay-off period to 7 October. The company has indicated that there are trading difficulties and instanced the war in Iraq as one of the difficulties affecting it.</P>
      <P>The workers are not happy with what has been indicated in this regard because it is clear that business is available. A tannery close by, Michel Ireland in Portlaw, which is not far from Clonmel, has in recent weeks advertised for workers to allow for a 50% increase in its workload. A hide company in the Longford area has also taken over a significant amount of the business of the Ronan factory. There is a concern that business exists to be worked on but other motives are behind the lay-offs. Will the Minister of State address the continuing indications that there is a deal with another company which will involve the closure of Ronan's and the transfer of the business to another company, Michel Ireland, in Portlaw?</P>
      <P>The workers are trying to establish the right to their jobs and, if that is not possible, to a decent redundancy deal. Of late, they have organised a sit-in on the premises to ensure either their jobs are protected or a reasonable redundancy deal is offered.</P>
      <P>I appeal to the Tánaiste to intervene in this dispute. This company is an old established industry in the Clonmel area which began around 1957. It has provided almost 50 years employment in the area, has a tradition of families in the area working for it and a substantial number of the workforce have up to 44 years service with the company. I appeal to the Tánaiste to intervene to ensure the company is viable or a decent redundancy deal is made available to the workforce.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan" hpid="Mr. B. Lenihan Mr. B. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children (Mr. B. Lenihan)</NameTxt>
      <P>In March 2003 John Ronan and Sons Limited, which operates a tannery in Clonmel, announced that it had decided to withdraw temporarily from the tanning business due to a slump in demand and reduced orders. The company laid off a number of process operatives and indicated that these lay-offs would be for a temporary period during which the company would endeavour to build up <Col N="1222" /> its order book with a view to re-entering the market. The company has been in operation in Clonmel for more than 40 years and has made an enormous contribution to the economy of the town and the surrounding area.</P>
      <P>Employees of the company, due to perceived uncertainties as to future activities, began a sit-in at the company's premises early in April. This sit-in, which was undertaken by members of the Amalgamated Transport and General Workers Union, is an unofficial action.</P>
      <P>The Tánaiste has stated in the House on many occasions that it is not appropriate for her to intervene in such disputes. The role of the State is to provide the dispute resolution machinery for the parties to use in the event of a dispute, and the Labour Relations Commission and the Labour Court have been established for that purpose. The parties should utilise the expert services of the commission and the court to avoid disruption and settle their dispute. The experience and expertise of these services are available free of charge to disputing parties and offer the best avenue for resolving their differences. Ultimately, however, it is the responsibility of the parties concerned to ensure that agreement is reached.</P>
      <P>The Labour Relations Commission had contacts with both sides in an effort to bring the parties together. However, the State's dispute resolution machinery should not be utilised while unofficial industrial action by the affected employees continues. Accordingly, I call upon the employees to suspend their unofficial action and avail of the services of the Labour Relations Commission and Labour Court, as appropriate.</P>
      <P>Deputy Healy divided his claim into two parts, one for redundancy and one for the security of the employment, but the Labour Court could at least address the issue of redundancy were that to be the end resolution in this issue. Settlement of industrial disputes requires the goodwill of both sides. I take this opportunity to encourage both sides to demonstrate their goodwill and desire to resolve this impasse by engaging in dialogue, either bilaterally or through the dispute resolution machinery.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>We have heard a lot in recent weeks about the amount of cutbacks since the election. I do not think there are any as harsh and miserly as those being implemented by the health board regarding cutting community-based services to the elderly. The savings being made are paltry. Much of the work is carried out by volunteers. If meals on wheels and other community-based support services to the elderly were staffed by the health board or the Department of Health and Children, it would cost a much greater amount compared with the volunteer service which operates at a fraction of the cost. These services are provided voluntarily by people and it serves as a bonding force in the community.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In April, the East Wall day care centre received a letter from the health board informing it there would be a reduction of &euro;100 per month <Col N="1223" /> in the funding for meals on wheels from May 2003. The centre was informed that this money would be taken from its existing surplus. Prior to that, a bevy of administrators had examined the operation of the East Wall service and found that it had a deficit of &euro;3,800. How can that possibly be taken from an existing surplus? The centre had told the health board of the difficulties it was experiencing in providing a five-day service because of the shortage of volunteers. At that time it asked for one key worker to be provided and the health board agreed to that request as long as the day care centre met the requirements of the health inspector &ndash; that it operate a five-day service and liaise with CERT for training. The centre met those requirements but the health board cut its miserly &euro;1.27 per meal &ndash; one old pound &ndash; by &euro;100 per month. To compound the situation, Dublin City Council imposed a commercial bin charge.</P>
    <P>The same letter informed the centre that the current grant allocation for Iona parish will remain unchanged. Iona parish is one of the wealthiest parishes in Dublin Central and East Wall parish is a very deprived parish. How can a health board exercise its discretion regarding providing subsidies and grants to day care centres in this discriminatory fashion? </P>
    <P>Cutbacks in funding by the Department of Health and Children are blamed for the cutbacks in the region of &euro;20,000 to the meals on wheels service to the elderly in the north inner city area. I find it unbelievable that such a thing can happen in this day and age. The health board's administrators knew that the centre was in deficit and was operating thanks to voluntary effort, but it imposed a cutback of &euro;100 per month to further reduce the funding available and then reneged on its promise to provide one full-time key worker to help out because of the shortage of volunteers.</P>
    <P>Elderly people who are unable to cook for themselves and who are disabled will fill up the hospitals. This is an essential service and the Minister should ensure there is reasonable funding available.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan" hpid="Mr. B. Lenihan Mr. B. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I make this reply on behalf of the Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children, Deputy Callely, who has special responsibility for this area within the Department of Health and Children. The provision of health-related services for older people in north Dublin is a matter, in the first instance, for the Northern Area Health Board operating under the aegis of the Eastern Regional Health Authority. Government policy regarding the care of older people is to maintain them in dignity in their own homes for as long as possible in accordance with their wishes. Since 1997 my Department has allocated significant levels of funding to services for older people, resulting in substantial advances in the quality and quantity of the health-related services being provided.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the case of services for older persons, approximately &euro;230 million of additional funding has been provided to the health boards since 2000. A range of services, including the home <Col N="1224" /> help service, community support structures, the support of carers, support for the Alzheimer's Society of Ireland and various voluntary groups have been developed and there have been improvements in staff ratios and in funding for the nursing home subvention scheme.</P>
    <P>I am glad to say that additional funding for non-capital investment was made available in 2003 and a large proportion of this funding was allocated to the health services. This funding is being applied largely to maintaining existing levels of service across all service programmes, including services for older persons. In 2002, 16,510 persons received a meals on wheels service in the Northern Area Health Board region. It is acknowledged this is a valuable community support service that enables older people to live in dignity in their own homes for as long as possible. During 2002, the Northern Area Health Board examined various protocols to ensure a more efficient use of resources as well as the upgrading of premises and equipment and of training of staff in food safety hygiene standards. Unfortunately, the withdrawal of community employment workers who were employed in this service has led to reduced services in some areas.</P>
    <P>The authority has advised my Department that the meals on wheels service for 2003 is under review with the intention of putting a substantial proposal for the expansion of this service to my Department later this year. This proposal will be considered in the context of funding available to my Department in 2004. The authority has further advised that it will ensure that the meals on wheels service being provided to older persons in 2003 will be prioritised on the basis of those most in need.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelFinneranFF" hpid="Mr. Finneran Mr. Finneran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Finneran</NameTxt>
      <P>I ask the Government to address the anomaly which has arisen between the national car testing unit and the motor industry regarding changes in the national car test which it is proposed to implement on 1 June 2003.</P>
      <P>Car testing has been introduced on a phased basis and, during this phase, failures on certain non-safety critical items do not constitute reasons for refusal of an NCT certificate. They are known in the trade as fail advisory items.</P>
      <P>I appreciate and fully understand that the phased implementation of the test has a lot to do with the high level of public support which it enjoys. It helped to avoid excessive failure rates that would have followed had the full rigours of car testing been implemented from day one and which had the potential to seriously undermine public credibility in the system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The NCT is now firmly established and is helping to change the attitude of car owners towards adopting a more sensible and responsible approach to regular safety checks and servicing of their vehicles. The principal test items which still are classified as &ldquo;fail advisory&rdquo; include headlight alignment, the performance of shock absorbers, side slip, type approval markings on windscreens and a number of visual checks, including a check that vehicle registration plates <Col N="1225" /> conform to statutory requirements. I understand also that in line with the commitment at the onset of testing all reasons for failure of the NCT would over a three year period become reasons for refusal of a certificate and it is the intention of the Minister to complete the transition this year. I have been informed by the motor industry that regulations to provide for this will be made within the coming weeks.</P>
    <P>The changes from &ldquo;fail advisory&rdquo; to &ldquo;fail refusal&rdquo; now to be introduced is likely to give rise to significant difficulties. The motor industry and the public are gravely concerned at the difficulties and at the cost to motorists. In preparation for the introduction of headlight alignment as a test refusal reason, the Department, the national car testing service and the Society for the Irish Motor Industry have been working closely together to ensure best practice in headlight setting and testing, but to date have not reached an agreed practice. I understand that the national car testing service recognises its responsibility for correct testing of headlights alignment and has invested significant additional resources to upgrade its system through the introduction of laser technology and enhanced training for vehicle inspectors. The kernel of the problem is that on the issue of headlight alignment, the motor industry to date has not reached an agreed standard with the national car testing service. It is in no one's interest to have a situation where uncertainty in the reliability of headlight aim servicing is a real prospect when defective headlighting becomes a reason for refusal of an NCT certificate.</P>
    <P>I would like to take the opportunity to ask the Minister to address the problem that has arisen by possibly deferring the new code of practice and at the same time encouraging equipment suppliers, and anyone else in the trade having a role in the headlight alignment, to commit to achieving the Irish standard without delay so that car owners will be sure of getting their headlights set accurately. Otherwise the NCT failure rate will shoot to the sky and bring a major financial burden on motorists.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMcDaid" hpid="Dr. McDaid Dr. McDaid">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Transport (Dr. McDaid)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Deputy for bringing this matter to our attention. Given the information available, I wonder where the problem arises.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Car testing is being implemented on a phased basis. In preparing for the final phase, my Department has been in continuous consultation with the national car testing service and the Society of the Irish Motor Industry to ensure a smooth transition. In addition, a comprehensive benchmarking service is being operated generally at local level by individual garages and their local NCT centres. In the present phase, failures, as has been pointed out by the Deputy, on certain non-safety critical items, known as &ldquo;fail advisory&rdquo; items, do not constitute reasons for refusing a test certificate but the owner is obliged to have the defects rectified. The method of testing for each item is set out in the Department's 1999 National Car Test Manual and is not different if a test item is classified &ldquo;fail refusal&rdquo; or &ldquo;fail advisory&rdquo;. The <Col N="1226" /> actual test to which a car is subjected at an NCT has not changed since it was introduced in 2000. What has changed is that we have been moving incrementally to a situation where failure on any item will mean that defects will have to be remedied, and a retest passed, before an NCT certificate will issue.</P>
    <P>In line with the commitment at the outset of testing that all of the reasons for failure of the NCT would over a three year period become reasons for refusal of a certificate, it is the intention to complete the transition this year. The move to make failure on any test item a reason for refusal of a certificate has the support of the Society of the Irish Motor Industry, which had reservations about distinguishing between reasons for refusal and fail advisory faults and sought that the test be implemented in full at the earliest date possible. The changes which will come into effect this year are unlikely to give rise to any significant difficulties, with the exception of headlight alignment. As with international experience, the failure rate for light alignment has been consistently high since the introduction of testing.</P>
    <P>In preparation for the introduction of light alignment as a test refusal reason, my Department has been working closely together with the national car testing service and the Society of the Irish Motor Industry to ensure best practice in headlight setting and testing. This led to the drawing up of an Irish standard for head lamp aim test equipment and floor area requirement which provides detailed and practical information on all relevant matters associated with headlight alignment so as to enable it to be carried out accurately. The standard has been distributed widely, including to motor distributors and service garages. The Department, NCTS and SIMI in a joint newsletter to the motor trade before last Christmas gave advance notice of the pending classification changes and alerted garages to the need to carry out the necessary preparations, including equipment installation and calibration, as well as staff training, so as to be ready when defective headlight alignment would become a reason for refusal of an NCT certificate, tentatively indicated as June 2003. Given this level of co-operation in preparing for the final phase, there is no question of an anomalous situation between the Department, NCTS and SIMI in relation to the headlight alignment or any of the other test items which will become reasons for refusal of a certificate later this year.</P>
    <P>I am conscious at this time that car owners could experience difficulty in getting headlights set accurately. However, I am confident the situation will not remain for much longer as individual motor garages, together with the Society of the Irish Motor Industry, have committed to full implementation of the standard on headlight alignment. While the changes will not now come into effect on 1 June 2003, I am determined they will apply in 2003, sooner rather than later. Accordingly, it is my intention that the necessary regulations will be made within the next couple of weeks.</P>

      <P>This applies to a constituent who has suffered from a serious back problem for some time. The reply to my parliamentary question of 7 May was as follows:</P>
      <P>The person concerned applied for an invalidity pension on 10 December 2002. He is currently receiving disability benefit of &euro;241.20 per week, including qualified dependant allowance and child dependant allowance in respect of two children.</P>
      <P>To qualify for invalidity pension an applicant must be permanently incapable of work and satisfy certain PRSI conditions. The person concerned was examined on 24 February 2003 by a medical assessor of my Department who expressed the opinion that he was currently incapable of work but not permanently so.</P>
      <P>As a medical practitioner, the Ceann Comhairle knows what his reaction to that would be. His first reaction would be to ask how long he has been inflicted by the illness. The answer to that question is 15 years, but the medical assessor has decided he is not permanently so. To my mind, if one took into account the number of times he was examined, assessed and put through the system, and saved all that money, it would be better to pay him, because there is no huge difference in the amount of payment. It is merely a question of the category into which he falls. In fact, he could opt for rehabilitative work with the approval of the Department, which might be beneficial to him. However, he cannot do that while he is on disability benefit because he would break his continuity of service and might end up without a qualification for any payment aside from a means-tested payment.</P>
      <P>The Minister of State and I know the story. I know what is written in his reply before I see it. I plead with him not to read out what I have just explained to the House. It is a simple matter. The Minister of State needs to give a direction to have the matter reviewed, by way of appeal or whatever the case may be, as soon as possible. I hope this will not go on for another 15 years because I cannot deal with it for much longer.</P>

      <P>The parliamentary question referred to concerns a person who is currently in receipt of disability benefit. Disability benefit is a short-term contribution based payment made to qualifying persons who are incapable of work due to illness or disability. The person concerned applied for an invalidity pension on 10 December 2002. To qualify for invalidity pension an applicant must meet the qualifying PRSI contribution conditions and must be permanently incapable of work as defined in legislation.</P>
      <P>For the purposes of the legislation, a person shall be regarded as being permanently incapable of work if immediately before the date of claim he or she has been continuously incapable of work for a period of one year and it is shown to the satisfaction of a deciding officer or an appeals officer that he or she is likely to continue to be incapable of work for at least a further year, or he or she is incapable of work and evidence is adduced to establish to the satisfaction of a deciding officer or an appeals officer that the incapacity for work is of such a nature that the likelihood is that the person will be incapable of work for life. The person concerned was examined on 24 February 2003 by a medical assessor of the Department who expressed the opinion that he was incapable of work. However, he did not regard the person concerned as being permanently incapable of work &ndash; I find difficulty with this if it has been 15 years &ndash; and asked that he be referred again for examination in nine months. In his medical report, the medical assessor indicated that the person concerned did not satisfy the medical criteria for invalidity pension.</P>
      <P>To be regarded as being permanently incapable of work in accordance with the legislation, the person concerned would have required a 12-month medical referral. Examinations are conducted in a fair, equitable, impartial and independent manner to the highest standards, in accordance with accepted medical practice and ethics. All reports of examinations carried out by medical assessors are submitted to the Department's chief medical adviser for approval.</P>
      <P>The person concerned was refused invalidity pension and was notified of this decision on 26 March 2003, the reasons for it and of his right of appeal to the independent social welfare appeals office. The decision was not appealed but the Deputy's parliamentary question was accepted by the appeals office as an appeal and this will be processed in due course.</P>
      <P>The Dáil adjourned at 9.25 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Thursday, 15 May 2003.</P>

      <P>The recent Referendum Commission report includes a recommendation concerning a mechanism for research and information on possible developments in the areas of holding referendums and increasing voter participation. In the recommendation, the commission expresses broad agreement with the thrust of a submission made by two private parties for the establishment of a new commission on a full-time basis to promote these functions.</P>
      <P>The need for research on possible developments in the area of holding referendums is not spelt out in detail in the Referendum Commission report and I propose to seek further clarification of this matter.</P>
      <P>As regards voter participation, one of the existing functions of the Referendum Commission is to promote public awareness of a referendum and encourage the electorate to vote at the poll. The experience gained by the commission will inform it of best practice for future referendums. My Department also sponsors information campaigns each year to encourage voters to ensure that they are registered both at register compilation stage and in the context of the supplement of the register. On voter education, my Department has made available, free of charge, several brochures on elections and referendums here.</P>
      <P>While I do not consider that the need for a full-time commission as suggested has been fully established, I will have the matter considered having regard to the commission's report, the recent changes in electoral and referendum legislation and the results of the CSO Quarterly National Household Survey on Voter Participation and Abstention.</P>

      <P>My Department understands that only three local authorities currently apply a weight based charging system. In addition, &ldquo;tag per bin&rdquo; systems, which also give an incentive for waste reduction, are in place in a number of other local authority areas.</P>
      <P>Government waste policy recognises that, as a matter of equity, and to give a direct incentive to waste prevention or minimisation and recycling, the level of waste charges imposed on households and businesses, either directly or through gate fees, should be based on usage. Accordingly, the Government expects that all local authorities will move towards introducing weight or volume related charging to the fullest extent possible within the three year target period and I will monitor progress in this regard.</P>
      <P>Research is currently under way on the effects of weight based charges for solid waste disposal, as part of the EPA Environmental Research, Technological Development and Innovation (RDTI) Programme, 2000-2006. The outputs from this research project should add significantly to available information on the subject and assist assessment of the potential impact of use-related charges on Irish waste management practice. This research study is scheduled to conclude in 2003.</P>

      <P>The current local authority mortgage interest rates are 3.35% variable and 4.45% for five year fixed.</P>
      <P>Certain fixed interest rate loans issued by local authorities prior to 1988 carry rates in excess of current levels. These fixed interest rates reflect the cost of the long-term funds involved.</P>
      <P>Since 1980, borrowers with local authority fixed rate mortgages have been permitted to redeem such loans without any interest rate penalty and refinance them in the private sector. This represents a significant concession, having regard to the redemption penalties, of up to six months interest or more, applied by commercial lending agencies in the event of early redemption of such mortgages.</P>
      <P>The position regarding high fixed interest rates on local authority loans was reviewed in November 2001, in consultation with the Department of Finance. This review determined that a State subsidy to reduce interest rates would not be appropriate.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 131 and 252 together.</P>
      <P>An effective basis for addressing our waste management responsibilities has been put in place through: the policy statement on waste management, Changing Our Ways; the policy statement, Preventing and Recycling Waste: Delivering Change; the waste management plans, largely prepared on a regional basis, adopted by the local authorities; and the comprehensive regulatory framework now in place in relation to waste.</P>
      <P>The Government's approach is based on the internationally recognised waste management hierarchy of prevention or minimisation, significantly increased levels of recycling, energy recovery and, finally, utilising landfill as the last resort for residual waste that cannot otherwise be recovered.</P>
      <P>The Government's priorities on waste management are now heavily focused on implementation. The main objectives are to: ensure that local authority waste management plans are fully and speedily implemented; intensify waste prevention efforts through an ambitious and well-resourced national waste prevention programme; significantly expand recycling efforts; extend producer responsibility initiatives at industry level; ensure that the volumes of waste going to landfill are significantly reduced; establish a number of new structures in support of waste management initiatives generally, and recycling in particular; and strengthen further the waste regulatory framework through the relevant provisions of the Protection of the Environment Bill 2003.</P>
      <P>Significant progress has been made in these areas over the past year or so, as highlighted in my response to Question No. 428 of 4 February 2003. In addition, I recently announced that some &euro;35 million of the proceeds of the environment fund is being earmarked for waste recycling and recovery activities this year.</P>
      <P>I am currently carrying out a national overview of the state of delivery of the objectives and targets set in the local authority waste management plans. I will consider what further steps may be necessary in light of this exercise which I expect to conclude shortly.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment and Local Government (Mr. Cullen)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government has responded actively to the increased level of social housing need by significantly expanding housing output. Last year more than 12,700 units of social and affordable housing were provided compared to less than 8,700 units in 2000. Local authority housing output of 5,074 units was achieved in 2002, the highest level for 16 years. The voluntary and co-operative housing sector continued to play an increasingly significant role in the provision of social housing with output of 1,360 units, the highest level ever recorded. Activity is also increasing significantly under the affordable housing and shared ownership schemes. As many as 882 affordable housing units were built in 2002, three times the output in 2001, and some 1,686 households benefited under the shared ownership scheme.</P>
      <P>The total capital funding for housing this year is &euro;1.7 billion an increase of almost 7% on the amount provided in 2002. It is anticipated that this funding will enable the needs of more than 12,000 households to be met this year. Spending on the local authority housing programme alone is about 15% ahead of the forecast under the National Development Plan 2000-06. The provision for this programme in 2003 is &euro;695 million which will allow local authorities to increase house starts in 2003.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The provisions under Part V of the Planning and Development Act 2000, as amended, will also assist in the delivery of social and affordable housing. The housing initiative included in the <Col N="1233" /> new national partnership agreement Sustaining Progress also seeks to increase the supply of affordable housing.</P>
    <P>The current level of public investment in housing is significant. The need to ensure that we are making optimal use of available resources in meeting housing needs is reflected in Sustaining Progress. It provides for a review of the effectiveness of programmes designed to assist low income groups, including those with social housing needs and special housing needs.</P>

      <P>My Department is working with the local authority interests concerned to progress the recommendations of the Review of Fire Safety and Fire Services report. I intend for this process to be managed through a high level implementation group with participation from the key stakeholders, including the County and City Managers' Association and the Chief Fire Officers Association.</P>
      <P>There is consensus on many priority areas for advancement. These include: the development of community fire safety programmes to shift the current focus from responding to fires to fire prevention; the adoption of a risk based approach to the determination of fire cover standards in keeping with best international practice; the introduction of a competency based approach to recruitment, retention and career progression within the fire service; and the issue of merging local authority fire services and building control functions with the objective of providing an improved customer service and better enforcement of building regulations.</P>
      <P>The implementation process for the review must also take account of significant changes in the institutional and budgetary situation since the publication of recommendations early in 2002. In the meantime, the Government has developed new structures for emergency planning, civil defence and marine and inland water safety services. These changes make it less practicable to contemplate, for the short-term at least, a merger of these functions in a new agency as recommended by the review.</P>
      <P>For these reasons, I intend that the implementation process for the review should focus on matters which are within the remit of my Department and the local authorities. These could include, in addition to the matters outlined, an enhanced role for the statutory Fire Services Council.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1234" />Tangible evidence of Government commitment to developing and modernising fire and emergency services nationwide is that since 1998 this Government has invested more than &euro;66 million in capital funding for the service, with a capital allocation of more than &euro;18.5 million in 2003. This has seen 33 new fire stations completed, including 11 completed last year. The purchase of more than 130 fire appliances has also been approved.</P>
    <P>I expect the Licensing of Indoor Events Bill will be enacted by the end of May. It will extend the range of options for fire authority inspectors to deal with fire safety risks in premises which they identify on inspection. The Bill will also strengthen the enforcement powers of senior fire officers under the Fire Services Act 1981. It specifically provides for the issue of a closure notice by the authorised fire inspector in circumstances of a grave and immediate danger to the safety of persons on a premises.</P>

The awarding or withdrawal of a Blue Flag is decided by FEE. My Department provides grant aid to An Taisce as a contribution towards the administration expenses of the scheme in Ireland. My Department has requested a report from An Taisce on options and measures which might be pursued for increasing the number of flags awarded to bathing areas in Ireland. An Taisce is currently undertaking research in the matter and results are expected in June.</P>
      <P>The major programme of investment being promoted by my Department on urban waste water treatment in coastal areas will have a significant positive effect on the quality of bathing waters in the surrounding areas, their associated designated bathing areas. It could also lead to an increase in the number of flags awarded. Under this ongoing programme we are on target for full compliance with the 2005 requirements of the EU Urban Wastewater Directive. It will eliminate untreated sewage discharges from all coastal towns with a population equivalent to 2,000 or more.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment and Local Government (Mr. Cullen)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 139, 148 and 162 together.</P>
      <P>Last month the Government approved a new set of arrangements governing the discharge by the State of its heritage functions. Under these new arrangements the Minister for the Environment and Local Government retains responsibility for policy and operational matters relating to our natural heritage. He also retains responsibility for built heritage policy &ndash; including architecture and archaeology. The operational and management functions in relation to built heritage will be transferred to the Office of Public Works. Rather than utilising the separate Dúchas brand, which has been in place for several years, my Department will be renamed the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government. The role of the Heritage Council, particularly <i>vis-à-vis</i> the policy role of my Department, will be redefined. There will be a progressive expansion of the remit of local authorities in heritage matters.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These changes were approved following the completion of a comprehensive review initiated last summer. The review was set against the background of the announcement by the Taoiseach in June 2002 of details of the new Government and changes in the distribution of functions between <Col N="1237" /> Departments. As part of the review process I made arrangements for consultation with staff working in the heritage area, the trade unions concerned, the Heritage Council and the CCMA. A draft report of the review was provided for consultation. All of the written submissions received were considered in the context of finalising the new arrangements.</P>
    <P>The organisational changes approved on foot of the review are designed to achieve the optimum use of the organisational resources available to Government. They build on my Department's strengths in terms of experience of regulation and policy development, particularly in the environmental area, and the strong tradition of the Office of Public Works in the areas of conservation and property management. Provision is also being made for the establishment of a high level heritage liaison group to provide a framework for effective interaction between both organisations.</P>
    <P>Prior to changes in the distribution of heritage functions between Departments the national heritage plan was published in April 2002. It included a commitment to review the Heritage Act 1995 under which the council was established. A preliminary phase of that review was undertaken as part of the broader examination of heritage organisational arrangements finalised last month. It concluded that there was a need to redefine the council's role, particularly to ensure clarity regarding the respective responsibilities of the council and my Department. The relevant findings of the report will serve to guide the second phase of the review which will consider the future role of the council in detail.</P>
    <P>The new arrangements announced last month will enable the State to discharge its responsibilities in safeguarding and promoting our heritage.</P>

      <P>Ireland signed and ratified the Council of Europe's European Landscape Convention on 22 March 2002. The purpose of the convention is to encourage public authorities to adopt policies and measures at local, regional, national and international level. These policies aim to protect, manage and plan landscapes throughout Europe to maintain and improve landscape quality, to bring the public, institutions and local and regional authorities to recognise the value and importance of landscape and to take part in related public decisions.</P>

      <P>I refer the Deputy to the reply to Question No. 293 of 1 April.</P>
      <P>I received a response from the UK Secretary of State for Trade and Industry, Ms Patricia Hewitt, MP, on 16 April. This restates the position of the UK Government on nuclear security. It outlined the contacts on this matter between Ireland and the UK and sets out the internationally agreed standards and principles concerning nuclear safety, referring in particular to the International Atomic Energy Agency guidance on the Physical Protection of Nuclear Materials. I appreciated the detailed response. However, it does not contain new information but reiterates UK Government policy on the confidentiality of security sensitive information.</P>
      <P>In the Secretary of State's response she invited me to publish the contents of her letter and it is as follows:</P>
      <P>16 April 2003</P>
      <P>Martin Cullen Esq TD</P>
      <P>Minister for the Environment and Local Government</P>
      <P>Custom House</P>
      <P>Dublin</P>
      <P>Eire</P>
      <P>Dear Minister</P>
      <P>Thank you for your letter of 28 March. I appreciate that concerns about the possibility of terrorist attacks against nuclear installations have been prominent in Ireland in recent months and am aware of the various approaches Ireland has made to the UK Government about this issue. You will also be aware of the recent correspondence between the Taoiseach and the Prime Minister concerning the prospect of acts of terrorism at facilities at Sellafield. As the Prime Minister said, the United Kingdom is not complacent about the threat of terrorism against civil nuclear facilities and continues to take proper steps to ensure that effective and robust measures are in place to counter these risks.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1239" />You say that &ldquo;the response of the UK Government to date has been that such arrangements are a matter of national security and are for the UK to manage.&rdquo; While the statement &ldquo;such arrangements are a matter of national security and are for the UK to manage&rdquo; is in itself quite correct, I do not feel this properly reflects the response the Government of Ireland has received from the UK Government to the matters that have been raised.</P>
    <P>There has been substantive correspondence between our officials through which the UK has sought to address as fully as possible the issues raised by the Government of Ireland. We have explained the processes followed by the UK Government to assess the threat, evaluate vulnerabilities and develop effective counter measures and have explained the reasons why we do not disclose more detailed information. We have sought to be as open and co-operative as we can with Ireland about these matters subject to ensuring the necessary confidentiality of security sensitive information.</P>
    <P>In London on 16 July 2002, officials of the Irish Government and the Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland attended a specially arranged private briefing on these matters given by the Director for Civil Nuclear Security and the Chief Inspector of Nuclear Installations. Information was provided about the way in which, following the events of September 2001, the Office of Civil Nuclear Security, the security regulator, has worked closely with the Health and Safety Executive, the safety regulator, to review the safety implications of events, including external hazards such as plane crashes, at nuclear installations. It was explained that a range of additional measures have been introduced or are in the process of being introduced to further improve security precautions and implement and improvements that might be achieved in managing the effects of any event. Some new measures introduced will be visible as they involve additional physical barriers or other engineered features or increased perimeter security arrangements at sites. Other measures will not be visible and details must remain confidential.</P>
    <P>As we have explained, the UK does not disclose outside the UK Government details of the threat assessments we have made, details about the physical robustness of installations against terrorist attacks, about the measures in place to address such threats, about the potential damage that might be caused by an attack or about counter-measures in place to minimise any potential effects. Access to such information is limited strictly to those that need it for the performance of their duties. The reason for this is that such information could be of use to <Col N="1240" /> someone seeking to carry out a malicious attack. We understand that the Irish authorities have declined to give details of security arrangements, for example at Irish airports, for precisely the same reason.</P>
    <P>We have pointed out that our approach to non-disclosure of such detailed information is consistent with internationally agreed standards and principles concerning nuclear security. These principals are set out in guidance published by the International Atomic Energy Agency &ndash; The Physical Protection of Nuclear Material and Nuclear Facilities (INFCIRC/225/Rev4). The guidelines confirm at section 4.1.2 that &ldquo;The responsibility for the establishment, implementation and maintenance of a physical protection system within a state rests entirely with that state&rdquo; and section 4.1.4 goes on to say that &ldquo;The state should continuously review the threat, and evaluate the implications of any changes in that threat for the levels and methods of physical protection.&rdquo;  Sections 4.3.1 and 4.3.2 relate specifically to the protection of confidential information. These read as follows:</P>
    <P>4.3.1 The state should take steps to ensure appropriate protection of specific or detailed information the unauthorised disclosure of which could compromise the physical protection of nuclear materials and nuclear facilities. It should define requirements for the confidentiality of physical protection systems and associated documentation.</P>
    <P>4.3.2. Management of physical protection systems should limit access to sensitive information to those who need to know for the performance of their duties. Information addressing possible vulnerabilities in physical protection systems should be highly protected as it could indicate means of successfully removing nuclear material or of carrying out sabotage.</P>
    <P>The Convention on Physical Protection of Nuclear Material is also relevant. Article 6(2) of the Convention provides:</P>
    <P>States Parties shall not be required by this Convention to provide any information which they are not permitted to communicate pursuant to national law or which would jeopardise the security of the State concerned or the physical protection of nuclear material.</P>
    <P>That nuclear facilities might be a target for acts of terrorism has long been understood. Sellafield is certainly one of these sites in the UK that needs to be properly protected against such acts, although it is certainly not a unique target for these.</P>
    <P>I am aware that the media in Ireland recently devoted considerable attention to an event where an individual &ndash; accompanied <Col N="1241" /> by a journalist &ndash; set up a banner at the perimeter fence of the Sellafield site and took photographs. This event is presented in such a way as to suggest that site security had been breached and that the individual had been allowed to get within reach of sensitive facilities on the site. In fact, the protest did not involve any breach of the perimeter fence and events were monitored closely at all times by Sellafield's security personnel. The individuals involved left the area when officers of the UK Atomic Energy Authority Constabulary approached them. The officers subsequently caught up with the individuals and spoke to them but took no further action.</P>
    <P>Those responsible for ensuring security at civil nuclear sites recognise the right of individuals to demonstrate outside nuclear sites or during transport operations. Should protesters seek to carry out actions of a more irresponsible nature that try to bypass security precautions or otherwise cause danger to themselves and others, security staff must respond accordingly. They must distinguish between protest actions and genuine threats to site security. Physical security at nuclear sites is based on a series of defensive rings. The first and most obvious is the perimeter fence of the site. This is carefully monitored and controlled so that any intruders would be detected and appropriate action could be taken. In the event that intruders were considered to represent a serious threat rather than protest action, the response measures would, of course, be of a nature appropriate to that situation.</P>
    <P>I hope this helps to explain the actions taken by the UK and our position on disclosure of detailed information. We are satisfied that arrangements for ensuring security in the UK's civil nuclear security are robust and that additional measures we have put in place since September 2001 to reinforce security are appropriate. This should not be taken to suggest complacency on our part. Security arrangements are subject to continual review.</P>
    <P>In view of public and Parliamentary concern in Ireland about these matters, I would be content for you to publish this correspondence or place it in the Oireachtas Library if you felt this would be of some assistance.</P>
    <P>Yours sincerely,</P>

      <P>The Government's concerns about old Magnox reactors, such as those at the Wylfa nuclear power plant, have been made known to the UK authorities both at official and ministerial level on numerous occasions. We have consistently called for the early closure of these reactors which continue to operate well beyond their original design life. The Wylfa Nuclear Plant at Anglesey is due to be decommissioned in 2010.</P>
      <P>Ireland has also responded critically to various UK public consultation processes concerning the regulation of the UK nuclear industry covering such matters as the management of radioactive waste in the UK, a review of UK energy policy and the UK strategy for discharges from nuclear installations.</P>
      <P>The Government has repeatedly pointed out that the risks and unresolved problems associated with the nuclear energy industry, when added to high research and capital costs, including decommissioning costs, as well as continued additional safety and security costs, mean that nuclear energy is not sustainable.</P>

In that context the Oireachtas Committee on the Constitution has been asked by the Taoiseach to assess the possibility of placing a cap on the value of development land. In doing so the committee will have to consider the constitutional and practical issues involved. The Government will give due consideration to any recommendations made by that committee, including any recommendations for change to the Constitution.

      <P>The significant increase, from &euro;850,000 in 2002 to &euro;1.689 million in 2003, in the allocation to the nuclear safety subhead of my Department's Vote reflects the costs arising from the pursuit of two international legal actions by the Government against the UK in relation to the commissioning of the Sellafield Mox Plant, and additional costs arising in the ongoing development of the nuclear emergency response plan.</P>
      <P>The legal action taken by the Government under the OSPAR Convention is based on the refusal, by the UK, of access to certain information on grounds of commercial sensitivity. Ireland is seeking access to the information to carry out an independent evaluation of the environmental impacts of, and economic case for, the plant to ensure that the plant was justified as required under EU law. Following oral hearings in these proceedings in the Permanent Court of Arbitration &ndash; PCA &ndash; in the Hague in October 2002, determination in the case is awaited.</P>
      <P>Separate legal proceedings against the UK under the 1982 UN Convention on the Law of the Sea relate to the threat to the marine environment from the continued operation and expansion of Sellafield, the threat to the Irish Sea from shipments of nuclear materials and the inadequacy of the 1993 Environmental Impact Statement for the MOX Plant. The written phases of the proceedings were completed in April 2003 and oral hearings will begin on 10 June 2003.</P>
      <P>These international legal actions are unprecedented and involve extensive legal and scientific research to ensure that Ireland's claims are prepared, presented and argued cogently at the relevant international arbitral tribunals. The additional costs provided for underline the Government's commitment to pursuit of the claims made in the legal actions.</P>
      <P>Additional costs will also arise this year in implementing measures based on consultancy recommendations following the exercise of the nuclear emergency response plan in November 2001. Proposals arising from the recommendations of the consultants will shortly be brought to Government.</P>

      <P>The report prepared for the EPA, giving an estimated inventory of releases of dioxins and furans to the Irish environment in 2000, and projections for 2010, is a very useful contribution to our information base on dioxins in the environment, especially as it identifies the relative significance of various emission sources for dioxins.</P>
      <P>Overall the report indicates that Ireland generates relatively low amounts of dioxin &ndash; an estimated 93 grams in 2000 &ndash; and in this regard it supports the findings of earlier EPA surveys of dioxin levels in Irish cows milk, which showed an overall 16% reduction in the period 1995 to 2000, to levels that are uniformly low by international standards.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the context of ongoing criticism of proposals for the development of thermal treatment facilities, as part of an integrated waste management infrastructure, it is noteworthy that our existing nine hazardous waste incinerators were estimated to have contributed a fraction of 1% of national dioxin emissions to air in 2001. Even taking into account a projected incineration of 1 million tonnes per annum of municipal waste by 2010, the report estimates that waste incineration would <Col N="1245" /> contribute less than 2% of national dioxin emissions to air.</P>
    <P>By contrast, it is evident from the report that the biggest source of emissions to both air and land is, and is expected to remain, uncontrolled combustion processes &ndash; in particular the home burning of domestic waste, house and vehicle fires, and Halloween bonfires.</P>
    <P>Overall the report anticipates that annual dioxin emissions to air from all sources will fall by more than 10% by 2010. I intend to study the findings of this report carefully and to bring forward appropriate measures, both to support an improved information database on dioxins in the Irish environment and to pursue a progressive reduction in emissions, where those are achievable in practice.</P>

The guidelines, a copy of which is available in the Library, are intended to facilitate implementation of Government policy in the development of renewable sources of energy. They are designed to assist planning authorities in making suitable provision for wind farm development in their development plans and to ensure a consistency of approach throughout the country to the treatment of planning applications for such development.</P>
      <P>The guidelines are currently being reviewed in the light of experience since they were issued to ensure that they continue to be relevant and useful. As part of the review, a public consultation process has been undertaken. All comments received will be taken into consideration in the preparation of revised guidelines which I intend to issue later in the year.</P>
      <P>The Renewable Energy Information Office estimate that as of February 2003 planning permissions have been granted for 1018 MW capacity and that 25 wind farms with a capacity of 140 MW are operational.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment and Local Government (Mr. Cullen)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 149, 150, 160, 178 and 248 together.</P>
      <P>The ultimate objective of the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change &ndash; UNFCCC &ndash; is the stabilisation of greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere at a level that would prevent dangerous anthropogenic interference with the climate system, to be achieved within a time-frame sufficient, <i>inter alia,</i> to enable economic development to proceed in a sustainable manner. Thus, under the Kyoto Protocol to the UNFCCC all countries, including Ireland, negotiated a real, meaningful and challenging target that require going beyond business-as-usual. Given the complexity of the task, the time frame involved is 15 years, of which some five years have now elapsed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Ireland has a Kyoto emissions growth limitation target of 13% over 1990 levels within the overall EU Kyoto reduction target of 8%, reflecting our contribution to the overall EU commitment and our need for economic develop<Col N="1247" /> ment. Our emissions of greenhouse gases were always expected to increase in the medium term, and we have ensured this was at a considerably slower rate than our unprecedented economic growth since the 1990s. Ireland is the most successful member state after Luxembourg in achieving a decoupling of emissions from economic growth since 1990. Emissions per unit of GDP are now 62% of what they were in 1990 compared to 78% for the EU as a whole.</P>
    <P>Ireland, however, has now the highest levels of emissions growth within the EU, reaching 31% in 2001 over 1990 levels. The European Environment Agency has identified us as among ten of 15 member states significantly challenged in relation to achieving their agreed share of the EU's Kyoto target. The substantial reductions achieved by some member states followed significant and abrupt structural changes occurring for other reasons. Recent data indicate some erosion of reduction gains beginning to occur as emissions for the EU as a whole rose in 2001.</P>
    <P>Our Kyoto obligations arise in the commitment period 2008-12. The Government's National Climate Change Strategy, published in November 2000, comprises a systematic programme towards meeting these obligations, and sets a ten-year policy framework for achieving the necessary emissions reductions.</P>
    <P>A progress report on the implementation of the strategy was published in May 2002. While this shows that measures in place or in progress are capable of achieving approximately 20% of the reductions required to meet our Kyoto Protocol obligations, continuing emissions increases due to volume growth in the economy mean that implementation of the strategy must be intensified. In essence, there has been progress in decoupling emissions growth from economic development, but the task now is to intensify this decoupling.</P>
    <P>Meeting our target is an important Government commitment, and I initiated a review of implementation of the strategy to ensure more focused and intensive implementation. I intend to publish the outcome of this review later in the year. I am satisfied that full implementation over the remainder of the decade, together with any additional measures which may be identified in the review, will ensure that our Kyoto obligations are fully met by the 2008-12 period, and any penalties are avoided.</P>
    <P>The EPA environmental research programme under the national development plan includes a major report on scenarios and impacts of climate change in Ireland, and I expect this to be published shortly. This will provide a basis for the agencies responsible for long-term planning, and where adaptation to climate change is relevant, to factor in the inevitable changes with greater confidence. Meeting our Kyoto target will be an important contribution to global efforts to tackle climate change, and I am satisfied that it can only be through long-term sustained reductions glo<Col N="1248" /> bally that the expected effects of climate change in Ireland can be ameliorated.</P>

      <P>My Department's submission was revised following representations from the owners of the land involved that the first submission was inconsistent with earlier advice given by my Department on this matter, and that the proposed rezoning could proceed without detriment to archaeology by the provision of an appropriate buffer zone. Having considered these representations, my Department advised Wicklow County Council of its view that a minimum buffer zone of 250 metres in the case of the Rath Turtle Moat and of 150 metres in the case of a separate recorded monument would provide appropriate archaeological protection in this case.</P>

      <P>Officials of my Department have had ongoing discussions with farm organisations since the statutory designation of lands and waters, including farm land, as special areas of conservation (SACs) commenced in 1997. The principal forum for these discussions has been a committee, known as the SAC monitoring committee, which comprises officials from my Department, the Department of Agriculture and Food and representatives of the major farming organisations. This committee has met frequently and has discussed all relevant issues and concerns relating to SACs and other areas designated for nature conservation purposes.</P>
      <P>I am aware of continuing concerns within the farming community regarding designation procedures and compensation provisions for these areas. In the context of the social partnership agreement, Sustaining Progress, the Government has recently agreed with the farming organisations to review the European Communities (Natural Habitats) Regulations 1997, under which SACs are designated. This review is to include issues of consultation with land owners and compensation for restrictions arising from the regulations. I anticipate discussions with the farming organisations on these issues at an early date.</P>

      <P>My Department has been actively engaged with the Society for the Irish Motor Industry (SIMI), the Irish Motor Vehicle Recyclers Association (IMVRA), the Metal Recyclers Association of Ireland (MRAI) and other parties concerned with a view to developing a producer responsibility initiative to implement the main provisions of European Parliament and Council Directive 2000/53/EC on end-of-life vehicles (ELVs). Under the directive, member states must ensure that the last holder or owner can deliver his or her end-of-life vehicle to an authorised treatment facility free of charge and that the relevant economic operators meet all, or a significant part of, the costs of implementing these measures. The directive also requires member states to introduce a system whereby certificates of destruction are notified to the competent vehicle registration authorities on foot of the deposit of vehicles for scrapping.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Agreement in principle has been reached by the economic sectors to establish a not for profit <Col N="1252" /> company to operate an ELV recovery scheme which will be subsidised by a fund generated by environmental levies on imported new and used vehicles. The Government has approved proposals for an ELV recovery scheme and my Department is continuing to discuss the detailed mechanisms for the operation and funding of the scheme in the context of the preparation of the enabling primary legislation, which is required for implementing the directive. The timing of the imposition of the levies and the commencement of free take back of ELVs will be determined in light of progress in finalising legislation and the necessary regulations.</P>
    <P>It is intended that the necessary legislative provisions to implement the directive will be incorporated, on Committee Stage of the Protection of the Environment Bill 2003, which has recently been passed by the Seanad.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment and Local Government (Mr. Cullen)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 161 and 174 together.</P>
      <P>The Government published the National Spatial Strategy or NSS on 28 November 2002 as a 20 year planning framework designed to enable every part of the country to achieve its potential.</P>
      <P>The strategy aims to build up the strengths of all areas in order to achieve more balanced regional development and population growth. It recognises that a greater share of economic activity must take place outside the greater Dublin area. To achieve this, the strategy sets out a framework within which gateways, hubs and other urban and rural areas will act together to allow areas to grow.</P>
      <P>Regional and local authorities are key players in taking forward the NSS, starting with the preparation and adoption by regional authorities of regional planning guidelines under the Planning and Development Act 2000. Immediately following the publication of the NSS I attended a number of events at regional level to brief a wide cross-section of interested parties on the NSS and start the process of rolling it out to the regions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1253" />In February 2003, guidance notes for regional authorities on preparing regional planning guidelines were issued by my Department to all regional authorities. Regional authorities, working in partnership with local authorities, have now commenced this work with the aim of ensuring that the guidelines are in place in all regions by early 2004. I have recently made regulations and issued directions under the Planning and Development Act, 2000 to provide additional legislative support for this process.</P>
    <P>Structures and mechanisms to integrate the NSS into planning and activities at Government, departmental, State agency, regional and local level have been put in place to ensure that the strategy directs the spatial aspects of public sector planning, policies and programmes, including the determination of investment priorities. Already, the NSS has shaped the Strategic Rail Review and the development of the Forfas regional investment strategy. An interdepartmental steering group, similar to that which oversaw preparation of the strategy, will now oversee its implementation.</P>
    <P>The successful development of gateways and hubs will require the putting in place of integrated spatial frameworks for land use, planning, urban design, transport and public service delivery. The relevant local authorities have primary responsibility for driving the preparation of these frameworks, in consultation with relevant public agencies, including those responsible for the provision of transport and other infrastructure, and translating them into statutory development plans to guide the development process. Work on the preparation of such frameworks is well advanced in some gateways, and other gateways and hubs are being advised to advance their plans as quickly as possible.</P>
    <P>In adopting the NSS, the Government decided that the strategy will be an important factor in the prioritisation of capital investment, and in the allocation of sectoral investment, which in the case of my Department includes investment in water services, non-national roads and social housing provision. My Department's expenditure programmes will support the implementation of the strategy over its 20 year life. The strategy will form a key input into this year's mid term review of the national development plan.</P>

      <P>On 23 January 2003, the European Commission issued Ireland with a Reasoned Opinion to the effect that the &euro;20 fee for making a submission on a planning application is contrary to the public participation provisions of Directive 85/337/EEC on Environmental Impact Assessment, or EIA. A reply is currently being prepared in consultation with the office of the Attorney General. As the Reasoned Opinion raises many issues relating to public participation in environmental impact assessments, which in turn involve significant legal and policy issues concerning the regulation of the entire planning process in Ireland, an extension of time for reply to the Commission was sought on 21 March 2003. It is my intention to have a final reply forwarded to the Commission shortly.</P>

      <Quest>the progress made to date in regard to his consideration of the report of the Health Research Board study commissioned by his Department into the likely effects of landfill and thermal treatment; the specific steps he intends to take to deal with the finding in the report that Ireland has insufficient resources to carry out adequate risk assessments for proposed waste management facilities; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment and Local Government (Mr. Cullen)</NameTxt>
      <P>The report published by the Health Research Board is a lengthy and detailed document which, alongside the related inventory of dioxin emissions to the Irish environment that was published by the EPA in late December 2002, is receiving careful consideration, both within my Department and the EPA. In due course, having consulted the Agency, the Department of Health and Children and other bodies that may be concerned, I will make a fuller statement in response to the HRB report and its findings.</P>
      <P>The executive summary of the HRB Report states: &ldquo;Ireland presently has insufficient resources to carry out adequate risk assessments for proposed waste management facilities&rdquo; and recommends that the necessary personnel and resources should be made available. This aspect of the report has been misinterpreted, partly because the body of the report does not particularly address or discuss current Irish capabilities or practice.</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Risk assessment&rdquo; in the context of the HRB recommendation does not mean the site-specific risk assessment that is routinely carried out by the EPA before it grants a waste licence to a proposed new waste facility. Rather, the report clearly is referring to a perceived need for health information systems to support routine and long-term monitoring of the health of people living near waste facilities, so that any actual public health impact from such facilities, or other types of environmentally significant development, can, over time, be identified and evaluated.  </P>
      <P>The report cautions that: each phase of a risk assessment poses distinct technical challenges; there will always be considerable uncertainty in the results of risk assessments, most of which will be site specific; and accordingly, they should be viewed in an appropriate perspective, as only one possible component of a decision making process on environmental questions.</P>
      <P>The study team also indicated that health impact assessment was a relatively new discipline developed over the past ten years. In addition, the team highlighted the fact that assessments were &ldquo;extremely difficult and expensive to carry out&rdquo;, and that it would be years before useful information could be available in respect of any new facility.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Nevertheless, the report considered that the provision of information systems and resources to monitor human health around potential sources of pollution would be an important element in <Col N="1256" /> building capacity in Ireland to protect public health in relation to potential environmental hazards generally. In this regard, the report noted that the recommendations in the 1999 Proposal for a National Environmental Health Action Plan, especially concerning the establishment of a national centre for toxicology, could form a basis for future action. My Department is, as stated, consulting the Department of Health and Children with regard to these HRB recommendations.</P>
    <P>In the meantime, the EPA will continue to implement its rigorous environmental licensing system in respect of all significant waste facilities with the objective of ensuring that such activities do not present a significant risk to public health or the environment.</P>

      <P>My Department operates a scheme of grants to assist in the renewal and repair of traditional thatched roofs and has in recent years introduced significant improvements to the grant levels under the scheme. The basic maximum grant was increased in 1999 from &euro;3,047 or £2,400 to &euro;3,810 and from &euro;4,571 or £3,600 to &euro;5,720 for houses on specified offshore islands. The grants may meet two thirds of the approved cost of thatching works, subject to the maximum limits.</P>
      <P>The Department also introduced a new measure to assist lower income households, for which the cost of maintaining a thatched roof imposed a particular burden. Householders with medical cards are eligible for thatching grants up to a maximum of &euro;6,350 or &euro;8,260 in the case of the specified offshore islands. In addition, in such cases the grant may cover up to 80% of the approved cost of the works, again subject to the maximum grant limits.</P>
      <P>While I have no proposals to increase the rate of thatching grants at this stage, my Department keeps the terms of the scheme under review.</P>

      <Quest>the action he intends to take over the coming months to address the discharge of technetium-99 into the Irish Sea; and if his attention has been drawn to the fact that these discharges may continue for at least three more years.</Quest>
      <QRef>[13034/03]</QRef>
    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment and Local Government (Mr. Cullen)</NameTxt>
      <P>The discharge of technetium-99 arises from the treatment of liquid waste at the Magnox reprocessing plant at Sella<Col N="1257" /> field. These discharges typically take place on a batch basis two or three times a year.</P>
      <P>Ireland's concerns about radioactive discharges to the Irish Sea, including discharges of technetium-99, have been conveyed on numerous occasions to the UK Government. These concerns, particularly those in regard to technetium-99 discharges, are shared by a number of Nordic countries, notably Norway. In the statement issued by the OSPAR Ministers in 1998 when the OSPAR Strategy on Radioactive Substances was adopted, the UK indicated that the concerns expressed by a number of the OSPAR states about Technetium-99 discharges from Sellafield would be addressed in the then forthcoming decisions concerning discharge authorisations.</P>
      <P>In September 2001, the UK Environment Agency submitted to the relevant UK Ministers, for consideration, its proposed decision in regard to a review of the discharge authorisation limit for technetium-99. In this connection, the agency proposed a retention of the existing discharge authorisation limit of 90 terrabequerels per annum and that this would be reduced to ten terrabequerels per annum by around 2006. The Government's concerns about the agency's proposals were conveyed to the UK.</P>
      <P>On 11 December 2002 the UK announced its decision to reduce the discharges of technetium-99 from Sellafield. The Environment Agency proposals to reduce the discharge authorisation to 10 terrabequerels per annum from 2006 were accepted. In addition, the UK proposed a moratorium on the discharge of currently stored technetium pending research into solutions for safely storing technetium on land and invited responses to this proposal.</P>
      <P>I welcomed the proposed moratorium but reiterated the Government's position that the retention of an authorisation limit of 90 terrabequerels to 2006 was at variance with the commitments given by the UK in 1998 when adopting the OSAPR Strategy on Radioactive Substances. In addition, I expressed concern that a failure to implement a land-based storage solution would place unacceptable pressure on the existing vitrification processes at Sellafield. I also repeated the Government's call for an acceleration of the vitrification process so that the contents of the HAST tanks can be reduced to buffer volumes on schedule by 2015.</P>
      <P>While the UK Government has stressed that it is committed to implementing the OSPAR strategy, I have concerns that the UK Strategy on Radioactive Discharges, published in July 2002, shows a projected increase in discharges in the short-term. Ireland remains actively involved in the OSPAR process to ensure that the OSPAR Strategy is fully implemented, in a manner consistent with the aims of the 1998 Sintra Declaration, by all contracting parties.</P>

      <P>It is a matter for each local authority to determine its current expenditure levels in the context of its annual budgetary process. All such expenditure, whether this be on pay or otherwise, is funded from a variety of sources including specific State grants, commercial rates, rents, fees and charges for services and general purpose grants from the Local Government Fund.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The amount of funding made available to local authorities through the general purpose grants <Col N="1259" /> from the Local Government Fund has grown to record levels in recent years.

    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment and Local Government (Mr. Cullen)</NameTxt>
      <P>There are currently six cases in respect of which the European Commission has initiated legal action, or announced that it intends to take legal action, in areas for which my Department has responsibility.</P>
      <P>The first case concerns the Dangerous Substances Directive (1976/464/EEC). This directive has been substantially implemented by the Local Government (Water Pollution) Acts 1977 and 1990 and by related Acts and regulations e.g. Environmental Protection Agency Act 1992 and the Waste Management Act 1996. Water quality standards for phosphorus were made in July 1998 and water quality standards for a range of other dangerous substances were made in January 2001. Monitoring by the EPA indicates that the main threat to water quality in Ireland is eutrophication due to excess inputs of phosphorus and, to a lesser extent, nitrates, and that dangerous substances are generally not a problem in Irish waters. It is envisaged that the Directive will be further implemented in the context of implementation of the Water Framework Directive (60/2000/EEC).</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The second case concerns the Nitrates Directive (1991/676/EEC) and the designation of areas as vulnerable zones and the development of action programmes to protect water quality in these areas. The Government position is that an action programme, including regulations, will be applied in the whole country and will provide statutory support for the application of established standards of good agricultural practice. The detailed provisions of the action programme and related research and monitoring programmes will be developed as a matter of urgency, in consultation with the main farming organisations and <Col N="1261" /> other interests, with a view to completion this year.</P>
    <P>The third case concerns the adoption of programmes for the protection of designated shellfish in waters in accordance with Article 5 of Council Directive 79/923/EEC. The directive has been fully transposed into Irish law, and action programmes have recently been made by the Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources and notified to the Commission. The need for any additional measures is being considered in the Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources.</P>
    <P>The fourth case relates to a number of waste issues, including progress in the licensing by the EPA of municipal waste landfills, and the regulatory control of waste activities by local authorities and the EPA. Ireland's defence, which has been submitted, is based in part on the fact that relevant requirements of Council Directive 75/442/EEC have been fully transposed under the Waste Management Act 1996 and related regulations, and that the process of licensing municipal landfills has been completed.</P>
    <P>The fifth case concerns the stated intention by the Commission to refer Ireland to the European Court of Justice, and seek the application of a daily fine, in order to enforce a previous judgment of the Court issued in September 1999 in relation to Council Directive 85/337/EEC on the assessment of the effects of certain public and private projects on the environment, particularly in relation to peat extraction. Environmental impact assessment and planning regulations of December 2001 have addressed the legal implications of the ECJ ruling.</P>
    <P>I announced proposals for the protection of more than 100 raised bogs on 18 December 2002. The Commission press release also acknowledged that this was an important step towards making Ireland's new system of protection fully operational. Public consultation on the designations of the majority of these peatland sites is now complete. The transmission to the Commission of the Natura sites that were part of these proposals will commence this week. In the light of the good progress being achieved here it is expected that the Commission will not proceed further with the case.</P>
    <P>The Commission announced in a press release of 8 April 2003 that Ireland is to be referred to the European Court of Justice for failing to meet the deadline for transposition of the Directive concerning the keeping of wild animals in zoos. My Department is proceeding to transpose the directive into Irish law by way of regulations under the European Communities Act 1972. Consultations have taken place with a view to completing the new regulations later this year.</P>

      <P>My early priority as regards local government legislation was the issue of the dual mandate and this is the subject of the Local Government Bill 2003 which is currently before the House. Over the lifetime of the Government the aim, building on progress to date, is to carry forward a significant change agenda for local government with improved effectiveness and efficiency and proper democratic input. Further legislation will be brought forward as this programme develops.</P>

As safety is paramount, the sleeping billets will not be available for use this summer. It is intended, on the assumption <Col N="1263" /> that the present renovations of the kitchen facilities are completed in time for the summer camps that emergency sleeping accommodation will be arranged and that summer camps will take place in Castlebar. However, even if the kitchen renovations are not completed in time, there will be no question of members of the Reserve not being able to attend annual camp as arrangements will be made to facilitate personnel at other locations.</P>

      <P>The Defence Forces invited tenders for the supply of products and services to support the Army and Naval Service cadetship recruitment process for 2003.</P>
      <P>The advertisement specified that the successful tender was required to meet and fulfil all of the following criteria: be trained to the British Psychological Societys or BPS accredited level in the use and interpretation of psychometric instruments; can provide training to the same BPS standards; will supply specified Saville and Holdsworth Ltd. (SHL) Personality and Aptitude Test instruments; be an accredited training provider in the use of SHL testing materials; have prior experience working with Defence Forces or in similar contexts either nationally or internationally; be a registered user of SHLs ability and personality testing instruments; facilitate the provision of familiarisation information to applicants in a variety of media, including paper and web-based formats; possess the facilities to quickly turnaround psychometrics data, automated scoring and report production, into an objective and consistent format that is easily digestible to non-BPS trained users; the ability to map psychometric data outputs onto the established Defence Forces selection criteria; should demonstrate the ability to work with, generate and apply Irish Defence Forces normative data; and an ability to support an ongoing Defence Forces validation study.</P>
      <P>The requirements are necessary because the Defence Forces cadetship selection process includes psychometric tests and only registered persons may use such aptitude tests, interest inventories and personality questionnaires. Applicants had to be licensed by Saville and Holdsworth Ltd. (SHL) as the Army and Naval Service use specified tests produced by SHL and it is a requirement of SHL that they are so licensed.</P>

      <P>There have been discussions on this subject in the framework of the International Civil Aviation Organisation or ICAO and it is expected that technical specifications for the incorporation of biometrics into passports will be agreed by ICAO shortly. These specifications will set a common, globally accepted standard for countries that choose to introduce biometrics into their passports. However, they will not be mandatory and the decision on whether or not to include biometrics will remain a sovereign one for national governments.</P>
      <P>A number of European countries have been researching different possibilities for incorporating biometrics in travel documents. On the initiative of the Netherlands, a meeting took place in The Hague in June 2002 to exchange views on this question. This meeting was attended by representatives of European countries and the European Commission, as well as observers from the United States, Canada and the International Civil Aviation Organisation. It was agreed at this meeting to establish a European Forum for Travel Documents. The next meeting of the forum will take place in Berlin on 30 June and 1 July 2003.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is no timetable for the introduction of biometrics into passports. This will remain a mat<Col N="1267" /> ter for each country to decide in accordance with its own requirements. However, in this regard, countries that participate in the US visa waiver programme, which includes Ireland, will need to take into consideration the provisions of legislation enacted by the United States &ndash; the Enhanced Border Security Act &ndash; following the terrorist attacks of 11 September 2001. This legislation requires such countries, as a condition of remaining in the visa waiver programme, to certify by 26 October 2004 that they have a programme to introduce biometrics into their passports.</P>

      <P>I am aware of this case, which has been brought to my attention by a number of representations. Officials of my Department met some time ago to discuss it with members of the Irish Falun Dafa Association.</P>
      <P>The two individuals in question are members of Falun Gong, which was banned by the Chinese authorities in July 1999. Falun Gong are regarded by the Chinese Government as an evil cult. The persons concerned are Chinese citizens and are, therefore, subject to the laws of China while in that country. As they are not Irish citizens, Ireland has no consular function in this matter, and the matter currently rests with the Chinese authorities.</P>
      <P>However, the Government takes seriously concerns about human rights in China, including those of Falun Gong members. Both the Taoiseach and I have raised this issue on a number of occasions with the Chinese Government. We will continue to raise human rights issues in our bilateral contacts.</P>
      <P>The issue of human rights was also discussed at the meeting of the External Relations Council of the European Union in March 2003. In our conclusions we agreed that the Union would urge China to take clear steps to improve the situation generally, and more specifically with regard to respect for the freedoms of expression, religion and belief, which have a particular impact on practitioners of Falun Dafa.</P>
      <P>At the 59th session of the UN Commission on Human Rights, which was held from 17 March to 25 April, the EU expressed its deep concern over violations of human rights in China, and at the lack of progress in a number of areas. In its statement to the Commission, with which Ireland was fully associated, the EU specifically expressed concern at the ongoing violations of the human rights of the followers of Falun Gong.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1268" />The EU also discusses key human rights concerns with China within the framework of the EU-China Human Rights Dialogue. The most recent session of the Dialogue took place in Athens on 5-6 March this year, and discussions were particularly frank and open, facilitating a substantial exchange of views. The EU continues to evaluate the results of the Human Rights Dialogue at regular intervals to determine how far its expectations have been met, and how improvements could be made.</P>
    <P>My colleague, Deputy Kitt, Minister of State with responsibility for overseas development and human rights, yesterday met the Chinese Ambassador, and raised our concerns over these cases with him. Officials in my Department and in our embassy in Beijing will continue to monitor these cases, and I will keep the House informed of any progress made.</P>

      <Quest>if his attention has been drawn to the fact that a person (details supplied) in County Cork has encountered difficulties enrolling her child for primary school to commence in September 2003 and that there is no other primary school in the area in which she can enrol.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Mr. N. Dempsey)</NameTxt>
      <P>The compulsory school starting age in a national school is six years of age and Rule 64 (1) of the Rules for National Schools provides that a child must be at least four years of age <Col N="1270" /> before she/he may be enrolled in a national school. Children of compulsory school-going age must have a place in a national school and overall there are more than enough places available.</P>
      <P>Enrolment in individual schools is the responsibility of the managerial authority of those schools and my Department does not seek to intervene in decisions made by schools in such matters. My Department's main responsibility is to ensure that schools in an area can, between them, cater for all pupils seeking places. This may result, however, in some pupils not obtaining a place in the school of their first choice.</P>
      <P>It is the responsibility of the managerial authorities of schools that are not in a position to admit all pupils seeking entry to implement an enrolment policy in accordance with the Education Act. In this regard a board of management may find it necessary to restrict enrolment to children from a particular area or a particular age group or, occasionally, on the basis of some other criterion.</P>
      <P>Where a board of management refuses to enrol a student in a school the parent of the student or, where the student has reached 18 years of age, the student themselves, following the conclusion of any appeal procedures at school level, has a statutory entitlement under section 29 of the Education Act 1998 to appeal that decision to the Secretary General of the Department of Education and Science.</P>
      <P>Under the appeal process, a committee is established to hear the appeal. Oral hearings are conducted with a minimum of formality. In most cases appeals must be dealt within 30 days. Where appropriate, the Secretary General may give whatever directions to the board of management that are considered necessary to remedy the matter complained of.</P>
      <P>I have requested my officicals to forward a list of the primary schools in the area concerned directly to the parent in question.</P>

      <P>Initially, my Department wrote to the chairman of the Health Board Chief Executive Officers Group on 24 January 2002 requesting that medical card holders should not lose their cards because of increases in social welfare rates announced in the budget. My Department again wrote to the chairman on 6 February 2002 requesting that every effort be made to ensure that both medical card holders and applicants be made fully aware that increases in social welfare payments would not disadvantage them when applying to hold or retain a medical card. In response, the chief executive officers confirmed that social welfare recipients would not be disadvantaged.</P>
      <P>On 31 October last, my Department again wrote to the chairman of the chief executive officers group reiterating the above and this policy remains unchanged.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children (Mr. T. O'Malley)</NameTxt>
      <P>Information on the level and the frequency of the use of the drug ritilin is not routinely collected by my Department.</P>
      <P>No guidelines for the prescription of the drug to children have been issued except for those included in the, Summary of Product Characteristics, approved by the Irish Medicines Board in granting the necessary authorisation to the company to place the product on the market in this country. These specify that the product is not intended for use in adults or in children less than six years of age and that doses above 40mg daily are not recommended.</P>
      <P>It must be recognised that the drug should be used only as part of a comprehensive treatment programme which typically includes psychological, educational and social measures and that its use is aimed at stabilising children with ADHD, ADD.</P>
      <P>My Department's policy approach is that treatment with the drug should be initiated by and be carried out by or under the supervision of a medical specialist in childhood behavioural disorders after appropriate diagnosis.</P>
      <P>The development of services for the management and treatment of attention deficit disorder-attention deficit hyperactivity disorder &ndash; ADD/ADHD &ndash; was considered by the working group on child and adolescent psychiatric services established by the Department of Health and Children in June 2000. In its report, presented in March 2001, the working group stated that the prevalence of ADD-ADHD in Ireland can be estimated at somewhere between 1% and 5% of school age children, namely aged five to 15 years, which is in line with the research findings in other European countries. The group recommended the enhancement and expansion of the overall child and adolescent psychiatric service as the most effective means of providing the required service for children with this condition.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>All aspects of the presentation, diagnosis, treatment and management of children suffering from ADD-ADHD were considered by the working group in the course of its deliberations. In its report, the different components of treatment required were set out and the importance of <Col N="1278" /> adequate linkages with others services, such as education services and the community health services, were emphasised.</P>
    <P>The working group found that the internationally acknowledged best practice for the provision of child and adolescent psychiatric services is through the multi-disciplinary team. It noted that many of the child and adolescent psychiatric teams currently in place throughout the country do not have the full complement of team members required and it recommended that priority should be given, in the first instance, to the recruitment of the required expertise for the completion of existing teams.</P>
    <P>In 2002, additional revenue funding of &euro;6.061million, £4.773 million, was allocated to provide for the appointment of additional consultants, for the enhancement of existing consultant-led multi-disciplinary teams and towards the establishment of further teams. A further &euro;1.64 million was allocated in 2003. Each health board now has funding for a minimum of three consultant-led child and adolescent multi-disciplinary teams.</P>
    <P>The health strategy Quality and Fairness &ndash; A Health System For You includes a commitment to the implementation of the recommendations of the working group's report.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>The most recent and comprehensive figures available to my Department on accidents in the home emanate from the recently published second phase of the national health and lifestyle surveys. The results of these surveys outline the pattern of non-fatal accidents occurring in this country and <Col N="1279" /> query many areas in relation to accidents including where accidents occurred and what treatment was sought at the time of the injury. These figures have been further analysed by gender, age, socio-economic grouping and educational status, thereby providing us with an even greater information resource.</P>
      <P>Overall, the SLÁN survey indicates that 17% of the respondents suffered some sort of injury in the past two years, which interfered with their daily activities, showing a decrease of 1% from the previous survey in 1998. Of these, 31% of the accidents occurred in the home or in the garden, indicating a sharp rise from the 18% reporting home-garden accidents in 1998. As in 1998, the home or garden was the most likely site for females across all age groups to suffer an injury.</P>
      <P>Both the national health promotion strategy 2000 &ndash; 2005 and the health strategy Quality and Fairness outline strategic objectives in relation to contributing to the reduction in the percentage of the population affected by fatal and non-fatal injuries. The health promotion unit of my Department sees its main objective in this area as working in partnership to promote safety and injury prevention with a particular focus on fall prevention, accidents in the home and on the road and farm.</P>
      <P>The health promotion unit is currently involved in a number of initiatives which examine the issues surrounding accident prevention and promoting safety at home. Officials from the health promotion unit represent my Department on two fire safety committees of the National Safety Council. These are multi-disciplinary committees that draw representation from the Department of the Environment and Local Government, the regional health boards and local authorities. This is in line with the ethos of the health strategy, which states that there is a need for action across many sectors in a co-ordinated, nationally focused manner.</P>
      <P>On a more operational level, the HPU facilitates the meetings of health promotion officers with responsibility for older people, whose discussions have recently focused on fall prevention. Safety is also an issue of concern for the members of the interdepartmental group on the needs of older people, chaired by Minister of State, Mr. Ivor Callely. Key Departments represented on this group include Social, Community and Family Affairs and Environment and Local Government as well, as local authorities and health boards. In relation to young people and accident prevention, the national health promotion information project officer is currently revising and updating the child accident prevention publication &ldquo;Play it Safe&rdquo;, with a view to providing specific information on injury prevention for three age groups.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 218, 219 and 222 together.</P>
      <P>The rural transport initiative, RTI, provides funding on a pilot basis for voluntary and community organisations and community partnerships to address the particular transport needs of their rural areas. The initiative is being managed by Area Development Management Limited on behalf of my Department.</P>
      <P>Under the RTI, 34 rural community transport groups are now being funded to provide transport services in their areas and the initiative is operational in parts of most counties in the country.</P>
      <P>Under the RTI, some 270 new transport services are currently being provided. Many of these are door-to-door services and are designed to fit in with existing scheduled services. Some 2,000 people, including many elderly people, are currently using the RTI transport services every week and these numbers are rising as new transport services are rolled out and existing services are developed to their full capacity.</P>
      <P>It is anticipated that some &euro;6 million will have been provided for this pilot initiative by the end of this year when the RTI is due to conclude. This compares with the &euro;4.4 million earmarked for it in the national development plan.</P>
      <P>As regards the future of rural transport services, I am currently considering a report from an interdepartmental committee which has made recommendations with regard to the development of a rural public transport policy.</P>

At the beginning of the year, work was under way on 19 projects. Two of these have already been completed and a further 11 are expected to open to traffic this year including, by the end of June, the M1 Drogheda bypass, Cloghran-Lissenhall and Lisenhall-Balbriggan schemes.

      <P>It is expected that all of the projects under the NDP national road programme will be completed although some projects will run beyond the time limit of the plan.

      <P>I am aware of the recent report of the EU Committee on Petitions in relation to their fact finding mission to Ireland in connection with the effects of taxi liberalisation. These recommendations have not been formally presented to the Government.</P>
      <P>The taxi hardship panel was an independent panel of three persons who were appointed to report in general terms on the nature and extent of extreme personal financial hardship which may have been experienced by individual taxi licence holders as a direct result of the liberalisation of entry to the taxi industry on 21 November 2000. It was made clear at the outset that based on legal precedent there can be no legal duty on the State to compensate taxi licence holders in relation to open market licence values that may have existed prior to taxi liberalisation.</P>
      <P>The recommendations of the panel were accepted by the Government which approved their implementation on a phased basis on 17 December 2002.</P>
      <P>The design and administration of a scheme to implement the recommendations of the taxi hardship panel and the arrangements to facilitate the making of payments to eligible persons will be progressed as quickly as possible so as to ensure that applications are dealt with on a confidential and objective basis.

      <P>The following criteria are used by the committee when assessing an application: crime-disorder statistics in an area; population and level of activity of centre; post and local contributions as evidence of commitment of partnership arrangements; recommendations of local Garda management; and special circumstances &ndash; needs.</P>
      <P>Separately, my Department has received significant &ndash; in excess of 150 &ndash; expressions of interest in the related community based CCTV scheme which was launched to facilitate community based groups who wish to install their own local CCTV system. Grant assistance of up to &euro;100,000 will, subject to the availability of funds, be obtainable from my Department towards the cost of such schemes.</P>
      <P>A prospectus has been prepared by my Department which provides information on how to apply for grant-aid funding, outlines the application process and identifies the main issues that applicants will need to consider. Copies of this prospectus are available, on request, from the Garda administration division of my Department.</P>
      <P>A code of practice, drawn up in co-operation with the Office of the Data Protection Commissioner, and detailed technical specifications, drawn up by the Garda Síochána, are almost complete. When both the code of practice and the technical specifications have been finalised my Department will issue copies of same to all communities who expressed an interest in the community based CCTV scheme and any applications subsequently received will be evaluated and processed.  </P>

    <P>The pilot has been evaluated by expert consultants who recommended that the pilot project be extended and expanded with the concurrent development of a drug court planning programme over the next 12 to 18 months.

      <P>Government policy on all nuclear waste stored at Sellafield is that it should be safely and securely managed to ensure it poses no threat to Ireland and its environment. Regarding the mixing of different types of waste currently stored at Sellafield, whether generated there or elsewhere, my Department has no information that there is any plan to mix different types of waste, and there are no figures currently available to us regarding the sources and the break down of waste at Sellafield between first generation and second generation waste.</P>
      <P>Dounreay is located on the north coast of Scotland, and was established on a former naval base as the centre for UK fast reactor research. It is now engaged on a major decommissioning and site restoration programme to deal with the legacy of past operations. It is estimated by the UK Government that the environmental restoration of Dounreay will involve the investment of £4.5 billion over the next 50-60 years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The explosion at Dounreay occurred in the late 1970s. Radioactive waste had been disposed of in uncontrolled ways by dumping in a deep shaft on the site. No proper records of the disposals were kept and the explosion was caused by chemical reaction within the dumped materials. I understand from the Nuclear Installations Inspectorate, the regulator for both Dounreay and Sellafield, <Col N="1290" /> that an application has been made to the Scottish Environmental Protection Agency by the operators of the Dounreay site, to transfer low level radioactive waste from Dounreay to Drigg near Sellafield. Any such application process involves statutory, including public, consultation. SEPA has applied to the Scottish Office, and the consultation processes will follow.</P>

      <P>Responsibility for the regulation of aircraft noise rests with the Minister for Transport. I understand the regulations that apply in Ireland to aircraft noise are promulgated at international level by the International Civil Aviation Organisation and by the EU. I also understand the ground testing of aircraft engines at any time at State airports is prohibited without the permission of Aer Rianta under the Air Navigation and Transport (Amendment) Act 1950 (as amended), and that a noise management strategy for Dublin Airport, prepared for Aer Rianta in 2000, addresses the issue of noise from aircraft power plant test running.</P>
      <P>In addition, under the First Schedule of the Environmental Protection Agency Act 1992, an integrated pollution control licence is required to test engines, turbines or reactors where the floor area exceeds 500 square metres. In terms of future noise policy, EU Directive 2002/49/EC relating to the assessment and management of environmental noise, to be transposed into law by 2004, requires, <i>inter alia,</i> the making by June 2007 of strategic noise maps for airports with more than 50,000 take-off or landing movements per year. My Department is in ongoing discussions with the relevant local and transport sector authorities, including Aer Rianta and the Department of Transport, regarding implementation of the relevant requirements of the directive.

      <P>The procurement and use of bed and breakfast accommodation as emergency accommodation for homeless persons is a matter, in the first instance, for local housing authorities.</P>
      <P>The standard of such bed and breakfast accommodation has improved significantly in recent years, with most now operating to a high standard, of involving unrestricted access for residents, 24 hour security and a limit on the number of bed spaces.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In addition, Dublin City Council carries out regular inspections of bed and breakfast accommodation to ensure that standards are being <Col N="1292" /> maintained. I understand that, where they are not satisfied with the quality of the accommodation, its use can be discontinued. It is recognised that bed and breakfast accommodation is not suitable as long-term accommodation for homeless people and that its use should be phased out, particularly for families. At my request, Dublin City Council and the Homeless Agency are reviewing the use of this type of accommodation.</P>

      <P>The Government has in place a national emergency plan for nuclear accidents which is regularly updated. My Department has the lead role in implementing the plan through the emergency response co-ordination committee. This committee, which also includes representatives of other Departments and the Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland, will respond to a major disaster at a nuclear installation in the UK or elsewhere which would result in a major release of radioactivity.</P>
      <P>An information booklet entitled National Planning for Nuclear Emergencies was published by my Department last year. The booklet sets out the principal features of the National Emergency Plan for Nuclear Accidents. An information leaflet summarising the main elements of the booklet was distributed to every household in the country.</P>
      <P>A Government task force on emergency planning is also in place to co-ordinate the work of Departments and agencies with key roles in emergency planning. In the event of any accident or incident at a nuclear installation abroad, the critical issue for Ireland is early notification. Two notification systems are used for early warning. Following Chernobyl, countries with nuclear power plants entered into an agreement, called the Convention on Early Notification of a Nuclear Accident, under which any country which operates nuclear installations is obliged to inform the International Atomic Energy Agency immediately of an accident, in any of its installations, which could have an effect outside its own boundaries.</P>
      <P>The IAEA, through its emergency response unit based at its headquarters in Vienna, will immediately pass on to all its member states, including Ireland, any notification which it receives of a nuclear accident in any part of the world. In addition to this IAEA system, a separate system, known as ECURIE, is operated within the EU. Under this, each EU member state is required to notify other member states of any radiological accident that could have consequences outside its territory. They must also provide details of any protective actions being taken and results of radiological measurements carried out.</P>

      <P>The Government's strategy to increase housing supply to meet demand and to improve affordability, particularly for first time purchasers, is proving effective. 2002 was the eighth consecutive year of record housing output, when 57,695 units were completed, an increase of 9.7% on 2001. This increase in housing output is having the effect of moderating house price trends with a reduction in average year on year house price increases from a peak of around 40% per annum in 1998 to more moderate levels currently.</P>
      <P>The moderating trend in house price increases when combined with Government measures and other factors, including high levels of economic growth, lower tax levels, increased disposable incomes, increased employment, lower mortgage interest rates and low inflation, has impacted positively on housing affordability. Demographic changes continue to drive the demand for housing, including social housing. The Government therefore remains committed to continuing with measures to boost the supply of housing and in this way seek to bring moderation to the rate of house price increases and also to assisting low-income groups and those with social housing needs by means of the range of targeted social and affordable housing programmes.</P>
      <P>Activity is increasing significantly under the affordable housing and shared ownership schemes, which assist households unable to purchase in the private market to own their own houses. Some 882 affordable housing units were built in 2002, about three times the output in 2001, and some 1,686 households benefited under the shared ownership scheme.</P>
      <P>Total capital funding for housing of &euro;1.7 billion is being provided this year, a near 7% increase on the amount provided in 2002 which should enable the housing needs of over 12,000 households to be met this year. The provisions under Part V of the Planning and Development Act 2000, as amended, will assist in the delivery of social and affordable housing and the housing initiative included in the new national partnership agreement Sustaining Progress also seeks to increase the supply of affordable housing. In conjunction with the existing affordable housing and shared ownership schemes these instruments will become increasingly important in providing greater access to home ownership by lower income groups in the medium term. The Government is committed to ensuring that the demand for housing is met in a sustainable manner and will continue to monitor and review housing developments and policies as necessary.</P>

      <P>The implementation and management of the local authority loan schemes are a matter for individual housing authorities. The current maximum loan available to borrowers through the ordinary house purchase loan scheme is &euro;130,000. Where borrowers are unable to acquire a home with an SDA loan, they can consider a shared ownership loan under the shared ownership scheme. In operating the shared ownership scheme, housing authorities should have regard to local circumstances in determining maximum finance and price limits or any other conditions they believe appropriate. In determining the maximum loan available under either the SDA scheme or the shared ownership scheme local authorities must also consider the purchaser's ability to pay, that is, mortgage repayments should not exceed 35% of net household income.</P>
      <P>Of the 1,686 transactions completed under the shared ownership scheme last year over 36% were in respect of house prices in excess of &euro;155,000, under 10% were in the price range of &euro;140,000 to &euro;155,000 and the remaining 54% were in respect of house prices less than &euro;140,000. My Department is keeping the terms of these schemes under review.</P>

      <P>My Department's guidelines for planning authorities on residential density, published in September 1999, set out the types of locations <Col N="1299" /> appropriate for higher residential densities, the range of densities appropriate to various locations and the need to achieve a high quality of residential environment. The guidelines specifically provide that one of the criteria to be taken into account by planning authorities in considering applications for higher density housing developments is the &ldquo;provision of an appropriate scaled range of social and community facilities, including shopping, education, health and childcare.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Any planning application for higher density housing development would be considered by planning authorities in the context of their development plans. Section 10 of the Planning and Development Act 2000 provides that each development plan must contain objectives for, inter alia: the integration of the planning and sustainable development of the area with the social, community and cultural requirements of the area and its population; the preservation, improvement and extension of amenities and recreational amenities; and the provision, or facilitation of the provision, of services for the community including, in particular, schools, crèches and other educational and childcare facilities.</P>

      <P>Fire and emergency services are provided primarily by the local authorities acting, as appropriate, in conjunction with the other emergency services locally. My Department supports these services through a range of functions, including sponsoring the legislation underpinning the fire service, funding (which has been substantially increased in the period since 1998) for the replacement/refurbishment of fire stations and the purchase of appliances and equipment and so on, the development and updating of an emergency planning framework and guidelines and the promotion of training and other initiatives. I am satisfied that the fire and emergency services stand prepared and capable of providing an adequate and effective response to emergencies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to planning for emergencies, I refer to the reply by my colleague, the Minister for Defence, to Questions Nos. 83, 121 and 122 of <Col N="1300" /> 2 April 2003. The emphasis of the work of the Government task force on emergency planning, under his chairmanship, has been to ensure that emergency planning challenges continue to be addressed with a view to developing responses to possible threats and promoting co-ordination of response arrangements. It is essential to ensure that Departments and agencies with management roles in large-scale emergencies are facilitated to carry out their respective tasks and that all necessary resources in terms of people, equipment and training are deployed to best effect.</P>
    <P>The focus for the future will continue to be on taking the necessary precautions to minimise the risks from terrorist activities, ensuring that the protection available to our people is maximised, putting the mechanisms in place to support the response agencies and co-ordinating for maximum efficiency and effectiveness.</P>

      <P>The shared ownership scheme offers home ownership in a number of steps to purchasers who cannot afford full ownership in the traditional way and is aimed at lower income house purchasers, especially first time buyers. Implementation and management of the scheme is, in the first instance, a matter for each housing authority. In operating the scheme, they should have regard to local circumstances in determining the maximum house price limit or any other details they deem appropriate. I consider that these issues are best determined by individual local authorities. The terms of the scheme are continuously kept under review by my Department.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment and Local Government (Mr. Cullen)</NameTxt>
      <P>Wetlands include a variety of habitat types. Inventory and survey to date has focused on those considered to be most at risk, notably turloughs, lagoons and raised and blanket bogs. Fens are a remaining priority for survey. The water framework directive will provide a context for further inventory and research on wetlands.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Many wetlands in Ireland are protected as part of the Natura 2000 network, having met the selection criteria under the EU habitats directive or the EU birds directive, or both. I have also announced proposals for the protection of 75 raised bogs as natural heritage areas under the Wildlife (Amendment) Act 2000. An inventory of blanket bogs suitable for designation as NHAs is <Col N="1302" /> being carried out this year, and similar consideration will be given to other wetland habitat types in subsequent years.</P>
    <P>Where a material change is likely to have a significant effect on a site designated for nature conservation, the deciding authority must ensure appropriate assessment of the implications for the site before taking a decision. Where such changes constitute development under the Planning Acts responsibility rests with the planning authority. Where such changes do not require permission or licensing by any other authority, the decision rests with my Department, to which notice of the proposed change should be given.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment and Local Government (Mr. Cullen)</NameTxt>
      <P>It is generally recognised that greater recourse by owners of cats and dogs to spaying and neutering can help control the population of these species and reduce the number of such animals straying. The efforts being made by certain animal welfare bodies to facilitate access by owners to spaying and neutering services are commendable and I was pleased to be able to approve a grant of &euro;10,000 to Veterinary Ireland last year towards the cost of their national spay week initiative.</P>
      <P>The limited resources that local authorities can allocate to dog control activities are fully absorbed by them in carrying out their obligations under the Dog Control Acts. I would not be in favour of additional costs being imposed on them through a national programme as suggested by the Deputy.</P>

      <P>The Broadmeadow Estuary and Malahide Estuary is a special protection area, designated in 1994 under the EU birds directive. Malahide Estuary is also a candidate special area of conservation under the EU habitats directive. I understand that Bisset's strand is located within the SPA but not within the cSAC. The designation of an area as a SPA does not preclude development within it, but the impli<Col N="1303" /> cations of the development for the site must be assessed before a decision is taken by a planning or licensing authority.</P>
      <P>A proposal to develop a car-park at Bisset's strand is the subject of a foreshore licence application to my colleague the Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources. His Department has sought comments from my Department on the implications of the proposal for the SPA and my officials are currently examining all relevant issues.</P>
