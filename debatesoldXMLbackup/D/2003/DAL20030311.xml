      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 1 to 4, inclusive, together.</P>
      <P>As I indicated in my reply of 18 December 2002, the evaluation of files intended for release to the National Archives is carried out by designated officials in my Department and I have no role in that process. It is normal as files are processed for release each year that some are certified by an appropriate official for retention on the grounds set forth in the National Archives Act 1986. I am informed that the number of files certified in this way in respect of the January 2003 release was five, of a total of 699. One of the five certified files was retained under section 8(4)(<i>a</i>) of the 1986 Act and the other four were retained under sections 8(4)(<i>a</i>), 8(4)(<i>b</i>) and 8(4)(<i>c</i>) of the Act. The statutorily designated officials are responsible for determining the particular subsection in accordance with which files are certified for retention.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny" hpid="Mr. Kenny Mr. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>Has the Taoiseach read reports about Captain James Kelly, who has requested that all documentation in respect of the 1970-72 period be published? Is there a reason the totality <Col N="3" /> of documentation relevant to this period has not been published? Has the Taoiseach been made aware of any undue sensitivity that warrants a decision not to publish such documentation? Will he comment on the matter?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Five files were not released last year. Further reference to section 8(4) should have been made in the reply to be fair to the House. Section 8(4)(<i>a</i>) pertains to information contrary to the public interest, section 8(4)(<i>b</i>) pertains to information obtained in confidence, and section 8(4)(<i>c</i>) pertains to information that might cause distress or which might be likely to lead to an action for damages for defamation. It was only for these reasons that any files were held back this year. Five files out of 699 were held back.</P>
      <P>From answering questions like these in the past, I note that files held back in the past were normally related to a personal interest, the identification of an individual or somebody giving information on a confidential basis. Release of the relevant file would have broken the confidence implicated in the person's giving the information in the first place or would have led to action for damages for defamation.</P>
      <P>As I said, five files have been held back in 2003, five in 2002, 13 in 2001, 12 in 2000 and none in 1999. Therefore, very few were held back.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny" hpid="Mr. Kenny Mr. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>Captain Kelly has said that the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy McDowell, is aware of certain other files that are very relevant and that might be in the public interest. Perhaps the Taoiseach will examine this if he does not have the information in front of him.</P>

      <P>The National Archives legislation was pioneered by former Taoiseach Garrett FitzGerald and led to the Freedom of Information Act, which makes State papers available after five years.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>Given the extent of betrayal on the programme for Government put together last May, the Taoiseach might consider it appropriate to refer that document to the National Archives <Col N="5" /> now rather than waiting because it is clearly of purely historical interest at this stage.</P>
      <P>Under section 8(4)(<i>b</i>), information is not transferred because it is considered necessary to protect information supplied in confidence. Does that differ from the case confronting two colleagues in the House? They are the subject of legal action because they passed on in confidence to a relevant member of the Executive information given to them in confidence, yet they find themselves being challenged on foot of an action by the Garda Síochána and hauled through the courts. Is there any difference in the principle that applies?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not see any difference and the Deputy will be aware that I support the stance of Members in this matter. Section 8(4)(<i>b</i>) pertains to information the Executive received from various sources over the years, not all of which related to the Troubles although it happens that the 30 year rule now applies to documents contemporaneous to their break-out between 1969 and 1972. The information was provided to the Executive by members of the public rather than by organisations and it would not see the light of day under the provisions of the 1986 Act according to my interpretation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeHiggins" hpid="Mr. J. Higgins Mr. J. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>Can the Taoiseach specify the nature of the content of the withheld files or parts thereof rather than referring to general categories under the Act? Does the Taoiseach agree that there is no good reason for the State to continue to withhold files 30 years after the events to which they pertain? It is a long time.</P>
      <P>The amendment to the Freedom of Information Act 1997 was formulated secretively and without consultation on the recommendation of a high level group of civil servants. Can we have confidence in the decisions of civil servants to release or withhold files in view of the tendency by certain senior officials to operate as secretly as possible? Can we be confident that the public's right to know is being respected? Files containing information which is possibly prejudicial to citizens or which may result in discrimination against them should, if not published, be made available to the people concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I heard the Ceann Comhairle's ruling in relation to the National Archives Act but I will have to answer some questions again. I cannot give Deputy Joe Higgins the list of files retained each year by the director of the National Archives as it is not the practice to make it available for inspection. In a great many instances, a file's title reveals its content of personal views and correspondence. Not all the files in question relate to Northern Ireland, but for security reasons no further information is available. The policy adopted by the division with responsibility for this area under the legislation strictly accords with the provisions of the Act. Civil servants will always operate in that way and whenever inter<Col N="6" /> pretation of an Act is in doubt, legal advice is sought. My experience has been that civil servants perform these functions to the highest standards.</P>
      <P>The policy of the division in my Department is to release as many records as possible, starting with the 1969 documents. Thirty years may have passed, but these matters are still of huge interest. When the first papers from 1969 were released, the result was several weeks of media focus, special television programming and the publication of at least two books. There have also been several debates in the House. Quite frankly, it is as well that the documents were not any more recent.</P>
      <P>A small amount of abstractions were made in the case of documents where sensitive or security information was detailed. With regard to correspondence the names and addresses of private individuals were withheld on the basis that there could not have been an expectation on the part of those individuals that their correspondence would ever be made public. The tone and the content of some of the correspondence if released had the potential to cause distress to the writers or their relatives. Correspondence from organisations and public representatives were released in full. The public was protected in these matters.</P>
      <P>There are some considerations which arise in relation to the legislation going forward and which have been brought to my attention. These include how best the historical record can be preserved having regard to the provisions of the National Archives Act which allows for abstractions in particular circumstances; how correspondence should be treated given that the Department could be open to a libel or defamation case; the extent to which the Department is legally covered where there are no definitive guidelines and each decision is based on individual judgment, which is the point made by Deputy Joe Higgins. Other considerations include the extent to which it is realistic for historians to expect the release of all records which in the case of Northern Ireland files from 1970 to 1980 are becoming increasingly sensitive. The work involved in examining the 1972 files will be substantial especially if large amounts of abstractions have to be made. It is important therefore to commence this work as soon as possible. Clarification of the Department's policy for dealing with the files is needed. These are just some of the issues that the section has to deal with. Its policy is to release as much as possible and only to protect what is directly related to individuals and directly related to something said by an individual that could either leave him open to defamation or perhaps it is a view no longer held by the individual.</P>

      <NameTxt>Caoimhghín Ó Caoláin</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Taoiseach say what percentage of the files withheld relate to matters concerning the North of Ireland? Will he say if any of the files withheld relate specifically to the activities of British agents here during 1972 and previous years, specifically the Littlejohn brothers? I presume that if any of the files had a <Col N="7" /> bearing that the Taoiseach would co-operate with Mr. Justice Barron. Have any of the files withheld been provided to Mr. Justice Barron in carrying out his inquiries into the Dublin bombing of 1972?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The files have all been released and only five which are of a personal nature have been withheld. Of the 699 files transferred to the National Archives, 104 related to Northern Ireland matters and 95 related to the Mansion House all-party anti-partition conference and the national anti-partition Mansion House fund. No files in these categories were withheld. On hundred and forty-three files were released with abstractions. Sixteen entire documents were withheld and part abstractions were made in the case of a further 56 files. These related to personal information, security matters and information given in confidence. There were a small number of files released belonging to the former Taoiseach, Jack Lynch.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent" hpid="Mr. Sargent Mr. Sargent">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
      <P>I ask this question in the context of the relevance of the National Archives. Documents in the National Archives relating to EU matters such as negotiations and arrangements have up until now been withheld if the release was deemed to be harmful to ongoing negotiations. Following the passing of the Nice treaty last year the Taoiseach was very clear that there would be greater transparency and scrutiny of matters relating to Europe. Will he reverse the freedom of information policy the Government initiated to allow for greater transparency, or how much sincerity was behind the promise of greater transparency if we are now looking at a closing down of information?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>In regard to EU matters, I do not know if files have been held back. My notes do not indicate that EU files are involved. As the Deputy knows, since the introduction of the new system on 1 July 2002, all matters relating to the EU are dealt with by a committee of this House. All other papers and questions are released under FOI on a regular basis. There is no change in that approach. Reams of documents are released by my Department each week. I am not sure if anyone reads them. I do not read them in the newspapers.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CaoimhglinOCaolain" hpid="Caoimhghín Ó Caoláin Caoimhghín Ó Caoláin">
      <NameTxt>Caoimhghín Ó Caoláin</NameTxt>
      <P>I asked specifically about the files withheld from the National Archives. In his response, however, the Taoiseach dealt with the files that had been provided to the National Archives. He indicated that five are withheld for personal reasons. Do any of the questions I posed apply in the case of any of the personal reasons that justified the withholding of these files? Are any of the withheld files, while small in number, of relevance to matters pertaining to the North of Ireland? Has any of them relevance to the actions of British agents in this <Col N="8" /> State, specifically the Littlejohn brothers or others? Does the Taoiseach believe that Mr. Justice Barron should have sight of any of the material in these files? Are they relevant to his ongoing work?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>From the information available to me &ndash; I do not have all the information &ndash; all the files withheld are of a personal nature. All the files in my Department relating to Mr. Justice Barron's investigations have been made available to him. He has had complete access to all the files held in my Department, the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform and Garda files relating to the 1974 period.</P>

      <P>Is the Taoiseach aware that in 1991, the then Government issued guidelines to implement the recommendations of the Second Commission on the Status of Women? They require Ministers and Departments to ensure that women constitute 40% of all appointments to State boards. In a report published last November, the National Women's Council shows that members of the Cabinet have consistently failed to reach their targets. Similarly, while some State boards have a better record than others, the guidelines are not being met. Will the Taoiseach indicate if his Department has met the 40% guid<Col N="10" /> eline and, if not, why? Last week, International Women's Week was celebrated throughout the country. The Taoiseach was not present in the House and this is the first chance Members have to ask what he is doing to ensure that this standard is met by all Departments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the 40% guideline and will, on a general basis, do everything I can to achieve the target. Most of the boards under the aegis of my Department are made up of outside bodies, such as social partnership. We always emphasise to them the need when making appointments to meet the target. I am not sure if we reach the target in all cases but we try to comply.</P>

Does he also accept it is time to establish an independent public appointments system, especially in view of the questions that arise over what are perceived to be the political nature of appointment decisions? The decision by An Bord Pleanála regarding the proposed incinerator at Carranstown, recently in the media headlines, is an example. Does the Taoiseach accept it is time to put clear water between the suspicion that there is link between Government policy and appointments to the boards of State bodies? </P>
      <P>Will the Taoiseach indicate whether his Department has issued guidelines on appointments to State boards and the requirement to meet a gender balance?

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I am referring to the guidelines. The guideline followed is 40%. The membership of the social partnership and the information society boards is based on the suitability of the people available. In some cases there is more of one sex than the other. It is only right that an effort is made to maintain the gender balance <Col N="11" /> across Departments and the Government follows that on the boards.</P>
      <P>I agree that the boards should be independent. The Deputy is aware that An Bord Pleanála, which was established by the 1983 Act, is one of the more independent boards. That does not stop people making comments. We can go over the top in our efforts for independence. We try to rule this and that person out and then get to the stage&mdash;</P>

      <P>The boards are independent. They are not politically appointed. The appointments are made by nominating bodies. That is how the boards of An Bord Pleanála and NESC were appointed. They are independent bodies. The Deputy's definition of independence may be different to mine but as far as I am concerned suitability, qualifications and competence are what are important. The Deputy probably thinks the fact a board member might have been seen with a politician in the past hundred years means the board is not independent but I do not.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I imagine anybody in Cheltenham would be seen talking to many Irish politicians. What criteria does the Taoiseach use when he appoints people to the boards under his jurisdiction? Does he go up and down every tree in the vicinity, so to speak, to see if they are qualified and have expertise in the area covered by the board concerned? How does he establish that? Does the Taoiseach agree that appointments to State boards are discredited and despised by ordinary people because of the perception that it is not the expertise of the appointees that is the main criteria but whether they are loyal hacks of the establishment parties which happen to be in Government?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I will go through the boards that I appoint one by one. The National Statistics <Col N="12" /> Board is a non-statutory board. Normally we would look for people who are expert in the area of statistics or who are qualified statisticians. On the board of NESC we would have people who have been members of social partnerships and who would have been nominated by those boards. The Information Society Commission is also made up of competent people who are expert in their field. We could go through the names of these people or I could give the lists of members of the boards. The Law Reform Commission has members from the eminent professions of the legal world and it is led by the honourable Mr. Justice Declan Budd. The members of all these boards are competent people.</P>
      <P>I disagree with Deputy Higgins and do not think the public at large feels boards are discredited. They believe the people who serve on these boards do a good job in return for little or nothing. They give up valuable time to serve on boards and sub-committees. I resent the fact that the Deputy, or anyone else, would question the integrity of board members who give of their time for practically nothing &ndash; I think they may get &euro;500 a year.</P>

      <P>They are confident, competent and qualified people. There have been a few breaches over the years but, by and large, the people who sit on State boards are highly competent people. When we sit in the national Parliament we should not criticise people. It is becoming increasingly difficult for people who serve on State boards, as there are more responsibilities and legal difficulties with which to cope. They are not a crowd of old hacks, they are people of expertise who are giving their service to the State, which it is increasingly difficult to do.</P>

      <P>Does the Taoiseach think there will be any State boards left by the end of the lifetime of the Government to which to appoint anyone? One could not open a newspaper last week or switch on a television without seeing the most recent acquisition to Government, the Minister of State at the Department of Finance, Deputy Parlon, like a crazed auctioneer swinging his gavel to sell whatever property fell within his path. Can the Taoiseach reassure the House that there will be State boards to which eminent people might be appointed on a pluralist basis?</P>
      <P>In regard to gender balance, the Minister of State at the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy O'Dea, recently threatened to bring in legislation to cause his Cabinet colleagues to observe the 40% rule. I presume he was only driven to those extremes because he thought it necessary to bring in legislation. Is it the general picture in Government that the 40% rule is not being observed?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>In reply to the first question, I think we have more State boards now than we had five years ago. While one or two may have ceased to exist there is a considerable number of additional ones.</P>
      <P>The gender balance on boards is always a bit of a battle, both on the part of nominating bodies and Departments to try to ensure that this is maintained. The position has improved and the Minister is right to keep the pressure on to try to achieve the target.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny" hpid="Mr. Kenny Mr. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>I looked at the Taoiseach's nominees in respect of the boards under the control of his Department and it is fair to say that there is a broad spread of expertise evident there. Many of these people appear to have been appointed by the groups they represent.</P>
      <P>I share the view of other speakers in regard to the matter of gender balance. The former Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Mervyn Taylor, who had responsibility for this area in the rainbow Government was very exacting in regard to reflecting a strong gender balance in appointments, which I think everybody can support.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Taoiseach referred to the responsible way in which former politicians have used their experience in respect of State boards. Prior to the flotation of Telecom Éireann, the political appointees to the board were asked to step down. <Col N="14" /> In the case of Aer Lingus, there are a number of political appointees there&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has already started moving in that regard to appoint aviation experts. Whatever happens to the future of the board, the Minister has moved in that way.</P>
      <P>As State boards, particularly the boards of commercial semi-State bodies, are concerned with big business, are highly complex and work in a very tight regulatory area one does not find people queuing up to take positions on them. Appointees to State boards realise very quickly that their appointments involve stringent commitments. Taking a position on a State board is very different today from ten or 20 years ago. It is becoming more and more difficult to find serious players for State boards, but that is what we have to do.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
      <P>I asked a question earlier to which I did not get a straight reply. I know the Taoiseach has feelings about the need for gender balance. Did the Minister of State with responsibility for equality write to the Taoiseach's Department and did the Taoiseach reply to the Minister of State, putting his feelings on paper? That is the question I asked earlier.</P>
      <P>In view of the fact that the system for making local authority appointments was found to be unsatisfactory and that the Local Appointments Commission was set up, does the Taoiseach see an independent public appointments system, which could be seen as such, as a logical follow-on to the Local Appointments Commission? In such a system lobbying would disqualify and the Taoiseach and Ministers could point to it as being similar to the system for making local authority appointments. Is it time for such a system to restore some of the credibility which has been lost in the public mind? When a decision such as the Bord Pleanála decision is made one asks why we do not have an independent appointments system and why the Government retains the right to make appointments, which compromises the independence of State boards.</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know if Deputy O'Dea wrote to my Department. He has been in touch with all Ministers, including myself, about the question of gender balance on boards. I am sure he has written to my Department &ndash; he speaks to all Members continually on this matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bord Pleanála Act took powers away from <Col N="15" /> the Government and gave them to nominating bodies. The Government appoints very few, if any, members to Bord Pleanála. People who have not been in Government may not appreciate &ndash; and I say that respectfully &ndash; that one does not have large numbers of people sending in CVs and seeking appointments to boards. That may have been the position in the past but it is not so now, given the regulatory climate that now exists. Whatever the task, one has to look for people with the necessary expertise.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent" hpid="Mr. Sargent Mr. Sargent">

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>One does not advertise. That is not a workable basis. The Government of the day has to look around. Increasingly, one requires people with international expertise and it is hard to find them. That may not be so in the case of some of the smaller and less significant boards but it is not easy to find competent and experienced people for the important main boards. Any chairman of a board or Minister wants to get people of the highest calibre because that is what makes a body function effectively.</P>

      <P>What steps has he taken in the current Dáil to address the imbalance? Picking up on the last response which the Taoiseach gave, will he agree the public advertisement inviting people to come forward who have real expertise, knowledge, qualification is the only way one can make a real assessment of the available pool of talent and suitability for such appointments? Surely, that is the major error in terms of the limited candidate pool. It is hardly beyond the bounds of possibility that this is based on the traditional view that cronyism rules O.K.

The statistics board is chaired by a woman and a number of its members are women. We comply with the gender balance rule <Col N="16" /> to the best of our ability. In regard to the independence of the board, often it is not the Minister but the agency that seeks members.

      <NameTxt>Minister for Transport (Mr. Brennan)</NameTxt>
      <P>Penalty points for speeding have been operating since 31 October 2002. Penalty points are being applied to the driving licence records of those convicted of speeding offences, and to those who pay a fixed charge to the Garda in order to prevent the instigation of court proceedings.</P>
      <P>Preliminary indications from the Garda Síochána in respect of the operation of the system to date, show that, with no reduction in enforcement efforts, there has been a significant drop in the level of detection of speeding offences. As the Deputy has averted to in the question, there was also a significant reduction in road deaths over that period. In the final two months of 2002 the total number of road deaths was 46 compared to 77 in the same period in 2001. This very welcome reduction in fatalities has continued in 2003. Provisional figures to 4 March 2003 show 49 road deaths compared to 69 on the same date last year.</P>
      <P>Penalty points are endorsed on the licence record held in the national driver file upon conviction for a speeding offence or upon payment of a fixed charge. The system operates in such a way that the offer of paying a fixed charge is always provided and a person has 56 days within which to pay the charge. If they opt not to pay, the case is taken to court. These periods are built into the system and ensure that every opportunity is afforded to the person to pay the fixed charge and avoid a court hearing. There is therefore an inevitable and intrinsic time-lapse between the issue of the notices, the payment of the fixed charge and the notification of the endorsement of penalty points. That the processing of notices by the Garda is operated on a manual basis, is a further contributory factor to those time lapses.</P>
      <P>I would like to refer briefly to an internal Garda report relating to the operation of penalty points leaked to members of the press on 9 March. I have been advised by senior management in the Garda that this report was commissioned in respect of the Dublin metropolitan area only and that it is already acting on its findings. I have been reassured by Garda management that it remains fully committed to the successful operation of the penalty points system.</P>
      <P>The recording of convictions for offences is a matter for the Courts Service. In addition, the compilation of data relating to payments of fixed charges where the relevant notices are issued by the Garda Síochána is a matter for that force. Both organisations transfer the appropriate data to the Department of the Environment and Local Government to facilitate its entry into the national driver file which is the responsibility of that Department. It is understood from the Department of the Environment and Local Government that 8,289 penalty point notices have issued as of 5 March 2003.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <i>Additional Information</i>The underlying focus and aim of the penalty <Col N="18" /> points system is to improve driver behaviour. The most telling commentary on the success of the system will be the degree to which its presence and application contribute to a sustained reduction in road deaths.</P>
    <P>Responsibility for the provision of traffic signs relating to speed limits on our roads is a matter for local authorities. Such signs may only be provided to indicate the locations where particular speed limits are being applied. While speed limits are determined either directly under the Road Traffic Acts or under regulations which I may make under those Acts, determinations in relation to the application of particular speed limits at locations is a matter for the elected members of the major local authorities. They are empowered to make by-laws relating to speed limits following consultation with the Garda and with the consent of the National Roads Authority in the case of national roads.</P>
    <P>I recently announced the launch of a comprehensive review of speed limits. This review will address all the major issues relating to speed limit policy, including the range of speed limits deployed, the signage used to indicate speed limits and the implications of the adoption of metric values. A broadly based working group has been established to carry out this review and it has already commenced its consideration of this complex subject.</P>
    <P>In the context of that review my Department has also written to local authorities seeking confirmation as to the status of by-laws in each of their areas and requesting them to review the appropriateness of the speed limits there.</P>

The electorate does not believe that because it would overload the system even more. The Minister, his officials and the Garda implementation group must have known what was happening. The introduction of the penalty points system has been a huge success and we want to see it continue. Is the Minister saying that all motorists who break the speed limit will receive penalty points and that where they go to court many will not get off because the case is statute-barred?

      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>The main focus of the exercise conducted by Warburg Dillon Read in 1999 was to review the strategic options for the future of Aer Rianta. As regards the concept of an independently owned terminal at Dublin Airport operating in competition with Aer Rianta, the general thrust of the consultants report, based on a very brief review of the issue, was negative.</P>
      <P>Much, however, has changed in the aviation sector since that time and this process of change, which is global in nature, will continue. A slowdown in the world economy which began in 2000 was exacerbated in Ireland the following year by the outbreak of the foot and mouth disease epidemic in the UK and the necessary measures which we put in place to ensure that our country remained disease free. However, it was the dreadful terrorist attacks in the US on 11 September that year which had the most drastic negative effects on the global aviation industry and international travel in recent times. A number of major, well-known airlines have not survived the downturn in the market following those events and most other airlines, including Aer Lingus, have had to implement restructuring measures and survival plans to ensure their continued existence on a viable basis.</P>
      <P>Even while the repercussions of those events are still with us, we now have the possibility of a war in Iraq which would further adversely affect international civil aviation and tourism. Compared to four years ago, the global aviation landscape has changed dramatically and it is not only prudent but necessary that we look afresh at our structures and organisations involved in the aviation sector to ensure that we are equipped to deal with the challenges facing us in the changed, and still changing, environment before us.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Last month, I received the report from the panel of experts, chaired by Mr. Paddy Mullarkey, former Secretary at the Department of Finance, which I established to examine the expressions of interest received in relation to the question of an independent terminal at Dublin Airport. The panel concluded that the development of an independently funded and operated terminal is operationally and technically feasible and that such a terminal is a viable strategic option for the development of Dublin Airport <Col N="21" /> and would elicit considerable market interest. I have made arrangements for that report to be published shortly on my Department's website.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Additional Information</i>
    </P>
    <P>
      <i>
      </i>I have also arranged for a process of consultation to get under way immediately with relevant interested parties and stakeholders in relation to the panel's report on the independent terminal concept at Dublin Airport. The board of Aer Rianta, the unions representing employees in the company and the Commission for Aviation Regulation will be involved in this consultation process which will also deal with the other major initiative relating to airports policy in the programme for Government, namely, the issue of greater autonomy and independence for Shannon and Cork airports. Following this consultation process, it is my intention to bring proposals to Government in relation to these two major issues.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RoisinShortall" hpid="Ms Shortall Ms Shortall">
      <NameTxt>Ms Shortall</NameTxt>
      <P>It appears from newspaper reports and the most recent Mullarkey report that while a second independent terminal may be feasible &ndash; I do not think that was ever in dispute &ndash; the likelihood is that there will be major job losses if it goes ahead, the value of Aer Lingus will be significantly undermined and, most importantly from the Minister's point of view, given the manner in which he strongly promotes competition in the State sector, it is likely to result in increased airport charges. Will the Minister tell us the arguments in favour of having an independently owned second terminal at Dublin Airport?</P>

      <P>The mid-term review of the national development plan referred to in my reply of 5 February is a matter for the Department of Finance. That Department is currently procuring consultancy assistance for the review which will be undertaken in the course of this year. That evaluation and review will provide an independent analysis of progress to date and a basis for decisions regarding programme adjustments. Such decisions will also have to take the prevailing economic and budgetary circumstances into account. I expect the review to be completed by the end of the year.</P>
      <P>Pending completion of the review, it is not possible to comment on what adjustments might be made between and within programmes and whether a single priority listing for both public transport and roads will be developed.</P>
      <P>It is my intention, however, that the review should reflect the Government's commitment in An Agreed Programme for Government to implementing an integrated transport policy. The establishment of my Department as a stand-alone Department of Transport, encompassing national roads, public transport and aviation is testament to the priority which this Government is giving to the need for integrated transport policies. My Department has completed the preparation of a statement of strategy in accordance with the terms of the Public Services Management Act 1997 which will be published shortly. The strategy will set out our key objectives, strategies and outputs for the three years 2003-05, including what actions we propose to take in relation to the development of an integrated transport policy. It is important, therefore, that the mid-term review reflects this.</P>
      <P>In this context, it is also my intention to seek to maintain a high level of investment in national roads and public transport in view of their importance for national and regional development.</P>

      <P>Does the Minister agree that when asking questions on public transport in the future, we should ask the Minister for Finance because it is clear from his comments today and from comments in the newspapers at the weekend that it is he who is making the decisions on transport? I refer to a letter from the Minister for Finance featured in the newspapers last weekend in which he reminded the Minister for Transport that the Government's priority was roads. Roads based public transport programmes have all the extra capital for the next three years. The Minister for Finance is not happy with the Minister for Transport for proposing public transport projects for which money is not available.</P>
      <P>Does the Minister agree that the Minister for Finance has now decided that the major public transport projects which we hope to see will not be financed, that instead we will continue for the next three years with the same 6:1 investment in roads to public transport and that that is Government transport? What analysis has been done on that roads based programme? What analysis has been done comparing the need for a public transport system as against a new roads programme? Will any analysis be done before the end of this year when another budget will be passed, another year of missed opportunities will have gone by, when the railway strategic review and the metro will be cast aside for lack of money and every public transport scheme we are seeking will be cast aside because the Minister for Finance is deciding transport policy?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. Brennan Mr. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister for Finance is not deciding transport policy; I am deciding it. The Minister for Finance writes to all Ministers. I am sure if it was possible to get the letter to which the Deputy referred, it would be possible to get the other 14. The Minister for Finance writes to each Department regularly reminding them that they are talking up their budgets and are spending too much money. That is what Ministers for Finance do well. My job is to develop the transport system. I do not have a difficulty with what the Deputy said in that it should be fully integrated. I am a supporter of public transport. I believe in investing in railways and in the Luas, in developing the metro and in providing new rail carriages because, as this country develops over the next five to 20 years, the population continues to grow and as economic growth continues, it is clear that the type of country we will have will require a solid, professional and modern railway system, particularly a high speed inter-city service. Dublin city and other cities will require modern bus and rail projects. I have no difficulty with that and the Deputy will see that when the strategic rail review is published.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I checked the figures because the Deputy asked me to on the last occasion we discussed this issue. In the national development plan as published, the roads commitment to the end of 2002 was &euro;2.6 billion and for railways, it was &euro;1.4 billion. The Deputy's 6:1 assessment is not accurate in <Col N="25" /> that sense. The figures given to me by the Department are &euro;2.6 billion for roads and &euro;1.4 billion for railways.</P>
    <P>As regards rail investment, there has been a 50% increase in DART capacity and new carriages have been provided on that service. There has been a 100% increase on the Maynooth line. Almost all the mainline rail network is new in that there is continuous welded track as opposed to the old broken line. There is a modern swish effect, as it were, from the railway. Having spent hundreds of millions on new railway tracks in recent years, it would be foolish to turn around and not continue to develop them and put carriages on them. It is a matter of where one draws the line between the two.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonRyanGP" hpid="Mr. Eamon Ryan Mr. Eamon Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Eamon Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>To make my figures clear, this year's budget advocated &euro;1.25 billion for new roads. If one takes out current expenditure on public transport, that is, keeping CIE afloat, and one looks at public transport capital expenditure, which is approximately, &euro;200 million, it is a figure of 6:1. Will the Minister agree to review that ratio or does he agree with the Minister for Finance that for the next three years, we must maintain that ratio? While I welcome making the rail line safe, that is not a big increase in public transport capacity. Will the Minister review the ratio of spending?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. Brennan Mr. Brennan">

      <P>I continue to do that. That is one of the benefits of having for the first time an integrated Department of Transport. For the past eight or nine months, we have a Department which asks whether we should put more money into a particular rail service or into a particular road service. That did not happen under successive Governments. I will continue to review it and take account of what the Deputy said.</P>

      <askee>Minister for Transport</askee>
      <Quest>the reasons thousand of motorists are unable to obtain dates for driving tests at his Department's office in Ballina, County Mayo; if his attention has been drawn to the fact that there are now thousands of drivers who now have no legal entitlement to drive as they have completed their full term on a provisional licence and now must obtain a date for a driving test before another provisional licence can be obtained from the local authority; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. Brennan Mr. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>In order for a person to obtain a third or subsequent provisional driving licence, the person concerned must have undergone a driving test for the category of vehicle within the preceding two years, or have a driving test appointment arranged.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My Department has a procedure in place to facilitate candidates for a driving test who require a test date in order to renew a provisional driving <Col N="26" /> licence that has expired or is about to expire. Arising from a recent disruption of the driver testing IT system due to technical difficulties, this process was interrupted for a period of almost two weeks. The problem has now been resolved and the scheduling of advanced dates for those who require a test date in order to renew their provisional licence has resumed.</P>
    <P>However, in view of the significant volume of applications for a driving test currently on hand and the need to deal with the scheduling backlog that arose due to the fault in the IT system, the issuing of test dates for all seeking a date so as to enable them to renew a licence will require time. Staff in the section are working overtime to clear the current backlog and I would like to take this opportunity to ask people to be patient.</P>
    <P>The current level of applications for the driving test and the resultant backlog is unprecedented. While the capacity of the driving test service to deliver tests has increased significantly in recent years I am considering, in consultation with the Minister for Finance, what other measures can be taken to enable tests to be offered within the shortest possible time. Such measures are likely to include additional overtime work to allow tests to take place outside normal working hours and on Saturdays and recruitment of retired testers. In common with all driver testers, any additional tester employed will be given appropriate training and will be supervised in the normal way to ensure that a uniform standard of test is delivered. Talks with the Department of Finance and staff associations are being intensified by my officials with a view to securing agreement to a package of measures to address the backlog.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaulConnaughton" hpid="Mr. Connaughton Mr. Connaughton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connaughton</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister understated the position. There is chaos in the Department in Ballina. Thousands of young people are unable to drive to work because they are not legally entitled to drive a car. Their entitlements under the provisional licence are gone because they have used their two provisional licences and have applied to Ballina for a driving test in order to get the next provisional licence. What is the legal standing of the thousands of people involved if they are hauled in by the local garda on a driving charge?</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. Brennan Mr. Brennan">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I have put in place an overtime package for the testers. Additional testers are being taken on from the retirement pool and there has been an agreement to work evenings and Saturdays. This will turn out about 40,000 extra tests per year. The system can at present turn out about 200,000 car tests annually while the backlog is 130,000. With the additional <Col N="27" /> resources, a hole can quickly be put in the backlog. The extra applications have been made because of the announcement of my intention to tighten up in this area. I have not moved on that yet because my focus is to ensure that those who have applied for tests get them. I hope a hole can be made in the backlog as soon as possible.</P>
      <P>The national waiting time at present is 23 weeks on average. It is significantly less in some places and more in others.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. Brennan Mr. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>The estimated costs, tender price and predicted completion date for the Dublin Port tunnel together with the subsidence issues at Fairview are matters for the National Roads Authority and Dublin City Council. However, I am informed by the NRA that the Dublin Transportation Initiative in its final report, dated 1994, identified a tunnel from Whitehall to Dublin Port as the preferred option for resolving Dublin Port access problems. The estimated cost of this proposal, which was a single bore tunnel only, was &euro;132 million. The Dublin Port tunnel developed from this proposal. However, the current tunnel is very different from that originally set out in the DTI strategy. It is, for example, a twin bore instead of a single bore, it extends to Santry instead of Whitehall, and is much deeper where it passes under houses.</P>
      <P>The original tender price for construction was &euro;449 million in June 2000. Together with land and property compensation, supervision costs and other miscellaneous costs, the current estimated all-in cost of the current project is &euro;625 million. The estimated completion date is early 2005.</P>
      <P>The National Roads Authority has overall responsibility for the planning and supervision of works for the construction and maintenance of national roads. In particular, it supervises the award of major road contracts by individual road authorities against relevant public procurement criteria including economic advantage to the public sector. In this context, all major road projects, including the port tunnel project, are subject to cost-benefit analysis and to assessment and evaluation at relevant stages, in accordance with the Department of Finance guidelines on the appraisal and management of capital projects. The port tunnel project at all stages satisfied these requirements.</P>
      <P>As regards the subsidence issues referred to by the Deputy, on Monday 3 March, Iarnród Éireann instructed the port tunnel contractors to cease all tunnelling works under the railway at Fairview, following two incidents which occurred during the construction of temporary supports at the site. These temporary supports are being constructed beneath the railway line to enable permanent works to follow with the construction of the tunnel itself.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is important to note that Iarnród Éireann has confirmed that the two incidents, on 23 February <Col N="29" /> and 1 March, did not pose a danger to railway operations. The incidents related to the failure of a supporting beam in a pilot tunnel and also to the slippage of about five cubic metres of material in a header tunnel. These incidents are being investigated by the contractors, Dublin City Council, Iarnród Éireann and their advisers.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RoisinShortall" hpid="Ms Shortall Ms Shortall">
      <NameTxt>Ms Shortall</NameTxt>
      <P>I asked the Minister a detailed question and gave the required notice for it. I am disappointed he has not answered it in full. I realise there were changes at the start when the project went from a single bore to a twin bore tunnel and moved from Whitehall to Santry. Given the final line and shape of the tunnel, what was the original estimate for that tunnel? What is the variation between that and the final contract price? In both cases, what cost-benefit analysis was undertaken and who carried it out? What was the projected rate of return in each scenario?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. Brennan Mr. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is correct in the sense that it is increasingly important to compare like with like in regard to big projects, and I am having difficulty trying to do that with regard to many projects. Some figures include property purchase and CPO costs while others do not.</P>
      <P>With regard to the port tunnel, the figure that should be compared to the estimated outturn of &euro;625 million is the original tender price, including a view at that time of all the add-ons, which comes to &euro;533 million. The original all-in price of the finally settled on project, after all the issues to do with different size bores were considered, was &euro;533 million. The estimated outturn is now &euro;625 million and the completion date will be early 2005.</P>
      <P>I do not know who carried out the cost-benefit analysis but I will find that out for the Deputy. I can supply the economic rate of return in regard to those economic analyses. The construction is well under way.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. Brennan Mr. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>We are not talking about figures thrown around before formal tenders were received. Once formal tenders were received and settled on, the figure was &euro;533 million. The comparable figure now is &euro;625 million. The analysis, based on 1997 prices, indicated a benefit-to-cost ratio of 3:5 and an internal rate of return of 14.8%. Both of these figure indicate a very robust economic performance.</P>

      <P>An initial consultation process has been completed with regard to the possible reintroduction of a maximum height for vehicles in use in a public place. My Department will now prepare an initial draft of regulations, taking account of the views of various parties, which include hauliers, Irish Rail, the National Roads Authority and the Department of the Environment and Local Government. The draft will take account of the economic, rail safety and road safety considerations as well as the need to protect costly transport infrastructure.

There are trucks in use on Irish roads at the moment that will not fit into the tunnel as it is currently planned.

      <P>The Government is committed to the development of the rail network as part of an overall strategy to support and maintain sustainable economic development. Capital investment in the rail network has been increasing year on year in recent years. This continuing commitment is reflected in the provision of approximately &euro;330 million in the current year in Exchequer and EU funds, an increase of 15% on 2002. Agreement has also been reached with the Minister for Finance to maintain current levels of Exchequer capital funding in public transport under the national development plan. This will result in investment of over &euro;1 billion in the rail network over the next four years, and no cutback in funding is envisaged.</P>

      <P>Has a study been done by Iarnród Éireann on the possibility of reopening the line from Clonsilla to Navan, via Dunboyne? Has the Minister received an estimate of the cost of this from Iarnród Éireann and do the figures quoted allow for the commencement of works of this kind within the planning period?</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I asked the consultants who drew up the strategic rail review to have a particular look at that line, as well as roughly half a dozen other proposed new lines, and the results of their work can be seen shortly when I publish the review. It is no secret that the review will indicate that there are greater priorities, such as inter-city lines between Dublin, Cork, Galway, Limerick and so on. The review envisages prioritising these networks before proceeding to examine whether lines such as the one referred to by the Deputy are viable. The jury is out on the project. I do not have details and statistics on particular lines, but I will certainly obtain those on behalf of the Deputy. However, the project is unlikely to commence in the short-term.</P>

      <P>When the viability of potential lines is being assessed, are calculations based on existing populations along those lines or on the populations of those areas that are envisaged in the Government's spatial plan? Is the Minister aware that the population of Navan is projected to treble in the near term? Will he assure me that, in deciding that the line to Navan is not a priority but a posteriority, the guidelines in regard to population have been properly taken into account by the consultants? If they have not, will the Minister send the report back to the consultants and ask them to re-do their work?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. Brennan Mr. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I instructed the consultants to take into account the population figures mentioned in the national spatial strategy before finalising their report. They are aware that Navan is growing rapidly. I intend to continue to examine about six lines that are in a similar category, for example by assessing the finances that are available to fund them. A conclusion on the lines will <Col N="34" /> be reached in the not too distant future. I am not prepared to take them off the agenda, but it is unlikely that they will be proceeded with at an early stage.</P>

      <P>The national spatial strategy was published after the strategic review the Minister mentioned in his reply to Deputy Bruton. Will the Minister outline the position on to the proposal to run a commuter service between Galway and Athlone, which is a gateway under the spatial strategy? Places like Athlone are as entitled to investment as anywhere else, if the strategy is to mean anything. Where does the project stand?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>Additional track would be needed, however, to turn it into a commuter line. It has been suggested that the commuter line should run as far as Ballinasloe or Oranmore, but that it should not go beyond that. I asked the consultants to examine these issues, as I am interested in investing in commuter lines about an hour outside all our cities.</P>

      <P>Is the Minister aware that the county development plan in County Cork is entirely dependent on the development of a railway link in east Cork? The plan was drawn up with rail services in mind. Can the Minister provide any new information about the east Cork line? His predecessor was quite anxious that the county development plan be put in place so that the rail link would follow. The plan is in place, but there may be chaos and the plan may collapse if the railway services I have mentioned are not developed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 135, 143 and 154 together.</P>
      <P>I have been engaged in ongoing dialogue with the various stake holders in relation to my proposals since I made a statement to the Public Transport Partnership Forum on 7 November 2002. I have met the boards of CIE and its three operating subsidiaries and I have had a series of discussions with the trade unions. I intend to continue that dialogue, with the objective of seeking an agreed approach to the reform programme based on the principles set out in my November statement. I have also indicated that I intend that the detailed preparatory work on implementation will proceed in parallel.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The initial meeting of the restructuring implementation group, which has been established to oversee the process of restructuring CIE as three independent companies, was held on 20 February 2003. The group consists of representatives of the CIE holding company, the three operating companies &ndash; Bus Átha Cliath, Bus Éireann and Iarnród Éireann &ndash; my Department and the Department of Finance. I invited the trade unions to submit a short paper to the implementation group, identifying their principal concerns about the restructuring of CIE, but they have not yet made a submission. As part of the ongoing dia<Col N="36" /> logue with stake holders, it was agreed at a meeting with the CIE trade unions on 4 February that there would be bilateral discussions between my Department and the trade unions to explore the reform of the bus market in the greater Dublin area. Three meetings have taken place since that date and the objective is to conclude these discussions by the end of March. My officials have met the management of Dublin Bus in this regard twice and I did so on one occasion.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms Shortall</NameTxt>
      <P>What time scale has the Minister set for the implementation group? What does the Minister think of the CIE holding company? Does he accept that there will be a need for a holding company of sorts, given the common work done by the three companies at present? I presume the Minister accepts that there will be major additional costs if payrolls and pensions are handled separately by each of the constituent companies. Does the Minister accept that a type of holding company will still be needed? In the context of the plans that have been outlined by the Minister, what are his proposals for the CIE Tours group?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. Brennan Mr. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I will ask the implementation group for a progress report in the next month or two. I have not changed my opinion of the holding company since we last discussed it &ndash; I intend to dissolve it completely and to establish the three companies on an independent basis as full State companies. I still intend to open 25% of the Dublin bus market next year. I do not accept that there is a need for a holding company, as the three companies are well able to run their own businesses and to operate their own pensions and properties. There is a good future for the three companies in a competitive environment. I have asked the unions to work with me and to accept that opening the Dublin bus market is a legitimate policy. We should not talk about whether the market is to be opened, but about how it is to be done. I am keen to open the market early next year. I have no specific proposals for CIE Tours. The future of companies owned by the holding company will arise when the three companies have been established independently. The future of CIE Tours, which is a very successful company, will be considered at that point.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>Integrated ticketing is taking place to a limited extent at present, ahead of the breaking up of CIE, so that process is not an <Col N="37" /> issue. The non-existence of a holding company will not affect integrated ticketing. It is planned that companies other than CIE will operate as well. Luas will be run by a French company and an increasingly large number of private bus services are in operation. I am determined that the bus market in Dublin and elsewhere will open to the private sector in 2004. The question of integrated ticketing will need to be addressed by public and private sector companies and not just within the CIE group. Deputies are aware that there are two types of integrated ticketing &ndash; the highly technical model, which will take another two years to put in place, and the shorter and sharper version, which does not need as much technology. I have asked my officials to examine the latter type and to bring forward proposals in relation to it. An enormous amount of technology may have to be installed in bus and train stations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoisinShortall" hpid="Ms Shortall Ms Shortall">
      <NameTxt>Ms Shortall</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister outline the estimated cost of the proposed break-up of the CIE group? Does he intend to meet representatives of Bus Éireann, including management and trade unions which have expressed grave concerns about the proposals, to discuss competition in the bus market outside the greater Dublin area?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. Brennan Mr. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot outline the cost of the break-up. It could be argued that the removal of the holding company will save money; it does not necessarily have to cost money.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. Brennan Mr. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>They will have to be re-allocated to the companies on a rational basis. I do not think additional costs will arise from the closure of the holding company.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoisinShortall" hpid="Ms Shortall Ms Shortall">
      <NameTxt>Ms Shortall</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. Brennan Mr. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not envisage additional costs, apart from the cost of making it happen, which should not be that great. The three companies should be able to operate without the need for a holding company. The holding company is not saving them money. It has done its job and it is now time for the three companies to compete with each other and to run their own affairs.</P>
      <P>I have already met the board of Bus Éireann, I met the trade unions regarding bus transport outside Dublin, and I will meet the management. We have regular meetings with unions and management on all these issues. I am keen to engage in discussions but am also determined to make progress. If the Deputy and other Deputies think our policies are not correct, they are fully entitled to criticise them. I am interested to hear their views on opening up the market in Dublin. I am not sure if they are for it or against it.</P>

      <P>Given that the Minister is in Government and benefits from the privileges associated with that, will he indicate clearly when his policy of introducing competition will come into effect? When does he expect all bus routes to be open to competition? He has a majority in the Dáil to make this happen so he does not have to worry about the Opposition for the moment. Will the policy come into effect within one, two or three years, and does anybody have a veto?</P>
      <P>Is it not the case that £1 million was received by the Government from the EU during the reign of the Minister's predecessor for the purpose of integrated ticketing? Where has that money gone and why is the Government so slow to introduce integrated ticketing? Does the Minister have any lessons to learn from the failure to introduce it so far, despite the fact that it has been stated Government policy for the past five years? This is an example of the failure of public administration.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms Shortall</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister accept that deregulation of the bus market outside the Dublin area has led to chaos in many areas where private bus operators are arriving three or four minutes before the scheduled Bus Éireann buses? I recently brought to his attention the case in Cavan where Bus Éireann was told to cease running a very successful service to Dublin, which ran at 6 and 7 o'clock in the morning. It was told to stop because a private operator had been licensed on the route and was running a bus at 6.30 a.m. that did not suit anybody. There has been a deterioration in the service and competition did not benefit commuters. Does the Minister accept that this is unsatisfactory? What are his proposals for regulation of the market?</P>

      <P>In the past hour, the Office of the Information Commissioner has produced an 81 page report into the application and operation of certain provisions of the Freedom of Information Act 1997. This is invaluable work from a non-political body and deserves every consideration. Given that the high level group set up last June to review the Act has not consulted the Information Commissioner, the National Union of Journalists, the community and voluntary organisations, the public or the Opposition parties, does the Taoiseach not consider it proper that there should be an adequate period of reflection before considered views are taken on the review of the Act? Given that the Government intends to ram the Act through the Seanad this week, will the Taoiseach not do the decent thing and withdraw it so there will be sufficient reflection and agreement on the way to proceed? Otherwise, he will make a shambles of it, as has happened to date.</P>

      <P>The Freedom of Information Act established three legal rights for each person to access information held by public bodies, to have official personal information amended where it is incomplete, incorrect or misleading, and to obtain reasons for decisions affecting him or her. None of these rights has been changed in the Bill before the Seanad.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Out of the 370 bodies, only a small number will be affected by the changes being proposed. The FOI legislation is about allowing the public to <Col N="41" /> continue to have the same access to information on planning issues in An Bord Pleanála, tourism matters in Bord Fáilte, road planning by the NRA, anti-competitive practices investigated by the Competition Authority, issues relating to the environment or the EPA, valuations by the Valuation Office and records held by local and regional authorities, health boards, third level institutes and many of the other 370 bodies. The changes will only affect matters which relate to collective Cabinet responsibility, issues still subject to the deliberative process as designated by a Secretary General, certain information pertaining to parliamentary questions, records relating to tribunals, costs of proposals of political parties and records concerning security, defence and international relationships. The proposed changes do not represent a complete overhaul of the Act, which was examined from a limited perspective.</P>
    <P>In preparing the legislative amendments, Departments considered technical measures, the 1999 review conducted by the Civil Service users group, discussions and interactions with the Office of the Information Commissioner and experience of the operation of the 1997 Act. The State has moved quickly to implement freedom of information according to an elaborative system. The freedom of information central policy unit of the Department of Finance chairs an interdepartmental working group and a public service users group on which all sectors of civil and public service covered by the legislation are represented. Below these umbrella groups, Departments and offices, local authorities, health boards and universities meet on an ongoing basis to consider issues of common concern and to share learning and experience. All these networks, groups and arrangements underpinning freedom of information have ensured that the Act has been under continuous review since it came into force five years ago.</P>
    <P>The Freedom of Information (Amendment) Bill is based on all the experience represented by the foregoing and has been prepared on foot of the Government's consideration of the review by the high-level group which looked at a limited area. The group examined the annual reports of the information commissioner.</P>

Surely, his report deserves Oireachtas consideration besides that of the Committee on Finance and the Public Service which is due to consider the matter on Thursday. This Bill will apply in full to each of the 370 agencies with the exception of the Cabinet. Is there something the Government does not wish the public to discover? Is there something it wishes to cover up?

The same is true of the Government's expectation that the Committee on Finance and the Public Service will deal with all these matters in one day. Given that he did not see fit to consult the Oireachtas, will the Taoiseach withdraw the Bill to give us all a decent opportunity to reflect on it?

It makes provisions relating to the working groups which operate in that context. There are a few other technical areas which also fall to be considered. The principles involved are features of legislation worldwide and I see nothing wrong with what we are doing. The Minister for Finance and his officials have all of next week to look at the excellent report the commissioner has produced.

      <P>If the Taoiseach cannot see anything wrong with this legislation, the Government must be more remote, arrogant and contemptuous than we imagined. This is the first time the Taoiseach has been in the House since publication of the Bill. It is being processed through the Seanad where it was treated on Second Stage as an emergency measure to be debated late into the night. The sponsoring Minister and the Minister of State are in Cheltenham. What greater contempt could be demonstrated for the Oireachtas? No space has been allowed between Second and Committee Stages, with the latter to be taken by a Minister of State who has probably not even read the Bill.</P>
      <P>How can the Taoiseach reconcile this with remarks he made to his annual conference before the last general election? How can he ignore the report of the Information Commissioner who is the referee in these matters? How could the Minister for Defence tell me on 4 March that amendments were submitted by the commissioner when we know from the information secured by Deputy Kenny today that he submitted amendments only after his Secretary General complained to the Department of Finance? He was told at that point to get his amendments in quickly. This is disgraceful treatment of the Oireachtas and the Information Commissioner, and it is designed to protect the Government.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The legislation is not being filleted. While a few technical changes are being made based on consideration of the reports I mentioned, the fundamental changes are in the area of collective Cabinet responsibility and the deliberative process. The Information Commissioner, who does an excellent job, is not the referee on the Constitution, nor is he the referee in terms of the deliberative process. He realises that and is not arguing contrary to it in the context of his areas of concern. As much as people would like matters to be otherwise to cause a fuss, that is how things stand.</P>
      <P>I have received correspondence from various organisations mentioned by Deputy Kenny. People thought provisions were being removed to deprive them of access to many things, but I have pointed out that this is not the case. Anyone can make that mistake, but the Freedom of Information Act established legal rights which continue to obtain. Each citizen has the right to access information held by public bodies, to have official personal information amended where it is incomplete, incorrect or misleading, to obtain reasons for decisions affecting him or her and to obtain information held by other organisations.</P>
      <P>Over the past five years, this Government has extended the number of bodies governed by the Act from a handful to 370 and will continue to extend it to the remainder. There is no change in any of that and it is totally misleading people to say that there is. There is a change in the area of the deliberative process which is even conditioned in the new legislation that it has to be authorised by a Secretary General in certain circumstances. The high level group was not asked to reform the legislation, it was only asked to look at the limited area of collective Cabinet responsibility and the deliberative process. It was the only change which it recommended.</P>

      <P>If that is true, why was it only given that remit? Of what is the Taoiseach afraid? Why did he not arrange to consult the users of the Act &ndash; consumer organisations, the NUJ, the relevant Oireachtas committee? How can the Taoiseach say these are only technical changes when they profoundly change the very essence of the legislation? How can re-designating part-time officials be regarded as merely technical? How can widening the definition of documents that are now considered related to Cabinet business be merely technical? How can giving the authority to Secretaries General to certify business be <Col N="45" /> described as being &ldquo;ongoing&rdquo;? Is the business &ldquo;ongoing&rdquo; that the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, missed when he was Attorney General, when a secret deal was being done between the religious congregations and the State that has ended up leaving the taxpayer liable for the burden, despite documents that we have now seen under the Freedom of Information Act, where the Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, at the time, made the same objections I have been making for the past three weeks?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeHiggins" hpid="Mr. J. Higgins Mr. J. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>In relation to Iraq, the Taoiseach writing in the <i>Irish Independent </i>on 1 February said: &ldquo; At a time of international crisis, it is the duty of Government to lead from the front.&rdquo; Since then, on the issue of Iraq the Taoiseach has not been so much sitting on the fence as encased in concrete upon it. We know that the Taoiseach likes to sit on the fence winking at both sides of the argument simultaneously. I am afraid that on this occasion it has left his two eyes shut to the appalling reality that is about to unfold in our world. It is quite clear that the United States intends to launch a bloody invasion of Iraq within weeks to secure the Iraqi oil fields for its economy and to extend imperialist control over the region.</P>
      <P>I ask the Taoiseach if he is aware that a huge majority of the Irish people are revolted by that and are deeply opposed to his Government continuing to be complicit in the US war machine build-up in the Middle East through giving them the use of Shannon Airport? Does the Taoiseach realise that if according to schedule he will present himself before President Bush on the White House lawn the day after tomorrow and politely present him with a bowl of shamrock, an emblem of the Irish people and make polite conversation with the President, this will be seen as solace and support for that President's war plans? It will be interpreted as such among the millions in the Arab world and among people who do not want to see this bloody adventure launched. Is the Taoiseach aware that if he does that, it will make a majority of our people deeply ashamed?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I ask if instead the Taoiseach will stand up and <Col N="47" /> send a message to the world that this country is absolutely opposed to the bloody adventure that is about to unfold at the expense of the Iraqi people, by boycotting the visit to President Bush and at least &ndash; as I have asked him before &ndash; leave the shamrock at home? He could instead bring a branch of fuschia because at least the bright red flowers will signify the blood of innocent thousands of people that the man receiving the shamrock is about to spill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government is deeply concerned at the recent developments which are changing by the day. Our goal remains the goal of the United Nations which is the disarming of the Iraqi regime by peaceful means if at all possible. That is the unanimous determination of the Security Council in Resolution 1441 on 8 November. Ireland helped to fashion that resolution. Regrettably, as Deputy Higgins has said, efforts to implement this resolution have led to tensions, including within the Security Council. We see Permanent Members of the Council working in direct opposition to each other every day.</P>
      <P>This is a cause of considerable regret to countries such as Ireland who look to the United Nations to serve the interests of all mankind by being a legitimate guarantor of international peace and security. Over the years we have looked to the United Nations for a collective foreign security policy. For the United Nations to be effective and respected, it must be united in purpose as well as in name. The brutal regime in Iraq poses precisely the kind of threat to international peace and security that the United Nations was created to deal with. That has always been this country's view. The ways and means were set out in the Charter in a logical sequence and they are up to and including the use of military force as a matter of last resort. The peoples of the United Nations in whose name the Charter is adopted are looking to the members of the Security Council to work together at this time on behalf of all members to restore unity in the Council and to secure the implementation of the resolutions by whatever means they deem to be appropriate and necessary. If the Security Council can prevail without the need for further death and suffering, so much the better and that is what we would like to see happen.</P>
      <P>I agree with Deputy Higgins that is what the vast majority of Irish people would like to see. Peaceful methods are always the preferred option and should be fully explored.</P>
      <P>Even at this late hour, the Minister for Foreign Affairs has been on the phone for the past 24 hours and over the weekend, talking to foreign Ministers and others to see what can be achieved. There must be an effort to try to force Saddam Hussein to take the opportunity to comply with the demands of the world as laid out in Resolution 1441 and 16 other resolutions. Only a Security Council that can demonstrate strength through unity is likely to persuade him to do so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="48" />In regard to the day after tomorrow, I will be at the White House. I respect the United States and its President. I respect what it stands for in the free world. I appreciate what it has done for this country. I appreciate its friendship and that of the United Kingdom. I differ on this issue. I will set out my point of view and stand with the United Nations, as I have done since I met Kofi Annan and made my first statement on the issue in Johannesburg on 4 September. I will not insult the United States.</P>

      <P>Does the Taoiseach realise that this is not a matter of polite debate between leaders? It is a matter of the blood of thousands of people being shed by the man he is visiting in pursuit of his country's economic interests. When did the Taoiseach realise Saddam Hussein was a bloody dictator? Surely it was not in November 1988 when the Minister, Deputy Brennan, was working out deals with his henchmen in Baghdad, months after the massacre and chemical weapons attack on thousands of innocent victims in Halabjah. When did the Taoiseach realise, like the rest of us, that this was an evil dictatorship? Does he realise that at this moment United States generals are all set and everything is prepared to launch a murderous assault with the greatest numbers of missiles in the shortest period in history on the heads of the Iraqi people, which will mean thousands of casualties?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Crawford</NameTxt>
      <P>I seek the adjournment of the Dáil under Standing Order 31 to discuss an issue of national importance regarding the removal of Teagasc advisory offices from rural Ireland, including the closure of the office in Bailieborough, County Cavan. The transfer from east Cavan to Ballyhaise of the advisory service will force many farmers out of business. The extra travel time of one hour each way for valuable advisers will cost extra in terms of time and expenses. Has the Government a commitment in real terms to rural Ireland? Government withdrawal from agriculture has caused the problems in Teagasc.</P>

      <P>I seek the adjournment of Dáil under Standing Order 31 to discuss a matter of urgent public importance, namely, the ever-growing crisis in the management and funding of the health services. It includes industrial action in the accident and emergency department of Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital, Drogheda, over-crowding at <Col N="50" /> Louth County Hospital, Dundalk, where patients are forced to queue for treatment in corridors without even the comfort of a chair, and lay-offs at the Mater Hospital, Dublin, a key strategic resource for the provision of many specialist treatments which are unavailable elsewhere.

      <P>The Order of Business today shall be No. 1, Health Insurance (Amendment) Bill 2003 [<i>Seanad</i>] &ndash; Second Stage. It is proposed, notwithstanding anything in Standing Orders, that the Dáil shall sit later than 8.30 p.m. tonight and business shall be interrupted not later than 10 p.m. Second Stage of No. 1 shall be taken today and the proceedings thereon shall, if not previously concluded, be brought to a conclusion at 10 p.m. Private Members' Business shall be No. 31 &ndash; Freedom of Information (Amendment) (No. 3) Bill 2003, and the proceedings on Second Stage thereon shall, if not previously concluded, be brought to a conclusion at 8.30 p.m. on Wednesday, 12 March 2003.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny" hpid="Mr. Kenny Mr. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the way the House is being treated by the Government, I object to a time limit being placed on the Bill. There is absolutely no reason on God's earth why the House cannot sit on Thursday or next week. For that reason, I oppose the Order of Business.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>It is proposed to ask Deputies to sit until 10 p.m. while our betters are disporting themselves in the Cotswolds. My office was advised this morning that a meeting of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs is to be cancelled, despite the great matters of which it is seized. Will the Taoiseach indicate if it <Col N="52" /> is his intention to summon the Minister for Finance to discharge his responsibilities in the Seanad on the disgraceful filleting of the Freedom of Information Act or is it the case that there are now two rules in this House, one of which allows Members on the Government side to demonstrate open contempt for the process of passing legislation?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent" hpid="Mr. Sargent Mr. Sargent">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
      <P>It is ironic that we are being asked to agree to a late sitting when the House will not sit on Thursday or next week. Many issues warrant debate. In objecting to this late sitting I ask that the business of the House be rescheduled to allow time for a debate on the crisis in Iraq. There will be a constitutional requirement to hold one.</P>
      <P>The absence of the Minister for Finance and his Minister of State illustrates that Ministers do not have to be present when their legislative proposals are presented to the House. It means that if Ministers are away for St. Patrick's Day, the House can proceed with its business.</P>

      <P>In the event of the British-US axis unleashing its war machine on the people of Iraq in the coming week on the expiry of the so-called deadline of 17 March, will the Taoiseach consider reconvening the Dáil in emergency session to address what would be a very serious development? Will he also indicate if such a debate will deal with the position this Parliament and the Government will adopt on behalf of the people on the question of military action in the absence of a second United Nations resolution and the continued use of Shannon Airport?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Chief Whip explained that in the absence of a sitting this Thursday, the House will sit on Friday, 4 April. I understood that was agreed. With regard to the points raised by Deputy Ó Caoláin, I have already given a commitment to hold a debate in the circumstances he outlined and I will honour it.</P>

      <P>That is a statistical question that the Minister of State might normally answer. In regard to the Good Friday Agreement, the House excused the Taoiseach for very good reasons last week and I would have expected that we would have some statements on the conclusion of the Hillsborough talks. As a party leader I was given a very detailed briefing by the Department of Foreign Affairs which I respected, as I am sure was the case with Deputy Rabbitte and other leaders. I was disappointed to see that elements of this were leaked to sections of the media and that the Taoiseach wrote an article for one of the Sunday papers. Will we have statements on the conclusion of the Hillsborough talks next week or the following week?</P>

      <P>I appreciate that in regard to Northern Ireland, very little of what took place last week has been in the public domain. Only a small fraction of events has been made public and much of what came out is not very accurate because it was a case of parties putting their positions in regard to the talks, with which I do not have any problem. If Deputy Kenny would like a debate we will look at that possibility but, if possible, I would rather leave it for a few weeks as there will be many meetings and consultations during the weekend after parties returned to Northern Ireland so I would like to leave it until after that. I do not have any difficulty with having a debate. It might be useful at the end of the month just before we come to the final decision but I would rather give the parties another opportunity to consult.</P>

      <P>Last week an undertaking was given to the Dáil by both the Tánaiste and the Minister for Defence that we would have a debate on Iraq. The undertaking was for a debate on Iraq &ndash; not on the desirability of unity on the Security Council. That was not the issue. In view of the Taoiseach's imminent meeting with the President of the United States, and in advance of the vote on the Security Council, people want to know where the Government stands on the option of a continuation of the work of the arms inspectors and the threat of war. No undertaking has been given as to when such a debate will take place. The clear impression has been created that we will try to slide past the meetings of the Security Council without the Government having indicated where it stands on this issue. I do not want another long homily on the desirability of unity. The Taoiseach is inclined to do that.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I am pleased to address the House today on the Second Stage of the Health Insurance (Amendment) Bill 2003. This is a brief Bill aimed at facilitating the early submission of a draft risk equalisation scheme for affirmation by the House, as provided for under the Health Insurance Acts 1994 and 2001. The need for the further provisions set out in the Bill arises from comprehensive consultations held with the Health Insurance Authority since its establishment and matters that arose in the course of preparing the detailed risk equalisation scheme. The authority will have a key role in the determination of whether risk equalisation is commenced, and also in the monitoring and the administration of the scheme.</P>
      <P>The Bill has two main provisions. The first provides a broad immunity from liability for damages for the Health Insurance Authority when discharging its statutory functions in good faith and provides for indemnification. The second is to ensure that the temporary exemption from risk equalisation, which has as its objective the encouragement of competition, can be availed of only by genuine new entrants to the market.</P>
      <P>The remaining provisions of the Bill cover procedural matters relating to proposed risk equalisation arrangements and to funding advanced for the establishment of the Health Insurance Authority.</P>
      <P>A draft risk equalisation scheme has been prepared by my Department and is currently the subject of consideration by the EU Commission Competition Directorate General. I will refer to the position on bringing this to the House for approval a little later. The provisions of the scheme will aim to achieve a balance between safeguarding the stability of community rating and facilitating competition in the provision of health insurance. They will reflect the central role to be carried out by the Health Insurance Authority, HIA, both in relation to determining the necessity for the commencement of risk equalisation and the manner of its application.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The following are to be among the key features of the scheme as they relate to the HIA. It will evaluate statutory data returns from participating insurers concerning the nature and distribution of insured risks between those insurers. It will prepare and submit reports and recommendations to the Minister for Health and Children, on the basis of its evaluation and analysis of the returns <Col N="64" /> received from insurers. The scheme provides for the HIA to have a major responsibility in relation to any decision to commence risk equalisation payments between insurers. Between two specified parameters, set out under the scheme as measures of differentials in the risk profiles of insurers, the HIA will recommend for or against the commencement of equalisation transfers between insurers. Within these parameters, it will not be open to the Minister to commence actual risk equalisation between insurers without a recommendation to that effect from the HIA. If the measure of differentials exceeds the higher parameter the Minister will be obliged to consult with the HIA as to whether there are good reasons for not commencing risk equalisation between insurers. The authority will have power to determine the basis on which risk equalisation payments should be calculated. The HIA's role in this regard will relate to the risk factors that are to be taken into account in the process. Age and gender differentials are automatically taken into account. The third factor to be included is a measure for health status, based on hospital bed utilisation. The HIA will have the power to determine the extent to which this factor is taken into account, subject to the authority having established that this is warranted by circumstances relating to the differences in risk profiles between insurers and is in the best overall interests of health insurance consumers.</P>
    <P>The necessity for risk equalisation to support the operation of community rating in our voluntary private health insurance market going forward has been extensively discussed in the House previously. I trust that most Members will support a draft scheme that strikes a balance between maintaining community rating and facilitating competition. Under the existing legislation, a draft scheme must be submitted to each House of the Oireachtas for approval. This will remain the position on the passing of the Bill now before us for consideration.</P>
    <P>At the general level, the objective of risk equalisation is easily appreciated. It follows logically that, in a market where the principles of community rating, open enrolment and lifetime cover apply, there must be a provision to share risk between competing health insurers. These common good principles curb the usual commercial instincts and incentives that insurers have to select good risks and avoid or discourage bad ones. In order for these principles to be sustainable, they must be supported by a balancing mechanism that enables insurers with worse than average risks to be compensated for the disproportionate level of the sick and elderly in the insured community they must cover.</P>
    <P>From the perspective of insurers, risk equalisation addresses the competitive imbalance that can occur as a result of risk selection, whether this occurs due to deliberate actions by insurers or inadvertently because of the more mobile nature of the young and healthy and employer paid insurance. In effect risk equalisation seeks to <Col N="65" /> tackle risk selection as a source of competitive advantage. This is equitable given that the usual insurance levers of underwriting and risk-based pricing are not available to competing insurers.</P>
    <P>The consequence of risk selection is that the <i>per capita</i> claims cost, and consequently premiums, start to rise for those insurers who are left with a higher proportion of less healthy individuals. This is a breach of the &ldquo;solidarity&rdquo; principle, which is fundamental to genuine community rating. Risk equalisation addresses this by limiting the extent to which certain healthier people, by benefiting from lower premiums, and-or their insurers by taking a higher profit margin can gain at the expense of other health insurance consumers. In short, risk equalisation aims to equitably adjust differences in health insurers' costs that arise due to variations in risk profiles.</P>
    <P>The detailed preparation of a risk equalisation scheme has been a complex matter, which has involved considerable actuarial expertise and also legal input, in addition to the consultations with the Health Insurance Authority. It has also been necessary to approach the formulation of the scheme in a manner that takes account of considerations that apply at European Union level. These relate to matters such as observance of general European Union legal principles of necessity and proportionality, competition rules and creation of the Single Market. It is widely known that plans for the regulation of our health insurance market have been the subject of fundamental differences with The British United Provident Association, BUPA, which entered the market in 1997. Given this situation and that the operation of this country's private health insurance market is subject to EU obligations, the regulatory measures to be implemented have attracted close and recurring interest on the part of EU Commission services.</P>
    <P>My Department has, at all times, kept the Commission advised of proposed regulatory arrangements. Although the Commission has formally accepted, in principle, Ireland's entitlement to have specific legal provisions in the interest of the common good in voluntary health insurance, as allowed for under the third non-life insurance directive, it has emphasised the need for necessity and proportionality in any measures that may be taken. Furthermore, ongoing representations and complaints by BUPA have resulted in the Commission revisiting the matter on a number of occasions, up to and including the present time.</P>
    <P>The current position is that BUPA Ireland has made a complaint to the Europe Union Commission that risk equalisation would constitute an illegal State aid and the EU's Competition Directorate General is considering a detailed notification made by my Department in response. This makes the case in relation to the necessity for risk equalisation, and furthermore that its introduction does not constitute State aid under EU competition rules. The timetable for bringing the draft scheme to the Houses of the Oireachtas will be determined in the light of the outcome of <Col N="66" /> these latest deliberations at EU level. It is however my desire and intention that consideration of a draft scheme by the Houses of the Oireachtas can take place at an early date.</P>
    <P>While the experience of EU Commission services revisiting the matter of risk equalisation on a number of occasions has impinged on the process of implementing a scheme, I would characterise recent contacts with the EU Competition Directorate General as being positive and constructive.</P>
    <P>This is a short Bill and while some aspects are technical its provisions are relatively straightforward. Section 1 provides for interpretation. Section 2 relates to the provision of a definition of functions in the Principal Act. The authority's existing functions are addressed in sections 12, 14, 15, 17, 18 and in particular, section 21. This section clarifies that the authority's functions, <i>inter alia</i>, include the exercise of powers and the carrying out of duties and is thus to be construed broadly.</P>
    <P>Section 3 arises from a request made by the Health Insurance Authority that it have protection from suit for damages corresponding to the statutory protection given to other public regulatory bodies. Accordingly, the provision gives a broad immunity to the authority itself, to individual members of the authority and to its staff where they are engaged in the discharge of their functions in good faith. It has been drafted having specific regard to a similar provision in the Irish Takeover Panel Act 1997 in respect of the takeover panel. Related provisions also apply in respect of the Commission for Electricity Regulation, while immunity from liability for damages is also provided under section 69 of the Central Bank Act 1997, section 53 of the Stock Exchange Act 1995 and section 53 of the Investment Intermediaries Act 1995.</P>
    <P>Section 4 amends Part II of the Second Schedule to the Defamation Act 1961. As part of its functions, the authority will be required to make reports and recommendations in relation to the question of commencing financial transfers between insurers under a risk equalisation scheme. The effect of the provision is to add the authority to the bodies that have qualified privilege in respect of a copy or fair and accurate report or summary of any recommendation that the authority may produce. Qualified privilege of the same nature is contained in the Irish Takeover Panel Act 1997.</P>
    <P>Section 5 is about refining certain procedures that will apply in the steps to be taken after a risk equalisation scheme has come into effect. The limited changes being made arise from consultations with the Health Insurance Authority. The first subsection deals with the requirement for the authority to include in its report to the Minister a recommendation on whether he ought to commence risk equalisation payments under a scheme. The legislation as it stands makes it clear that recommendations by the authority are for that purpose alone. The amendment is entirely <Col N="67" /> consistent with the current position but clarifies that the authority shall not include a recommendation on the matter in a report where the Minister has already exercised the power to commence risk equalisation transfers under a scheme. The health insurance legislation already contains a provision requiring the authority to submit annual reports with respect to the operation of a scheme, once risk equalisation payments have been commenced. The legislation provides that the Minister shall cause such reports to be laid before each House. The Bill does not change this reporting requirement.</P>
    <P>The second subsection relates to giving advance notice to parties, by either the authority or the Minister, of its proposed recommendation, in the case of the authority, or the proposed exercise of his powers to commence risk equalisation payments, in the case of the Minister. As the legislation stands, notice in such instances must issue to all registered undertakings, which are also given the opportunity to make representations. However, the legislation provides that a scheme may include a provision allowing restricted membership undertakings, such as, the occupational schemes that apply in the case of the Garda and the prison officers, to opt out of risk equalisation. It should not therefore be necessary to give notice to undertakings about proposed developments relating to the commencement of transfers under a scheme where such an option may have been used.</P>
    <P>Section 6 is concerned with the arrangements in place to facilitate and encourage the entry of new insurers into the market to provide greater competition and choice to consumers. The legislation provides for insurance undertakings that have not yet commenced business to avail of a three year exemption from risk equalisation. The purpose of this is to allow new insurers to establish a critical mass of customers and recover start-up costs that could arise before being liable to make payments in respect of risk equalisation.</P>
    <P>The provision in the Bill retains this measure. The main purpose of amending the existing provision is to avoid a possibility that the exemption could be availed of through the creation of a subsidiary or some other form of associated company by an existing undertaking. This approach is considered desirable to remove any possibility of an issue of avoidance arising in the arrangements. As there is no indication that an associated company of an existing undertaking was intent on, interested in or to be created for the purpose of availing of the exemption, the amendment is most appropriately regarded as a precautionary one. It aims to ensure the exemption will only apply in circumstances where the added value for consumers of private health insurance is a genuine increase in the choice of insurers and greater real competition in the market.</P>
    <P>The section retains the three year exemption for new entrants. However, it contains provisions aimed at securing a clearer indication of the com<Col N="68" /> mitment and serious business intent to actually follow through on entry to the market on the part of insurers who decide to serve a notice of exemption in the future. In that regard, it requires insurers to be registered with the Health Insurance Authority before serving a notice of exemption and to commence business not later than three months after the date of the notice. Neither of these is an onerous step and it remains in the hands of the new entrant insurer to decide the timing in relation to becoming registered and subsequently serving a notice of exemption.</P>
    <P>Section 7 relates to financial arrangements made in relation to the Health Insurance Authority at the time of its establishment. The ongoing operational costs of the authority are funded by the proceeds of a levy on the premium income of registered insurers. The levy is currently set at a rate of 0.14% of that annual premium income. However, the legislation allowed for the Minister to advance funds to the authority and during 2001 sums amounting to more than &euro;500,000 were advanced to the authority in respect of initial costs. As the legislation stands, the authority is obliged to repay in full the amount advanced. The authority considers that costs incurred in its establishment should be borne by the State on the grounds that it is a public body and was established to carry out a public service in relation to the common good aspects of health insurance.</P>
    <P>This section maintains the option of the Minister effecting repayment of the &euro;500,000 provided towards establishing the authority. It is clear that the provision is an enabling one and does not mean that part or full repayment will automatically be waived &ndash; this will be looked at strictly on its merits and will be subject to consultation with the authority.</P>
    <P>I commend this short Bill to the House. The proposed early introduction of the risk equalisation scheme to follow enactment of the Bill will meet national requirements for sustaining the operation of the core common good principles of our voluntary private health insurance system, together with taking account of EU Commission concerns about necessity, proportionality and competition.</P>
    <Speaker pid="OliviaMitchell" hpid="Ms O. Mitchell Ms O. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Ms O. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for outlining the sections of the Bill and welcome his presentation on the progress being made on preparation of the draft scheme. I was interested to hear the Minister's interpretation of the difficulties with risk equalisation at EU level.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is a short Bill with only seven brief sections. I watched its progress through the Seanad. While each section is in itself important the real importance and significance of this Bill lies in the fact that it presages the introduction of risk equalisation into health insurance in this country. This matter was discussed long and hard before I entered this House in 1994 and subsequently in 2001. It is, I am sure the Minister will agree, an unresolved and contentious issue among those <Col N="69" /> who know what it means. It may not be an issue discussed by the man on the street but it is extremely important to those who depend on private health care. It is in its impact on private health care that this Bill is hugely significant.</P>
    <P>While listening to the news today I was thinking that this is a rather esoteric topic to discuss on a day when the health service is growing ever close to implosion. One of our major acute hospitals is closing ward after ward and is unable to provide cover for staff on sick leave. Health services are in crisis. Nevertheless, this Bill highlights how important it is that we get it right when we make decisions. Some 49% of the population depend on private health care insurance and on the success, stability, prudence, efficiency and vibrancy of the health insurance sector to ensure they have access to health care when they need it.</P>
    <P>The State will, in theory, provide hospital care to the entire population but the reality is that it is ill-equipped to do so. The <i>de facto</i> situation is that the State provides, increasingly poorly and with increasing difficulty, health care to approximately one third of the population. The vast majority of the population depends on private health care and insure themselves, for the most part, to meet the cost of hospital provided services. Any act of ours which impinges on their ability to do so by making changes in the circumstances in which their insurer's operate is of enormous and lasting significance to the majority of the population.</P>
    <P>When the Minister's Department wrote to the Whip's office seeking urgent enactment of this Bill it did so on the grounds that the Attorney General recommended that the period between publication and enactment should be as short as possible. I have no problem with expediting this legislation. However, I question the further contention that there was significant ongoing political, industry and consumer demand for the early introduction of the scheme as a necessary part of the arrangements to support community rated private health insurance. I have not been deafened by any clamour for its introduction. I am aware the VHI is anxious to have it implemented. Apart from a few desultory inquiries from political parties in the House, which I would not describe as significant ongoing demand, I am not conscious of any clamour from the public for it.</P>
    <P>I have no desire to be difficult or contrary on the passage of this Bill into law. I wish to place on record my serious and deeply felt reservations about the whole concept of risk equalisation. Even without detailed knowledge of the specific Irish circumstances into which it is proposed to introduce risk equalisation one intuitively feels it is utterly bizarre and illogical to try to argue that small new entrants into any market should be obliged to pay the existing monopoly supplier for the privilege of having the temerity to seek to compete with it.</P>
    <P>I realise that in the case of medical insurance it is not that simple. On the face of it, it seems <Col N="70" /> like an extraordinary and draconian response to the safeguarding of the principle of community rating. I fully support the concept of community rating but I dispute the necessity to bolster it by introducing risk equalisation as an institutionalised ongoing prop for future inefficiency rather than as a compensation for historically different risk profiles. It is ironic that risk equalisation should flow from a desire to promote competition in the health insurance sector. We deregulated the market to encourage new entrants and to achieve competition in health insurance. At the first indication of a new entrant we immediately introduce legislation to ensure it or future entrants cannot compete.</P>
    <P>In a situation such as exists in Ireland whereby there is one dominant market supplier, a monopolist, and where following deregulation a new entrant to the market has a much lower risk profile than the incumbent, one can and should argue the case for compensation by new entrants for the worse than average risk profiles of the incumbent so as to ensure a level playing pitch at the initial stages. It is almost impossible if risk equalisation continues for it not to become a compensation for inefficiency. The initial objective may be to achieve a level playing pitch but if it is ultimately to sustain that level playing pitch, it is also self-defeating because it effectively eliminates the purpose of introducing competition in the first instance. It is simply impossible, over time, to distinguish between the deviation in risk profiles due to historic circumstances and the deviation in risk profiles which may emerge simply as a result of the failure to compete effectively and consequently to attract new, young, healthy customers. Either way, we wipe out all the benefits of competition to the consumer.</P>
    <P>Ireland has had extremely high market penetration in health insurance. Therefore, the only competition of substance in the future will be in the new, young and healthy market. An efficient and successful firm succeeds to the extent that it attracts more of this segment of the market than others &ndash; in fact, that becomes the definition of success. However, under risk equalisation, whatever firm succeeds in attracting this young age group, it is immediately penalised. What then, in those circumstances, is the incentive to entice new customers and to provide them with better, cheaper, newer and more advanced products? What is the incentive for them to negotiate any advantages with the hospitals or the health care providers, including the Minister? What would be the point of any company competing if the more successful they are, the more they are penalised and the less successful and more inefficient they are, the more they get paid by their competitors? It is a bizarre market. To think that all of this comes about as a result of the desire to introduce competition in the health insurance market. It is difficult to see how any of this serves the interests of the consumer which, presumably, was the purpose of the whole exercise.</P>
    <P>Because of the importance of the survival of <Col N="71" /> insured private health care to the majority of the population and because of the enormous impact risk equalisation will have on the market, it is important it is handled with extreme sensitivity and the greatest care. The 2001 Act, governing the introduction of risk equalisation, went to great lengths in at least paying lip-service to the necessity to ensure that competition survived under the new dispensation. The legislation laid down safeguards to protect the public interest if ever risk equalisation was introduced. It went to great lengths to do so in recognition of the threat that risk equalisation posed to the functioning of a normal competitive market.</P>
    <P>For that reason, the Minister should be more circumspect in expressing support for and a determination to bring in risk equalisation given that, at least in theory, the legislation requires a recommendation from an independent agency before the Minister can do so. If the Minister gives the impression that he has already made that decision, then it makes something of a farce of enshrining the need for that recommendation in legislation.</P>
    <P>A related problem I have with this legislation is contained in section 5 which removes the ability of the authority to make a recommendation to the Minister once the Minister has exercised the power to introduce risk equalisation. This may be an innocuous measure but it may be about precluding the authority from making any future recommendations, that is, a recommendation to abolish the process altogether or to change it in a fundamental way. I may be wrong in assuming this is an attempt to limit the power of the authority and I would like the Minister to clarify this. I do not want to see the power of authority effectively emasculated. It is supposed to be the protector of the public and of the continuation of competition and, as the Minister said, to strike the balance between the stability of community rating and facilitating competition.</P>
    <P>The authority has two roles, the first being the commencement of equalisation. If it does not have power to make recommendations to the Minister, its only other role is in operational matters which does not provide any protection to the consumer.</P>
    <P>I am not alone in having concerns. As the Minister will be aware, the EU Commission is currently investigating the scheme as proposed. It is not beyond the bounds of possibility that it will prevent its introduction. I am not saying this is, by any means, a foregone conclusion but the possibility exists. Similarly, the Competition Authority has expressed its reservations. Only very reluctantly and in recognition of the need, at least at the initial stages, to underpin the concept of community rating did it accept the undoubted interference in the market which risk equalisation represents. The Competition Authority has stated in quite unequivocal terms that risk equalisation is a barrier to entry into the Irish health insurance market and that competition, as we all know, is <Col N="72" /> the best protector of the consumers' interest. Competition will ensure that higher service levels are provided at lower prices to the consumer. We are, effectively, interfering with the possibility of that happening.</P>
    <P>Against a background of concerns about its introduction, I am sure the Minister will appreciate my concerns about the introduction of section 5 which is rowing back on the powers given to the Health Insurance Authority, powers which may have worked to settle anxieties which exist in the wider marketplace about risk equalisation. There are also justifiable concerns that there is a less than healthy relationship between the Minister, the existing dominant market player and the Health Insurance Authority. Each agency may believe it is acting in the public interest but the reality is that the authority and the VHI are both creatures of the Minister and cannot but act in concert with him.</P>
    <P>I accept that the VHI faces a difficult situation in terms of the much older age profile and, therefore, I accept the need for some form of risk equalisation. However, my concerns are, in the first instance, that risk equalisation is an extremely blunt instrument to introduce in order to deal with what is a specific time related problem. The assumptions underlying risk equalisation will change. Markets will change and age profiles will certainly change &ndash; there is nothing more certain than that &ndash; yet we are introducing in legislation a permanent structure which institutionalises support for inefficiency. This is not in any way to accuse the VHI of inefficiency in that it applies to whatever firm is the recipient of risk equalisation. Should it or any other insurance agency become inefficient &ndash; this will be reflected in its inability to attract new, young and healthy customers &ndash; then it can be assured of the support of risk equalisation. That cannot ultimately be in the consumers' interest. It is this permanent structure of support for inefficiency which is the most worrying aspect of the proposal.</P>
    <P>Will the Minister consider, either as part of this Bill or in the regulations he intends to bring forward to govern the scheme, the possibility of giving the Committee on Health and Children the power and the funding to appoint its own actuaries who, from time to time, would be empowered to assess and determine the need for ongoing risk equalisation? In any event, will the Minister clarify the intent of the new section 5 before Committee Stage and, more specifically, that it is not an attempt to limit the ability of the Health Insurance Authority to make any recommendations beyond the initial ones to introduce the equalisation scheme? I would like an assurance that it will not be emasculated once it has performed its function in a hands off way, that is, giving the impression that this is not a political decision but an independent one made by an independent body which will have no power to protect the public thereafter.</P>
    <P>My main concern in preserving and promoting competition is to ensure that private health care <Col N="73" /> is available to the 50% of the population which depends on it. I am sure the Minister shares that concern. Despite deregulation in the health insurance market, which was introduced for that very purpose, we do not have competition in any real sense. It is true there has been another entrant into the market but the reality is that it does not have to compete. It can track the existing dominant provider. Until there are more health insurance companies, we cannot say there is competition. If there are no further entrants into the market, which risk equalisation may well prevent, will the Minister consider &ndash; in the context of the privatisation of the VHI which I believe he is considering &ndash; breaking up the VHI to ensure that at least we have some competition in the provision of health insurance? I realise this was down the road but we must be conscious of it on an ongoing basis. The Minister is aware of how close to implosion the health services are at present. It is important that people are allowed to provide for their own health care and that we encourage competition, not just in the procurement but in the provision of services.</P>
    <P>The Minister should consult me on section 5 or I will bring in amendments to that section on Committee Stage.</P>

      <P>The reason for this Bill is a curious one. In 2001, the Health Insurance (Amendment) Bill was passed to provide for risk equalisation and the establishment of the Health Insurance Authority. This Act is now being revisited because of a failure by the Minister for Health and Children to provide good law that could stand up to scrutiny. The most important flaw, according to the Minister's statement to the Chief Whip, has been the subject of a recommendation from the Attorney General to bring this amendment Bill through the House quickly to pre-empt any possible legal challenge. If the Minister and his Department were doing their job properly, there would be no need for this Bill.</P>
      <P>There is something perverse about debating this Bill in the House while the crisis in our major Dublin teaching hospitals, which is deepening daily, cannot be debated with the Minister. Even when it is raised at an appropriate time, the response of the Government to this crisis is abysmal. Last Thursday, I asked the Minister to outline the likely overruns in budgets in hospitals like Beaumont, the Mater and St. James's if cutbacks were not made. He replied that he could not provide this information and implied that it was ridiculous to expect him to do so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The case for the debate on health insurance has been made on the grounds that amendments to the Act are urgently needed. I do not argue with that but the urgency of the need is open to question. I wonder at the priorities of the Minister when he has shown himself so unwilling to confront the serious problems in the acute hospital sector. Last week, for example, we discovered that not only has the management of Beaumont Hospital a clear view of the overruns it faces but <Col N="74" /> it is actively considering cuts in patient services of the most acute kind. Today, we learn that the Mater Hospital has closed 22 beds and is now closing a further 50 beds. To have fewer operations and fewer staff is the only way this hospital can cope with the fact that its budget in real terms has been cut by 10%.</P>
    <P>Regrettably, these hospitals are not alone in their predicament. One hospital consultant has estimated that if this situation is replicated elsewhere, 80,000 patients this year will be denied the care they need. It is surprising we have not heard from the Minister on how he is dealing with this crisis. We have heard his views on risk equalisation and the Defamation Act but surely it would be comforting to know that the risks patients face today as a result of cutbacks decided upon by the Government are also being tackled. Time has been provided to debate this Bill on the grounds that the need to amend the Health Insurance (Amendment) Act is urgent, yet time is not being provided to debate a crisis in our hospital service which directly affects patient care.</P>
    <P>This is a short and largely uncontentious Bill but I would like to make a few points on it. It is surprising that an Act passed in 2001 is already being made the subject of further amendment. It is not long ago that the Committee on Health and Children debated the issue of risk equalisation and its importance in providing a balanced framework for competition in the health insurance market. I disagree with Deputy Olivia Mitchell's views on risk equalisation and recognise fully the need for it. The principles of community rating, open enrolment and lifetime cover require a mechanism that will protect subscribers from predatory companies that will cherry-pick the healthier, younger subscriber out of the ever-increasing pool of subscribers to the detriment of older, more vulnerable people who have health insurance cover. Risk equalisation spreads the load equitably and I am not convinced by the argument put by BUPA that it will have a deleterious effect on its business activity.</P>
    <P>Health insurance activity is clearly flourishing. The growing proportion of the population taking out voluntary health insurance is noteworthy. Now approaching a figure of 50% of the population, the number of people with health insurance bears no relation to the original proportion of people included when the scheme was introduced. Though entitlement to hospital care has been extended during the intervening period to include all patients, anyone who can afford to take out health insurance is choosing to do so and the reasons for that are well known. Primarily, people buy access to hospital services &ndash; this has been confirmed by research time and again &ndash; and, generally, they get what they pay for. The hospital service responds to demand from private patients because the money follows the patient and the system is thereby incentivised to deliver.</P>
    <P>The experience of the public patient is diametrically opposed to the experience of the insured patient, unless they are emergency cases <Col N="75" /> in accident and emergency units. Waiting lists, waiting times, waiting to get to see the specialist, waiting to get a hospital bed &ndash; that is the common experience of the public patient. Public hospitals have to respond to fixed budgets set down by the Minister for Health and Children through the ERHA and other health boards. Patient needs become secondary to budgetary needs. Empty beds, closed wards and under-used operating theatres are the result, because treating patients costs money.</P>
    <P>There is the most graphic example of this in today's news that the Mater Hospital is shutting down wards and laying off staff. If, instead, the hospital continues to respond to the need to treat its public patients, it will be set on a collision course with the Minister and the ERHA. The tight budgetary strategy is getting in the way of doctors and hospitals providing care for patients who are often in desperate need of treatment.</P>
    <P>Creating an integrated stream of patients to whom care is provided on the basis of need and which rewards efficient activity is the kind of structural reform that the Minister should have embarked on. Health insurance could play a part in devising such a system. Sadly, the structural reform has not been developed during the lifetime of the last Government and I fear the focus of the new Government has shifted significantly rightwards to a Progressive Democrats agenda which is all about cost cutting and not primarily about patient care. It is no accident that one of the most important reports which will come out on the health service is being carried out under the aegis of the Department of Finance under the direction of a professor of accountancy and, according to media reports, without one health care professional on the committee charged with creating efficiency in the health service.</P>
    <P>Talking about reports, yet again I am forced to raise the issue of the plethora of reports that have been commissioned by the Minister. I tabled a parliamentary question seeking information on the number of reports and their cost approximately five weeks ago, but got no answer apart from an acknowledgement. I tabled an identical question last week and am still waiting for a reply. This failure to provide information makes a joke of a system that is supposed to be accountable, efficient and operated within a timeframe. If the information is not forthcoming from the Department, it is impossible for any Deputy to function in a way that meets the public need for accountability. I ask the Minister to deal with this matter.</P>
    <P>The Bill brings about some changes which should really have appeared in the original Act of 2001. One change is inexplicable in these straitened times &ndash; in section 7, there is a proposed waiver of repayment of advances made to the authority by the State, which accounts for &euro;500,000. I understand that there is discretion on the part of the State in this regard but it is inexplicable, at a time when such difficulty is being experienced in the hospital service, that whatever <Col N="76" /> good could have been done with &euro;500,000 is not being done because the Minister proposes to support the authority in this way. In effect, he is supporting insurers because the authority is paid for by way of subscriptions from insurers, which should also cover the start-up costs.</P>
    <P>It is noteworthy that the Mater Hospital budget for 2003 is approximately &euro;155 million and has not increased at all since 2002. The Minister is always very quick to announce how much additional money is going into the health service, but it is quite remarkable how little money is given to one of our major hospitals to run its services. Even in that context, &euro;500,000 could have been spent is some way that would have made at least a small difference.</P>
    <P>The reason this Bill is being brought forward at this time and in this way is outlined in the letter from the Department to the Chief Whip, which spells out the need to process the legislation quickly &ndash; given the risk of a legal challenge under section 5(<i>b</i>), &ldquo;the period between publication and enactment should be as short as possible.&rdquo;  It is extraordinary that we have to deal with this on the basis of advice from the Attorney General. The Department should have prevented this from arising.</P>
    <P>There has certainly been a demand for risk equalisation. I, and others who understand the importance of ensuring risk equalisation, have sought it from the Minister. There is a genuine demand to ensure that it operates well to protect the subscriber. I do not see why we should be protecting the &euro;500,000 that the Department seems so keen to give away.</P>
    <P>I look forward to the draft scheme and to having an opportunity to comment on it. I hope the European Commission and the Director General for Competition give a positive response to the Minister for Health and Children. One can argue about State subvention of private health insurance, and there clearly is State subvention, given all the tax breaks and other supports for people with private health insurance. The objection being tabled by BUPA to this particular proposal, however, cannot possibly stand up. We are not talking about insuring in some minor way somebody out on the open market. We are talking about health insurance and about essential services that people need to protect themselves. I hope that health insurance would be understood to fit into a different category to other discretionary forms of insurance. Looking at the various insurance models across Europe, there is a very strong argument for a universal insurance system that would protect patients and, at the same time, achieve efficiencies. I will leave that matter for another day.</P>
    <P>This Bill represents a tidying up of bits and pieces that should not have been dealt with so messily in the first place. Section 3, for example, provides immunity to the authority from suits for damages. This is a standard provision in other sectors, and I am mystified as to why it was not included in the original Act. There is also the pro<Col N="77" /> vision relating to the Defamation Act 1961. This is not new legislative ground. These are standard protections that have been included in other legislation. The legislation referred to in the Minister's statement goes back to 1997 or even earlier. It is very hard to fathom why these provisions were not included in the Health Insurance (Amendment) Act 2001. I ask the Minister to indicate, in his response, whether the Department of Health and Children has its own parliamentary counsel. I recall that the last time I asked, it did not. Has such a change been made in the Department? It might bring about some improvement to the drafting of legislation. I recall that the Department of the Environment and Local Government had such in-house experts, and such a move might create a pool of expertise within the Department of Health and Children that would be beneficial. Section 6 contains a good, common sense proposal providing greater protection. Again, however, it is difficult to see why the provision was not included in the original Act.</P>
    <P>I look forward to the draft regulations. I also look forward to hearing what the Minister for Health and Children has to say about any moves to privatise the VHI. He would face stiff opposition to such a move from the Labour Party. So far, it has been extremely difficult, impossible even, to find out what the Minister's views are on this proposal. It is clear that the right wing agenda of the Progressive Democrats exerts a powerful, potent influence in this Government and has certainly damaged the Minister for Health and Children in his efforts to improve the health service. I acknowledge that. I am fearful of a push to privatise the VHI in a way that would not serve the public interest. It would not improve the present situation, flawed and dysfunctional as it is, with so many people taking out private health insurance. I ask the Minister to ensure that we have a debate at some stage, perhaps at the Committee on Health and Children, on the central issue of the future of health insurance.</P>

      <P>This brief Bill is to be welcomed because it contains some very important amendments which contribute handsomely to the aspirations of social inclusion, accountability and a worthwhile return on health care investment by the State. I welcome this Bill principally because it enshrines the principle of risk equalisation, or the transfer of an equalisation premium or levy from companies with niche markets to other companies which refrain from such practices.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Since the entry of BUPA into the Irish market some years ago, its over-concentration on the under-35 age group has been compensated for by its payment of an equalisation levy to the VHI. The element of competition introduced by new <Col N="78" /> entrants to the market will be instrumental in keeping private insurance costs down and will hopefully deter people from abandoning private health insurance and overtaxing the public health care system.</P>
    <P>Risk equalisation is designed to protect rating across the insured population. It means that private health companies cannot cherry pick the best risks and cream off the profits associated with doing so, while ignoring the elderly and the sick, who are more likely to claim. If risk equalisation is not implemented, the entire system of community rating, where everyone pays the same premium for health insurance, irrespective of age, will collapse. Risk equalisation is essential to ensure that premiums for people over 50 are maintained at a realistic level. Competition between health insurers is good because a monopoly situation can make a single operator become complacent. It is vital that equipment and services in hospitals be upgraded to reduce delays and replace antiquated equipment with modern, state-of-the-art medical equipment.</P>
    <P>The take up of the national treatment purchase fund has been somewhat sluggish, with people voting with their feet and waiting even longer for treatment at home. This scheme certainly does not represent the way forward. People dependent on the public health system invariably have higher mortality rates than those who are privately insured. Cancer survival is often related to the stage of disease at the time of detection. While cancer patients who are uninsured have lower survival rates than the insured because of late detection, higher mortality is also caused by lower access to the fullest treatments even when the cancer is detected early.</P>
    <P>Uninsured cancer patients die sooner than people with insurance, largely because of delayed diagnosis. The uninsured are less likely to receive timely screening services such as mammograms, smear tests and colon exams. By the time cancer is diagnosed in uninsured patients, it is more likely to be at an advanced, often fatal, stage.</P>
    <P>Spiralling health insurance costs in a sluggish economy are causing more people to join the ranks of the uninsured. An uninsured person in the United States who is seriously injured in a car accident could be in debt for the rest of his or her life. In Ireland, such a person would be treated in an overcrowded accident and emergency ward, with beds and trolleys scattered between cubicles. The Irish person might have a remote possibility of occupying a bed several days later. Such a patient living in County Monaghan would have to be transferred to Cavan, Dundalk, Navan, Drogheda or Dublin, where hospitals are bursting at the seams. Staff morale in such hospitals is at an all-time low and it is a miracle that any emergency treatment can be provided in such circumstances.</P>
    <P>The Government should reverse its recent trend of reducing tax credits for private health insurance if it is to encourage uninsured persons to purchase health insurance. The provision of increased tax credits to uninsured people would <Col N="79" /> help such people, who comprise 48% of the population, to purchase health insurance. I welcome the creation of a health insurance authority as a regulatory body for the private health insurance market. A level playing field in the health insurance market is required. New insurers entering the market in the future will be subject to the requirements of risk equalisation, but only after an exemption period. I support the Bill and wish it well in its passage through the House.</P>

      <P>We live in an unfair world. It is obvious that health apartheid exists in this country, as almost half the people invest in private health insurance. They have no faith in the public health system as a result of the Government's inability to deal with those in need in a humane way. People are not confident that they will be treated properly or quickly if they do not have private health insurance. As a general practitioner, I agree with them. People have been driven into private health care programmes, meaning that they have to pay for medical services to which they are entitled. Those who cannot afford to pay for such services have to try to do so, even if this means they have to beg, borrow or steal.</P>
      <P>Someone needing a routine mammogram will have to wait for a year under the public health system, even though it can be done within a week in a private hospital if one has adequate insurance. These problems are getting worse all the time. As the standard of the health service declines, more people feel the need to invest in private health insurance. One has to wait for four years for a first rheumatology appointment in the west of Ireland, during which time one's joints seize up. People with rheumatoid arthritis need to be seen within a few weeks, but this will not happen if one does not have money.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is not right that some Irish people should receive better treatment than others. Rather than invest in the public health service, however, the Government plans to build more private hospitals. Millions of euro are being poured into private health care at home and abroad by the Government, which is a wonderful benefactor to private medicine. Public hospitals do not have enough beds, consultants and essential equipment. The care received by those who benefit from this staggering apartheid contrasts with that received by those who do not. The fact that the Government is pouring millions into the private health system, thereby starving the public health system of the funds it needs to meet its basic running costs, represents a vote of no confidence in the latter system. The Government is closing beds in the Mater Misericordiae Hospital because it is unwilling to provide the money that is needed. The funds allocated at the start of the year will not be increased. Health boards are being made to do things that they do not want to do and people suffer as a result. The Government seems <Col N="80" /> to have a limitless fund for private health care, however.</P>
    <P>Although Mayo General Hospital is recognised by the Department of Health and Children as the most efficient hospital in Europe, it has been starved of funds. There is no plan to replace equipment in the hospital, and other hospitals, that no longer works. There are no waiting lists in the departments of Mayo General Hospital that have fine staff, including consultants, but there are problems in units such as urology, rheumatology and orthopaedics, where there are no consultants. Over 1,000 men in the west have to leave their beds many times each night as a result of the fact that they have been waiting for over five years for an operation that takes 20 minutes. The procedure could be performed within a couple of weeks if those involved had money. These problems are getting worse.</P>
    <P>The Government should invest more money in the public health system, for example by employing more consultants. Increased investment would mean that people from Belmullet would not have to travel to Galway, which is virtually the same distance as from Dublin to Galway. It would not be considered good enough for a person in Dublin to have to go to Galway so it should not be good enough for those in Mayo. Many children's ears have become damaged as a result of waiting for years for an operation. There are 33 empty beds and an idle theatre in Mayo General Hospital. Although the Government is paying for people to attend private hospitals in Ireland and abroad &ndash; there have been advertisements in the newspapers about it &ndash; it will not employ consultants to treat people in their own county. It intends to close general hospitals in Monaghan and Roscommon and it will not support Mayo General Hospital, but it seems to have a great deal of money for new private hospitals.</P>
    <P>There is an old saying that if one gives a man a fish, one will feed him for a day, but if one teaches him to fish, one will feed him for life. A similar strategy should be adopted in terms of Government resources, to allow us to look after our own people at home, not abroad. Interim solutions are not the answer. Why does the Government not support the existing public health system by employing enough consultants and providing enough beds? Hospitals like those in Monaghan and Roscommon should be retained because people matter. Mayo General Hospital should be upgraded to regional status because it is already providing a regional service and because County Mayo is the third largest county in Ireland. I challenge the Government and the Western Health Board to appoint the consultants that are needed and to stop closing hospitals. The increased level of bureaucracy is also not needed as the funds should be used to employ more doctors and nurses. We should have faith in the public health system and we should not allow millionaires to become multi-millionaires. We should remember those who do not receive enough money to run the service.</P>

      <P>The health care services provided by a society reflect its values. In the United States, the provision of health care is not seen as society's obligation but as a voluntary consumer purchase in an environment in which social solidarity plays second fiddle to economic forces. One in five Americans is under-insured or does not have health insurance. Access to health care is curtailed without health insurance. Health care systems in most EU member states, by contrast, have been based on the concept of social solidarity. Ireland's two-tier health care system reveals values that are closer to those of Boston than Berlin. Good quality health care does not come cheap. There is a growing realisation in the United Kingdom that if health care spending is to rise, people must be convinced to pay for it. If the Government wants to deliver equitable, high quality health care, it will have to convince the electorate to pay.</P>
      <P>The economic fundamentalism of the Fianna Fáil-Progressive Democrats Government leaves very few options open in relation to adequately funding the health care services. The Government's self-serving rhetoric about the need for greater efficiency and accountability in the health care system is a clear attempt to distract from the fact that it is not prepared to invest in the kind of health care services found in other EU member states. Given the free market ethos which informs most of the Government's policies, it is likely that our health care system will move in the direction of the US system, where expensive private health insurance is essential if one is to avail of basic health care and the less well-off become the casualties of the system.</P>
      <P>When I recently read that the Republican Party in the United States is vehemently opposed to the community rating system proposed by Bill Clinton, I immediately thought that the system must be a good thing. The usual arguments were put forward in opposition to community rating. If we are to have an equitable system, community rating and its adjunct, risk equalisation, are vital. We need to examine in greater detail the type of risk equalisation being proposed.</P>
      <P>Like many other Deputies, I have had meetings with BUPA and the VHI, both of which are superb lobbyists. I am sure the Minister has had his fair share of lobbying as well. I leave these meetings a little dissatisfied because neither insurance company is an angel. Both are plying their trade and putting forward their own pitches. When I spoke to Mr. Sheridan from the VHI, for instance, I asked him what is the problem. The problem, of course, is the average age. I asked if it were theoretically possible to transfer patients of a higher age rather than having a fund and putting the money into that fund, where BUPA effectively pays the VHI. I proposed this, perhaps as devil's advocate, but it was completely out of the question. This makes me think that the VHI is seeking to gain on the back of BUPA. It is a very difficult area. However, I welcome community rating very much.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="82" />This Bill is short and non-controversial and the Minister knows that it passed through the Seanad in record time. It will probably do the same in the Dáil this evening. It is a necessary precursor to the introduction of regulations by the Minister concerning a risk equalisation scheme for private health insurance companies. The Minister, Deputy Martin, stated in the Seanad on 26 February 2003 that the need for the further provisions set out in the Bill arose from consultations held with the Health Insurance Authority, set up in February 2001. It was given the responsibility of managing and administering risk-equalisation schemes.</P>
    <P>VHI has specific views on this Bill, which it regards as having a tidying up function. It feels that certain procedures and issues need to be examined. However, as far as it is concerned, the really important step in implementing a risk-equalisation system for insurance companies will be the introduction of regulations by the Minister. It argues that even following the introduction of these regulations, it will take up to 18 months to implement them.</P>
    <P>We are dealing with an extremely complex area and I am trying to find other countries where similar circumstances obtain. Australia has been mentioned, but one is not comparing like with like. It has up to 44 companies in operation, whereas we have only two. I would like the Committee on Health and Children to examine this further because we now know about the difficulties that have arisen in respect of competition. Will the Minister tell us what Brussels is saying on the issue if he is in a position to do so?</P>
    <P>Will the introduction of a community rating system give an unfair advantage to the VHI? Will the Minister elaborate on what kind of advantages would be involved? How satisfactory is the implementation of a community rating system at present? Is the Minister aware that the VHI and BUPA are laying down rules that undermine the concept of community rating? For example, many new or rejoining customers who are 60 years of age or over have to wait several years before they can avail of any benefits from the health insurance plan. This is discriminatory and I would like the Minister's views on the matter. It has been communicated to me by doctors in my own constituency, who are dissatisfied with the arrangement. Patient Focus is not happy with it either. Furthermore, people with pre-existing conditions such as diabetes or heart conditions have similar waiting periods to endure. The rules in this respect are discriminatory. What can consumers do? Given the lack of a regulator in the area, the companies are answerable only to the Minister, who has not challenged them about discriminatory practices.</P>
    <P>Is the Minister concerned about the track record of the private health insurance companies? Does he believe, as I do, that it leaves a lot to be desired? Patient Focus has told me that the insurance companies are not answerable and that there should be a regulator or a health ombuds<Col N="83" /> man to whom consumers can appeal if they feel they are being discriminated against in terms of their insurance premiums or policies. Perhaps the Minister will outline his views on this in his reply.</P>
    <P>Some contributions from the Labour Party and Fine Gael seem to have favoured either VHI or BUPA, but I am not in favour of either one. Both have major faults. Patient Focus believes that they are not very committed to the idea of consumer participation. The VHI has a consumer group comprised mainly of representatives of companies with large numbers of employees but its members threatened to resign several years ago because its recommendations were being ignored. When BUPA first joined the Irish market, the Irish Patients' Association, now known as Patient Focus, approached it regarding the issue of consumer participation. It showed little interest in the idea and the discussion went nowhere. This must be addressed.</P>
    <P>We have noted the crisis in the Mater Hospital, which is due to a lack of investment. It is true that there are matters of efficiency to be addressed, about which the Minister has spoken. I am sure he is blue in the face listening to the Minister for Finance talking to him about efficiency and management. However, we will continue to have a black hole in terms of health investment if we do not address the fundamental problem of health. Why are we getting ill more often? We are living longer, but we are enduring more stress. Generally speaking, the amount of tablets we are consuming indicates that we are becoming sicker and sicker. The answer lies in our consumer lifestyle. Good health is essentially about the air we breathe, the food we eat and the water we drink. All of these have become steadily more polluted over the years and they are steadily inducing illness in the population.</P>
    <P>What about the purity of our water? Can one talk about pure water when we are actually putting fluoride into it? Why do we have the highest cancer rates in Europe? The Minister knows that it costs a considerable amount of money to treat cancer patients.</P>

      <P>I welcome the Health Insurance (Amendment) Bill 2003 in so far as the measures relating to risk equalisation protect those taking out health insurance from being penalised on the basis of their health status. I am glad the Minister and his Department did not cave in to the pressure from BUPA, which was opposed to the introduction of risk equalisation. Without risk equalisation, there would be an incentive for insurers to target younger, healthier and cheaper risks while discouraging older, less healthy individuals. Risk equalisation, with community rating, ensures that for those who can afford it, private health insurance is not restricted to low risk individuals or applicants.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The retention of the three-year exemption from risk equalisation for new entrants to the health insurance market causes me some concern, <Col N="84" /> but I welcome section 5(<i>c</i>) which prevents an associate company of a registered undertaking from availing of it. Section 7 of the Bill relates to the financial arrangements to establish the Health Insurance Authority. Apart from the fact that it is to be a public body, I have yet to hear a clear explanation of why the costs should be borne by the State rather than by the health insurance companies for which the authority is to be responsible. I would appreciate clarification of the point by the Minister as it is my belief that the respective players have a responsibility in this regard.</P>
    <P>While I support this Bill, the House should be clear that Sinn Féin does not support the private health insurance model as a means of financing the health service. I take this opportunity to make a number of points regarding the health service and the drift towards private health care and the American model. Sinn Féin advocates the radical overhaul of health care and health insurance and is committed to the creation of a national health service with free provision for all. We oppose the Government's pursuit of policies which advocate private health care as these will eventually lead to the privatisation of the health service. As a party committed to the creation of a national health service, Sinn Féin opposes the range of State incentives and supports which have made private health insurance an attractive option for those who can afford it.</P>
    <P>As far back as 1982, the commission on taxation recommended the abolition of available reliefs and in 1989 the commission on health funding recommended the abolition of tax relief on a phased basis to monitor the effect of such a measure on the demand for private health insurance. The commission questioned the availability of tax relief on the grounds of equity and effectiveness. The National Economic and Social Forum report on equity of access to hospital care, which I have quoted from in this House before and shall again, states that the Irish State subsidises parallel private care to an unusual degree. The report describes how delivery of publicly and privately funded care is interconnected to a considerably greater degree than in other health care systems. There is no tax relief for private voluntary health insurance in Denmark, Belgium, Finland, France, Sweden or Britain. Sinn Féin calls for the removal of tax incentives for private medical care and for the ring-fencing of savings from this initiative for use in the health sector.</P>
    <P>Health care in this State is provided according to a two-tier system in which the private sector is subsidised by the taxpayer. In 2001, the estimated net cost to the State of an in-patient bed in a major teaching hospital designated for the private sector was &euro;319 per day. The estimated cost at other acute hospitals was &euro;219 per day. The private sector is allocated 20% of the beds in public hospitals, but contributes only 11% of money required to run these establishments. Therein lies a major deficit. The two-tier system gives consultants an incentive to occupy as many beds as poss<Col N="85" /> ible with private patients, forcing taxpayers to spend &euro;165 million annually to subsidise their hospitalisation. Consultants piggy-back on the system taxpayers provide. It is immoral apart from anything else. Consultants are paid from the public purse to treat public patients while they profit from the thriving private health industry. They are permitted to work unlimited private hours in public hospitals using medical resources and public offices funded by the taxpayer for personal, private business profit. When the argument is made that public funding of the health care system is unsustainable, it should be considered in the context of the burden the private system places on public resources.</P>
    <P>The VHI was formed in 1957 to provide insurance against hospitalisation costs for the 15% of the population who were not eligible for public hospital services. It was not intended to replace the State as a health care provider, yet by 1999 42% of the population was covered by private health insurance. There has been a shift in the VHI's role as a complement to the public health system to the point where it has become an alternative. This shift has clearly failed to improve access to health care and there is little evidence to suggest that increased competition in the private health insurance market will change that. I contend it will not and recommend a national health service model to the Minister.</P>

      <P>I welcome this opportunity to speak to the Health Bill. The Health Insurance Acts of 1994 and 2001 set out the provisions for the regulation of the voluntary private health insurance market in Ireland. More than 40 years ago, the State established the VHI which was the only insurance body serving the private health insurance market until the entry of BUPA some years ago. This development was welcome as competition is of benefit to consumers. The VHI continues to provide a fine service and many patients have reason to be thankful for its assistance, but competition is essential to keep providers on their toes.</P>
      <P>The insurance sector has seen sizeable rises in costs over the past few years. All Members will be aware of the enormous increases in car and liability insurance premia which have put the viability of certain industries at risk. Insurance companies are in the business of making money and if a section of their market is perceived as high risk, they increase premia, rightly or wrongly. Motor insurers have wrongly decided that young people pose a greater risk of claims and increased to exorbitant levels the premia they charge young drivers. Many young drivers cannot afford the high costs involved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We all recognise that the motor car is now an <Col N="86" /> essential component of life for many people and especially for those in rural Ireland. Many parts of rural Ireland do not have a public transport service and so the use of a car is essential for travelling to work and for socialising. The insurance companies in this case have got it wrong because they are charging such high premia to all young people. It is true that a small proportion of young people cause an excessive amount of claims but the vast majority of young drivers are excellent and careful drivers. It is wrong to tar all of them with the same brush and force many young people off the roads, through no fault of their own. I suggest that we examine this at a later stage.</P>
    <P>The health insurance market is run by a completely different principle. Recognising the importance of health insurance, the State introduced the principle of community rating when the VHI was created. This is totally different from all other types of insurance which are based on the level of premia paid by the subscriber equating with the potential risk involved. As human beings grow older, it is a fact of life that the dangers or risks associated with their health increase. If health insurance was based on the same principles that apply to other types of insurance, then as we grow older the premia paid would increase and after a certain age it would be impossible to acquire health insurance. When the VHI was established, the principle of community rating was used. I wish to pay tribute to the late Chief Justice, Mr. Tom O'Higgins, who was the Minister for Health when the VHI was established. He died recently after a distinguished life of public service both in the Oireachtas and in the Judiciary.</P>
    <P>Community rating means that all adults pay the same rate, irrespective of age. Young people, by and large, enjoy good health and so the risk of claims in this age group is low. Careful management by the insurance bodies, be it the VHI, BUPA or whoever, should ensure that the risk of claims is spread over all members of the various insurance companies. In this way medical insurance costs can be kept as low as possible. However, over the past number of years there have been substantial increases in medical insurance premia. This is a reflection of the high rise in medical inflation which has occurred as newer investigative methods, treatments and drugs become available.</P>
    <P>Medical insurance costs have another built-in cost which is the fixed cost of administration. I notice from the published accounts of the VHI that its administrative costs account for about 9% of its overall budget. This compares very favourably with the cost base of other insurance companies operating in other markets. The VHI is to be congratulated for keeping such a tight rein on operating costs. I cannot comment on BUPA's costs as its cost base in this country is incorporated into its UK accounts and does not appear to be available separately for this country. Perhaps BUPA Ireland could examine this practice for the <Col N="87" /> future and consider publishing its accounts for Ireland separately. It would appear from statements made by the chairman of the UK parent company that the Irish operation is viewed as one of the most profitable operations in a very large world-wide company.</P>
    <P>For community rating to operate effectively and transparently in an open market, risk equalisation is essential. What that means in effect is that any company engaged in health insurance with a high percentage of low risk subscribers, and therefore liable to make a greater amount of profit, should contribute some of that profit to a fund that can be distributed to companies with a high number of high risk subscribers.</P>
    <P>The VHI has been in operation for over 40 years and it has a large number of subscribers, many of whom are now approaching middle to old age. The risk of these people needing access to their health insurance is much higher than any company which might have a higher number of low risk subscribers such as young people. In this regard, the risks of all companies are shared equally with the result that health insurance premia are kept to the lowest level possible which is good news for subscribers.</P>
    <P>This Bill allows for the establishment of the Health Insurance Authority which will act as the regulator of the voluntary health insurance market, especially for the operation of a risk equalisation scheme between insurers. The Health Insurance Authority will manage and administer risk equalisation schemes. The operation of the scheme will be devised by actuaries according to a very complicated formula but it is my understanding the essence will be a transfer of funds from companies that have high profits to companies with low profits or which are just breaking even. In other words, the risks of looking after all age groups are shared equally between the health insurance companies so that no single company can cherry pick a low risk group at the expense of other subscribers. There may be other insurance companies who may wish to enter the Irish health insurance market and I believe it is important that they should be aware of the exact conditions that operate here.</P>
    <P>I welcome the provision to allow new entrants to the market a period in which to develop their insurance portfolio without contribution to the risk equalisation fund, but once they have become established, it is important that they enter the fund and contribute if that is required. In this way the fundamental principle of community rating is protected. Health insurance premia must be kept at the lowest possible level for all subscribers, irrespective of their age. It is a principle that has served this country well and one that must be maintained. I commend the Bill to the House.</P>

      <P>I welcome the opportunity to contribute to this Second Stage debate and I commend the Minister for introducing the Bill to the <Col N="88" /> House. I note that Second Stage is to be completed later this evening and I hope the Bill will have a speedy passage through the House.</P>
      <P>Ireland has a unique history of private health insurance. The part played by VHI over the years has not been properly appreciated. It was only when BUPA came into the Irish market that many individuals and families realised the extent of the work done by VHI. Competition is good for the insurance market. I am pleased that the Government at the time did not allow the new arrival to cherry pick and insure only the young and healthy members of the population. We have good, strong voluntary health insurance now and I want to see that continue.</P>
      <P>This legislation will establish a new health insurance authority and I ask the Minister to give the authority a wide brief so that it can examine all aspects of the health insurance industry. I do not envy the Minister in his task of tackling the difficult problems in the health service at the moment. The cost of providing health care to the public is rising and as people live longer the costs increase even more. Medical procedures are advancing but the equipment involved in these procedures is very expensive. The share price of pharmaceutical companies is increasing each week, based on the profits from the production of medicines. They spend more every year on the testing of new or improved medicines.</P>
      <P>The role of the medical profession is also changing. In fairness to its members and their families, the fear of litigation causes the profession to protect its own interests. I ask the Minister to examine this area in consultation with his Cabinet colleagues.</P>

      <P>This is not a debate about pieces of paper. It is not about files, documents, folders or letters. It is about fundamental political issues, including what it means to be a citizen of Ireland in the 21st century. It is also, perhaps just as importantly, about what it means to be a public servant in Ireland in the 21st century. For years now, we have been told that all political parties are the same, there are no differences between them. That has never been true, and the Govern<Col N="89" /> ment's proposals to amend the Freedom of Information Act make it clear how untrue the assertion is.</P>
      <P>Freedom of information is a touchstone issue. How politicians and political parties act on the issue is a declaration of what lies at the core of their political philosophy. Are they committed to the fundamental idea of democratic accountability or are they not? Do they see themselves as having a mandate from the people, and being accountable to the people, or do they not? Do they regard the people who elected them as citizens, with rights equal to those who govern? Do they regard the public administration as having an absolute responsibility to behave to the highest standard of openness, with respect for the rights of all citizens? Do they regard themselves as a new aristocracy, speaking down to a peasantry whose duty it is to take lectures from their masters?</P>
      <P>The idea of citizenship is at the heart of this debate. It is sad that in 2003, it is necessary to remind the Government of a concept which was largely developed in the 19th and early 20th centuries. The core principle is that political power in a democracy is vested in the people, with every adult having an equal voice as of right. These ideas of equality, and of rights, are alien to the Government. It intensely dislikes the notion that people should have a right to anything. For several years now it has made it very clear, for example, that it certainly does not think people with disabilities should have a right to services. As the new aristocracy, it prefers to hand down crumbs from the master's table, or even from his shiny new jet.</P>
      <P>Heaven forbid that people should be regarded as citizens, with rights to anything, let alone information about how the new aristocracy conducts its business. This is precisely the new aristocracy's attitude to freedom of information. We have all heard it said that information is power. Certainly, without information, it is impossible for any Government to be held to account. The Government has done everything it can to diminish the role of this House in parliamentary scrutiny of its activities or its policies. The Taoiseach is always available to be door-stepped for 30 seconds of meaningless soundbites, but he is never willing to give a straight answer to a straight question. Now there is an attempt to undermine the rights of ordinary citizens to information on how the Government functions. Unfortunately, a media that in general has been content to facilitate the Taoiseach's meaningless soundbites will now find it more difficult to hold the Government to account.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Tánaiste, in particular, has suggested that the Government's proposals are of concern only to the media, and not to ordinary citizens. Her approach is a clear indication &ndash; not for the first time &ndash; of the disdain with which she regards ordinary Irish citizens. Does she believe that citizens are only interested in the personal information about themselves held by Government? <Col N="90" /> Does she not believe that citizens might be interested in the workings of Government, or in how fundamentally important policies that affect the entire society are being developed? Does she not believe that citizens have a role in holding the Government to account and have a right to do so? It is clear she does not. She seems to have little interest in the principle that, in a democracy, it is citizens to whom the Executive is ultimately responsible. Perhaps she has forgotten Article 6 of Bunreacht na hÉireann which states as follows: &ldquo;All powers of government, legislative, executive and judicial, derive, under God, from the people.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The Government's proposals will deprive Irish citizens of the right to information on how its own Government functions. It is clear that the Government's purpose is not to amend the Act but to neuter it. Its proposals have been drawn up with one purpose in mind &ndash; to provide Ministers and civil servants with means to limit a citizen's access to information. The Government proposes to significantly broaden the definition in the Act of what constitutes a Cabinet paper. This opens up the opportunity of material being sheltered from the provisions of the Act simply because it has somehow been included on a Cabinet agenda. Similarly, it is clear that the proposal to extend the protection of Cabinet papers to committees of officials working to Cabinet is intended to provide a shelter from scrutiny for a wide range of material.</P>
    <P>In proposal after proposal, the clear intention is to shut down public access. Secretaries General of Departments are to be given power to certify material as being part of an ongoing deliberative process. This will effectively suspend the appeal process in relation to a request. The only recourse for citizens is the prohibitively expensive route to the High Court.</P>
    <P>Deterring citizens from asking questions is a central part of the strategy. The high level group mentions a charge of &euro;20. The Government in its proposals has not told us what fee it envisages. Not alone is the fee designed to deter requests, it will alter the practice of providing information outside of the Act. There will now be an incentive to tell citizens to submit a formal request and pay the fee, rather than simply release information which should be in the public domain. The term &ldquo;freedom of information&rdquo; will be a hollow one. Perhaps we need to begin thinking of an alternative &ndash;&ldquo;information at a price&rdquo; perhaps? Blanket exemptions are to be applied to material where previously a public interest test was sufficient. Bizarrely, all documents relating to tribunals of inquiry are to be kept from the public.</P>
    <P>The Government has sought to defend its proposals by referring to the report of the high level review group. This defence is flawed because the report of the group is itself deeply flawed. I look forward to the members of the group giving evidence to the Committee on Finance and the Public Service. I look forward to hearing why they saw fit to imitate Mr. de Valera and look into <Col N="91" /> their own hearts to discern the wishes of the Irish people. I look forward to hearing why the NUJ, the Information Commissioner or even the Opposition parties were not consulted. These are important partners in how the Act is used, and their voices ought to have been heard.</P>
    <P>I am also looking forward to the evidence of the senior civil servants, because they are people for whom I have considerable respect. Each of them, in my experience, believes in the concept of public service. I seriously doubt that they would, if left to their own devices, have any opposition to the idea of public consultation on this issue. From various things I have heard, I wonder whether the civil servants involved believed their report was part of a process. I find it difficult to believe that they understood it was the Government's intention to base its decisions on their conclusions and nothing else. The senior civil servants involved would not purport to speak for everyone in the Civil Service.</P>
    <P>I wish they had stopped to think about how they could reconcile their findings with the wider cause of reform within the Civil Service, a cause in which at least some of them believe. Read in isolation, the report of the group does little to inspire confidence in current processes of administrative reform. It speaks of an attitude which harks back to former days of unaccountable bureaucracy. It does not speak of a determination to drive ahead with a modernising agenda.</P>
    <P>The high level group has been characterised, perhaps unfairly, as constituting five Sir Humphreys. However, they have produced a report which might be expected of an old-style civil service asked to produce its own wish-list. Civil servants do not write the law, Governments do. If the Government wishes to force senior civil servants into an unholy alliance to bring down the shutters on open government, there should be an awareness that the Government, and only the Government, is accountable to the people for doing so.</P>
    <P>The Government's proposals go well beyond even the draconian proposals of the group. Where in the group's report, for example, does it suggest that files prepared for parliamentary questions should be hidden away? We are now confronted with the proposal that information which is deemed fit to be released to the Dáil is to be hidden away unless the Opposition can find the right formula of words to elicit it. We are back to the Ray Burke school of open government. The Government cannot appeal to the review group for support for this proposal.</P>
    <P>Nobody can rationally oppose a fair-minded and balanced review of this legislation. I am prepared to listen to the case, if it can be made, that the Act causes some administrative problems, but I also want to hear evidence on the benefits of the Act in improving the quality of administrative work. I have little doubt that the prospect of public scrutiny has served as a stimulus to improve the research and analysis which underlies admin<Col N="92" /> istrative decision making. Freedom of information means that the old prejudices are not good enough. Reasoned argument is required instead.</P>
    <P>The Labour Party is prepared to listen to reasoned and well-supported arguments about how the Act can be improved. The legislation has always sought to strike a balance between the rights of the citizen to information and the need for effective administration. That is why my party, in proposing this Bill, is prepared to postpone the release of Cabinet papers under the Act for a further year, to allow a proper review to take place. Such a review must include a wide public consultation process, and a willingness to entertain argument from all quarters.</P>
    <P>Not only was the Information Commissioner not consulted on the Government's proposals, but it is clear from the report he has published today on the application and operation of certain provisions of the 1997 Act, that he has very serious reservations about them. In his report, Mr. Murphy says that it would be inappropriate for him to engage in public debate on the merits or demerits of the Government's Bill. However, he gives a number of specific examples of where he sees that the Government proposals could, according to his report, &ldquo;create serious legal and other problems in the future and which have the potential to result in costly litigation possibly involving my office.&rdquo;  In particular, he expresses concern about the implications of section 12 of the Government's Bill, which he says, seeks to substitute the definition of Government currently contained in the Act with, according to his report, &ldquo;a much more far-reaching and constitutionally unrecognisable definition.&rdquo;  All of this emphasises why the commissioner should have been fully consulted by the Government before any proposals for amendments to the Act were finalised.</P>
    <P>The manner in which the Government's legislation has been pushed through the Seanad this week is an indication of how the new aristocracy does business. The sport of kings is more important than the rights of citizens. The Minister for Finance and his Minister of State have both absented themselves from the Seanad this week, and neither is available to attend this House. Can there be a more eloquent statement of the contempt in which this Government holds the House and the citizens who elected it?</P>
    <P>One commentator at the weekend described the Government as neo-liberal. Certainly, the Progressive Democrats, and the Progressive Democrats within Fianna Fáil, have acquired all the neo-liberal characteristics of Thatcherism. Sadly, when it comes to empowering the citizen, these neo-liberals have little in common with the radical liberal tradition of the 19th century. They favour a small, strongly centralised state and not one that is answerable to its citizens. It is sad that the party founded by former Deputy O'Malley in his anxiety to stand by the Republic, can sign up to this assault on the rights of citizens. One recalls <Col N="93" /> the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, who I am pleased to see in the House, hanging out of a lamp-post proclaiming &ldquo;no thanks to single party government.&rdquo;  That was the biggest broken promise of the election campaign.</P>
    <P>The Progressive Democrats have happily merged with their aristocratic cousins in Fianna Fáil and do not want to be disturbed by the little people asking awkward questions. They have no intention of holding Fianna Fáil to account. Comfortably seated in the ministerial transport of their choice, their slogan has been replaced by &ldquo;no thanks to open or accountable government.&rdquo;  The man who once compared his Taoiseach to Ceaucescu has shown all too clearly how comfortable he is with Ceaucescu's concept of free and unfettered information.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach, however, is no neo-liberal. His is a more old fashioned form of conservatism. The great paternalist, he seeks to smother us all in his happy embrace. As his permanent election campaign makes its way around the country, we are all expected to smile and cheer as the great man meets his people. However, the people must not complain at what his most right-wing of Governments does or, more often, leaves undone. When the parents of children with disabilities have the temerity to protest outside the Mansion House, they are greeted with a dismissive snarl. How dare they not stand and cheer everything the Taoiseach does? Do they not know he will look after everybody, not because they have any such thing as rights but because he chooses to?</P>
    <P>From now on, their criticism will be muted, because they will be kept in the dark. If the Taoiseach's Ministers are at loggerheads over the health service, they will not be allowed to know. If the State concludes a deal with the religious which confers a huge cost on the taxpayer, the full truth can be hidden from public view. A veil of secrecy will be thrown over the operations of Government so that the new aristocracy can continue on its merry way, unimpeded. Instead of being mediated through the Freedom of Information Act, information will in future be mediated through consultants and agencies at many times the cost.</P>
    <P>No Government should be afforded this much freedom from scrutiny nor be allowed to put itself beyond public accountability. However, this Government in particular is more in need of scrutiny and accountability than ever. The acronym which is most appropriate to it, with all its pretensions to being a new aristocracy, is SAD &ndash; smug, arrogant, and dishonest.</P>
    <P>There is another option. The Labour Party's Bill provides the Government with the opportunity to pull back from its proposals to gut the Freedom of Information Act and to hold a meaningful review. If the Government is genuinely interested, as it claims to be, in preserving the principle of freedom of information, it will accept this Bill. If it does not, we will know what are this SAD Government's true intentions. I commend this Bill to the House.</P>

      <P>On 25 June 2002, just two weeks after their appointment to Government, Ministers decided to appoint a committee of high level officials to review the Freedom of Information Act. Why the rush, so soon into their new term of office? Neither of the general election manifestos of the parties in Government made any explicit reference to reviewing the Act. No mandate had been sought from the electorate to proceed secretly on this mission to dismantle this law.</P>
      <P>At no stage during the election, just weeks earlier, did any Minister tell the public that this was a pressing matter nor indicate that both parties were so concerned about the operation of the Act that within days of forming their new Government they would seek to refer the operation of the Act to a review group and seek, as we now know from the proposed Bill, to emasculate the Act.</P>
      <P>This is deception of a high order. This country is proud to be a parliamentary democracy. It is not a parliamentary dictatorship where the Government can ram through whatever measures it wishes without due scrutiny and consultation. The Government derives its authority from the electorate based on a clear honest statement of its intentions. This did not happen in this case.</P>
      <P>Everything about the procedure adopted here is a cause for concern. The hidden agenda was kept under wraps from the eyes of the voters but was ready to be placed on the Cabinet agenda within a few short weeks of re-election. The review group's existence was never revealed to the press or public or even advised to the statutory Information Commissioner. The review process was carried out in secret without consultation with users, media or members of the Dáil or Seanad. The Bill's clauses go far beyond the suggestions of the official review report and the parliamentary timetable for the Bill in both the Dáil and Seanad is inadequate for the proper scrutiny of the measures proposed.</P>
      <P>In its opening statements the high-level review group says: &ldquo;The introduction of FOI legislation in this country has played an important role in promoting openness, transparency and accountability in Government.&rdquo;  The summary conclusion of the high level review group states: &ldquo;Internationally, freedom of information is recognised as an important contributor to good public administrative practice.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Nowhere in the report, nor in the spin that has surrounded the introduction of the Government's new Freedom of Information (Amendment) Bill, has any concrete example been given of a decision or action of Government, which was prevented, significantly delayed or whose cost was significantly increased by the operation of the existing Act. In Leaders' Questions today the Taoiseach referred to &ldquo;damage&rdquo; to the Government but he has not specified what this damage might be. Perhaps the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform will enlighten us. Given the urgency which the Government has <Col N="95" /> devoted to dismantling the Act, we are entitled to know why.</P>
    <P>The proposals by the Government go further than the proposals of the high level review group. Why? What has the Government to hide or, perhaps more significantly, what does it anticipate wanting to hide from scrutiny in the remaining period of its term of office? I have one basic question to which it is essential to get an answer. Why was there no consultation with the Information Commissioner, the NUJ, NGOs, the Department's own consultative committee which was set up by the Department of Finance and encompassed respected people from a range of walks of life or with other interested parties, not least the Dáil and Seanad? The Government is using the cover of the upcoming deadline for release of Cabinet papers to seek changes of a far more fundamental nature than envisaged under the original Act.</P>
    <P>The Labour Party's modest and politically generous proposal this evening goes a long way to meet for the coming year the Government's misgivings about this deadline. If the Government rejects this constructive attempt to meet its concerns, it will only highlight again the destructive hidden agenda of the more sweeping changes that lie behind its own Bill. Why can we not have a year to consult and reflect? Why can we not have time to find consensus?</P>
    <P>In every debate of this kind it is salutary to remind ourselves, however often repeated they are, of the words spoken by the late Mr. Justice Hamilton:</P>
    <P>I think that if the questions that were asked in the Dáil were answered in the way they are answered here, there would be no necessity for this inquiry and a lot of money and time would have been saved.</P>
    <P>It is ironic that the Government now proposes to shelter the briefing papers for parliamentary questions, and indeed briefing papers on legislation, from public view. Accountability to Parliament will be limited by whether a question is reached on the Order Paper, by what questions are asked, if they are reached, and whether the answer sets out to mislead by withholding key information. This is a certain recipe for the appalling vista outlined by the late Chief Justice where information is withheld and suppressed, leading undoubtedly to abuse and persistent cover-ups. It is a case of a return to the bad old days and proof positive of how little the leading figures in the current Administration have learned from the events of the past decade.</P>
    <P>At the meeting of the finance committee this coming Thursday, I will have many detailed questions for the senior officials but it is the political agenda that should concern this House. There is more to this than the protection of Cabinet documents due for release next month. The Government's new legislation is a significant setback to community and voluntary organisations. It will <Col N="96" /> substantially undermine the Government's existing policy on its relationship with the community and voluntary sector.</P>
    <P>In its own White Paper, the Government acknowledged the need to create a participatory democracy where active citizenship is the norm. It stated that voluntary activity was a vital element of democracy and that a strong democracy enhances and protects the capacity of citizens to participate. Furthermore, it stated that in the Government's vision of society the ability of the community and the voluntary sector to provide active channels for the active involvement and participation of citizens was fundamental. Were these words written by the same Government that wants to enact a law that turns these sentiments full circle?</P>
    <P>The plans to significantly curtail citizens' access to information will directly undermine the Government's spurious commitment last year to create a more participatory democracy where active citizenship is fostered. Introducing a fee for information requests will deter citizens' involvement with policy making and will directly disadvantage many citizens' groups. The quality of one's citizenship and capacity to participate will be more directly linked to income, under this proposal, than is currently the case. This is directly in conflict with the White Paper's commitment to focus on the needs of the most disadvantaged, to achieve quality of opportunity, access and treatment and to ensure that individuals and communities are facilitated to speak about the problems affecting them and to be part of the practical response.</P>
    <P>The restrictions appear to represent an adversarial, rather than a partnership, approach to citizens by the Government. We have an eminent lawyer here representing the Government. Lawyers are famous for their adversarial approach.</P>

      <P>This Bill has arisen without consultation with citizens' groups. As a result it is lopsided in favour of administrative convenience with no balancing component of democratic accountability or support for active citizenship. It is significant that every section of the Bill is overwhelmingly focused on restricting citizens' access to information and making the process more time consuming and costly. There is no additional right for the citizen in the Government's proposals. As far as this Government is concerned, inquiries from citizens represent a burdensome nuisance which should be discouraged and hindered at every turn. I am sure that even at this late stage, Ministers must realise they have gone too far. They have an honourable way out &ndash; by accepting the Labour Party Bill and allowing the tried and trusted mechanisms of public consultation to take their course over the coming 12 months. The Taoiseach, rightly, has earned his political reputation on his ability to encourage and foster consultation until agreement is reached. The Labour <Col N="97" /> Party asks the Taoiseach to look into his heart and to use the tried and trusted method that has brought him to where he is and allow the consultation that these changes require.</P>

      <P>It is said that familiarity breeds contempt. Sometimes it breeds indifference. That is the wish of the Government, or at least the expectation of some elements of it, that the public has become inured to the ongoing outflow of scandals, suggestions of corruption and of malpractice and that somehow it does not have the resonance it once had.</P>
      <P>A decade ago, in the immediate post-Haughey era, people were scandalised by the state of public affairs and demanded that there be a response in this House, a wind of change that would blow through public administration and alter the way public business was done. They demanded that it be done in the interests of the public rather than in the interests of the few. Phrases like &ldquo;golden circles&rdquo; were in common usage.</P>
      <P>My party fought the 1992 election on two simple concepts; justice in the economy and ethics in Government. From that simple concept, &ldquo;ethics in Government&rdquo;, flowed three bedrock items of legislation that have framed the way public business has been done in the past decade. The first was the Ethics in Public Office Act, the second was the Electoral (Amendment) Act and the third one was the Freedom of Information Act. This is a trilogy of measures that sought to change the way public business was done in this land.</P>
      <P>The Ethics in Public Office Act set standards for public administrators, Members of the Oireachtas, Members of Government and senior public servants. It changed the way business was done. The Electoral (Amendment) Act, which I had the pleasure to sponsor as Minister for the Environment and Local Government, sought and achieved a cap on expenditure and a disclosure of contributions to political parties and a cap on the amount that could be given to individuals and to political parties.</P>
      <P>Each of these measures in turn has come under attack by the Fianna Fáil-Progressive Democrat Administration. We should not be surprised at that. I have personal knowledge of the Electoral (Amendment) Act and I know that the then Progressive Democrat spokesperson who is now the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, said it was so bad it was unamendable, that the principles in it attacked democracy and fought it tooth and nail. Ironically, I later saw a former Fianna Fáil Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform lay claim to the Act as his own on a Fianna Fáil website.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Of all those items of legislation, the Freedom of Information Act was, in many ways, the most important. It has transformed public access to how the country is governed at every level &ndash; within the quangos, the local authorities and national Government. It provided an irritant for many of us. We get irritated when there are requests to see expenses or who travelled where <Col N="98" /> or what was spent on the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform's breakfast or the Taoiseach's dinner. That irritant is balanced by a searing light penetrating the way business is done. It has two fabulous benefits. It has transformed the way business is done, attacked old prejudices and required reasoned arguments for decisions. Nobody wants to be portrayed as not engaging in argument. That used to be the way, until this legislation was lobbed in here which has remarkably transformed public administration for the good.</P>
    <P>What does the Government now propose? Yesterday I engaged in a debate &ndash; or tried to &ndash; on my local South East Radio. It is very interesting that the mantra coming from the two Fianna Fáil representatives, one the Minister of State at the Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources, Deputy Browne, is that this is a minimalist proposal from Government, that there is really only one substantial change, which is that the Cabinet exemption is to be extended from five to ten years and everything else is really dotting i's and crossing t's. That is a patent falsehood. The truth is that there are substantial changes aimed at attacking the base of the Freedom of Information Act. There are two most glaring proposals in this regard. The first is in regard to the widening of the definition of Cabinet papers to include areas that were not included in the primary legislation. My former colleague, Eithne FitzGerald, carefully looked at these and I was on the negotiating team that tried to get these matters through. I know that this particular issue was looked at with great care.</P>
    <P>In essence, all that is required to sanitise a document from public scrutiny is to waft it past Cabinet. Those of us who have had the pleasure and honour of serving in Cabinet know that many a document gets stamped &ldquo;seen by the Minister&rdquo; because it came into the precincts of the Minister's office. That kind of stamp, &ldquo;about to be seen&rdquo;, &ldquo;about to be presented&rdquo;, &ldquo;papers presented to&rdquo;, &ldquo;concerning Cabinet&rdquo;, will be sanitised from public view. That is a clear intention and gives <i>carte blanche,</i> if the Administration so wishes, to hide documents from public scrutiny.</P>
    <P>The other major change is in regard to the deliberative process. From now on, the Secretary General of a Department can say that the deliberative process is ongoing. God knows many major issues in this country are ongoing, not for years but for decades. As long as a process is ongoing, documents can be shielded from public view and public debate. This is a deliberate attempt to undo one core element of the Freedom of Information Act in so far as it relates to the operation of Government. Quite clearly, the Government has decided that, in terms of shining the light of public scrutiny on administration, that is fine and dandy, acceptable and good as long as it does not touch upon itself and its workings.</P>
    <P>A sensible argument could be made for changes in this area. We do not have a closed mind to that. That is why the way the Govern<Col N="99" /> ment's Bill has been handled is so debasing of free debate and proper scrutiny and respect for this House and respect for others who are charged with a role in this, including, in particular, the Information Commissioner.</P>
    <P>I wish to address a question to the two Cabinet Ministers present both of whom are honourable people and honourable public servants. Will they accept the goodwill of the Labour Party proposal, not to roll back everything the Government is proposing but simply to put everything on hold? I ask them to freeze things as they are for a year and allow all who are genuinely concerned with this important public right to have their input fairly weighed. Then, 12 months from now, a Bill can go through this House on which we are all agreed. I ask the Minister to accept this conciliatory and positive proposal from this side of the House on a Bill that is in all our interests.</P>

      <P>It was suggested that all the proposals in this Bill were one-way traffic and that all of them were motivated by the convenience of the Government. I draw Deputies' attention to section 25 of the Government's Bill, which provides that records held by public bodies relating to the costing, assessment or consideration of any proposal of a political party carried out for or on behalf of that party should be exempt. I remind Deputies opposite that that proposal is in ease of them. At this moment the Information Commissioner is considering a case where someone has applied to him for the release of that information. This section was not proposed by the top level group but by the Department of Finance, which became aware of the situation and believed the principle that the deliberative process of the Opposition parties should not be impeded by the operation of this Act and that they should be free to consult the Department of Finance in relation to proposals of their own in confidence without the danger that some journalist might do to the Opposition what they claim is perfectly right when done to Government, that is inquire into their deliberative process and into what they are considering doing or proposing in this Chamber. That is one example of a measure in the Government's Bill which is not driven by the interests of Government but by the interests of fair play and the deliberative process of the Opposition.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I note that the Information Commissioner has, today, published a commentary on the Freedom of Information Act 1997. I have not had time to read it in its entirety or to study its conclusions in their entirety but I am struck by the second <Col N="100" /> paragraph of his background statement in which he says that he is conscious that many commentators would like him to state his views on the proposed legislation but that he does not intend to do so because it would be entirely inappropriate for him to engage in public debate on the merits and demerits of the Government's Bill. He goes on to say that the Constitution provides that the sole and exclusive power of making laws for the State is vested in the Oireachtas and that it is the role of the Information Commissioner, in relation to the Freedom of Information Act, to implement the legislation passed by the Oireachtas in an independent and impartial manner. He then goes on to say that, given the importance of the proposed changes to the Act, however, and having regard to his statutory reporting relationship with the Houses of the Oireachtas, he has decided to publish a commentary of the Act under section 39 of the Act. He quotes the relevant provision: &ldquo;The Commissioner may prepare and publish commentaries on the practical application and operation of the provisions, or any particular provisions, of this Act, including commentaries based on the experience of holders of the office of Commissioner in relation to reviews,&nbsp;.&rdquo;  Reviews, by the way, are not top level reviews but reviews under section 34 of the Act, which are reviews of decisions.</P>
    <P>In his decision to engage in a commentary which involves evaluating and passing comment on the provisions of the Government's Bill, the commissioner seems to have strayed across his self-imposed line. He seems to have said that on the one hand, it was not his function and to have implied that it would be improper of him to comment on the merits and demerits of a Bill and on the other hand, he resorts to section 39 of the Act and relies on his capacity to make a commentary on the Bill to justify the particular observations he has to make. Without making any more severe criticism of him, it is abundantly clear that section 39 does not empower him to comment on Bills. It asks him to comment on the application of the provisions of the Act and of reviews of decisions carried out under the Act.</P>
    <P>This, perhaps, exemplifies one of the problems of the Act. It has been pushed vigorously &ndash; I do not decry the commissioner's vigour in carrying out his work &ndash; even to the point where, for instance, Opposition requests for information to cost their own financial records have been the subject, when resisted by the Department of Finance, of attempts to get at them through the Office of the Information Commissioner. I put those points to Deputies for them to contemplate. It is not all a one-way street.</P>
    <P>I welcome the opportunity afforded by the presentation of the Labour Party Bill to set the record straight about the Government's position on freedom of information. The Government's position is quite reasonable and straightforward. The measures proposed in the Government's Bill, which is before the Seanad, are based on the need to ensure that the business of Government is <Col N="101" /> efficiently organised. The Government must be able to consider all aspects of important public issues and then reach decisions in the best interest of the whole community. That is the function of Government. It is the Government's view that the existing Act prevents this and it must therefore be amended.</P>
    <P>The Government has examined the position carefully in light of the conclusions reached by the high level group of Secretaries General and other factors and has, quite properly, made its decisions about the best way forward and incorporated these in its proposed legislation. We do not believe that it is in the public interest that records relating to Government decisions should be released in a manner which undermines those decisions or leads them to being re-opened.</P>
    <P>The Freedom of Information Act 1997 has made a major contribution to public life in Ireland. I accept that point and I accept what Deputy Howlin and others have said to that effect. People can now get access to all manner of records. They can get papers relating to a huge range of economic and social policies being implemented by Departments and public sector organisations of all kinds. They can also get information about the personal material held on them by public bodies as well as the reasons for decisions made in relation to them.</P>
    <P>As a result of the Act, there has been a significant improvement in the quality of public debate in Ireland. Debates on important issues are definitely more informed. One only has to look at newspapers today and compare them with the position ten years ago to see that there is now more and better coverage of public policy and its impact on Irish society and the economy. There are probably many factors which have brought this improvement about &ndash; for one thing, we have more media outlets than before &ndash; but it is undeniable that the Freedom of Information Act has played a major part in informing and therefore encouraging public debate.</P>
    <P>We have some way to go before we see the extensive use of freedom of information that has emerged in the United States, for instance, but there is no doubt that Ireland is moving in that direction. The impact of the Act is borne out by the volume of requests made under the Act &ndash; over 44,000 in the period from April 1998 to December 2001. A second important statistic is the number of bodies covered by the Act, which has increased from 67 in 1998 to a total of 370, including local authorities, health boards, voluntary hospitals and numerous other State agencies, bodies and institutions, including those in the enterprise, broadcasting and third level education sectors.</P>
    <P>These developments must be encouraged. The kind of debate we are seeing in Ireland is part and parcel of a healthy democracy. Debate about public issues is one of the ways in which a democratic society is established and sustained. I assure the Dáil that I welcome this new approach to the way we run our affairs in this country. I do not <Col N="102" /> want to take away from it and I want to see further developments in this direction.</P>
    <P>Freedom of information has also played an important part in public service reform in Ireland. The 1997 legislation has gone a long way to establishing more openness and accountability throughout Government. The Act has served to inculcate a more open attitude across the public service to the release of information on an administrative basis which previously would not have been readily available.</P>
    <P>I assure the House that there is no question of moving away from what has been achieved since the introduction of the Freedom of Information Act. This is not the purpose of the legislation that has been introduced in the Seanad. I would return later if time permitted to the purpose of the Government's legislation. Before I do that, I want to look at the Bill we are debating. To be honest, I find it a little confusing. As I understand it, the Bill seems to have two main aims. First, to extend the present five year exemption to six years and, second, to provide for a consultation process established in statute. According to this Bill the consultation would be a fairly major undertaking. The Information Commissioner is to consult with interested parties, which include the members of the consultative groups established by the Minister for Finance, members of the media, including the National Union of Journalists, business users, members of the Houses of the Oireachtas, members of the legal profession as well as non-governmental organisations.</P>
    <P>Following this complex process, which is to be undertaken within 12 months, the commissioner is to examine each and every proposal to amend the 1997 Act and lay a report before each House of the Oireachtas. It is not entirely clear from the Bill what precise role the Government is to be accorded in this exercise. Section 6 merely instructs the Government to &ldquo;have regard&rdquo; to the reports of the commissioner and the joint committee. I assume this is intended to allow the Government to exercise some element of choice over what measures it would then be allowed to introduce.</P>
    <P>It has been clear in recent days that the alleged lack of consultation by the Government about its Bill is supposed to be a major problem. I can only assume that this is the main reason for the Labour Party Bill we are debating. It must be said clearly that the Government was not and is not obliged to consult with the persons mentioned in the Labour Party's Bill. In certain circumstances it is open to the Government to decide to take its own advice or, as was done in this case, to appoint a top level group of people, whose independence and integrity is unquestioned, to examine these issues and the effect of the Freedom of Information Act on the consultative and legislative process of Government policy.</P>
    <P>As one who has some degree of experience, as Attorney General I was in a position to operate an office of State, largely free from the constraints of the Freedom of Information Act in its <Col N="103" /> entirety. When I was transposed by a remarkable process to which Deputy Rabbitte has alluded to the position I now hold, the dramatic change that I found &ndash; I do not say the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform is as it is&mdash;</P>

      <P>I ask the Labour Party to concede that one of the unintended consequences of the passage of the Freedom of Information Act was a transmutation of people's attitudes to recording the reasons for making decisions, putting in writing vigorous exchanges of views, contradicting other persons or putting in writing views which would require moral courage rather than expect the approbation of the media if they were revealed. These are the natural and predictable consequences in some measure of the Freedom of Information Act which I support. None of us should fool ourselves into believing that the unalloyed good of putting the searing search light, to which reference was made earlier, on the process of government and the processes of governmental institutions in this society, is all one-way traffic and its effects have been for the better and that there have been no deleterious side effects because there certainly have been. The Government's view in June 2002 was that it had to be addressed as a matter of urgency. If we were to function properly as a Government under the Constitution&mdash;</P>

One of the things that would be deleterious and bound to damage that process would be if its preparatory documents, in which contrary views are expressed, were to be laid open to public scrutiny almost immediately after a decision was made, in circumstances where the fundamental ethic of government is to go out and support decisions, even those to which one was strongly opposed, and not to disclose one's own opposition.

While one remains inside one remains a team player and supports the majority view, no matter how convinced one is that that view was not the view one would have preferred to have been taken on the day. If one then says that all the material in which one vigorously puts one's point of view is to be put in the public domain one undermines that ethic of government and fundamentally weakens the processes by which the Executive arm of the State is required to function.

There is nothing sinister about the provision in the Government's legislation to the effect that material prepared by civil servants to be of assistance to members of the Government when answering parliamentary questions should be available to the Opposition or the public generally. It has frequently been my experience that some of the material with which I have been so generously endowed by my Department is material over which I would not stand.

    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Defence (Mr. M. Smith)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government's Bill is a carefully balanced package of proposals which preserve the basic objective of freedom of information, while ensuring that Government can continue to conduct its business in an effective manner, in accordance with the public interest. This is the key objective &ndash; to strike the right balance between openness and transparency on the one hand and the effective functioning of the Government process on the other.</P>
      <P>The centrepiece of the Government's Bill is the amendment of section 19 dealing with meetings of the Government. I am pleased that many commentators seem to have accepted that the extension of the period of protection for Government records from five to ten years is a necessary and sensible measure. It was always recognised that a period of protection for such records had to be a feature of FOI. Those who framed the original Act recognised this and provided for five years, a shorter period than in any other jurisdiction where such periods apply.</P>
      <P>However, it is becoming increasingly clear that five years is not an adequate period for this purpose. As the high level group established by the Government to review the operation of the Act stated:</P>
      <P>As experience is gained in the operation of the Freedom of Information Act, it is evident that a five year moratorium on the release of Cabinet records is too short. It does not give Ministers the assurance that they require to commit views freely to the record if those views are to be divulged in such a relatively short space of time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have no hesitation, therefore, in recommending to this House that the restriction of five years for Government records should be raised to ten years. A ten year limit still leaves Ireland with a liberal regime. To those who contend that the Government is out of step or that the measures in this Bill go too far, I draw their attention to the following provisions from FOI Acts overseas with which our Act is commonly compared. In Australia, the Secretary to the Department of the Prime Minister has the power to certify that a document is a Cabinet document. Such a certificate establishes conclusively that the document is exempt. In New Zealand, a record may be withheld if it is necessary to maintain the consti<Col N="106" /> tutional conventions which protect collective and individual ministerial responsibility or the confidentiality of advice tendered by Ministers of the Crown and officials.</P>
    <P>In Canada, the Act does not apply for 20 years to a long and non-exhaustive list of Cabinet confidences, including correspondence used for reflecting communications or discussions between Ministers of the Crown on matters relating to the making of Government decisions or the formulation of Government policy and records, the purpose of which is to brief Ministers of the Crown on matters before Cabinet.</P>
    <P>Specific protection is afforded to ministerial communications in the UK. Protection is also afforded information which would, or would be likely to, prejudice the maintenance of the convention of collective ministerial responsibility or which would, or would be likely to, inhibit the free and frank provision of advice or exchange of views for the purpose of deliberation. The amendment to section 19 also deals with two other areas directly linked to the Cabinet process, inter-ministerial communications and committees directly supporting the deliberations of Cabinet.</P>
    <P>Protection of Government records also covers communications between Ministers on live Cabinet issues. These communications are an extension of the Cabinet exercise of collective responsibility and it is entirely logical that the same protection as applies to Government records should also apply to these records. This principle is recognised in other FOI regimes, for example in the Canadian and UK models. There has been misleading comment on this provision from various quarters and suggestions were made that all correspondence from Minister to Minister will henceforth be unavailable for release. That is simply not the case.</P>
    <P>There also appears to be a misunderstanding about the protection of records of committees directly supporting the Cabinet. Again, this is a tightly drafted provision to cover cases where officials are mandated to assist Cabinet deliberations on matters before the Cabinet and to report directly to the Cabinet.</P>

      <P>To ensure that such protection is only afforded to records which genuinely fall within these categories, the Bill provides that the Secretary General to the Government must certify that the committee concerned meets the relevant requirements. This is a reasonable, prudent and logical measure which will operate to ensure that Government is provided with comprehensive advice, expressed in totally frank and candid terms on the complexities of the issues under consideration.</P>
      <P>The question of fees has also attracted particular comment. Let me make it clear that there will be no fees for records relating to personal information.</P>

      <P>These are explicitly precluded by the Bill. Section 26 of the Bill is an enabling provision allowing the Minister for Finance to introduce upfront fees. I fully agree with my colleague, the Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, that this is long overdue. As I have said, FOI has been making an important contribution to public debate and to public service in this country. However, this does not come cheap.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>The statistics alone indicate that FOI is now a significant burden on Departments. Fees were provided for in the original Act but they have not worked as charging of fees has been the exception rather than the rule. My colleague, the Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, has spoken of the cost of particular requests amounting to thousands of euro. Every public servant involved in processing an FOI request will testify to the time involved. This involves acknowledging the request, discussions with the person to ensure the request is adequately focused and understood, estimating search and retrieval time required, locating relevant records, examining each record line by line for any exempt matter and considering public interest arguments for and against release.</P>
      <P>Where third party information is involved, the process can be even more onerous with the requirements to locate and contact third parties, issue formal consultation letters, consider submissions and notify appeal rights. As the fee regime is not working, the Bill now before the House will allow the Minister for Finance to prescribe fees for requests for access to records and for applications for review of decisions which must be paid before anything else happens. Contrary to media reports, the level of the upfront fee has not yet been decided. The high level group mentioned a possible fee of &euro;20, which accompanies planning appeals, as a possible example but the Minister for Finance has stated that he has still to give very careful consideration to the setting of fees and, in doing so, will be careful to strike a balance between the burden and cost of administering the legislation and the need to facilitate access to information.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill contains a number of technical provisions which are designed to improve the operation of the Act. These are based on the experience to date and draw from the work of the Civil Service users' network, the advice of the central FOI policy unit of the Department of Finance and the interactions and discussions between the <Col N="108" /> Department and the Office of the Information Commissioner over the years.</P>
    <P>The Government is also proposing to amend section 20, deliberations of public bodies. More certainty is required in this area for the effective functioning of the Government process so that records which relate to ongoing deliberations of Departments are not released into the public domain prematurely in such a way as to undermine the process of Government.</P>
    <P>Because it can be difficult to establish whether a deliberative process has ended, the Bill provides that the Secretary General of a Department can certify when a deliberative process is still in progress or has concluded. Secretaries General are responsible people and are in the best position to make an assessment about the work in their Departments. In exercising this function, they will be obliged to operate in accordance with the principles of the Act which provide that it is to enable members of the public to obtain access to the greatest extent possible, consistent with the public interest and the right to privacy, to information in the possession of public bodies. Again, the need for secure protection of the deliberative process is a feature of other jurisdictions and I would instance the Australian FOI law which also provides for certification by secretaries general. The certification provision applies only to Departments, which comprise only 17 public bodies out of a total of 370 covered by the FOI Act.</P>
    <P>I do not propose in this debate to dwell on all the other provisions of the Government's Bill &ndash; these have already been presented by the Minister for Finance. However, I am satisfied that, having considered the advice of the high level group and having drawn on its experience of the operation of the Act for five years, the Government has proposed a Bill which will improve the day-to-day operation of the Act, better reflect the cost of FOI and protect the integrity of the Cabinet process and the exercise of collective responsibility. The Bill which we are debating today does not address these key objectives and I cannot, therefore, support it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Labour Party for introducing this Bill. I also thank the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy McDowell, for attempting to address the Bill rather than reading a mimeographed speech into the Official Report.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>June 2002 was a significant time for the Government. It was then it discovered that all its free-flowing spending and the promises it made in the election to a gullible public were unsustainable. It was also then it discovered that the rules of disclosure under which it operated for five years were suddenly unsupportable. The public wonders if the two are connected. Was the discovery that all its promises could not be sustained connected to its realising that all the papers around at that time could not be published? There is deep public suspicion about this. The <Col N="109" /> Minister is living in a fool's paradise if he does not know that.</P>
    <P>People are increasingly seeing a Government arrogant in its approach, reneging on promises made, making the weakest in our community suffer for over-spending and now seeking to undermine the right of the public to information available to them during the years the Government was in office. We are led to believe that during those years Ministers were scared to put their thinking on paper. We are to believe they were quaking in their boots, were afraid to discuss matters freely or put them on paper because Cabinet confidentiality would be undermined. Yet, these people worked quite freely in the knowledge that all would be revealed five years later. No one has shown me any Government decision that was undermined because of Ministers' fears to submit material in writing. There is no evidence from the high level group of Government breaking down because Ministers were spending inordinate amounts of time at Cabinet on unresolved issues because they were afraid to put those matters in writing. There is no such evidence. The public rightly believes that the real reason behind this is that Ministers are afraid of their sins. They do not want the information on which certain decisions were made to become available, as was the rule under which they operated at the time.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy McDowell, was to be the public defender and ride shotgun, as Deputy Rabbitte said, on the ways of Fianna Fáil and its tendency to abuse single party Government. The only bullets he has come up with are targeted at the Information Commissioner. It is he the Minister excoriates in this Chamber. The Government, having failed to consult the Information Commissioner about legislation in which he was intimately involved then comes into the House and attacks him as if his motivation was suspect. The approach the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform has taken is contemptible. He admitted he had not read the report but he should have done so before he made that accusation.</P>
    <P>I am not a lawyer and I bow to the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform in this regard. However, section 36 states that the commissioner shall keep the operation of the Act under review and may, subject to subsection (2), carry out an investigation and so on. The commissioner alone is statutorily charged with keeping this legislation and not the high level group. He is absolutely entitled to point out to the Houses of the Oireachtas how proposals to change it will undermine its operation. It is clear if one takes the trouble to read the report &ndash; unfortunately, the Minister did not have the time to do so &ndash; that he had a profoundly different view of the Freedom of Information Act than the high level group whose independence the Minister applauds. These are not independent people. The high level group consists of people who are on the side of those who have an interest in just one side of the <Col N="110" /> operation of the Act. There are others, including the citizens, Members of this House and the NUJ, who have a very different view, yet the Government only sought to consult one side. That was not an independent review and to say that is not to reflect on the integrity of the group. They are parties in this issue and are not independent and the Minister is treating the House with contempt by suggesting they are.</P>
    <P>It is clear from the commissioner's report that he has taken a different view. His view of the Act is that it is based on the presumption of openness and not secrecy. This is clear in relation to section 19. Any reasonable person reading section 19 would agree that the Information Commissioner's interpretation is correct. It includes words like &ldquo;may refuse&rdquo;, the presumption being that, in many cases, they may not refuse but the Government is changing that. It states that the opportunity to refuse will be solely related to Government meetings but the Government proposes to change that as well. It further states that the records which will be protected will be around statements made at Government meetings but again the Government proposes to throw the net extraordinarily wide to protect everything from tax consultative groups to any little two-bit committee Ministers might appoint. They will all be protected as if they were statements before Cabinet. This is a different approach to that in the existing Act.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no difficulty allowing such material to be made available once the election is over. Naturally, there is commercial sensitivity which is recognised in the Act, to the effect that one does not release commercially sensitive information. Similarly, during the course of an election campaign, there is politically sensitive information which one does not release to one's opponents. The Minister is making some sensible changes there and I do not dispute that there needs to be some protection. It should not be five years but perhaps a couple of years. It is wrong to suggest that this change, which may have justification, justifies throwing out all the protection to allow the public access to Cabinet decisions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This has been a deeply flawed process. I am not convinced by the Minister's suggestion that what is at the heart of this is to protect the way in which the Cabinet works. What is at work here is the idea that information will become available <Col N="111" /> over the next five years relating to decisions taken five years ago in the lifetime of the last Dáil which would be potentially embarrassing. That is the only reason these changes are being made. There are no examples in the report of the high level group showing justification for the type of changes being made. This is a bad piece of work which reveals much more about the way in which this Government is thinking, the arrogance it has adopted after a term in office and the way it is circling the wagons to make sure it will not be exposed over the next five years to the type of accountability to which the public has a right. That is the motivation behind this legislation.</P>
    <P>I have not been convinced by any of the speeches I have heard or read. Not a shred of honest appraisal based on experience has come before the House to justify the changes being made. If the Minister produces some honest appraisal of problems, I will listen. I have an open mind but I see no such appraisal in what is before us. The Information Commissioner got it right. He has highlighted constitutionally unsound definitions and noted that some of the attempts to bring in changes have abandoned all the obligation to demonstrate harm which was at the heart of the old Act, that is, that secrecy can be protected if it can be demonstrated that harm will result if the information is released. The Government is trying to reverse that presumption. That is what is going on here. It is not sound and is not good for the citizen. It should be roundly rejected. I hope that at this late stage, the Government will accept what the Labour Party is offering, namely, an opportunity for us, who have a mutual interest in getting this right, to co-operate, instead of continuing with this jackboot tactic which has been a feature of the last couple of weeks, particularly in this House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FergusODowdFG" hpid="Mr. O'Dowd Mr. O'Dowd">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dowd</NameTxt>
      <P>The Information Commissioner has done a good job since his appointment. Nine times out of ten he defends the right to know and the right to transparency and openness in all dealings with Government, health boards, county councils and other public bodies. When the Government increased the amount of money an unfortunate person had to pay under the refund of drugs scheme by £10 per month in 1999, I made a request in regard to that decision under the Freedom of Information Act. I was told by the Department of Health and Children that if it gave me the information, it would undermine the very workings of the Government at its highest level and that it would compromise the bargaining position of the Department of Health and Children in the context of future negotiations with the Department of Finance. Eventually on appeal, the Office of the Information Commissioner agreed to give me the information which was that it was a cost saving exercise on the part of the Department, namely, that it would increase the tax on the sick person so that it would save money under the refund of drugs scheme. If this <Col N="112" /> Bill is passed, will we have access to such information or will the Secretary General of the Department say it will effect future deliberations of the Department and refuse access to the information? The Government wants to close the window which is partially open or to place a fog over what is really going on at Cabinet or in our country.</P>
      <P>If one looks at the budget for the Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs, one will see there is a 16% increase for the programme to fight the drugs problem, particularly in cities. However, if one investigates it further under the Freedom of Information Act, as I have done, one finds that there is a shortfall of &euro;7 million and that the advice to the Minister, Deputy Ó Cuív, was that the Cabinet Sub-committee on Social Inclusion and Drugs approved &euro;23 million of work to be done by the local drugs task forces but that the budget was cut back by &euro;7 million. We will not get such information if this Bill is passed.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform said one only has to look at newspapers today and compare them with the position ten years ago to see there is now more and better coverage of public policy and its impact on our society and economy. Let us look at a recent decision. <i>The Irish Times</i> stated that the Department of Foreign Affairs plans to move the passport office to Balbriggan, which is great. However, if one reads further there is a comment by a county manager that this took place &ldquo;in the face of very stiff competition&rdquo;. The Freedom of Information Act allowed me to discover that &euro;20 million of taxpayers' money will be invested in a new passport office, which is a good thing, and that the office will be in Balbriggan, or so it was thought until the facts were known.</P>
      <P>The documents released to me under the Act suggest that there are a number of developments in different areas which would be suitable. Drogheda, my home town, is top of the list but Balbriggan appears with an asterix and the document states that it will not be ready in time. Further information about the location of this &euro;20 million spend by the Government states that the Department got a telephone call about this issue and a document states:</P>
      <P>It is a pity that work on the business park in Balbriggan is not more advanced as it is in a good location. Unfortunately a building there is not going to be available for a year after we need it.</P>
      <P>A memorandum of meetings between the Department of Foreign Affairs and the Office of Public Works states:</P>
      <P>Given the timeframe, it was agreed that a building with at least planning permission in place will be required. The development at Balbriggan would, therefore, not suit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Nowhere can I find a report on why this building and &euro;20 million of taxpayers' money is going to <Col N="113" /> Balbriggan. I do not know why it is going there although the freedom of information legislation helped me to find out that there is a big question mark over how it got there.</P>
    <P>There may be different reasons for that but the reason the decision was made is being withheld from me. I was told it would be given to me in due course when the contracts are signed by the Department of Foreign Affairs, the builder and Fingal County Council. However, it is clearly in the interests of transparency and openness that the information is made available. If the Bill is passed, I do not believe it will be made available? </P>
    <P>The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform attacked the Information Commissioner, the defender of the public interest in regard to freedom of information. I welcome the fact that the commissioner has made a submission, which just arrived today, and it is very important that his views are listened to.</P>
    <P>There has been a lot of talk about the high level group's consideration of the Act. What of ordinary people who want to establish their right to information on them and what of those on the Opposition benches who want to expose duplicity or double standards in decision making at Government level? They need to and want to know. If the Government succeeds, we may never know and that would be a grave injustice to the democracy, transparency and openness in which the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform claims to have such interest.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>Tonight, I have had to listen to the most pathetic defence of Government proposals I have ever heard in my long time in this House. The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy McDowell, opened by telling the House that the Bill was partly in the interests of the Opposition. He quoted part of section 25 as being in relief of the Opposition. He then said, off the cuff, that this proved the Bill was not completely driven by the interests of Government. However, there are 27 sections in the Bill so there is the clear implication that the other 26.5 sections are in the interests of Government, as, of course, they are.</P>
      <P>The Minister went on to fire a shot across a person who dared to quote an independent view on Government proposals &ndash; the Information Commissioner. I declare an interest because I knew the commissioner when he was secretary of the Department of the Public Service, for which I had responsibility as Minister of State at one time. I know of no more independent, decent and honourable man in the public service, yet, because what he said independently did not coincide with the Government view, the Minister, Deputy McDowell, went so far as to claim that the commissioner had no entitlement to express a view.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister went on to quote section 39 of the original Act which entitles the commissioner in this regard, but that is not the point because the Minister is adept at quoting constitutional and <Col N="114" /> legal points to cover political arguments. His political argument is that nobody should dare question the Government in what it is doing. The Minister stated in his speech that it was not clear to him that the Government can or should consult the Information Commissioner, or any other person or body, about how it should carry out its business. The Government's business is legislation yet it does not even bother to consult this House. The way it is jackbooting this legislation through the Seanad is a disgrace, as is the way it has indicated that it is not interested in any view from a Senator or a Member of this House. This is typical of the way the Government conducts its business.</P>
    <P>In the pathetic defence of the Bill from the Minister for Defence, he referred lamely to the high level group and stated that the Bill draws on the group's experience and, on that basis, the Government has proposed a Bill which will improve the day-to-day operation of the Act. What was the original Act about? The Freedom of Information Act was &ndash; I am quoting from the Long Title &ndash; to enable members of the public to obtain access, to the greatest extent possible, consistent with the public interest and the right to privacy, to information. How can a restriction on that be in the best interests of the operation of the Act? </P>
    <P>It is a hugely important point. The Freedom of Information Act was not produced for the benefit of the media or the Opposition &ndash; I accept the media have an interest in it and more power to them &ndash; but for the benefit of the public. Does the Government give a damn about the public? This is one more example of the fact that it does not. This Act was introduced in 1997 for the benefit of the public. The restrictions proposed by the Government are clearly on the right of the public under the 1997 Act. This point must be driven home so that the public knows that this Bill is taking from its rights, not just from the rights of the media and the Opposition. In more than 25 years in the Dáil, this is one of the most serious assaults on our democratic system that I have seen.</P>
    <P>Members should remember the background to this. When the freedom of information proposal first emerged, it had the backing of all parties. It was not a creature of the rainbow Government simply because that Government put it through the Oireachtas &ndash; it had been part of the programme for Government of an earlier Fianna Fáil-led Government. In 1997, the legislation had all-party backing and went through the Oireachtas without a single dissenting voice. The only criticism of the Bill came from those in Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats &ndash; God bless them &ndash; who thought it was too restrictive. They should explain themselves now. Nonetheless, that Bill had support from all sides whereas this Bill is being rushed through with unseemly haste. It is the hallmark of a single-party Government, a parliamentary dictatorship which is heading this country towards Mugabe-<Col N="115" /> land. This Bill has all the hallmarks of institutionalised majoritarianism.</P>
    <P>The Government has not faced the fundamental issues immediately apparent on this issue. Is the Government prepared to put the possible embarrassment of its Members before the rights of the public? That has not been confronted, nor has the issue of who the records belong to. Do they belong to Ministers, civil servants or the public? Have Ministers and senior civil servants the courage to write down their views and stand over them or is the purpose of this legislation to ensure that they do not have to do that?</P>
    <P>I will return to this matter on Second Stage but will now turn to the report of the Information Commissioner, another important matter. The commissioner makes it clear that the amendment to section 20 in the proposed Bill could create serious legal and other problems which have the potential to result in costly legislation. He also makes it clear that the amendment to section 19, in particular, the definition of Government, is absolutely unique in that &ldquo;the Government&rdquo; is now to, apparently, include a committee of officials. I realise that the Government is arrogant and thinks it can sweep all before it and ignore the Opposition and the media, at least in the short-term &ndash; although it will, as usual, curry favour with the media in the run-up to the next general election &ndash; nonetheless, I will issue one little warning to the Government. The Government is not entitled to tell us in a Bill how it is defined, because the Government is defined in the Constitution as consisting of members who shall be appointed by the President, in accordance with the provisions of the Constitution. It is not constitutionally possible for the Government to produce a Bill telling us that the Government can now include a committee of officials. The Labour Party's Bill provides a sensible proposal. Let us adjourn this discussion for a year. That will give us the opportunity to have proper consultation. Let us get rid of the arrogant approach of this Government and end up with a decent amendment if, in fact, such an amendment is necessary.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MJNolan" hpid="Mr. Nolan Mr. Nolan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Nolan</NameTxt>
      <P>Prior to Private Members' business, I spoke about the new competition in the voluntary health insurance sector. The entry of BUPA into the Irish market has brought some much needed competition into this sector. However, it is only right to acknowledge the part that the VHI has played in medical insurance and the amount of coverage it has given to the public since its establishment in the 1950s. I am pleased that BUPA was not given a free hand when it <Col N="116" /> entered our market and was not allowed to cherry pick the best possible risks as far as it was concerned and only sign up young, relatively healthy individuals and families.</P>
      <P>In a broader context, I feel some sympathy for the Minister for Health and Children in trying to tackle the obvious inadequacies within our health service. It is not an easy job for any Minister or Government to try to live up to public expectations. As a population, we are living longer, so the cost of maintaining a strong, viable health service is increasing. We have seen the increased investment in the Department of Health and Children over the past five years in particular. The cost of medicines are increasing by the week. New medicines are coming on the market and are rightly being demanded by individuals. Everybody is entitled to the best possible medical attention and medicines available. Pharmaceutical companies are spending significant sums of money every year on testing new products, so when the products eventually come on the market, this investment tends to be reflected in their price.</P>
      <P>Some time ago, I spoke about our health board structure. The health boards were set up in 1971 and 1972, and it is time to look at restructuring them. Some tinkering around the edges took place some years ago in the Eastern Health Board area, but we must look now at how all health boards can be restructured in order to provide a better, more efficient service to the public. I served for a five-year period on the South Eastern Health Board. The regional hospital serving counties Wexford, Waterford, south Tipperary, Kilkenny and Carlow is based on the coast, in Waterford. I can never understand the reasoning behind that. It would make far greater sense to have the regional hospital in a central location within the health board area. Without being parochial, somewhere like Kilkenny would be fairly central. We now have a situation where people on the periphery of that health board area, particularly in my own county of Carlow, must drive 40 to 45 miles to access the regional hospital in Waterford. Some of my constituents would be far quicker travelling to the fine facility in Tallaght, County Dublin.</P>
      <P>Other aspects of the health boards also need looking at. Perhaps the Minister and the Minister of State would take that into consideration. Now is the time to do it, given the difficulties being experienced even by Dublin hospitals. Only today it was revealed that the Mater Hospital is closing some of its beds.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The job of the health care provider is becoming increasingly difficult. General practitioners, in particular, and nurses serving in the community and in hospitals are, to put it mildly, run off their feet. They also have to look over their shoulders because of the fear of claims being made against them. This is not doing any good in terms of the quality of service being provided. I know, from speaking to some GPs recently, that they now have to spend a lot of time covering their backs. <Col N="117" /> This is putting additional pressure on our hospitals because if there is any fear of a claim being made at a later stage, the hospitals must cover themselves. Therefore, patients are being brought into hospitals and occupying acute beds when that may not be necessary. Sections within the legal profession should examine their consciences and the role that they are playing in encouraging people to go down the road of litigation. This is not confined to the medical sphere. The significant costs of litigation can also be seen in the area of car insurance.</P>
    <P>Weekends place a particularly heavy toll on our medical professionals and general hospitals. Our emergency services, including ambulance staff and accident and emergency units, are put to the pin of their collars in some areas to cope with the needs and demands placed on them by drink-related problems in particular. It is only right to now consider putting a levy on the drinks industry. It is as plain as the nose on anybody's face that the drinks industry has a significant part to play in this, and the cost to the State is enormous. I commend the Minister on bringing this legislation before the House and wish it a speedy passage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanNeville" hpid="Mr. Neville Mr. Neville">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Neville</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to contribute to this debate and welcome the Bill. It is necessary to ensure the orderly provision and application of health insurance. I welcome competition within the health insurance market, and the situation has improved considerably since BUPA established itself here. It is to be congratulated on that. I also pay tribute to the VHI for the excellent service it has given the State since its foundation, and to the man who founded it, the then Minister for Health, Tom O'Higgins, who passed away recently. In any discussion on health insurance, we should recognise the pioneering work of Tom O'Higgins.</P>
      <P>We must realise, however, that there is another important aspect to this debate about medical insurance &ndash; the two-tier system. Medical insurance exists for those who can afford it, who can access medical provision quickly and who do not need to endure a waiting list for a hip replacement or cataract operation because we can pay. There is another side to the coin, however, and that is the people who cannot afford medical insurance and who must stay on waiting lists for indeterminate periods, sometimes up to two or three years. It is important, in a debate like this, that we do not ignore those who cannot afford health insurance and who have to wait for certain services. I refer to those who cannot afford to go to the Blackrock Clinic or the Mater Private Hospital. I am not debating the existence of private health care, but the public service should match that provided by the private sector.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We should demand equality of opportunity, which does not exist at present, for all citizens in the health service. The political will to provide equality of care, treatment, opportunity and life expectancy does not seem to exist. The fact that <Col N="118" /> 22 beds closed in the Mater Hospital today &ndash; there is a threat that another 50 will also close &ndash; is an indication of what is happening in the health services throughout the country. The medical profession has calculated that about 80,000 people will be denied care if the present problems continue for another two or three years.</P>
    <P>I would like to draw the attention of the House to the area of disability, which was the subject of a debate here last week. It is important that we reiterate and confirm our concerns in that regard. I am pleased the Minister of State, Deputy Tim O'Malley, who is responsible for disability and mental health matters, is present for this debate. I understand that he visited St. Ita's Hospital in Portrane today and I am sure it was a good experience for him. I commend him for making the effort to experience the problems on the ground. I will address this matter in greater depth in a moment.</P>
    <P>A recent reply by the Minister for Health and Children revealed that in 2001, 28,705 patients, most of whom were elderly, were readmitted to hospital within a week of being discharged. Consultants have said they are coming under unbearable pressure to discharge patients early to make room for other patients arriving from accident and emergency wards. The money saved by discharging a patient early represents a false saving, however, as an elderly person who does not receive a full cycle of treatment may have to return to hospital if his or her condition deteriorates as a result of going home too soon. A consultant who advises that a patient should receive a certain period of treatment may have to recommend an early discharge to save money. If a patient's second stay in hospital, while recovering from a relapse, lasts longer than the period of time he or she should originally have spent in hospital, the consultant's decision to send him or her home will not have saved money. A system based on such an approach is open to question. The Ministers responsible for health should look seriously at such procedures, which do not save hospital bed days.</P>
    <P>The year 2003 is European Year of People with Disabilities. It is an indictment of the Government that those for whom this is supposed to be a special year are being neglected. The budget which was passed by this House in December included a reduction of 8% in the funds provided to local authorities for the disabled person's grant. No new services have been provided for disabled persons as those planned last year will not be introduced.</P>
    <P>During the Private Members' debate on this matter last week, the Minister, Deputy Martin, said that the &ldquo;national intellectual disability database and the physical and sensory disability database are the keys to ascertaining the needs going forward.&rdquo;  The Minister was right to make this point, as knowledge is power and planning must be based on the information that is available. There is no national physical and sensory disability database at present, however, so we do not <Col N="119" /> know how many people there are with such disabilities and we do not know their needs. The Government congratulates itself by listing grandiose figures in relation to funding in this sector, which is a sham. The Government will continue to work in the dark until this information is made available. The database I have mentioned will not be compiled this year.</P>
    <P>The Midland Health Board received over 700 applications for inclusion in the assessment of needs as part of the process of compiling the physical and sensory disability database. The health board estimated that it would be able to fund an officer to co-ordinate and assess the information. The board made an appointment last year in the expectation of receiving funds this year. Although the co-ordinator is in place, the health board cannot afford to pay staff to survey the 700 people whose needs have to be assessed. This is an effect of the budget cuts.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Neville</NameTxt>
      <P>I have remarks to make about people with disabilities, who are ignored in this Bill. No extra funding is being made available for them through insurance or the budget. I do not blame the Minister of State, Deputy O'Malley, who is being denied funding to assist people with disabilities. He will not receive money from the insurance system or the Minister. The leader of the Minister of State's party told me in a letter that considerable funding was being made available to the health services and that a substantial increase of &euro;523 million has been made in the budget allocation to the Department of Health and Children. She informed me that the Minister for Health and Children would decide how the increased allocation is to be applied within the Minister of State's area of responsibility. The Minister, Deputy Martin, gave the Minister of State, Deputy O'Malley, nothing for people with disabilities.</P>
      <P>It is difficult for the Minister of State to tell the House why 1,711 people living at home who require full-time residential services will not receive them this year, given that his senior colleague did not give him a shilling to spend in this area. Similarly, 861 people who require a day service and 1,014 people who require a respite service will not obtain such services because of the lack of funding by the Minister for Health and Children. Between 30 and 40 emergencies will arise this year as a result of family problems, such as the death of a carer or parent, but the Minister of State does not have the money to deal with them.</P>
      <P>More than 400 people will come out of educational institutions and the Minister has no money to provide them with residential care. There is no point in talking to them about BUPA or the VHI because most of them cannot afford cover.</P>
      <P>Few of those with psychiatric conditions have health insurance. The Minister will be aware that Amnesty International declared in recent weeks that the Government is in breach of the Universal Declaration on Human Rights because of the poor services it is providing for mentally ill patients. It stated that the responsibility lay firmly with the Government, not the health services, health boards or any of the service providers. As the Minister of State accepted in a reply to a parliamentary question last year, the State is in fundamental breach of the human rights of those who are mentally ill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The UN Principles for the Protection of Persons with Mental Illness and for the Improvement of Mental Health Care, which were adopted in 1991, elaborate the basic rights and freedoms of <Col N="121" /> people with mental illness that must be secured if states are to be in compliance.</P>
    <P>Article 12 of the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights alludes to &ldquo;the right of everyone to the enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of physical and mental health.&rdquo;  It also identifies some of the measures states must take to achieve the full realisation of this right. Article 23 of the Convention on the Rights of the Child recognises this right for all children and identifies several steps for its realisation.</P>
    <P>Documentation on the Principles for the Protection of Persons with Mental Illness and the Improvement of Mental Health Care states:</P>
    <P>The MI Principles apply to all persons with mental illness, whether or not in in-patient psychiatric care, and to all persons admitted to psychiatric facilities, whether or not they are diagnosed as having a mental illness. They provide criteria for the determination of mental illness, protection of confidentiality, standards of care, the rights of people in mental health facilities, and the provision of resources. MI Principle 1 lays down the basic foundation upon which states' obligations towards people with mental illness are built: that &ldquo;<i>all persons with a mental illness, or who are being treated as such persons, shall be treated with humanity and respect for the inherent dignity or the human person&rdquo;, and &ldquo;shall have the right to exercise all civil, political, economic, social and cultural rights as recognised in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights and in other relevant instruments&rdquo;.</i> It also provides that <i>&ldquo;all persons have the right to the best available mental health care&rdquo;.</i>Amnesty International is the most respected international organisation on human rights and has determined that the State has been found to be in breach of the above principles. We are not providing proper rights and the best available mental health care to our patients.</P>
    <P>In addition to the UN mechanisms I have outlined, Ireland is also bound by certain human rights principles laid down by the Council of Europe. We are not complying with these either.</P>
    <P>Many people with mental illness will be best served by community based systems. We examined the mental hospitals and saw that they were overcrowded. We then reduced the number of in-patients substantially but did not provide proper community based care for those with a mental illness. For example, a 1999 study of the problem in the then Eastern Health Board area, We Have No Beds, found that the lack of community alternatives led directly to the inappropriate occupancy of almost half of the available acute beds by patients not requiring acute hospitalisation. Two thirds of the patients inappropriately occupying acute beds in the psychiatric service could have been placed elsewhere had community based residential facilities been available.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="122" />The report also found that one consequence was &ldquo;an increasing number of reports of EHB psychiatric services which had no beds for patients who were acutely ill and who needed hospitalisation&rdquo;. Another was the emergence of &ldquo;a system of borrowing beds for short-term purposes from one service by another&rdquo;, an arrangement described as &ldquo;unsatisfactory for patients, representing poor quality of service delivery to acutely ill persons&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State should note the number of geriatric patients in psychiatric hospitals, most of whom are not in need of psychiatric care. They need geriatric care and should be in an appropriate facility. The Eastern Health Board also concluded that in a subsequent Government commitment to create 850 hospital beds, none was allocated to the mental health services. Meanwhile, there have only been small advances in community alternatives to hospitalisation.</P>

      <P>In the past four years there have been significant results and record levels of activity in all the acute hospitals. A range of additional services have also been provided through the major care programmes. In the four years from 1997 to 2001 the <i>per capita</i> spend on health moved from fifth from the bottom of the EU league table to just above the EU average. The National Development Plan 2000-2006 is providing over &euro;2 billion to the health services which will benefit every major care programme. The total overall represents a trebling of investment over the last seven years.</P>
      <P>The two-tier medical service mentioned by Deputy Neville does not obtain in Dublin's acute hospitals where services are provided on the basis of need. I am in a position to make that statement as a board member of St. James's Hospital. The national health strategy sets out a programme of investment and reform that will continue over the next decade. It provides for the largest expansion of bed capacity in the history of the health service through the commissioning of an additional 709 acute hospital beds for public patients. A total of 520 of these beds were made available in 2002 and the remainder will come on stream this year.</P>

      <P>In 2002, there were 964,000 in-patient and day-patient discharges from acute hospitals. That means 2,600 patients were discharged for each day of the year which corresponds to an overall increase of 5% on the number of discharges in 2001. There was an increase of 13% in the number of day cases between 2001 and 2002. The Mater and Beaumont Hospitals are only two of five acute Dublin training hospitals. Other hospitals operate within their budgetary constraints because management, nurses, doctors and consultants work together free of the impression that there is money behind every cloud. Over the last five years, the investment in acute hospitals has led to new initiatives to improve operating theatres and equipment and to provide care for diabetics. A great many doctors, nurses and consultants have been appointed. There is a national shortage of money, but some hospitals are able to cope with their budgets while others scaremonger.</P>

      <P>I join with Deputy Neville in congratulating the VHI whose work I acknowledge. I did not realise its founder was a former Member of this House, Tom O'Higgins, to whose family I extend my sympathy on the occasion of his death. The VHI is a non-profit company which has proved most effective in providing much needed services and we owe it and the hospital administrators who work with it a debt of gratitude. It has been very good for the country. BUPA was a welcome entrant to the health insurance market and I would like to see more companies coming in.</P>

      <P>BUPA provides new services and looks at the market in a different way. It creates competition and encourages people to purchase private insurance to cover their own costs.</P>
      <P>I am in favour of community rating and risk equalisation. The insurance company must charge the same rate for a given level of service, regardless of age, sex or health status. All adult subscribers pay the same amount for the same benefits. Community rating guarantees life-long affordable health insurance for the Irish people because the young support the old and the healthy the sick. Irish people acknowledge and understand this system. Community rating has been the policy of successive Irish governments and it is supported by all parties and the public. I did not realise that Deputy Olivia Mitchell was opposed to community rating or risk equalisation.</P>

      <P>I am glad the Deputy supports it. I am also in favour of risk equalisation because of the competition in the market. It brings stability to the market. When the market steadies all the insurance companies will have the same number of claims and risk equalisation will then become unnecessary. I believe it is still very necessary at the moment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ardagh</NameTxt>
      <P>Risk equalisation is a subsidy paid by one insurer to another. Its objective is to transfer funds from insurers with better claims experience to those with a poorer claims experience because of the age and health profile of the customers. It sustains community rating by ensuring that the young and healthy support the old and sick regardless of which insurance company they join. It protects the stability of the market and discourages insurers from targeting the young and healthy. I do not like the term &ldquo;cherry-picking&rdquo; but I like the idea of BUPA entering the Irish market and encouraging new people to look after their own health insurance costs.</P>
      <P>The EU has a long-established common good principle which accepts a community rated system of health care insurance supported by risk equalisation. The third non-life directive allows Governments to require health insurers to sell policies which are community rated and to participate in risk equalisation schemes sometimes referred to as lost compensation schemes. If risk equalisation is not applied or if its application is further restricted, community rating will collapse and insurers with young members will make unfair extra profits. These profits arise because those insurers are not paying their fair share of the community's claims costs. If risk equalisation is not applied, insurers with older, less healthy customers will carry a higher share of claims, generate lower profits and face eventual collapse. We do not want to see this happen in the Irish market.</P>
      <P>Without risk equalisation, community rating is distorted; the young no longer support the old and the healthy no longer support the sick. All health insurers will target young, healthy members to the disadvantage of the older and sicker people. Health insurers with young members would make big profits while those with older members would incur big claims costs. The market becomes unstable, insurers with older members eventually go out of business, community rating collapses and premia for older and sicker members become unaffordable, putting further pressure on the public system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Both BUPA and VHI have put forward their arguments about risk equalisation. BUPA believes that risk equalisation is being pushed by the VHI because its structure guarantees it a subsidy and insulates it from competition. I believe that risk equalisation is focused on the protection of community rating and allowing the old and the sick to afford health care by offering them a pre<Col N="128" /> mium which is the same as that paid by younger members. It is hoped that risk equalisation will cause the market to become more experienced and stable and then it will no longer be necessary. BUPA also claims that risk equalisation has nothing to do with community rating. It says that it purports to equalise claims but does not attempt to equalise revenues or insurers' overheads where the monopoly has huge advantages.</P>
    <P>To encourage new insurers to come into the market, marketing and overhead costs should be taken into account in relation to the risk equalisation scheme. BUPA also argues that risk equalisation discourages new entrants into the market and creates unbearable risks for competitors. In reality a major goal of risk equalisation is to create the stable market and that will allow for real competition where the competition is in the marketing of the product.</P>
    <P>Elderly people have particular concerns about health insurance. Everyone over 70 is now entitled to a medical card so people of that age no longer have to concern themselves to any great degree with private health insurance. Older people have been very well looked after by the Government. Additional revenue funding of more than &euro;26 million has been announced for services for older people in 2003, including palliative care services and the nursing home subvention scheme with the provision of additional home helps. Improved community-based services and the services provided in community hospital and day care centres have been of great benefit to the elderly. The Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Martin, recently announced the development of the pilot public private partnership programmes for community nursing units. These developments will ultimately provide about 850 additional long-term beds. This demonstrates the commitment of the Government to health services for the elderly.</P>
    <P>I confirm to medical card holders that they will not lose their cards because of increases in social welfare rates that would put them beyond the income guidelines. Chief executive officers of health boards were asked to ensure that medical card holders and applicants were made fully aware that the increases in social welfare payments would not disadvantage them when applying to hold or retain a medical card.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Crawford</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to speak on this Bill. It deals with the issue of risk equalisation and providing funding for the Health Insurance Authority. There are many other issues which need to be dealt with. I note that the Taoiseach and others in the House recognised that the late Tom O'Higgins established the VHI when he was Minister for Health. VHI was designed to be community rated and community based so that <Col N="129" /> all ages were entitled to the same charges and treatment. That was extremely important and it has been carried on through the introduction of BUPA. We must preserve what is good but we must also allow for competition. Given our membership of the EU and the open market that exists, it worries me that after all these years only two health insurance companies operate in Ireland. It is becoming obvious that more and more people will need health insurance because of the failure of the Government to provide the services many people need.</P>
      <P>In the recent past, the Minister and the Taoiseach promised a world class health service. We heard a few weeks ago about the cutbacks in the service at Beaumont. This week we heard about the reduction in the number of beds in the Mater Hospital, which sends a shiver down the spine of those of us who care. I do not question that the Minister cares about the health of the people. What happens in Beaumont and the Mater is extremely important to people living in the Border area. While some people may have insurance cover, others have not. If fewer beds are available in hospitals such as the Mater, people on waiting lists in the more peripheral areas such as Cavan-Monaghan and along the Border will not be given the priority they deserve. The situation is more worrying in light of the fact that Monaghan General Hospital is still off-call officially. One sometimes feels it is more like a third world health service than a world class service whereby people must go in the back door rather than the front. I hope the situation in Monaghan General Hospital will be rectified sooner rather than later so that patients can have the maximum care available, either private care or public health care, whichever is relevant, as close to home as possible.</P>
      <P>Where is the logic in the North Eastern Health Board sending public patients from Monaghan to private hospitals in Mullingar when surgeons and medical staff are in place in Monaghan General Hospital?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle An Ceann Comhairle">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>I must point out to the Deputy that we are debating the Health Insurance (Amendment) Bill. While reference to the health service in general is acceptable, detailed discussion of the health service as in the health Estimate is not acceptable under the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeymourCrawford" hpid="Mr. Crawford Mr. Crawford">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crawford</NameTxt>
      <P>It is vitally important because the whole insurance issue is based on cost. VHI charges increased dramatically a short time ago. I know the Minister increased the cost of beds to the VHI by 40% or 45%, which allowed it to increase the cost to customers by 18%. That is why I am referring to the need for more competition so that there will be a better insurance price structure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I must tell a short story in relation to the VHI increase. I received a letter from an aged couple who are members of the VHI and who benefited from the equalisation clause. What really annoyed them was that while VHI costs increased <Col N="130" /> by 18%, they received a bill for a private ambulance from their home in north Monaghan to Dublin at a cost of 3.5 cent per kilometer. Two and a half years earlier, a health board ambulance transported his wife from the same area to Cavan hospital on two occasions at a cost of ten cent per kilometer, three times more. One must ask how the VHI can sustain these charges from health boards and remain in business? This issue must be looked into in detail because it is not justified. I raised the question at the time. Luckily, some people got medical cards approximately 18 months ago on the instigation of the Minister. That scheme cost &euro;52 million rather than the projected &euro;90 million. Given the state of the health service, some people who opted out of the VHI are extremely sorry. Patients have not received the medical service they expected under the scheme.</P>
    <P>That leads me to the issue of subvention. If we are serious about the health service, we must ensure people are moved out of hospitals to curtail costs as much as possible. People must be allowed into nursing homes if there are vacancies. The only way this can happen is if subvention is made available. I asked the Minister a general question and I received some replies from health boards. However, the reality is that there is a waiting list for subvention in the North Eastern Health Board area and people do not receive it when they need it. This is a desperate situation. It is costing insurance companies much more because people who could be cared for in nursing homes are being retained in hospital beds. I heard someone speak on radio about the situation in Beaumont and a nursing home operator rang saying she had 53 beds lying idle in Swords. These would cost approximately as much per week as Beaumont would cost per day. These matters must be looked at if we are to try to maintain insurance costs at a realistic level. Is it cost-effective to export patients for treatment? While Monaghan General Hospital may be able to perform minor surgery only, is it cost-effective to send patients to England for treatment, including paying for their family to go with them? I am not sure how that can be justified in this day and age.</P>
    <P>In November 2001, someone close to me was extremely ill with ear problems. She could not even touch the side of her head and was rushed to Drogheda, where they promised to put her on an emergency waiting list. She went privately afterwards and received a letter the other day stating that she could be dealt with under the special scheme of going abroad. That notice took from November 2001 to March 2003. That person was extremely ill and recognised as such by a specialist in Drogheda hospital. We must be realistic in regard to the health area and minimise costs. Several Deputies on the Minister's side referred to the generous budget. I am not arguing about the budget. Some &euro;9.2 billion is a huge sum of money but the problem lies with how it is spent. Fine Gael will support any savings in the system as long as patients receive a good service.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FergusODowdFG" hpid="Mr. O'Dowd Mr. O'Dowd">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dowd</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a very important debate. I would like to identify some areas where I believe insurance needs are greater than are currently met in terms of our system of organisation. Medical cards in themselves are an insurance policy against medical costs. People with medical cards who are ill, particularly those who are seriously ill, can meet their doctors' fees, the costs of prescriptions and so on. If one happens to be a politician or whatever, one can afford to meet his or her medical costs. One can also afford VHI or BUPA payments. However, a significant number do not fit into either category. Generally, they earn the average industrial wage, yet they cannot afford to pay for the long-term treatment of illnesses, such as asthma, or frequent visits to doctors.</P>
      <P>When the economy is doing well the percentage of those in receipt of medical cards drops, as has happened in the last few years. In the past three or four years, the numbers in receipt of cards in the North Eastern Health Board dropped by 4% or 5%. There is an agreement between the health boards and the medical profession to the effect that greater numbers will be treated without the necessity to renegotiate their contracts. This means that agreement can be reached on treating those on low income who cannot afford the cost of health insurance and who are ineligible for the receipt of medical cards. This aspect should be addressed as a matter of urgency.</P>
      <P>In compiling a recent risk management consultant's report on the problems in the North Eastern Health Board, with particular reference to the Cavan-Monaghan hospital group, interviews were conducted with staff who said that private patients were being admitted for treatment to the hospitals through the accident and emergency units and that this discriminated against those who were not private patients. Access to health care should depend on need and there should not be a back door for private patients. That should be addressed. Will the Minister indicate if he has seen the report and, if so, will he outline his views on it?</P>
      <P>Many people in hospital need time to convalesce in nursing homes. I understand that the VHI provides cover for such care for up to two weeks or slightly longer. However, many patients need to spend a longer period of time convalescing. Given the changes in society, where extended family support is no longer available, those leaving hospital who are not well enough to go home often do not have adequate insurance to cover the full extent of their convalescent stay in a nursing home. This aspect must be addressed in the interests of the insured person.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Approximately two weeks ago, 14 people in acute hospital beds in County Louth who were not well enough to go home and needed convalescent care, were unable to get the local health board to process their application for subvention because it was restricted by the amount of money it had spent on subvention in the previous year. They were holding up acute hospital beds <Col N="132" /> because they were unable to fund the gap between what their insurance provided and the nursing home required. This is a serious issue and it must be addressed.</P>
    <P>There is a need to consider nursing home care in the long-term. Those availing of private health cover should be encouraged to pay for such care from an early age so that the cost can be spread over many years. This type of cover should be kept separate from the other types of cover provided by private health insurers, whether it be for acute illness or whatever. Over the coming years, many more people will live to a greater age and they will be required to spend much more time in nursing homes than is the case at present. There is no insurance provision for this contingency. It means that people must save or invest in their homes as a form of insurance policy. It is time that direct insurance cover was provided to cover this aspect. When people do not have the cash or the cover to pay for such long-term care, the health boards will liquidate their assets, which in many cases is their own home. While I accept that people must pay for their care, this type of arrangement often deprives children of their parents' family home. This aspect must be addressed. I commend the Bill and look forward to the Minister's reply.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelRing" hpid="Mr. Ring Mr. Ring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ring</NameTxt>
      <P>When the House returns from the St. Patrick's Day break, it must hold an extended debate, over two or three days, on health. It would give Deputies the time to address all the issues and the Minister the opportunity to advise the House on what is happening. There has been an assumption among VHI and BUPA policy holders that they would receive immediate hospital treatment, but that no longer applies.</P>
      <P>Is the Minister concerned about BUPA's complaint to the EU Commission on risk equalisation? What are the implications if the Commission rules against the Government? I support the Minister's position on the VHI. We cannot allow insurance companies to target those who are least at risk, such as the young. We must ensure that insurance cover is provided to all age groups. In view of this, I support the legislation. While we may criticise the VHI, it must be acknowledged it has done excellent work in providing insurance cover. All necessary measures should be implemented to protect its position in this country.</P>
      <P>I live in the Western Health Board area and am my party's deputy spokesperson on health. Will the Minister explain why last July, the board declared it had a budget deficit of &euro;16.6 million, yet at the end of this year it emerged with a surplus of &euro;8 million? It implies that the board saved &euro;24 million in one year at a time when there were cutbacks across all services. It is indicative that something is wrong with the country's health services.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It may now be time to choose between public and private hospitals. Consultants may have to be paid more, provided all their work is done for <Col N="133" /> public hospitals. The State may have to make an investment in private hospitals to get them up and running. Perhaps we should forget about insurance altogether and have one hospital system where people are called according to need whether they have insurance. Maybe we should try to start at the beginning in regard to health.</P>
    <P>I have listened to the debate, as has the Minister. In regard to health boards, we have created a monster that has got out of hand. There was never as much money spent on health, yet the crisis was never greater than in the past few months. Something has gone wrong. There are bed managers and all sorts of managers running the health service. The time has come to get rid of the health board and consultants. The Minister laughed at me three years ago when I said that it should all be scrapped and he should start again at the beginning. We might have had three or four years of hardship but we would at least take control of the health service again. The people might then appreciate what we are trying to do.</P>
    <P>What have we done instead? We have created bigger monsters with the health boards, programme managers and bed managers etc. I asked a parliamentary question recently about the number of people employed in my area's health board. The number of jobs that have been created is phenomenal but things are not happening on the ground. People cannot get the services they need. We have seen this in regard to BreastCheck. In the next couple of weeks we will have to take to the streets to demand services. BreastCheck is available in certain parts of the country but not in the west. All that is needed to deal with the situation is &euro;15 million. What is &euro;15 million when compared with the Minister's overall budget in the Department of Health and Children?</P>
    <P>The situation now is that there is a problem regardless of whether people are insured. Somebody must take on the problem and deal with it. We can be critical on this side of the House. I listened to Deputy Ardagh and I would only love to send a copy of his speech to his constituents. If I did, he would not dare stand in the next county council election, not to mind a Dáil election, because those constituents would wipe him off the ground. I must say that about this sort of hypocrisy in defence of the Government.</P>
    <P>I have nothing against the Minister as a person. He is a fine guy and does his best but he has lost control. That is not his fault. His predecessors have helped the situation get to this stage. We have taken too much power from this House and given it to people outside who are not answerable to anybody. Last year the Minister, at least, went before the interview board which gave him the best vote in the country. He can be judged again in four years' time. The Minister will have to make a judgment on the chief executive of the Western Health Board in a short time. I hope he makes the correct judgment. I will not advise him what judgment he should make but if I was in his position I know that&mdash;</P>

      <P>No, I am full of energy. The proposals in the legislation are technical. The point I want to make relates to health insurance. Is it worthwhile any more, considering the health service we have? I listen to people who are waiting for procedures and who have paid their dues to VHI and BUPA but who cannot get the services they need. This country has got it right in regard to health insurance in spite of complaints to Europe and elsewhere. The Minister must make sure health insurance is available to everybody. We do not want to have a situation such as exists in other insurance areas where the cream is taken and the rest are left.</P>
      <P>It is a bit like roads and services, like Luas and other services. Dublin gets the services but rural Ireland does not. There is nothing wrong with subsidising services for people who need services. There is nothing wrong with the State supporting and assisting the VHI.

      <P>There is a major crisis in the health service and we need debate on it. The people are outraged by what is going on.

Will he take on the health boards and will he provide a service of which the people can be proud? </P>
      <P>Every night on the media we hear of the crisis. The people working in the service are under pressure and cannot stick it any longer.

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank all the Deputies who contributed to this debate. It was a broad and informative discussion that sometimes moved across the broad canvas of health issues. I will deal with some points raised by Deputies at the outset of the debate. Deputy Mitchell was critical of the risk equalisation provision. Risk equalisation is not a penalty on an insurer. It is an equity measure for the benefit of the whole market. It has been examined <Col N="135" /> thoroughly by a number of bodies, including the Society of Actuaries who found it is an essential concomitant to community rating. Various parties in the House have supported the concept of risk equalisation.</P>
      <P>In regard to the question of the HIA's powers being limited by the change to section 12 (4) of the Principal Act, I want to clarify that the amendment was sought at the request of the HIA itself. The HIA has specific powers under the Principal Act to give advice to the Minister on matters relating to its functions under section 21 of the 1994 Act. It also has specific powers under section 11 of the 2001 Act in regard to reporting on the operation of risk equalisation with respect to its effects on the interests of health insurance consumers once transfers have commenced. It is obliged to make annual reports to the Minister on the operation of risk equalisation and the Minister is obliged to lay such reports before the Oireachtas. The provision of this Bill does not affect that section.</P>
      <P>The risk equalisation scheme will, in the first instance, only require data returns to be made by insurers. It will not require the making of financial transfers initially. Any commencement of financial transfers are a matter in which the Health Insurance Authority will be critically involved. The 2001 Act sets out its functions in detail in this regard and it does not subordinate the Minister's wishes. I wish to make that clear to Deputy Mitchell. Inefficiencies will not be transferred as the scheme is designed so that insurers retain their own average cost per claim. Insurers are not fully compensated for claims, therefore the scheme does not incentivise claims.</P>
      <P>Deputy Mitchell was concerned about the impact of risk equalisation. The measure envisaged is moderate and balanced. The effect of any commencement of risk equalisation under the proposed scheme will be to make financial transfers, via the Health Insurance Authority, from insurers with a better than average risk profile to insurers with a worse than average risk profile. This will leave the former with an outcome which more closely reflects what the experience would have been if they had a more equitable share of the market risk. It thereby supports the application and stability of community rating across the insured community as a whole. Only the insurers' age and gender profiles will be adjusted to reflect the market experience. Other key cost drivers such as numbers covered, benefits promised and claims management will remain unchanged.</P>
      <P>Risk equalisation affects the equitable sharing of risk profiles between insurers by replacing an insurer's own profile with the market average profile within defined agents and their gender bands. Looking at risk equalisation on an agent-gender basis it is evident that its impact on the key drivers underlying an insurer's own claims experience is no more than is appropriate and proportionate in a community rated market.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="136" />Deputy McManus raised a number of key issues. The amendment on the exemption from risk equalisation is precautionary. The possible difficulty was identified during the course of detailed consultations with the Health Insurance Authority on the development of a detailed scheme. The Bill provides for an extension of the Act with regard to immunity for the Health Insurance Authority. This was specifically sought to enable it to undertake its independent functions under the Act and scheme to be introduced. The highlighting of this matter followed the establishment of the authority and consultations with it. I welcome the Deputy's support for the need for risk equalisation to support community rating.</P>
    <P>Deputy Connolly welcomed the Bill and his supportive comments on community rating and risk equalisation were noted. Deputy Cowley was critical of the role of private health care within our system. Private health insurance has been an important element of overall hospital care provision since it was introduced by the late Tom O'Higgins in 1957 and due regard and credit has been paid this evening to the important decision that was taken at that time. Allowing individuals to provide financially for their own health care needs has the impact of displacing demand on the public health system. However, it needs to be pointed out that there has been a massive increase in the level of public investment in health over recent years.</P>
    <P>Many comments were made during Second Stage about the general health system and the issue that emerged today in regard to the Mater Hospital. There have been significant increases in health spending. The health portfolio does not just involve the hospitals, it has a broad remit. Over the past five years there have been almost unprecedented levels of funding under every heading, particularly in areas that were starved of funding in the past, such as mental health, disability and child care. Previously these areas had never received a decent allocation of funding. There has also been a significant increase in the funding of the acute hospital system in the past two to three years since we devised the strategies to improve their status.</P>
    <P>Cumulatively since 1987, some &euro;400 million has been invested in the area of cancer care. In reply to Deputy Ring and other Deputies, we are improving the quality of care for cancer patients. The quality of cancer care today is far superior to anything we experienced five or ten years ago. The number of procedures has increased dramatically in all hospitals, as has the number of professional consultants dealing specifically with cancer issues over the past four years. We can talk the health system into a crisis as long as we want but those facts cannot be dismissed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not making those points in an argumentative way but in an objective, factual way.</P>
      <P>Heart disease is one of the biggest health issues in the country and the Government decided to target such issues in a strategic way. Ultimately it is only by tackling the big killers in the country that, in time, we can reduce mortality rates. That is the ultimate measurement of the success of the investment over the past five years &ndash; the dividend in regard to a reduction in morbidity from heart disease and cancer which are the two big killers. Time will show that a significant degree of that investment has been well made and effective.</P>
      <P>It is also important to point out &ndash; and I share Deputy Ring's concerns &ndash; that there are major reform packages coming down the tracks. There are also major reports nearing completion which will be brought to Government and to this House for subsequent discussion. I would welcome a wide-ranging debate on health. Perhaps the Oireachtas can look at the issue collectively.</P>
      <P>There are issues pertaining to how budgets are managed. In 1996 the rainbow Government introduced the accountability legislation into this House, which we supported and continue to support to try and bring some kind of accountability, certainty and consistency to the service &ndash; and that applies to all of the major agencies, health boards and hospitals. The legislation provided for a first charge on the subsequent year if one went over budget, which can create a difficulty, as has happened this year with some of the hospitals in the Dublin region where there was significant overruns on last year, despite the fact that last year's increase was well over &euro;1 billion.</P>
      <P>This year, after the publication of the revised volume of Estimates, we were faced with another increase in health spending of some 12%, which is significantly higher than the original November Estimate. One may well ask why that is the case. Benchmarking has now kicked in. The benchmarking bill alone for health this year is well over &euro;200 million, and that is only the first 25% or maybe the arrears. I will check those figures. There is another pay agreement for the intellectual disability sector. We have gone up to about &euro;970 million extra in health spending this year alone, the bulk of which is going into pay. People are popping up everywhere saying they did not get enough. A 12% increase is way ahead of any other European country in terms of investment in public health, particularly in a tight fiscal year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have invested significantly in the public sector. Some Deputies, including Deputy Ring, raised the issue of whether we should concentrate on the public health service and forget about private health insurance. The bottom line is that the public health service has said it does not have the capacity to cope with additional numbers. There is not a hospital in the Dublin region that has not had significant capital funds allocated to <Col N="138" /> it for major infrastructural work. The Mater Hospital itself, in conjunction with Temple Street Hospital, is the largest investment project in the country under the health aspect of the national development plan. Due cognisance should be taken of these developments and commitments.</P>
    <P>Last August dire consequences were predicted all over the country with deficits of up to &euro;16 million, much of which did not materialise. I said that at the time, but no one believed me. There were headlines everywhere. Last Sunday one radio programme raised that specific issue.</P>

      <P>I am not talking about specifics. The system tends to react in certain ways in terms of issues arising. I am not saying for a moment that there will not be difficulties this year. There will be, but the knee-jerk response of saying the world is going to collapse is not a sustainable approach to take. In difficult times, one manages by prioritising. Irrespective of what the financial allocations are this year, there is no reason any of the key specialties should be affected. I refer to cancer, where we have invested additional funding, cardiology which should not involve any cutbacks in service and renal services which should not be curtailed anywhere in the country. These are life and death issues and we are satisfied they will be protected in the allocation we have made. We need to take a measured and balanced approach to the issue in what I agree will be a difficult year. I am not disputing that for a moment. Neither am I going to respond to people who forecast the collapse of the system every day.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusHealy" hpid="Mr. Healy Mr. Healy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Healy</NameTxt>
      <P>The original text of the Adjournment motion read as follows:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The need for Dáil Éireann to discuss why south Tipperary was not included in the spatial strategy programme and for a commitment to be given that the county be included in the <Col N="139" /> decentralisation programme to be announced shortly.</P>
    <P>The text has been changed by the questions office, but I feel that the lack of our inclusion in the spatial strategy and decentralisation are matters that are vitally interlinked and I will refer to both in the time I have to speak on this matter.</P>
    <P>County Tipperary was excluded from the spatial strategy. That decision is difficult to understand but it becomes more unbelievable when one reads the spatial strategy documents, particularly the figures set out on page 40 in regard to the characteristics of gateways and hubs. County Tipperary did not expect to qualify for inclusion under gateway status but we were hopeful that we would have been included under hub status, particularly the town of Clonmel. This would have had the effect of radiating economic growth throughout the county to places such as Carrick-on-Suir and Tipperary town, which have been designated as deprived areas of high unemployment and have been included in the RAPID programme.</P>
    <P>The spatial strategy document outlines the criteria for hub towns, all of which are met by the town of Clonmel. First, a hub town must have a significant urban population of between 20,000 and 40,000, set in an associated rural hinterland. This describes Clonmel. Second, a hub town must have primary and secondary education facilities with the option of third level or outreach facilities. Clonmel has excellent primary and secondary education and has a third level facility, the Tipperary Institute, which has been opened for a number of years. Third, a hub town must have a mix of local medium-sized and larger businesses serving local, regional and national-international markets. Clonmel qualifies here. Some very large industries, including Guidant, a medical plant with 1,200 employees, Showerings Ireland, Merck, Sharp and Dohme and a host of other industries, large and small, are located in Clonmel.</P>
    <P>Fourth, a hubtown must be an important node in transportation and communication terms on the national road, rail and bus networks. Again, Clonmel qualifies. It is situated on the N24, the Limerick to Rosslare national primary route, and on the railway line from Limerick to Rosslare. Fifth, there must be an effective local transport system with facilities for pedestrians and cyclists. Clonmel qualifies here. Sixth, there must be a local and/or regional hospital. A significant expansion programme costing &euro;20 million is being carried out at St. Joseph's Hospital, Clonmel. Seventh, a hub town must have a wide range of sporting and cultural facilities including public parks and open spaces. Clonmel qualifies again. Eighth, there must be effective water services and waste management arrangements.</P>
    <P>Clonmel should have been included in the spatial strategy. Now that it has not we want a commitment that the decentralisation programme will include the towns of Tipperary and Carrick-on-<Col N="140" /> Suir. These are two towns which are deeply deprived and have levels of unemployment which are three times the national average. I ask for a commitment from the Government that a significant decentralisation measure will be announced for these two towns in the very near future.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatTheCope" hpid="Mr. Gallagher Mr. Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment and Local Government (Mr. Gallagher)</NameTxt>
      <P>During the course of the previous Dáil the issue of decentralisation was frequently raised. It was of particular concern to Deputy Healy and to many other Deputies. The issue is of keen interest to many, if not all, Members. The Government is supportive of decentralisation and I am particularly pleased to have the opportunity to address the issue this evening.</P>
      <P>The Government's commitment to introducing a new programme of decentralisation is evident in the commitment made in An Agreed Programme for Government, in which we undertook to move forward the progressive decentralisation of Government offices and agencies, taking into account the national spatial strategy, which is aimed at ensuring that all regions develop to their potential.</P>
      <P>It has been clear from the outset, and the Minister for Finance has reiterated in this House on many occasions of late in reply to parliamentary questions put down by a number of Deputies, that there is a wide range of important issues which must be taken into consideration before arriving at a decision. I appreciate that a new programme of decentralisation would be a matter of great significance and I trust the House will appreciate why the Government is determined that a decision should be taken only after proper deliberation. Few issues in the last Dáil generated as much interest as a new programme of decentralisation and it appears that it will be just as relevant in this Dáil.</P>
      <P>Given its importance and the level of interest in the issue, consideration of the many and varied issues involved has necessarily taken longer than originally envisaged. Some 120 urban centres throughout every county have expressed interest in being part of the new programme, with each case receiving consideration. It has been necessary to consult widely with staff interests, departmental management and so on. I share the Minister's concern that the deliberation which precedes a major decision such as this should reflect the genuine concerns of all those who will be affected by a new and comprehensive programme, be they staff concerned about their future or departmental management concerned about the delivery of the public services for which they have responsibility.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government is particularly determined that any large scale programme should do nothing to compromise the efficient delivery of public services and, to that end, the Government has invited the SMI implementation group to contribute its views as to the most efficient way to proceed. These views will be of considerable <Col N="141" /> assistance in informing the Government's decision.</P>
    <P>The Minister is conscious of the calls made upon him and other members of the Government to use the vehicle of decentralisation to address job losses in various parts of the country. Like many others, I appreciate the concerns of Deputy Healy in this regard but I know he will realise that there is a host of factors which will influence the Government's decision on the subject. The process is not as simple as listing off a series of qualifying criteria against which the merits of various towns can be measured.</P>
    <P>The case for the inclusion of south Tipperary has been well articulated and a huge effort has gone into the preparation and presentation of a number of cases in respect of various towns throughout the constituency. The efforts of so many in this regard deserve appreciation and I pay tribute to all concerned.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately, I cannot and will not confirm that any one town or area is to be included as a definite part of the new programme. The Government is committed to developing a coherent and comprehensive programme. To make any announcement at this time would only serve to undermine this approach.</P>
    <P>I thank Deputy Healy for raising this topical issue, which is of great interest inside and outside this House. I am pleased to have had the opportunity to restate the Government's position.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dowd</NameTxt>
      <P>I will read from a letter to the Taoiseach:</P>
      <P>Dear Mr. Ahern,</P>
      <P>I am a father of five girls aged between six and 12, all attending Scoil Mhuire Fatima, Dublin Road, Drogheda. You may recall visiting that school a little over 12 months ago. At the time you were very happy to shake everybody's hand and smile for the cameras, as you had an upcoming election. You were also happy to tell us how the new school that we had been promised for so many years was as good as started.</P>
      <P>This is a letter from a parent, David Maher, who e-mailed the Taoiseach last week, following a meeting in Drogheda.</P>
      <P>More than 400 children attend the school, which is in a disgraceful condition, having been built in the mid-19th century. At that time the rooms were adequate. The construction was of wood and fire safety was not an issue. The school has lasted well but it has played its part in the education of the children of Drogheda.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When the Taoiseach visited the school and saw what was happening there and the Minister, Deputy Dermot Ahern, Deputy Kirk and a bevy of Fianna Fáil candidates and their entourage visited the school and paraded up and down before the general election last year, the parents and children of Scoil Mhuire Fatima believed a new school was around the corner. This, however, is a <Col N="142" /> school around the corner which will not be built if this Administration continues as it is. A new school will not be built unless the Minister looks at this matter with sincerity and determination.</P>
    <P>The question of fire hazard is the biggest problem the children face. Everyone is concerned about the safety aspect and the fire hazard that the building presents. I understand the fire officer visited the school today. I told the parents last week they had got to get the fire officers in to inspect the school because in the event of a fire they would regret not having taken it to this stage. They would be happy if the Taoiseach, or his brother, the Minister of State, were to return to see how deeply people are concerned about what happens. One of their other concerns is that the children have to go out of the school and walk along the main Dublin-Belfast road to change classrooms. One of the playgrounds and two classrooms are leased and will no longer be available to the school from next year.</P>
    <P>This is no way to look at the future of education in Drogheda. The Minister and his Department must do something about this school. It is not good enough to say they can spend some money on addressing some of the issues such as the electrical wiring which is so badly needed, the fact is the building has to be condemned for a modern school.</P>
    <P>The parents cannot meet in the hall at night because it is dangerous. During the general election it was used as a polling booth but when one walked down the steps into the front of the school there was no handrail and the pavement was cracked. The entrance had to be closed as it was too dangerous for people. This meant that elderly people and others had to walk around the back of the school, over an uneven surface.</P>
    <P>The position is clear. Promises have been made and have been broken badly by the Government. The last line of the letter states:</P>
    <P>Do not wait, Taoiseach, until there is a terrible tragedy and you have to console family members of dead little girls. Combustible materials and hazardous wiring just do not mix. Taoiseach, you would not send your daughters to this school. Don't make us.</P>
    <P>That speaks for itself.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment and Local Government (Mr. N. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy O'Dowd has given me the opportunity of outlining to the House the Department of Education and Science's current position regarding the allocation of funding for schools building projects.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The 2003 capital programme has now been published and full details of individual projects are available on the Department's website. The programme is designed to give the maximum amount of information to managers, boards of management, principals, parents and students. The criteria used for selecting projects has also been published for the first time. That is sup<Col N="143" /> posed to be a fair, professional and independent process.</P>
    <P>This year's building programme amounts to &euro;342.9 million, four times the amount allocated six years ago in 1997. The 2003 programme will deliver over 140 large-scale projects at primary and post-primary level. In addition, over 400 schools will benefit in some way from the capital programme and, of course, all primary schools benefit directly from the devolved grants scheme for minor works.</P>
    <P>The budgetary allocation for 2004 and subsequent years will determine the rate of progress on projects at schools currently in architectural planning and at other schools such as Scoil Mhuire Fatima that have not yet commenced the architectural planning process. It is obvious there are a number of other schools awaiting approval before this particular school gets to the first line of approvals.</P>
    <P>The management authorities at individual schools should continue to use funds from their devolved grant to deal with any urgent health and safety matters.</P>
    <P>I have heard what the Deputy had to say. I am standing in for the Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Noel Dempsey, and I shall convey to him the Deputy's comments in relation to the school.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>With all due respect to the Minister of State, Deputy Noel Ahern, I hope I will not get the standard reply. The matter I wish to raise concerns a school which is in danger of losing its insurance if repairs are not carried out. The principal of St. Kieran's boys national school, Galvone, Limerick, went public on the local and national media over a week ago because of the appalling conditions in the school and because the insurance company concerned said it could not guarantee to continue to insure the school. There are problems with a leaking roof, subsiding floors, leaking toilets, large holes in the school yard and a heating system that is so bad it had to close three times in this school year in October, January and February. While the school's conditions are appalling it is a wonderful school in other ways and is in the green school programme. I have visited the school a few times and it has a fabulous morale. With the exception of the building, this is a very good school.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The principal decided to go public because he was concerned about his duty of providing an education to the children and if the insurance was pulled he could not do that. He could not keep the school open if there was no insurance. It is an indication of how bad some schools are that the insurance company concerned, which is a reputable company and insures most schools in the country, had to threaten to withdraw support. The principal also had to go to the Health and <Col N="144" /> Safety Authority because he was concerned about some of the conditions in the school.</P>
    <P>I tabled a written question about this school two weeks ago. I understand that since then officials from the Department of Education and Science have visited the school and have acknowledged the seriousness of the problems. I understand there is the possibility of amalgamating with a girls' school which is close by. The boards of management of both schools are willing to consider all possibilities, including amalgamation, as an answer to the problem because they have to maintain the school whether on the current site, which is totally unsuitable and would need about &euro;2 million to put it into proper condition, and the &euro;20,000 being offered this year will go nowhere in terms of the seriousness of the problem.</P>
    <P>I am not trying to be negative in the sense that there may be a solution that would work for St. Kieran's boys national school and the girls' school which is close by. It is essential that the urgency of this case is recognised by the Minister and the Department as the school may not get insurance. I ask for a guarantee of uninterrupted education for the pupils of St. Kieran's boys national school, Galvone, irrespective of the solution. In recent months the problems of many schools have been highlighted both here and outside the House because of terrible conditions of one kind or another. This school is probably unique in that the insurance company has said it is so bad that it is a meaningless exercise to list the defects and that it is sufficient to state that the building is not suitable for use as a school.</P>
    <P>In view of the condition of the school and the need for continuing education for these boys, I urge the Minister of State to convey the urgency of the situation to the Minister for Education and Science.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelAhern" hpid="Mr. N. Ahern Mr. N. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy O'Sullivan has said more or less what is contained in the reply. I shall convey her remarks to the Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Noel Dempsey. The 2003 capital programme has been published and full details on individual projects are available on the Department's website. The programme is designed to give the maximum amount of information to managers, boards of management, parents and students. One of the new features is that the criteria used for selecting projects has also been published. Given that it is supposed to be done on a professional it is extraordinary there are so many complaints and that school authorities are of the view that the system is not choosing the correct schools.</P>
      <P>This years building programme amounts to &euro;342.9 million, four times the amount allocated six years ago. The 2003 programme will deliver over 140 large-scale projects. In addition, over 400 schools will benefit in some way from the capital programme and, of course, all primary schools benefit directly from the devolved grants scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Officials from the Department of Education <Col N="145" /> and Science recently visited St. Kieran's national school and advised that they consider the best way forward for the provision of improved accommodation for St. Kieran's is by way of amalgamation with the Presentation national school, Galvone. It is the Department's view that the Presentation national school building has, with some internal alterations, sufficient capacity to cater for the amalgamated school.</P>
    <P>The Department of Education and Science has advised the schools that it is prepared to provide some grant aid towards the cost of these internal alterations on the basis of the amalgamation proceeding without delay. The health and safety situation in St. Kieran's national school will, in the meantime, be a matter for the board of management. The Deputy outlined the way forward. This project can go ahead with reasonable speed provided the amalgamation process is agreed. I will relay the Deputy's remarks to the Minister.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. F. McGrath</NameTxt>
      <P>I am grateful for the opportunity to raise this important local and national issue which relates to the high insurance premiums and the need for a computer room at Árd Scoil Rís, Griffith Avenue, Dublin 9.</P>
      <P>Last night I had the privilege of meeting with the principal, staff and parents' council at Ard Scoil Rís. I was immediately impressed by the partnership approach of the school. Here we had a classic example of parents and teachers working together in the interests of their pupils. They have a genuine interest in Irish education and a vision for the future. The first item of concern was the high insurance premium of &euro;24,000 per annum. This is too high and totally unfair on the school. It is a major dent in the school's budget. I call on the Minister to intervene and assist Ard Scoil Rís with the cost of its insurance.</P>
      <P>Parents' councils should not be about raising money for basics in education. Services such as heat, light, insurance and wages should come from the Department of Education and Science. Parents' councils should exist to assist by way of fund raising projects for school extras.</P>
      <P>The Minister and the Department have a duty to properly fund schools and to do something about the discrimination against schools like Árd Scoil Rís which are affiliated to religious orders. Community, comprehensive and vocational schools do not have to pay such insurance as it is paid by the Department. This is not fair and is simply not good enough. Parents and taxpayers are tired of this unfair situation. I hope the Minister of State will provide me with a positive response on what the Department is going to do in this regard. I am looking for sensible and practical proposals of assistance for Árd Scoil Rís.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I urge the Tanáiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Harney, and the Cabinet to consider fast-tracking the insurance reform proposals and to bring legislation before the House so that we can reduce insurance costs <Col N="146" /> for schools such as Árd Scoil Rís which need support and finance now. I call on the Minister to do something for the school.</P>
    <P>The second issue of major concern for the parents' council of Ard Scoil Rís is the urgent need for a computer room. This request should be implemented immediately. IT and computers are a way of the future and, in the long-term, the development of our economy. There is no doubt that in this IT age no school can claim to give a comprehensive or adequate education without access to computer facilities. This excellent school has the software, hardware and trained personnel needed but does not have a room to house its IT department. The estimated cost of such a room is approximately &euro;200,000. Funding to develop an educational service for its pupils is urgently required. This is a disgrace and something must be done. I call on the Minister and the Department to deliver financial aid towards insurance costs at Árd Scoil Rís and a grant to develop its computer room.</P>
    <P>This issue is part of the engine room of Irish education services and the future of Irish education. I urge the Minister to assist Árd Scoil Rís now.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelAhern" hpid="Mr. N. Ahern Mr. N. Ahern">

      <P>I am glad the Deputy has given me the opportunity of outlining to the House the position of the Department of Education and Science regarding the allocation of current funding to second level schools, including Árd Scoil Rís, Griffith Avenue, Dublin 9, to meet the cost of insurance. I am also glad to have the opportunity to address the provision of a computer room at the school.</P>
      <P>School insurance arrangements have evolved in a manner that reflects the different traditions and structures of the voluntary secondary, comprehensive, community and VEC sectors. In the case of voluntary secondary schools, it is a matter for the managerial authorities of individual schools to negotiate and arrange insurance cover on school property and against public liability. Grant aid towards voluntary secondary school costs are provided by the Department of Education and Science by way of <i>per capita</i> grants which may be used for this purpose.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the case of vocational schools and colleges, the relevant vocational education committee arranges insurance cover. With regard to community and comprehensive schools, the State provides a general indemnity to the authorities of these schools in lieu of their taking out insurance cover against liabilities which may arise. Since 1997, the Government has made significant improvements in the level of funding to voluntary secondary schools. For example, the standard <i>per capita</i> grant in 1997 was &euro;224.74. This has been increased to &euro;266.49 in the current school year. A capitation grant of &euro;133,778 will issue to Árd Scoil Rís in the current school year. In addition, under the school services support initiative, second level schools have benefited from further significant increases in the support grant from <Col N="147" />&euro;25.40 per pupil in 2000 to &euro;99 per pupil during the current school year.</P>
    <P>Further improvements introduced by the Government include a range of equalisation measures designed to reduce historic anomalies in the funding arrangements for the different school types at second level. Under the terms of a recent equalisation measure, the support services grant was further increased by &euro;28 per pupil with effect from September 2002. This brought the support services grant for secondary schools to &euro;116.88 per pupil from September 2002 and to &euro;127 per pupil from 1 January 2003. This increase is in addition to the range of equalisation grants of up to &euro;15,554 per school or, &euro;44.44 per pupil per annum, which was approved for secondary schools in December 2001. In total, Ard Scoil Rís will receive &euro;77,467 under the school services support fund in 2002-03. A grant of &euro;22,220 will also issue in respect of secretary and caretaker grants under the PESP scheme.</P>
    <P>For a school with 500 pupils, this amounts to extra funding of up to &euro;100,000 per annum and annual grants of &euro;236,761 towards general expenses and support services, including insurance costs. This amounts to more than &euro;255,811 in the case of disadvantaged schools.</P>
    <P>In addition to the level of current funding detailed above, I can further report to the House <Col N="148" /> that the Department of Education and Science recently provided capital funding of over &euro;66,000 for works at Árd Scoil Rís. These works were necessary to ensure continuance of insurance cover at the school.</P>
    <P>With regard to the provision of a computer room at the school, an application in this matter is currently under consideration in the planning section of the Department of Education and Science. Consistent with normal practice, an examination of all relevant issues is being undertaken with a view to determining the long-term accommodation needs of the school. This analysis, when complete, together with the school's long-term projected enrolment, will provide a basis for making a decision on the school's request.</P>
    <P>The 2003 schools building programme has been published and is available on the Department's website at www.education.ie. Given the level of financial commitments to be met from projects already in construction, I do not envisage that the Department of Education and Science will be in a position during this year to initiate architectural planning for further building projects, including the provision of a computer room at Árd Scoil Rís. This matter can, of course, be considered in next year's capital programme. I will pass on the Deputy's comments to the Minister.</P>
    <P>The Dáil adjourned at 10.30 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Wednesday, 12 March 2003.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. Brennan Mr. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Transport (Mr. Brennan)</NameTxt>
      <P>An Agreed Programme for Government establishes a number of commitments in relation to taxi services, including a specific commitment to continue the process of making taxis wheelchair accessible. On 19 November, acting on another of the commitments in the programme, the Government approved the establishment of the office of the national taxi regulator and a taxi advisory commission, initially on a non-statutory basis, pending the development of legislative proposals.</P>
      <P>The preparation of the necessary legislation is proceeding as a matter of urgency in my Department with a view to the formal establishment of a commission for taxi regulation and a taxi advisory council. The role envisaged for the commission includes the setting of national standards of entry into the industry, standards for taxi, hackney and limousine vehicles, including the implementation of the proposed wheelchair accessible taxi policy, as well as the setting of standards for customer service and for meeting the needs of people with disabilities.</P>
      <P>Recently I appointed Mr. Jimmy Farrelly, former Secretary General of the Department of the Environment and Local Government, as an interim chairman of the commission pending the recruitment of a statutory chairman. Mr. Farrelly will have a particular focus on qualitative issues. He is already engaged in a consultation process with the taxi, hackney, and limousine industry, local authorities, the Garda Síochána and other interest groups with a view to assessing and addressing issues relating to standards in the industry, including vehicle standards.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Pending the completion of this process and the establishment of the statutory commission, the manner of implementation of the policy of accessible taxi services has yet to be determined. It is <Col N="150" /> unlikely that the question of a single standard vehicle type will be identified for the purpose of being licensed as a taxi. This imperative is clearly signalled in a consultation paper relating to the future development of qualitative improvements in taxi services, framework for the promotion of qualitative improvements in taxi services and the future regulation of those services, that issued in February 2002. That paper also recognised that further improvements to the existing wheelchair accessible taxi specification may be required for the purpose of accommodating the greatest possible range of people, including those who suffer from mobility and sensory difficulties, while at the same time having due regard to the availability of suitable vehicles at reasonable cost. These issues will inform the evolution of new taxi standards under the auspices of the commission in order to meet the programme for Government commitment.</P>

    <P>Recently I received the strategic rail review from the consultants who carried out the work. I propose to bring it before Government and then publish it in the coming weeks.

    <P>As to future investment and funding of the railways, I believe that such decisions should be guided by the findings and recommendations of the strategic rail review, which I see as offering a blueprint for the future. The review considers rail passenger as well as rail freight services and gives a comprehensive perspective on urban, regional, rural aspects of the railway's future. The national spatial strategy has been one of the key influences on the shape of the document. Until the Government has formally considered the review and I have published the document I do not propose to comment on specific proposals such as the western rail corridor.</P>

    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. Brennan Mr. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Transport (Mr. Brennan)</NameTxt>
      <P>The 2003 Estimates provision of &euro;1.209 billion will bring total Exchequer investment in the programme over the period 2000-03 to approximately &euro;3.8 billion, which is more than &euro;900 million in excess of that provided for in the NDP. This will enable good progress to be maintained in the upgrading of the network. I am concerned to ensure that we get maximum value for money for the high level of investment in the national roads network.</P>
      <P>It is clear that financial resources alone will not be sufficient to guarantee the benefits from major investment now being made. Projects need to be delivered efficiently and cost effectively to ensure value for money is obtained. Tight cost control and delivery of projects must be the foremost guiding principle of programme implementation.</P>
      <P>The National Roads Authority has overall responsibility for the planning and supervision of works for the construction and maintenance of national roads. It supervises the award of major road contracts by road authorities against relevant public procurement criteria including economic advantage to the public sector.</P>
      <P>A wide range of measures have already been taken by the NRA to improve cost estimation and control and to secure greater certainty in the outturn cost of projects. These include: the appointment of specialist cost estimation staff, the publication of revised specifications, reduction in carriageway cross section width, and the greater use of the design and build form of contract.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In addition, a senior group of officials is currently considering additional funding options for the national roads programme. As part of its work, the group is considering the scope for further improvements in cost estimation and con<Col N="152" /> trol procedures, including the greater use of fixed price contracts. The group will shortly present its report to the cross-departmental team and the Cabinet sub-committee on infrastructure, housing and public private partnerships. The report will provide a basis for the team and the Cabinet sub-committee to review the funding of the programme having regard, <i>inter alia,</i> to its increased cost.</P>
    <P>These measures, together with the moderation in construction cost inflation that has occurred over the past year, will assist in achieving value for money and greater output for our investment going forward.</P>
    <P>As I announced on Sunday, arrangements are being put in place for the regular monitoring of major roads projects with particular reference to project costs, progress and target dates for completion.</P>

      <Quest>if his attention has been drawn to the serious concerns among Aer Lingus workers regarding the status of its pension fund, as a result of which worker directors refused to sign its accounts; the discussions he has had with the company on this matter; the implications for its future; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>
      <QRef>[7113/03]</QRef>
    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. Brennan Mr. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Transport (Mr. Brennan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware of the concerns of the Aer Lingus unions regarding the status of their pensions schemes, particularly in relation to the Irish airlines general employees superannuation scheme in which the majority of staff are members. This scheme is a multi-employer scheme with the principal employers being Aer Lingus and Aer Rianta and is registered with the Pensions Board as a defined benefit scheme.</P>
      <P>These concerns were brought about as a result of the application of a new accounting standard, FRS 17, for the first time in the Aer Lingus 2001 accounts. This standard requires certain disclosures which were not required previously and ultimately requires surpluses or deficits on defined benefit schemes to be taken onto employers' balance sheets.</P>
      <P>As a consequence of FRS 17, Aer Lingus explicitly stated in its 2001 accounts for the first time that the scheme was a target benefit pension scheme and that the company and employees contribute a fixed percentage of salaries each year to the scheme which does not vary according to the funded level of the scheme.</P>
      <P>The Aer Lingus scheme is unusual in that it specifies the benefits payable to members as well as the contribution rates payable by the employers and members. These two provisions are incompatible in the event of a deficit. The rules provide that if there is a deficit the trustees must decide what action to take. The rules also indicate that there is no obligation on the part of either employers or members to increase contributions.</P>
      <P>As a result Aer Lingus formed a view that while the scheme was a defined benefit scheme under the definition of the Pensions Act, it neither fitted easily within the definitions of defined contribution or defined benefit schemes under FRS 17. In the light of this the company concluded, in conjunction with its professional advisors, that the scheme was more in the nature of a target benefit scheme. The target is to pay the benefit levels specified in the rules and, assuming the actuarial position is adequate, this is what will occur.</P>
      <P>In the absence of the balance of cost resting with a known party or parties, the potential exists that the trustees will be unable to meet the target and, under the rules, will be required to determine an appropriate course of action.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At the Aer Lingus board meeting on 27 February the worker directors present objected to the approval of the 2002 accounts on the basis of the description contained in the detailed notes to the accounts relating to the current pension arrangements for its employees. The board approved the accounts without amendment. The text in the note to the 2002 accounts, which has yet to be <Col N="154" /> published, quotes the scheme rules relating to the position which applies if there is a surplus or deficit. A similar approach was taken in the accounts of the pension scheme which were sent to members in December 2002.</P>
    <P>Resolution of this issue is primarily a matter for the trustees, the members of the scheme and the employers as the rules of the scheme cannot be changed without the consent of the parties.</P>

      <P>My Department is responsible for the licensing of private passenger bus operators and for the granting of passenger route licences where these are required. The conditions imposed on these licences include compliance with the rules on admission to the occupation of private bus operator and the legal requirements on road safety as far as the standards for drivers and vehicles are concerned.</P>
      <P>In order to operate a bus service for hire or reward an operator must hold a road passenger transport operator licence. One of the criteria for obtaining such a licence is possession of a certificate of professional competence in road passenger operations. This certificate is obtained through attendance at a course and passing an examination set by the Chartered Institute of Logistics and Transport in Ireland. It certifies that the operator or designated transport manager has reached a recognised competency to continuously and effectively manage a road transport business.</P>
      <P>In relation to vehicles, any vehicle used in the operation of bus services authorised under a licence must undergo an annual roadworthiness test by an authorised tester designated by the relevant local authority.</P>
      <P>In addition, large public service vehicle licences are issued by the Garda to operators in respect of vehicles carrying in excess of eight passengers. This involves an examination of the vehicle by the Garda and is independent of the roadworthiness tests carried out on behalf of my Department.</P>
      <P>My Department is also responsible for the enforcement of EU regulations governing drivers' hours, breaks and rest periods for commercial drivers, including bus drivers.</P>
      <P>The above measures are in place and enforced to promote the safety of drivers, passengers and other road users. They help to maintain quality of standards of bus operators in the sector.</P>

      <P>Under the arrangements used by the NRA for conventional contracts 70% of the fees are based on the accepted tender and not on the final project cost. The remaining 30% of fees, which relates to duties associated with the supervision of work, is based on the final cost of the project.</P>
      <P>Standards of design and workmanship are established in the NRA design manual for roads and bridges and their specification for road works. NRA and local authority staff ensure that consultants adhere to these standards and that design and specification decisions reflect value for money.</P>
      <P>Going forward the greater use of design and build lump sum contracts which transfer responsibility for the detailed design to the contractor, under NRA and local authority supervision, will reduce the level of fees payable by the NRA and local authorities.</P>
      <P>Engineering consultant fees on national road projects account for approximately 2% to 4% on average of national road projects. Securing value for money for these services requires a good balance between a cost effective approach to fee determination and ensuring the highest quality of planning, design and supervision of major projects.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. Brennan Mr. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Transport (Mr. Brennan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 147, 189, 191 and 192 together.</P>
      <P>Last year the Government agreed that the development of the Dublin metro should be undertaken on a phased basis and as a public-private partnership. The proposal for a metro in Dublin is part of the Dublin Transportation Office's strategy A Platform for Change. Phase 1 of the metro involves a line from Blanchardstown and Dublin Airport to the city centre and Shanganagh. Since then the RPA has concentrated its work on developing the outline business case for phase 1. It has also conducted a preliminary public consultation and a prequalification exercise for potential bidders. More recently Iarnród Éireann submitted a preliminary proposal for a DART link from Connolly station to the airport.</P>
      <P>In November 2002 my Department received the outline business case for phase 1 from the RPA. It includes cost benefit analyses, a financing model, system options, the estimated cost over the lifetime of the project and the estimated timescales involved.</P>
      <P>The final costs of the project will be determined by a number of factors including the route alignment chosen, the structure of the PPP and the bids received as part of the competitive tendering process. The advisers engaged by the RPA estimated that the cost of the various options for phase 1 of the project ranges between &euro;1.7 billion to &euro;3.8 billion in terms of total direct capital cost at 2002 prices. These figures increase substantially when one estimates a final cost which takes account of expected inflation over the period between now and when services commence, VAT, fees, interest charges, the cost of risk transfer and a provision for risk and contingency. A more accurate cost can only be determined when the final structure of the project is decided and competitive bids are received from the interested parties. Nevertheless, I have asked the RPA to review each element of the costs to identify scope for reductions and my Department and the RPA are having discussions in this regard. The possible effects which a project of this scale may have on the overall Exchequer finances and Ireland's obligations under the EU Stability and Growth Pact are also being examined at present. No conclusions have yet been reached in this regard.</P>
      <P>Following completion of the evaluation of the metro outline business case and the Iarnród Éireann proposals in the coming weeks, I intend to bring my recommendations to the Government.</P>
      <P>After a Government decision in the matter the next steps would involve: public consultation on the route alignment selected; negotiation and conclusion of a PPP contract; and the independent public inquiry required under legislation before the railway order granting planning permission for any major railway works can be granted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Consistent with my policy for major infrastructure projects, which I outlined in recent days, I <Col N="158" /> will put in place a formal arrangement for the RPA to report progress in relation to the metro.</P>

      <P>The rural transport initiative provides funding for voluntary and community organisations and community partnerships to address the transport needs of their rural areas. The initiative is being managed by Area Development Management Limited on behalf of my Department.</P>
      <P>Under the RTI, 34 rural community transport groups are being funded to provide transport services in their areas. The scheme is operational in parts of all counties with the exception of Louth which did not apply for funding.</P>
      <P>There have been no cuts in recent weeks by my Department in respect of funding for the RTI. It is anticipated that some &euro;6 million will have been provided for this pilot initiative by the end of this year. This compares with the &euro;4.4 million earmarked in the national development plan.</P>
      <P>As to future arrangements for rural public transport, I have received a report from an interdepartmental committee which examined options for the development of a rural public transport policy. I am now considering its findings and recommendations and I will bring forward proposals for rural transport later this year in respect of future years.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 149 and 172 together.</P>
      <P>I refer to my reply to Priority Question No. 128 where I outlined the preliminary data made available from the Garda and the Department of the Environment and Local Government in relation to the operation of the penalty points system.</P>
      <P>Penalty points for speeding have been operating since 31 October. Penalty points are being applied to the driving licence records of those convicted of speeding offences, and to those who pay a fixed charge to the Garda in order to prevent the instigation of court proceedings.</P>
      <P>The application of enforcement policy in relation to the offence of the breaching of speed limits is a matter for the Garda Síochána. The compilation of detailed data in relation to the number of detections for speeding offences since the launch of the penalty points system is also a matter for the Garda. I have been assured by Garda management that there has been no reduction in enforcement efforts since the launch of the scheme and that despite it there has been a noticeable reduction in the number of speeding detections.</P>
      <P>The recording of convictions for offences is a matter for the Courts Service. The compilation of data relating to payments of fixed charges where the relevant notices are issued by the Garda Síochána is a matter for that force. Both of those organisations transfer the appropriate data to the Department of the Environment and Local Government to facilitate its entry into the national driver file which is the responsibility of that Department. It is understood from the Department of the Environment and Local Government that 8,289 penalty point notices have issued as at 5 March.</P>
      <P>The full application of the penalty points system will be achieved when the IT systems of the Garda and the Courts Service are developed. The question of reviewing the system will be considered against the background of its full operation.</P>

      <P>Dublin Airport is not constrained from a capacity point of view.

      <NameTxt>Minister for Transport (Mr. Brennan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 155 and 186 together.</P>
      <P>The National Development Plan 2000-06 envisages significant private sector investment in national road development. It is envisaged that a proportion of the national roads programme will be implemented by means of public-private partnerships. This will involve private sector funding and will ensure earlier delivery of vital national road infrastructure. Through PPPs, private sector innovation will be harnessed in the areas of scheme design, construction and long-term operation and maintenance.</P>
      <P>User tolls are now in widespread use throughout the developed and developing world and are particularly favoured where rapid expansion in major road networks is required. They are a considerably more widely used instrument of roads financing than shadow tolls and more readily permit the transfer of economic risk, which is desirable in PPP projects. While the use of shadow tolls has not been ruled out, road user tolling is, on the basis of the above considerations, more likely to be relied upon in the earlier stages of national roads PPP development.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The NRA's current PPP programme comprises 11 high quality projects spread throughout the country. The position in relation to these projects at present is as follows: the M50 second West-Link Bridge is under construction and is expected to be completed this year; the contract for the Kilcock-Kinnegad project is at final negotiation stage; initial tendering has been completed and bidders have been shortlisted to proceed to the best and final offer stage in the case of both the N25 Waterford bypass and the Dundalk western bypass; the N8 Rathcormac-Fermoy bypass is at tender evaluation stage; the NRA has invited expressions of interest for the M3 Clonee to Kells; and the remaining five schemes are at an advanced design stage which includes the prep<Col N="162" /> aration of statutory documentation for publication.</P>
    <P>In the case of the second West-Link bridge, the funding arrangements are subject to the relevant tolling agreement between the NRA and National Toll Roads plc. Funding arrangements for the remainder of these schemes will not be determined until the relevant negotiations are finalised and tolling agreements entered into.</P>
    <P>As regards the system of tolling to be used, I have already publicly stated that my strong preference is for a method that utilises the most up to date electronic technology to ensure that there is rapid movement of traffic through the toll booths and traffic tailbacks are eliminated.</P>
    <P>I am confident that the modest level of the tolls to be charged, combined with the high quality of the new roads and the greatly improved transport service they will provide, will ensure that the routes are attractive to the vast bulk of inter-urban traffic.</P>
    <P>Additional options for funding the national roads programme, including through the National Development Finance Agency, are also being considered by a group of senior officials who will present a report to the Cabinet committee on infrastructure, housing and PPPs shortly.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Transport (Mr. Brennan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 156, 166 and 168 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The sub-group of the cross-departmental team on infrastructure, housing and PPPs, which is examining additional funding options for the national roads programme and other programme management issues, will shortly present its report <Col N="163" /> to the cross-departmental team and Cabinet sub-committee. The report will provide a basis for the team and the Cabinet sub-committee on infrastructure, housing and PPPs to review the funding and management of the programme having regard, <i>inter alia,</i> to its increased cost. It will also assist the cross-departmental team and Cabinet committee in reviewing progress to date in implementing the programme, the outlook to 2006 in terms of project completions, and the potential for additional private sector funding over and above the PPP programme already being implemented.</P>
    <P>The position in regard to the overall funding of the programme is that Government has maintained investment in upgrading the national roads network at a high level. The 2003 Estimates provision of &euro;1.209 billion will bring total Exchequer investment in the programme over the period 2000-03 to approximately &euro;3.8 billion &ndash; more than &euro;900 million in excess of that provided for in the NDP. The increased cost of the programme means that some projects will take longer to deliver than originally envisaged but the hugely increased level of investment will nevertheless allow good progress to be maintained.</P>
    <P>The position in regard to carriageway width is that the National Roads Authority revised its design standards in relation to motorways and dual carriageways in December 2000. This standard, published in the design manual for roads and bridges, provides for a narrower central median incorporating a containment barrier. Previous practice was to rely on a wide central grass median as the primary safety feature. The adoption of the new standard, which is consistent with international practice, makes it possible to reduce the carriageway cross section from 36m. to 26m. without any diminution of road safety. Cost savings will arise from the smaller land take required but some of this will be offset by the cost of the median barrier.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 157 and 171 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="164" />The Railway Procurement Agency has been given statutory responsibility for the implementation of an integrated ticketing system based on smart card technologies for initial deployment in the greater Dublin area.</P>
    <P>The RPA has set a target date of end 2005 for completion of this project. It is examining all options to expedite the delivery of integrated ticketing with a view to bringing forward the proposed launch date.</P>
    <P>The development costs of the full integrating ticketing project are estimated to amount to &euro;26.9 million for the total project. In the 2003 Estimates for my Department &euro;3.6 million has been earmarked for integrated ticketing. This has enabled the RPA to proceed to the current phase which will deal with the design and procurement options for the system, including consideration of the potential for procuring the system on a public private partnership basis. The procurement strategy decided upon will determine the appropriate involvement of the private sector and estimated Exchequer financial support for the whole project.</P>
    <P>In advance of the introduction of full smart card technology systems, Bus Éireann, Bus Átha Cliath and Iarnród Éireann have introduced systems for purchasing certain tickets online via their websites. They now offer bus and rail integrated tickets for daily, weekly and monthly travel based on magnetic strip technology. In addition Bus Éireann, Bus Átha Cliath and Iarnród Éireann are in discussion with the Railway Procurement Agency about having tickets which will integrate with the Luas systems when services commence next year.</P>

      <P>Last week I visited Madrid to see and hear the approach that its authorities are taking to the construction of its transport infrastructure. The Madrid authorities are undertaking a significant investment programme involving roads, metro and a second terminal at Barajas Airport. Reports to me suggested that the cost effectiveness of these projects and timescale in which they are being delivered were worthy of examination.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I had very interesting and fruitful discussions with my Spanish counterpart. I also met public and private bodies, including representatives of the State, regional and local authorities. I was impressed with the short delivery time that has been achieved in Madrid for major infrastructure projects and with the comparatively low outturn costs that were quoted to me. The whole approach to project planning and construction is worthy of further consideration. I have asked the relevant State bodies under my aegis to investi<Col N="165" /> gate, in particular, the cost comparisons on the road and metro projects. I have also asked my Department to examine the regulatory procedures applied in Madrid to determine if they can be adapted for here and so contribute to reducing the cost and delivery time for critical infrastructure projects.</P>

      <P>The programme for Government contains a commitment relating to the establishment of a dedicated traffic corps. I support the implementation of this proposal through the formation of a corps that will be separately identifiable and visible.</P>
      <P>A consultation process involving my Department, the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform and the Garda Síochána in relation to the establishment of a dedicated traffic corps is being progressed. The furtherance of this proposal raises a range of challenging issues. Of particular importance will be the questions relating to the governance of the corps. Central to that issue is the question of the relationship that the corps will have with the Garda and, in particular, whether it will be under the overall control of the Garda Commissioner. The establishment of a dedicated traffic corps will require the introduction of legislation, in particular to establish its powers, functions and accountablility. Its establishment will be progressed in tandem with the preparation of the necessary legislation.</P>
      <P>My Department is also examining the practice in relation to traffic policing in other EU member states.</P>

      <P>The Road Traffic (Traffic and Parking) Regulations of 1997 and 1998 establish the statutory basis, <Col N="166" /> including relevant restrictions and prohibitions, for the use of bus lanes. The regulations also provide that many of the restrictions and prohibitions which are established in respect of the rules relating to traffic and parking generally are not applied to particular classes of road users in very particular and restricted circumstances. These include a provision through which the restrictions and prohibitions applicable to the use of bus lanes do not apply to a vehicle being used by a member of the Garda Síochána in the performance of the duties of that member. In certain circumstances the duties of members of the Garda may include the driving of vehicles for the purpose of transporting Ministers and other State appointees.</P>

      <P>Since 10 January 2001 Dublin Bus is required to notify my Department at least four weeks in advance of the commencement of proposed new services or proposed amendments to existing services. In line with this direction, my Department was notified on 21 January by Dublin Bus of proposals to amend services on the 33 route.</P>
      <P>During the course of examining its proposals my officials noted that some of the additional services requested conflicted with services outlined in a prior application for a route licence from a private operator under the Road Transport Act 1932.</P>
      <P>Dublin Bus was notified on 18 February that the majority of its proposals were noted. It may proceed to implement these changes without restriction. The company was requested to suspend the introduction of the remainder of the proposed changes until further notice.</P>
      <P>My Department will complete processing the existing licence application without delay and will revert to Dublin Bus as quickly as possible. The company may then either proceed with the remaining proposed changes or, alternatively, will be asked to review them in the light of any licence that may have been issued in the interim to the private operator for the route in question.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Question Nos. 163 and 175 together.</P>
      <P>Recently an interim chairman of the commission for taxi regulation, Mr. Jimmy Farrelly, was appointed. He has been asked to carry out a consultation process with the taxi, hackney and limousine industry, local authorities, the Garda Síochána and other interest groups with a view to assessing and addressing issues relating to standards in the industry in advance of the appointment of a statutory commission.</P>
      <P>I have indicated that I am prepared to act on any recommendations proposed by Mr. Farrelly, for urgent changes to the current regulations on standards, following this consultation. He has also been asked to advise on the appropriate procedures to be used to implement the findings of the taxi hardship panel.</P>
      <P>The preparation of the necessary legislation to support the establishment of the commission for taxi regulation is proceeding as a matter of urgency in my Department. In addition, the post of chairman is the subject of consultation with the Department of Finance.</P>
      <P>The granting of a taxi licence is currently subject to the vehicle being passed by the national car testing service, having adequate insurance and the payment of a fee. A person may not drive a taxi unless he or she has been issued with a licence to drive a small public service vehicle by the Garda.</P>
      <P>Taxis, as an on-street immediate hire service, are only allowed access to with-flow bus lanes when they are being used in the course of business.</P>
      <P>Recently I requested officials in my Department to examine the reported issuing of taxi licences to business concerns or individuals for their own private use and not for the provision of a service for the benefit of the general public, as well as the existing legislation and regulations to establish the exact position in law.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>My proposals are that the independent body will procure and regulate public transport services within a regulatory and investment framework laid down by Government. As Minister for Transport I will continue to set overall transport policy. Under my proposals the independent regulator would have the following functions: the allocation of both current and capital funding for public transport services from an overall allocation provided by the Exchequer; the procure<Col N="169" /> ment of bus services in the greater Dublin area from both Dublin Bus and private operators; the procurement of long distance bus services serving the GDA which commence or end outside its boundaries; the regulation of public transport fares; setting and enforcing quality standards for public transport services; negotiating a public service contract with Iarnród Éireann for the provision of DART and suburban rail services in the GDA; and approval of the relevant service contracts for LUAS and metro services procured by the Railway Procurement Agency.</P>
    <P>All public transport outside the GDA should also be subject to independent economic regulation. I have not yet taken any decisions on the precise form of regulation to be applied to public transport outside Dublin.</P>

While it is not possible to provide an exact breakdown of this total between military and other exempt flights, it is estimated that the latter comprises a very small proportion of the total payment. It should be noted that the amount for 2002 includes the reimbursement of the en route and communications charge to the IAA for all military flights in Irish controlled airspace as distinct from Irish sovereign airspace. No further breakdown of this figure is available to my Department. There are no figures yet available in relation to 2003.</P>

      <P>The NDP sets the strategic framework for the development of the national road network over the period to 2006. The framework is based substantially on the national roads needs study published by the NRA in 1998. In the NDP the Government decided, in the case of five main inter-urban routes, to go beyond the recommendations of the study, to provide for a higher level of service on these routes than proposed in it and to provide for the upgrading of these routes to motorway-dual carriageway standard in their entirety. The Government adopted this approach having regard to developments including traffic growth since 1996, when most of the work on the study was undertaken, the views of economic and regional development interests, and the importance of high quality inter-urban road links between the main urban centres in supporting economic and social development. The road development projects involved will, as part of the detailed planning and design process applicable to all major roads projects, be subject to assessment and evaluation, including cost-benefit analysis, in accordance with Department of Finance guidelines on the approval and management of capital projects.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="172" />The 2003 programme announced recently by the NRA is in line with the framework set out in the NDP. The detailed programming of the work involved in the implementation of the programme and the allocation of funding for projects is a matter for the NRA.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Transport (Mr. Brennan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very much aware of the problem of crowding on our railway network, particularly at peak periods. I am conscious of the discomfort and inconvenience this causes to passengers.</P>
      <P>Iarnród Éireann has a statutory responsibility for ensuring the safety of its passengers. Therefore, it is a matter for the company to satisfy itself that the number of passengers being carried in any particular train or carriage does not compromise overall passenger safety.</P>
      <P>My Department's railway inspectorate continually monitors developments in regard to crowding on trains. It has stressed to Iarnród Éireann the importance of keeping this matter under review.</P>
      <P>I am advised by Iarnród Éireann that it expects its consultants to finalise their independent review of its crowding management strategy on intercity services by the end of March. Later this year the company plans to introduce a reservation system, allowing pre-booking on key peak services.</P>
      <P>The Railway Safety Bill 2001 will require all railway undertakings to implement a formal safety management system and to describe that system in a document called a safety case. The Bill will require a railway undertaking to identify in its safety case all issues impacting on the safety of its operations. Such issues would include its strategy for managing crowding of trains. The railway safety commission, to be established under the Bill, will need to be satisfied that the safety case is adequate to ensure the safety of passengers. The Bill completed Second Stage on 27 February and has been referred to the Oireachtas Select Committee on Transport.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Growth in passenger numbers has contributed to the present crowding difficulties on intercity and suburban services. Data provided by Iarnród Éireann shows that since 1994 passenger numbers on intercity services have increased from 7.8 million to an estimated 11.3 million in 2002, a 45% increase. In order to address the capacity problems arising from this passenger growth, significant funding has been, and continues to be, made available to Iarnród Éireann for investment to improve the safety of the network, increase the <Col N="173" /> passenger capacity of the system and improve the quality, reliability and speed of services.</P>
    <P>Iarnród Éireann has ordered 67 new inter-city carriages and these will begin to enter service in 2005. In addition, the entry into service later this year of 80 diesel rail cars, purchased for use on outer suburban routes, will release Mark III carriages from those suburban routes for use on intercity services. These new rail cars will reduce the number of commuting passengers using key inter-city trains and will also be available to supplement inter-city rolling stock on Sundays. The ongoing delivery of new rolling stock will increase the available capacity to deal with peak periods and should help to alleviate the present crowding difficulties.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 183 and 197 together.</P>
      <P>There are two main issues in the programme for Government relating to the future of Aer Rianta. They are as follows: the commitments to ensure greater autonomy and independence for Shannon and Cork Airports; to examine proposals for a new independent terminal at Dublin Airport; and progress them if the evidence suggests that such a terminal will deliver significant benefits.</P>
      <P>I established a panel of experts, chaired by Mr. Paddy Mullarkey, to examine the expressions of interest received in an independent terminal at Dublin Airport. Last month I received its report regarding this issue and today I am making arrangements for it to be published on my Department's website.</P>
      <P>Last October I met the group of unions representing workers in Aer Rianta. I also met a delegation from SIPTU in February to discuss these two major issues in the Government's programme.</P>
      <P>I have arranged for a process of consultation to get under way immediately with relevant interested parties and stakeholders in relation to the panel's report on the independent terminal concept at Dublin Airport. The board of Aer Rianta, the unions representing employees in the company and the Commission for Aviation Regulation will be involved in this consultation process which will also deal with the issue of greater autonomy and independence for Shannon and Cork airports.</P>
      <P>Following this consultation process, it would be my intention to bring proposals to Government in relation to these two major issues.</P>

      <P>Construction of the two Luas lines from Tallaght to Connolly Station, lines A and C, and from Sandyford to St. Stephen's Green, line B, is progressing. Significant milestones for the project have already been achieved. The depot at Red Cow is now complete and the 26 trams for the Tallaght line have been delivered. Construction of the Sandyford depot is complete, fitting out will begin shortly, the first 40 metre tram for the line has been received and the remaining 13 trams will be delivered over the coming weeks.</P>
      <P>Almost all enabling works, such as utilities, diversions and bridge building are complete and the land and property acquisitions programme is well advanced. A significant amount of track has been laid and the test tracks at Red Cow and Sandyford are in place.</P>
      <P>In December 2002 responsibility for the day-to-day management of the Luas project passed from CIE to the Railway Procurement Agency. The detail of individual contracts is a matter for the agency. It has informed me that the contractual completion dates, October 2003 for line A-C and December 2003 for line B, will not be met and that the contractor involved has indicated that a 16 week delay can be expected. It also told me that, based on its projections, a more realistic timetable for completion would be May 2004 for the Tallaght to Connolly Station line and March 2004 for the Sandyford to St. Stephen's Green line. Accordingly, the RPA is in negotiation with the contractor as regards the consequences of these delays.</P>
      <P>A period of up to three months will be required following these dates for testing, commissioning and general safety checking before passenger services commence. I have conveyed my concerns about the delays to the RPA. I have asked that all necessary steps are taken to ensure that services commence at the earliest possible date.</P>
      <P>The initial budget submitted to the Department by CIE for the project was &euro;466 million in 1999 prices, based on preliminary estimates. This budget was subsequently revised in February 2001 to &euro;675 million to take account of actual competition tender prices received, reflecting high inflation in the construction sector, higher than anticipated property acquisition costs and changes to the scope of the project, mainly related to the provision for upgrading line B to metro status. Capital funding for construction of the lines, estimated currently at &euro;691 million, is in place. The RPA has also made financial provision for risk and contingency.</P>

      <P>Aer Rianta has statutory responsibility for the management, operation and development of the State airports, including Dublin Airport.</P>
      <P>With the completion early last year of the new terminal extension, Dublin Airport now has terminal capacity to handle up to 20 million passengers per annum. This compares with a throughput of just over 15 million passengers in 2002.</P>
      <P>Airlines are responsible for checking in passengers and delivering baggage from the plane to the baggage hall. Check-in at Dublin Airport is undertaken by the airlines or their designated ground handling agent. Airlines have a choice of handling agents at Dublin Airport. Ground handling companies at Dublin Airport are approved by the Commission for Aviation Regulation and are contracted to the airline directly.</P>
      <P>Last year Aer Rianta introduced a by-law which set standards for check-in, covering both the opening time and the number of check-in desks to be available for each flight. Adherence by airlines or their ground handling agents to these standards will serve to reduce queuing time and increase passenger comfort when checking in for their flights.</P>
      <P>Aer Rianta informs me that the director of Dublin Airport and his staff continually manage and monitor service standards for passengers. Aer Rianta has also established a passenger services council the prime objective of which is to promote continuous improvement in passenger service levels at Dublin Airport.</P>

      <P>It is recognised by Aer Rianta that Cork Airport needs significant investment as a result of the growth in traffic through the airport in recent years and the company is well advanced with its plans for a major new capital investment programme in infrastructure and facilities. The main feature of this programme, estimated to cost &euro;130 million, is a 25,000 sq. m. terminal building. Planning permission for this project was secured last year and Aer Rianta is currently finalising its evaluation of tenders for the works. Aer Rianta expects that all necessary arrangements for the works to proceed will be concluded within the next couple of weeks. The company expects that the work will take two years to complete and the aim would be to have the new terminal ready for Cork's year as European City of Culture in 2005.</P>

      <P>As I said in the course of my address at the launch of the programme of the Robert Emmet Bicentary Commemoration on 20 September 2002, a significant proportion of this year's commemoration budget will go to the Robert Emmet Association. A sum of &euro;7,000 was paid to the association last year to cover expenses already incurred and it is expected that approximately &euro;40,000 will be given on receipt of costings of the details of the planned programme. The programme consists of publications, lectures, conference and public events to commemorate the life of Robert Emmet as well as people such as Anne Devlin, Sarah Curran, Thomas Russell, Jemmy Hope, Michael Dwyer and Thomas Moore.</P>

      <P>As the Deputy will be aware, the negotiations on a successor agreement to the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness, PPF, have now concluded resulting in a proposed new agreement entitled, Sustaining Progress, copies of which have been laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas.</P>
      <P>In the draft agreement which has emerged, there is a focus not only on wages and the labour market, but a continued framework for consistent policies to maintain our competitiveness and our productive capacity, while progressing our social agenda, including in particular targets under the NAPS.</P>
      <P>Sustaining Progress also engages with the social partners in a new, dynamic and highly-focused way on a range of special initiatives, which have a priority in terms of social inclusion and quality of life.</P>
      <P>However, the draft agreement between the parties does not make specific provision to assist the sector to which the Deputy refers, to be exempt from rental charges.</P>
      <P>The Deputy may wish to take this particular issue up with the Minister of State at the Department of Finance with special responsibility for the Office of Public Works should he wish to pursue the matter further.</P>

      <NameTxt>Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Ms Harney)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very much aware of the high cost of insurance in Ireland and I am concerned about the difficulties this is causing generally, including for sports clubs throughout the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On 25 October last, I announced my programme for fundamental insurance reform. The programme reflects the commitments given in An Agreed Programme for Government and comprises a comprehensive set of inter-related <Col N="182" /> measures designed to improve the functioning of the Irish insurance market. The key measures include: establishment of a ministerial committee, chaired by myself, to oversee implementation of the reform programme, including the 67 recommendations in the Motor Insurance Advisory Board, MIAB, report; publication of the action plan to give effect to the MIAB recommendations within a target timeframe; establishment of the personal injuries assessment board, PIAB, on an interim basis, pending preparation of the necessary legislation to put the PIAB on a statutory footing; and publication of the report of the implementation group on the PIAB.</P>
    <P>The pricing and underwriting of insurance is a matter for individual insurance companies and EU law prevents me from intervening directly in the matter. However, I have made it clear that I consider there to be an onus on the insurance industry to ensure that the reforms to be taken as outlined in my reform programme will have the effect of reducing the cost of premia to consumers.</P>
    <P>My Department, in conjunction with the Competition Authority, have agreed the terms of reference for a study being undertaken into the competitiveness of the Irish insurance market. The terms of reference are available at www.entemp.ie and www.tca.ie. The study will identify and analyse barriers to entry and limitations on rivalry in the insurance marketplace.</P>

      <P>I can say that constitution of the board of FÁS is governed by the Labour Services Act 1987. Of the 17 members on the board of FÁS, only two are nominated by myself as Minister. Neither of my nominations are from my constituency. The Deputy may like to know that two FÁS board members are from my constituency, namely Mr. William Attley, trade union representative, and Mr. Peter Cullen, Worker Director. Neither of these nominations, however, are within my remit.</P>
      <P>The Labour Services Act 1987 also allows for the establishment of FÁS International Consulting Limited. There are seven members on the board of FÁS International. Of these, I have nominated and appointed Ms Tara Hayes from my constituency.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Mr. Fahey)</NameTxt>
      <P>In accordance with the Government's decision in 1999 to restructure community employment (CE), participation levels are gradually being reduced reflecting the significant reduction in the numbers of the long-term unemployed, and the shift in emphasis away from work experience programmes to training, from which there is a greater level of progression to employment.</P>
      <P>CE places in health related projects are ringfenced from reductions and have remained at a constant level since March 2002. There are 3,710 people working in CE health sector places and the cost of maintaining these places during 2003 will be in the region of &euro;46 million. The ringfencing of CE health services was agreed with the Department of Health and Children and the health boards during discussions on mainstreaming these services.</P>
      <P>The total numbers of CE places providing health-related services were not clearly identified or specifically ringfenced until 2002 and, accordingly, comparable figures are not available for 2000 and 2001. The overall number of CE places available is set to reduce by 5,000 places this year to a level of 20,000 by year-end. Therefore, it is not possible to expand any of the services being provided by the programme at this time.</P>

      <P>My Department does not have detailed information available to it relating to the practice referred to by the Deputy.</P>
      <P>The objective of policy in this area is to ensure that the consumer is adequately informed of all charges being imposed. Provision for this has been made in a number of statutory measures, particularly by the European Communities (Protection of Consumers in respect of Distance Contracts Made by Means of Distance Communication) Regulations 2001, (S.I. No 207 of 2001), the European Communities (Directive 2000/31/EC Regulations 2003, (S.I. No. 68 of 2003), and the European Communities (Requirements to Indicate Product Prices) Regulations 2002 (S.I. No 639 of 2002).</P>
      <P> These measures combined with normal consumer vigilance should be sufficient to protect consumer interests in this area. Therefore, I do not propose to take steps towards prohibiting the type of charges concerned.</P>

      <P>The WTO Declaration agreed at the fourth trade ministerial meeting in Doha, in November 2001, provides for a new round of multilateral trade liberalisation negotiations across a broad spectrum of trade related issues. The declaration, one of the key documents from the ministerial meeting, outlines a wide-ranging work programme and is the blueprint for negotiations which are scheduled to conclude by 2005.</P>
      <P>Negotiations are ongoing across the range of topics involved including, in relation to trade-related issues in the areas of agriculture, services, trade related intellectual property rights, dispute settlement and trade and development. Ireland participates in the negotiations as part of the European Union and the EU and its member states are contributing substantially to the delivery of key outputs under the Doha work programme.</P>
      <P>As a small open economy, particularly reliant on exports for economic development, Ireland supports a strengthening of the WTO and of the multilateral trading system and an ambitious approach to the elimination of remaining barriers to trade in goods and services. Issues of importance to Ireland under the current round are the conclusion of agreements in the areas of agriculture, services, market access and trade measures to assist the economies of developing countries in particular, focusing on how to better integrate developing countries into the global trading system.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that the customs and excise service of the Revenue Commissioners has primary responsibility for the prevention, detection, interception and seizure of controlled drugs intended to be smuggled or illegally imported into the State as set out in the Memorandum of Understanding which was signed by both the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform and the Minister for Finance in January 1996.</P>
      <P>The commissioners attach a very high priority to the detection of illegally imported drugs. This is reflected in Revenue's statement of strategy 2003-2005, which I recently approved and launched. The office has committed itself to deliver on the supply reduction targets set out in the national drugs strategy, NDS, document, Building on Experience. These targets require the Customs Service and the Garda Síochána to increase the volume of opiates and all other drugs seized by 25% by the end of 2004 and by 50% by the end of 2008, using 2000 seizures as a base.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The commissioners advise me that the Customs Service seized controlled drugs with street values of &euro;60.6 million and &euro;33.6 million in 2001 and <Col N="198" /> 2002, respectively, compared with &euro;10.9 million in 2000. The national drugs strategy also advocates the strengthening and consolidation of measures designed to restrict the importation of illicit drugs. A number of specific measures have been implemented by the commissioners to enhance the operational effectiveness of the Customs Service in its efforts to detect drug smuggling.</P>
    <P>The Customs Memorandum of Understanding, MOU, programme continues to grow and expand. Customs have now negotiated 42 MOUs with trade associations and significant operators involved in import/export, or international transport and logistics. A further two are in the course of preparation. The promotion of these MOUs is regarded internationally as best practice and is in keeping with the World Customs Organisation business alliance programme.</P>
    <P>An operational protocol was agreed with the Garda Síochána in October 2000, and this has enhanced the effectiveness of inter-agency co-operation and significantly increased the number of joint operations and controlled deliveries.</P>
    <P>A new drug detector dog acquisition programme has just been completed resulting in the deployment of nine detector dog teams at strategic locations throughout the State. Passive 'stop and stare' dogs, which can screen passengers as well as freight, are now being utilised.</P>
    <P>The Customs drugs watch programme has been reviewed and was re-launched earlier this year. This programme seeks to enlist the support of the coastal community and other persons based in strategic locations in reporting suspicious activity to Customs on a confidential basis. The programme includes a poster and public awareness campaign.</P>
    <P>A customs officer has been assigned to the Europol National Office.</P>
    <P>Conscious of the globalised nature of drug trafficking, there is constant interaction with customs administrations and law enforcement agencies in other countries and this results in regular national and international operations being organised.</P>
    <P>The Revenue Commissioners advise me that they constantly monitor and review the effectiveness of their drugs enforcement operations. In addition to the measures already implemented, the commissioners are considering the acquisition of additional technical and other equipment in order to enhance the ability of the Customs Service to detect illegally imported drugs.</P>

      <Quest>if his attention has been drawn to the fact that community and voluntary groups are unable to move into the Northside Civic Centre, Coolock, Dublin 17, on 31 March 2003 due to the fact the rent charges imposed on tenants by the Office of Public Works are too high; and if assistance will be given in resolving this issue.</Quest>

      <P>The initial rent has been set at &euro;15.00 per sq. ft. At the outset, the community-voluntary sector confirmed that they were willing to pay reasonable rent for their accommodation in the proposed civic centre. Bearing in mind what is in question, both the cost and high quality of the accommodation, the rent is not unreasonable and indeed, is well below present day market rents for similar type accommodation.</P>
      <P>The Office of Public Works is aware that some of the voluntary sector groups are having difficulty funding the rental costs in the new centre. However, it is important to note that the primary remit of the Office of Public Works is to provide accommodation for Departments and Offices; it is not the Office of Public Works's role to fund voluntary organisations, either directly or indirectly. If additional funding is required by any of the voluntary groups to meet their rental costs, they should direct their requests for assistance to the appropriate authorities, i.e. the bodies or organisations that sponsor them or provide them with funding.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>In budget 2003 I decided to raise revenue from indirect taxes and one of these changes was the increase in the reduced rate of VAT from 12.5% to 13.5% with effect from 1 January 2003. This will bring in &euro;187 million in 2003 and &euro;224.5 million in a full year. VAT has become one of the most significant sources of revenue for the Exchequer. This revenue raising measure was essential in order to raise Exchequer revenue for much needed public services. This change in the rate became law on budget night and is in the process of being confirmed in the Finance Bill. <Col N="201" /> The removal of the 1% increase in the reduced rate of VAT for hotels and restaurants as proposed by the Deputy would require alternative revenue raising measures of similar scale or similar reductions in public expenditure. I have no plans to make any changes to the current position.</P>

      <Quest>the threshold between siblings not living in the same house in regard to rules in relation to inheritance tax; if an inheritance of farmland between siblings is treated differently if the recipient is a farmer or non-farmer; and if unzoned land is valued at its agricultural value, development or hoped for value.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy)</NameTxt>
      <P>The taxation of inheritances is governed by the capital acquisitions tax&ndash;  CAT &ndash; code. Under this code, a person can take inheritances under three different group thresholds before being liable to CAT at 20%. These thresholds are as follows:</P>
      <P>&ndash;&nbsp;&euro;441,198 &ndash; Group A &ndash; where the recipient is the child of the disponer,</P>
      <P>&ndash;&nbsp;&euro;44,120 &ndash; Group B &ndash; where the recipient is a brother, sister, nephew, niece, lineal ancestor or lineal descendent, other than those covered by Group A, and</P>
      <P>&ndash;&nbsp;&euro; 22,060 &ndash; Group C &ndash; all other cases.</P>
      <P>These amounts are indexed linked, and rise each year in line with inflation, and generally the market value of the inheritance is the value used for the purpose of these thresholds.</P>
      <P>The threshold for inheritances between siblings is therefore &euro;44,120, assuming that the beneficiary has taken no prior benefits in group B since 5 December 1991. Where siblings live in the same family home, they would avail of the general exemption on the transfer of the family home if certain conditions are fulfilled.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the context of an inheritance involving farmland, the recipient may be entitled to a relief known as agricultural relief. This applies in the case of a gift or inheritance of agricultural land, where the recipient is a farmer. For the purpose of the relief, farmers are defined as individuals domiciled in Ireland, where 80% of the value of <Col N="202" /> their assets after taking the gift or inheritance is represented by agricultural property.</P>
    <P>The relief operates by reducing the market value of agricultural property by a flat rate of 90%, so that the tax is calculated on an amount &ndash; known as the agricultural value &ndash; which is substantially less than the market value. Therefore, depending on the circumstances, it is possible that a person may inherit as much as &euro;441,200 of farmland in market value terms from his or her siblings before incurring a CAT liability. The market value is determined by reference to recent sales of comparable land.</P>

      <P>The Revenue Commissioners are conscious of the risks posed to both the Exchequer and public health by the production and sale of illicit alcohol and regularly conduct operations to target such activities.</P>
      <P>I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that searches were carried out by Revenue officers following the detection of illicit distilleries in the State and in Northern Ireland. In conjunction with these detections, three bottling plants were also discovered in the state.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am also informed that proceedings have been instituted recently in a number of cases involving the possession of illicit spirits that had been found in the course of searches of various licensed premises. These proceedings were instituted under the Illicit Distillation Act 1831 which provides, on conviction, for a monetary penalty, or custodial sentence in lieu, and also the consequential disqualification from holding a licence by virtue of an amendment introduced by the Intoxicating Liquor Act 1924. To date, convictions have been obtained in three cases, one of which is the subject of an appeal to the Circuit Court on the question of forfeiture of licence. A <Col N="203" /> further 11 cases are currently before the courts. In the meantime, investigations are continuing in the case of four other detections made last year.</P>
    <P>The question of the adequacy of existing legislation is being kept under review in light of developments and, in particular, the outcome of these cases. A new offence in relation to keeping, selling or delivering unexcised or counterfeit spirits has been included in section 93 of the Finance Bill 2003.</P>

      <P>The Government remains committed to moving forward the progressive decentralisation of Government offices and agencies. As I have said previously, a wide range of important issues, including the national spatial strategy, have to be considered before a final decision is taken on this matter. It is vital that all involved are consulted, be they staff concerned about their futures or Departmental managements concerned about the delivery of the public services for which they have responsibility. Given these wide ranging considerations it is not possible for me to state, at this time, when the Government will be in a position to take a decision on the issue of decentralisation. However, all of the submissions and representations which have been received by my Department, including the case made for Bandon, will be given consideration as part of the deliberative process.</P>

      <P>The reduced rate of VAT increased from 12.5% to 13.5% with effect from 1 January.</P>
      <P>Generally, the purchase of a new house by a private individual involves two stages: the payment of a deposit at the time of signing the contract, with the possibility of staged payments as the house is being constructed and payment of the balance on completion.</P>
      <P>Where a private individual or any other un-registered person makes a payment to a registered builder for the purchase of a new house the rate of VAT applicable is the rate in force at the time the payment was received by the builder. Therefore, any payments made during 2002 were liable at the 12.5% rate of VAT, and payments made on or after 1 January 2003 are liable at the 13.5% rate.</P>
      <P>Thus, in cases where deposits and-or staged payments were made prior to 1 January 2003, it is only on the remaining balance that the increased rate is applied. In cases where contracts were signed, but no payments were made prior to 1 January 2003 the total cost of construction of the house is subject to VAT at the 13.5% rate.</P>
      <P>I would not be in a position to comment on the actual terms of a contract entered into between the builder and the private individual concerned.</P>

Successive Ministers have closely followed over many years the highly unsatisfactory situation of Irish nationals teaching in Italian universities who, along with other non-Italian EU nationals, have experienced discrimination with regard to their employment. The Government has supported the European Commission in its efforts on behalf of those experiencing such discrimination.</P>
      <P>The Commission's case against Italy at the European Court of Justice was decided in the Commission's favour on 26 June 2001. I warmly welcome the finding of the Venice regional tribunal in the light of that judgment in favour of EU nationals affected by discriminatory employment conditions within Italian universities. I hope that this finding, together with the infringement procedure being undertaken by the Commission with respect to non-implementation of the European Court of Justice's 2001 judgment, will lead to early concrete improvements in the situation of EU nationals teaching in Italian universities.</P>

      <P>Last year my Department made available a total of &euro;375,000 for Irish emigrant welfare associations in the United States and Australia. A total of $300,000 was given to groups in the US and Aus$56,600 was made available to Irish emigrant welfare associations in Australia.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The grant awards were in recognition of the excellent work done by Irish emigrant support groups in the United States and Australia in providing information, advice and outreach services to Irish emigrants. The funding is a practical <Col N="209" /> expression of the Government's support for these efforts.</P>
    <P>A total of &euro;2.7 million was made available to emigrant welfare groups in Britain under the DÍON fund, which was then the responsibility of my colleague, the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment.</P>
    <P>This year &euro;386,000 is available in the Vote for the Department of Foreign Affairs to fund emigrant welfare groups in the US and Australia.</P>
    <P>Responsibility for the DÍON fund was transferred to my Department from the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment on 5 February 2003.

      <P>Ireland enjoys excellent political relations with Latvia. In 1991, we welcomed the fact that Latvia regained its independence. We have also supported Latvian accession to the EU, and in the course of accession negotiations, EU contacts with Latvia have been maintained at all levels, including at ministerial level. Following the successful conclusion of accession negotiations at the Copenhagen European Council in December 2002, we look forward to welcoming Latvia as an EU member state on 1 May 2004, during the Irish Presidency.</P>
      <P>As an acceding state to the European Union, Latvia is required to meet the highest standards of protection of human rights, including the protection of minorities. These are elements of the Copenhagen political criteria which all candidates for EU membership are required to fulfil before accession negotiations can be opened. The Commission has affirmed in its regular reports since the start of negotiations with Latvia in 2000 that Latvia fulfils these requirements.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to the specific issue of the protection of national minorities, a significant role is played by the Council of Europe's Framework Convention on national minorities. Ireland's permanent representative to the Council of Europe <Col N="210" /> chairs the rapporteur group on human rights of the Committee of Ministers of the Council of Europe, in which, <i>inter alia,</i> the issue of national minorities is discussed.</P>
    <P>Latvia signed the framework convention on national minorities on 11 May 1995, but has not as yet ratified it. In a resolution of 23 January 2001, the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe called on Latvia to ratify the convention as a matter of priority. The Committee of Ministers of the Council of Europe on 24 April 2001 also encouraged the Latvian authorities to ratify the convention. Although ratification is not a requirement for EU accession, the European Commission too has urged Latvia to ratify the convention. Latvia intends to ratify the convention and is engaged in an ongoing process to prepare for this. However, it will be noted that the Latvian Parliament rejected ratification in March 2001.</P>
    <P>As a member of the monitoring committee of the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe, the Deputy will be aware that these matters have been discussed by the monitoring committee in the context of its post-monitoring dialogue with the Latvian authorities.</P>
    <P>The Irish Government provides pre-accession assistance to all the candidate countries. Each embassy accredited to a candidate country has a budget of &euro;30,000 to fund pre-accession training, which may include training in the area of human rights. Latvian officials have also participated in courses funded by the Department of Foreign Affairs and run by the Institute for Public Administration. Through Ireland Aid, the Government has also supported civic society groups in Latvia. We have recently approved funding of nearly &euro;11,000 to the European Women's Foundation for a democratisation project in a region where the majority of the population is of Russian origin.</P>

      <Quest>the main outlines of any joint position to be advanced by the 15 EU member states at the next session of the ad hoc committee of states on a comprehensive and integrated international convention on protection and promotion of the rights and dignity of persons with disabilities at United Nations level, which is due to take place in New York in June 2003; if the 15 EU member states are resolved to move beyond academic discussions of whether a convention is necessary and committed to begin the drafting process in earnest; and the projected timescale for the completion of the process.</Quest>

      <P>As the Deputy is aware the United Nations has for some time been considering the question of an instrument aimed at the protection and promotion of the human rights of persons with disabilities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The first meeting of the UN <i>ad hoc</i> committee to consider proposals for a comprehensive and <Col N="211" /> integral international convention on protection and promotion of the rights and dignity of persons with disabilities was held in New York from 29 July to 9 August 2002. Ireland was represented at the meeting by an official from my Department and a representative of the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform. The next meeting of the committee will be held from 16 to 27 June in New York.</P>
    <P>The EU is in the process of establishing its position in regard to the issues before the <i>ad hoc</i> committee. It would therefore be premature at this stage to comment on what this position might be.</P>

      <P>The talks which took place at Hillsborough last week marked a further significant development in the work in which the Governments and the parties in Northern Ireland have been engaged for several months. This work aims to facilitate the acts of completion necessary to implement all outstanding aspects of the Agreement fully and rapidly, including the restoration of the devolved institutions in Northern Ireland on a stable and inclusive basis.</P>
      <P>The Governments are convinced that the difficulties in the process cannot be reduced to a single item agenda and will best be addressed in a comprehensive framework that progresses and resolves all outstanding issues.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At Hillsborough, a significant degree of movement was witnessed over the two days of talks and we substantially closed the gaps in a number of key areas, including policing, criminal justice, and human rights and equality. While all the parties did not sign up to every aspect, there is nevertheless a shared understanding among them of <Col N="212" /> the steps that will be required to achieve acts of completion on all sides.</P>
    <P>The two Governments have consistently endeavoured to provide clarity and certainty and to set down the obligations and commitments necessary from all sides to restore full confidence and trust. The question of the monitoring of and compliance with commitments made has proven to be very difficult. Mindful of the sensitivity of the issue, the Governments have sought to find a way forward that meets the requirements for the inclusive operation of sustainable political institutions.</P>
    <P>Early next month, the Taoiseach and Prime Minister, Mr. Blair, will return to Northern Ireland to publish their final proposals. In the meantime, the parties will have the opportunity to assimilate the details and consult their members before coming to a conclusion. On account of the need to facilitate this process, the Assembly elections will be delayed by a few weeks and will now take place on 29 May. It is our intention that, on that day, the people of Northern Ireland should be able to pass their democratic verdict in the certain knowledge that the Agreement is fully operational and that the political institutions are both secure and sustainable.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 269, 290 and 293 together.</P>
      <P>From the outset, the Government has made it clear in the Dáil and in other fora such as the UN and EU that it favoured the resolution of the current crisis by the UN through peaceful means. It remains our strong hope that this will be possible, and we are encouraging the efforts being made by the international community to ensure this outcome. The Government take the position that war is not inevitable, that force must be used only as a last resort, that we support the work of the arms inspectors and that the unity and firmness of the international community will remain essential in achieving the full co-operation needed to attain the goal of disarming Iraq peacefully.</P>
      <P>The conclusions of the European Council of 17 February restated the European Union objective of full and effective Iraqi disarmament and the desire to achieve this peacefully. I am pleased at the level of consensus which this reflected. In our discussions we took full account of the deep public concerns about the possibility of conflict. Ireland made a significant contribution to the shaping of these conclusions. Every European Union Government is anxious to avoid war. That is why we want to see the disarmament of Iraq achieved through exclusively peaceful means, in accordance with Resolution 1441.</P>
      <P>We have supported, and during our term on the Security Council worked hard to further, the efforts of the international community to arrive at a solution to this issue which will compel the Iraqi authorities to meet their obligations without the need for resort to the actual use of military force. Ireland, as a member of the Security Council, played an active and constructive role in building the unanimous support for UN Security Council Resolution 1441. A unified and coherent approach within the Security Council is most likely to succeed in convincing Saddam Hussein to comply with Iraq's obligations.</P>
      <P>As regards what position would likely be taken at EU and UN level in the event of an outbreak of hostilities, I believe no useful purpose would be served by my speculation given the many uncertainties which apply at present.</P>

      <P>The basic principles applying to the Partnership for Peace, PfP, were set out in the PfP Framework Document of January 1994 and remain unchanged.</P>
      <P>The Framework Document sets out the political purposes of PfP, which include the protection of human rights; the safeguarding of freedom, justice and peace; the promotion of democracy; the maintenance of the principles of international law; fulfilment of the obligations of the UN Charter and OSCE commitments. A key principle which applies is that of &ldquo;self differentiation&rdquo; whereby each PfP country determines the nature, scope and limits of its participation.</P>
      <P>In accordance with the provisions of the Framework Document, the terms of Irish membership were set out in Ireland's presentation document for the PfP programme, approved by the Dáil on 8 November 1999. This document states, <i>inter alia,</i> that Ireland's decision to participate in PfP is in full accordance with Ireland's policy of military neutrality that has always been pursued in tandem with full and active support for collective security, based on international law. The presentation document also established our priorities for PfP membership, including peacekeeping and humanitarian operations.</P>
      <P>The number of non-NATO countries participating in PfP will fall from 27 to 20 after the lengthy accession process is completed for those countries from eastern Europe and the Baltic region that were accepted for NATO membership last November at the Prague Summit. From Ireland's perspective, a key aspect of this development is that no change to the underlying principles to PfP is envisaged. The core principle of self differentiation, to which I have already referred, will still apply. Ireland will continue to benefit from experience being gained in the peacekeeping area, especially through the development of enhanced inter-operability which is improving our ability to undertake peacekeeping operations in a safe and effective manner.</P>

      <P>I refer to my reply to Question No. 167 of 5 March 2003.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The past three years have seen consistent progress in the prevention of conflict and the estab<Col N="215" /> lishment of stable democratic structures in the countries of the western Balkans. Progress has been more uneven in the economic and institutional reform process and in the building of stable societies based on respect for human rights and the rule of law. Issues of continuing concern throughout the region include the prevalence of organised crime and unsatisfactory levels of co-operation with the international criminal tribunal for the former Yugoslavia.</P>
    <P>The EU is taking the lead role in building peace and stability in the region. The EU-western Balkans relationship will be reviewed at a summit meeting in Thessalonika on 21 June 2003, the day after the European Council, which will bring together the Heads of State and Government of the five states of the western Balkans, the EU member states, the accession states plus Bulgaria, Romania and Turkey. The summit will reaffirm the commitment of the EU to working with the countries of the region in the framework of the stabilisation and association process towards the prospect of their eventual integration into European structures. Ireland will play a full part in developing the relationship during 2003 and especially during our EU Presidency in the first half of 2004.</P>
    <P>In relation to the individual countries of the region, following intense negotiations, which were facilitated by the EU, the new federal state of Serbia and Montenegro was proclaimed on 4 February 2003, replacing the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. I welcome the progress which has been made in recent weeks in establishing the democratic institutions of the new state, including the election of the federal parliament and the election of federal President Svetozar Marovic on 7 March. Urgent progress is now required on the completion of the economic action plans which will enable movement towards the negotiation of a stabilisation and association agreement with the EU. The EU has also pointed out that, in common with other states and parties in the region, Serbia and Montenegro must demonstrate in the period ahead improved levels of co-operation with the international criminal tribunal for the former Yugoslavia.</P>
    <P>The situation in Kosovo remains the most uncertain in the region. Some progress has been made towards the achievement of a multi-ethnic society in line with Security Council Resolution 1244, but considerable work remains to be done. Ireland fully supports the work of the UN Mission in Kosovo and of the special representative of the Secretary General, Michael Steiner, including his initiative to invite political leaders in Belgrade and Pristina to meet to discuss practical issues of mutual concern. It is important at this stage that all parties, in Pristina and in Belgrade, concentrate on the development of a dialogue on practical issues for the benefit of the people of Kosovo and avoid unilateral initiatives which could endanger the stability of Kosovo and the region.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="216" />I have welcomed the wide-ranging economic and political reforms undertaken in the past three years in Croatia which enabled the conclusions of a stabilisation and association agreement with the EU in October 2001. Prime Minister Ivica Racan submitted Croatia's formal application for membership of the EU in Athens on 21 February. The application will be considered by the Council of Ministers, and the next step will be the formulation of a Commission opinion, which is expected to take about one year to complete.</P>
    <P>Elections were held in Bosnia Herzegovina in October 2002, and following protracted negotiations, a new Council of Ministers and Governments for the entities which make up the federation have been appointed in recent weeks. There is now an opportunity for greater progress in the reform process with close co-operation between the democratically elected Bosnian authorities and the international community, especially with the Office of the High Representative in Sarajevo, Lord Ashdown.</P>
    <P>In the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, the new coalition Government has made further progress in implementing the Ohrid framework agreement, which ended the conflict in the country in 2002. Framework agreement action plans were agreed by the signatories to the agreement on 3 February 2003. I welcome the effective working relationship being established between Prime Minister Crvenkovski and his coalition partner, Ali Ahmeti, the leader of the majority Albanian party, the DUI.</P>

      <P>The Government, in common with successive Governments, believes that the European Union is most effective when it acts in harmony and speaks with one voice. Naturally, as the European Union is made up of sovereign states, there can be different views among its members on any given topic. This reflects the very nature of the European Union, in which dialogue among the member states is the means whereby a common EU position is sought and very often achieved, irrespective of the issue at hand.</P>
      <P>The European Union plays an increasingly important role in the lives of its citizens, as well as an ever greater role in the wider world. Therefore, it is in the interest of both the citizens of the EU member states and of the international community as a whole when the EU can achieve a common position on key issues. The Government will continue to advocate the importance of solidarity among the member states and applicant countries.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>On 17 December 2002, I made a statement to the Dáil concerning the situation in Afghanistan. Since then, the progress towards a stable and democratic society in Afghanistan has continued. This process commenced with the signing of the Bonn agreement in December 2001. Working together, the Afghanistan transitional authority and the international community are working steadily towards the reconstruction of the social, economic and governmental infrastructure of the country.</P>
      <P>Since 17 December, the important process of drafting a new constitution for Afghanistan has advanced. President Karzai is preparing a decree detailing the main elements of the new constitutional process, and a constitutional commission is to be established for this purpose. Thereafter, public consultations on the new constitution are scheduled to take place between April and June this year.</P>
      <P>There has also been important progress on the preparation for the elections due to take place in June 2004. The UN Mission in Afghanistan, UNAMA, has already started organising the electoral process and co-ordinating the international assistance which has been offered.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A very welcome development in Afghanistan was the heavy fall of rain and snow last week. <Col N="218" /> There is widespread hope there that this may mark the end of the severe drought which the people have endured for the past six years. The impact of the end of the drought cannot be underestimated as it would have a huge effect on the agricultural and humanitarian situation which has been particularly devastating for the rural population.</P>
    <P>Other key developments under way include the reform of the national army and the creation of a national police force. Also on a positive note, on 10 February 2003 the leadership of the International Security Assistance Force, ISAF, with which Irish troops continue to serve in Kabul, was transferred smoothly from Turkey to Germany and the Netherlands.</P>
    <P>In light of this progress, it is unfortunate that the human rights and security situations in Afghanistan continue to raise concern. The Afghanistan poppy eradication programme has also met with opposition in the east of the country and there have been reports of attacks on the offices of some international organisations.</P>
    <P>The Government remains strongly committed to the process of reconstruction in Afghanistan. Our ambassador in Tehran, who will also serve as ambassador to Afghanistan, presented his credentials in Kabul last week. He held a series of meetings on the ground, with the Afghan authorities, Irish non-governmental organisations in the field and international organisations, which will be important for our assessment of the ongoing needs of the Afghan people and in further informing where Ireland's contribution can best be made. Ireland has provided more than &euro;14.2 million in funding to Afghanistan since 2000 which, I am pleased to report, makes us one of the leading international donors to Afghanistan on a <i>per capita</i> basis.</P>
    <P>Together with our EU partners, Ireland remains committed to and will continue to support the reconstruction and rehabilitation of Afghanistan to ensure that, with the help of the international community, it may emerge as a stable and peaceful democracy.</P>

    <P>More than ten years after the ending of the civil war in El Salvador, while there continues to be a high level of violent crime, political stability is now the norm, although in the run-up to the mid-term legislative elections on 16 March, there have been reports of violent incidents between followers of the two main political parties, the <Col N="219" /> Alianza Republicana Nacionalista, Arena, and the Frente Farabundo Marti para la Liberación Nacional, FMLN.</P>
    <P>The Arena Government of President Francisco Flores is pursuing liberal economic policies which have yet to bring significant tangible benefits to the great majority of Salvadorans and have encountered considerable public opposition, including a strike by public health workers marked by some violent incidents in recent months.</P>
    <P>The country is still suffering from the effects of Hurricane Mitch which hit Central America in October 1998. Growth prospects have also suffered a serious setback due to the drop in world coffee prices in recent times.</P>
    <P>According to the UN Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean, Eclac,, 50% of the El Salvador population live below the regional poverty line. If the Eclac target of reducing that figure to 30% by the year 2015 is to be met, a gross domestic product growth of 4.7% per annum would be required. This is an ambitious aspiration when it is noted that GDP growth in 2001 was 1.8%, 1.9% in 2002 and the forecast for 2003 is 2.2%.</P>
    <P>El Salvador is a member of the Central American integration system, CAIS. At the 18th ministerial conference between the countries of CAIS and the EU in Madrid on 18 May 2002, the two sides agreed to negotiate a political and co-operation agreement in the context of their joint commitment: &ldquo;to bolster the progress in the political, economic and social development of Central America and ensure that democratic processes are made irreversible, through the promotion and protection of human rights, transparency and the fight against corruption, the strengthening of the rule of law, good governance, access to justice and the role of civil society, which are factors that the two regions share and regard as crucial for their political and economic stability&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>For its part, the Irish Government, through Ireland Aid, will continue to support the dedicated efforts of non-governmental organisations in El Salvador and throughout Central America. The following table sets out details of Ireland Aid's assistance in El Salvador.</P>

      <P>Since the entry into force of the Amsterdam treaty in May 1999, the European Union has worked to make a constructive reality of the treaty's provisions on the Petersberg Tasks, namely, humanitarian and rescue tasks, peacekeeping tasks and tasks of combat forces in crisis management, including peacemaking, through the development of the European Security and Defence Policy, ESDP. The conclusions of European Council meetings since Cologne in June 1999 have provided political direction for the EU to develop an operational capacity, incorporating both civilian and military dimensions, for conducting Petersberg Tasks.</P>
      <P>Ireland has sought to play a positive and constructive role in the evolution of the ESDP. It is an inclusive project and it has been conceived and elaborated with the engagement of all EU member states, including Ireland. We have and will continue to participate actively in its ongoing development.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="221" />Ireland, in co-operation with other EU member states, especially the other neutral and non-aligned countries, has, for instance, helped to influence the overall parameters within which the ESDP operates by placing particular emphasis on the primary role of the United Nations Security Council for the maintenance of peace and security. This emphasis has been reflected in the conclusions of successive European Council meetings. Conflict prevention has also been at the core of the Union's approach and Ireland has worked to ensure that this centrally important dimension to ESDP is given prominence. I wish to see the continued development of the EU's role in the conflict prevention area.</P>
    <P>An important aspect of the ESDP is its intergovernmental nature and the application of unanimity to decisions taken by the Union in the security and defence area. This has helped to maintain Ireland's influence on developments in the ESDP area.</P>
    <P>Overall, Ireland and our EU partners must address the challenge of ensuring that the EU makes an effective contribution for a stable Europe and a more secure and just world. To this end, we will continue to work to influence the development of the ESDP.</P>

      <P>Ireland maintains bilateral aid agreements with <Col N="222" /> six countries in Africa, known as programme countries: Tanzania, Lesotho, Zambia, Ethiopia, Uganda and Mozambique.</P>
      <P>These agreements are given practical effect in the form of triennial country strategy papers, CSPs, agreed between Ireland and partner Governments. CSPs cover all aspects of our development aid relationship with the country concerned and outline both the priorities for assistance and the financial envelope within which such programmes are to be funded. CSPs also govern the terms of our partnership with the Governments of South Africa and East Timor.</P>
      <P>The report of the Ireland Aid review committee published in 2002 recommended, <i>inter alia,</i> that:</P>
      <P>At least one and possibly two new programme countries might be selected from the Least Developed Countries in that region (sub-Saharan Africa) whose needs are acute and which could be expected to respond well to an Ireland Aid engagement building on the experience gained from existing bilateral programmes.</P>
      <P>The review goes on to outline the criteria for the selection of new countries and makes a further recommendation in relation to Asia:</P>
      <P>Without diluting the focus of the bilateral programme on sub-Saharan Africa, the Committee recommends that Ireland Aid explore the scope for adding a new programme country in Asia. A number of Least Developed Countries in South East Asia appear suitable candidates. . . .</P>

      <P>As I have made clear on previous occasions, it is not the policy of the Government to draw up a league table of countries deemed guilty of the worst human rights abuses.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Together with our EU partners, the Government monitors the human rights situations in many countries throughout the world on the basis of information obtained from a variety of sources, including non-governmental organisations. Where the situation warrants, we make known our concerns about human rights violations to the Governments in question, either directly or through action at the UN General Assembly and the UN Commission on Human Rights. At these bodies the EU regularly makes statements on the human rights situations in a number of countries <Col N="223" /> from all regions. Ireland is fully associated with these statements. The EU also introduces or supports resolutions dealing with specific countries.</P>
    <P>Active participation in multilateral organisations such as the EU, UN and the Council of Europe provides an occasion where Ireland can voice its concerns regarding human rights abuses. Through these organisations, international pressure can be brought to bear on those responsible for the violation of human rights.</P>
    <P>The Government will continue to use these mechanisms as a means of highlighting violation of human rights and furthering their protection.</P>

      <P>A referendum on the adoption of a new constitution, and presidential and legislative elections to establish functioning, democratic institutions are scheduled to take place in Rwanda in 2003, thus completing the transition phase that followed the 1994 genocide.</P>
      <P>The consequences of the 1994 genocide continue to dominate Rwandan political life and will impact on the upcoming elections. Freedom of association for political parties is restricted as only the eight parties that signed the 1994 power-sharing agreement are registered. Freedom of assembly is also restricted and political parties are limited to acting only within the transitional National Assembly and their political bureau. They are not free to meet at provincial and local level or hold public meetings. Freedom of speech is also subject to restrictions. Public television and radio is under the control of the Government.</P>
      <P>Ireland and our EU partners will continue to press the authorities in Rwanda to ensure that conditions conducive to open and democratic elections are put in place, thereby laying solid and durable foundations for peace, democracy and reconciliation in Rwanda. We will encourage the liberalisation of political activities. We will continue to monitor freedom of expression, particularly the freedom of the media, in the run-up to the election.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="224" />At the General Affairs and External Relations Council on 21 October 2002, the EU adopted a revised Common Position on Rwanda which aims to support national reconciliation, reconstruction and development, the protection and promotion of human rights and fundamental civil liberties, and the transition to democracy. The Common Position encourages inclusive dialogue, improved power-sharing, democratisation and the protection of minorities. It emphasises the importance of the new constitution guaranteeing effective protection of civil and political rights and safeguarding fundamental rights and freedoms. The Common Position focuses on the presidential and parliamentary elections, stressing the need to ensure that political parties are able to participate freely in the elections. Regarding human rights, it encourages the Government of Rwanda to continue its co-operation with the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights and to ensure the independent and effective functioning of the national human rights commission.</P>
    <P>The Rwandan authorities are endeavouring to solve the problem posed by overcrowded prisons, decrease the pressure on its overburdened judicial system and, eventually, achieve reconciliation among the population. In this context, local courts known as Gacaca have been set up to try genocide suspects who are still being detained but who are not wanted by the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda, and community leaders are being trained to act as judges. The EU has welcomed the launch of the Gacaca tribunals and has called on the Government of Rwanda to ensure that Gacaca justice is administered in line with international human rights standards.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government is committed to the active promotion of full observance of universal human rights standards and opposes and seeks the elimination of all contemporary forms of slavery. Contemporary forms of slavery include practices such as bonded labour, the sale of children, child prostitution, child pornography and trafficking in persons. The Government is also opposed to all acts and practices which degrade or exploit human beings.</P>
      <P>Through its participation at international fora such as the UN General Assembly, the UN Commission on Human Rights, the Council of Europe and the OSCE, Ireland raises its concerns in tandem with like-minded countries regarding these issues.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For example, at the 58th session of the UN Commission on Human Rights, Ireland co-spon<Col N="225" /> sored a number of resolutions on these issues, including that on trafficking in women and girls.</P>
    <P>The UN body with responsibility for the study of all aspects of slavery is the working group on contemporary forms of slavery. Ireland has provided financial assistance to the UN voluntary trust fund on contemporary forms of slavery with the purpose of assisting involved non-governmental organisations to participate in the working group and to provide assistance to individual victims of such practices.</P>
    <P>The reality of trafficking as an affront to human dignity and, as a threat to security and stability, was recognised by Ireland and our EU partners in a statement to the Organisation for Security and Co-operation in Europe, OSCE, human dimension implementation meeting held in Warsaw from 9 to 19 September last.</P>
    <P>More recently at the OSCE tenth Ministerial Council held in Porto from 6 to 7 December last, where Ministers adopted a declaration on trafficking in human beings, my colleague the Minister for Rural, Community and Gaeltacht Affairs, Deputy Éamon Ó Cuív, in a statement, condemned trafficking as a modern form of slavery.</P>
    <P>I welcome the decision of the incoming Dutch chair to make trafficking in all its forms the focal theme for next year's economic forum of the OSCE.</P>
    <P>The importance of addressing trafficking in persons has been recognised by Ireland and our EU partners. Article 5 of the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights provides that no one should be held in slavery or be required to perform forced or compulsory labour. It also prohibits trafficking in human beings.</P>
    <P>Ireland, along with all other EU member states and the European Commission has signed the UN Convention on Transnational Organised Crime and its two accompanying protocols on prevention, suppression and punishment of trafficking in persons, especially women and children, and smuggling of migrants by land, air or sea. The protocol on trafficking not only provides for measures to suppress trafficking but also for measures to protect the victims of trafficking.</P>
    <P>The persistence of contemporary forms of slavery, a most fundamental abuse of human rights, presents a challenge to all governments. The Irish Government will continue to highlight and address this issue at every appropriate opportunity.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 285 and 291 together.</P>
      <P>The Government's national programme of assistance to developing countries comprises two elements. The major component is my Department's Vote for international co-operation, &euro;374 million in 2003, while elements of official development assistance, ODA, expected to total some &euro;80 million in 2003, are administered by other Departments.</P>
      <P>Total ODA has increased substantially in recent years, from &euro;177 million in 1998 to &euro;420 million in 2002 and this year is expected to reach &euro;450 million. These increases have been pursuant to the Government's commitment to achieving the UN target for ODA of 0.7% of gross national product by the end of 2007.</P>
      <P>The scale and timing of the increases in funding required to achieve the 0.7% target by 2007 will be reviewed on an ongoing basis. While increased resources will enable us to broaden and deepen our support across all areas of the aid programme, it is anticipated that priority will continue to be given to a small number of least developed countries in sub-Saharan Africa &ndash; the programme countries: Ethiopia, Lesotho, Uganda, Tanzania, Mozambique and Zambia. These are among the poorest countries in the world and receive the largest share of our bilateral assistance.</P>

      <P>Presidential, parliamentary and state elections will be held in Nigeria in April and May 2003. The elections are of particular importance to the future political course of Nigeria. Four years after the end of a long period of military rule, the challenge for Nigeria will be to manage effectively the holding of free and fair elections.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>EU missions in Abuja have been in close contact with the country's independent national election commission, INEC, to monitor its plans for the organisation of elections at which an estimated 65 million Nigerians will be eligible to <Col N="227" /> vote. As can be appreciated, this is a considerable undertaking for any country. The EU Common Position on Nigeria, which was adopted in May 2002, identifies the development of a democratic culture in Nigeria as a key area of EU support. Consequently, the European Commission programme of support for the 2003 elections has been agreed at &euro;6.5 million. The programme includes civic and voter education; capacity building and training for election observers; and monitoring and technical assistance to the INEC.</P>
    <P>The elections have generated considerable interest in Nigeria and internationally. More than 1,000 international election observers are expected to monitor the conduct of the election campaigns as well as the elections themselves. An EU exploratory mission visited Nigeria in November 2002 to assess the pre-election situation and the feasibility of sending an EU mission to observe the elections. On 3 February, Nigeria's Foreign Minister wrote to President Prodi pledging the commitment of the Government of Nigeria to the holding of free and fair elections and extending an invitation to the EU to send observers. An EU election observation mission is being prepared and Ireland is planning to provide observers to the mission.</P>
    <P>A successful series of elections this year will serve to deepen and strengthen the democratic process in Nigeria. For these reasons, the forthcoming elections in Nigeria will continue to be treated with the utmost priority by Ireland and our EU partners.</P>

      <P>The core objectives of the Ireland Aid programme continue to be poverty reduction and sustainable development. Meeting the basic human needs of some of the poorest people in the world and improving their access to food, water, health services, sanitation, education and employment are key goals of the programme, at both bilateral and multilateral level. The centrality of fighting pov<Col N="228" /> erty, which guides the range of activities supported by Ireland Aid, was reaffirmed in the recent report of the Ireland Aid review committee.</P>
      <P>The main geographical focus of the bilateral programme is sub-Saharan Africa, the poorest region in the world. Ireland Aid provides long-term development assistance to six programme countries &ndash; Lesotho, Zambia, Tanzania, Uganda, Mozambique and Ethiopia &ndash; as well as South Africa within the framework of three year country strategy papers, CSPs. In line with other donors we operate in the main through our partner Governments and agree with them the priorities for the country strategies to ensure that Ireland Aid programmes respond effectively to their development needs. This is standard practice in building up government capacity and strengthening their sense of ownership of the development process.</P>
      <P>Ensuring that the aid we provide reaches those for whom it is intended is of fundamental importance to the Ireland Aid programme. Our systems and procedures are designed with this in mind and are constantly under review. The bilateral country programmes are subject to annual external audit by reputable accountancy firms. The programmes and projects which form part of the overall programme are themselves audited. In addition, the evaluation and audit unit of Ireland Aid carries out a series of evaluations of programme activities to ensure, <i>inter alia,</i> that the assistance which we provide reaches its targeted beneficiaries at all times.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Mr. N. Dempsey)</NameTxt>
      <P>School insurance arrangements have evolved in a manner that reflects the different traditions and structures of the voluntary secondary, comprehensive and community and VEC sectors.</P>
      <P>In the case of voluntary secondary schools, it is a matter for the managerial authorities of individual schools to arrange insurance cover on school property and against public liability. Grant aid towards voluntary secondary school funding costs are provided by my Department by way of <i>per capita </i>grants which may be used for this purpose. In the case of vocational schools and colleges, the relevant vocational education committee arranges insurance cover. With regard to community and comprehensive schools, the State provides a general indemnity to the authorities of these schools in lieu of their taking out insurance cover against liabilities which may arise.</P>
      <P>Since 1997, the Government has made significant improvements in the level of funding to voluntary secondary schools. For example, the standard <i>per capita </i>grant in 1997 was &euro;224.74. This has been increased to &euro;266.49 in the current school year. An additional <i>per capita </i>grant of &euro;38.09 is paid to disadvantaged schools bringing the total <i>per capita </i>grant in the case of these schools to more than &euro;300. In addition, under the school services support initiative, second level schools have benefited from further significant increases in the support grant from &euro;25.40 per pupil in the year 2000 to &euro;99 per pupil over this school year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Further improvements also include a range of equalisation measures designed to reduce historic <Col N="230" /> anomalies in the funding arrangements for the different school types at second level. Under the terms of a recent equalisation measure, the support services grant was further increased by &euro;28 per pupil with effect from September 2002. This brought the support services grant in the case of secondary schools to &euro;116.88 per pupil from September 2002 and to &euro;127 per pupil from 1 January 2003. This increase is in addition to the range of equalisation grants of up to &euro;15,554 per school, &euro;44.44 per pupil, per annum approved for secondary schools in December 2001. For a school with 500 pupils, this amounts to extra funding of up to &euro;100,000 per annum, and annual grants of &euro;236,761, &euro;255,811 in the case of disadvantaged schools, towards general expenses and support services, including insurance costs.</P>
    <P>In the case of Ardscoil Rís my Department recently provided capital grant aid in the amount of &euro;66,343.95 for works which the school's insurance company required to be carried out, to ensure continuance of insurance cover.</P>
    <P>With regard to the provision of a computer room at the school, an application in this matter is under consideration in the planning section of my Department. Consistent with normal practice, an examination of all relevant issues is being undertaken with a view to determining the long-term accommodation needs of the school. This analysis, when complete, together with the school's long-term projected enrolment, will provide a basis for making a decision on the school's request.</P>
    <P>The 2003 school building programme has been published and is available on my Department's website at www.education.ie. Given the level of financial commitments to be met from projects already in construction, I do not envisage that my Department will be in a position during this year to initiate architectural planning for any further building projects, including the provision of a computer room at Ardscoil Rís. The project will, however, be considered for the 2004 capital programme.</P>

      <P>The Deputy may be aware that the programme, Giving Children an Even Break, was launched in 2001 to tackle educational disadvantage at primary level. Schools participating in the programme are in receipt of a range of additional supports including teacher posts and other non-teaching supports, to be targeted at disadvantaged pupils. The additional supports to be provided reflect the level of concentration of pupils from educationally disadvantaged backgrounds in each school invited to participate in the programme. These levels of disadvantage were established as a result of a comprehensive survey of primary schools carried out by the Educational Research Centre, ERC, in March and April 2000 at the request of my Department. All the schools identified as having pupils enrolled with characteristics of disadvantage have been invited to participate in Giving Children an Even Break.</P>
      <P>The aim of the survey was to gain an indication of the level of disadvantage in each school using principals' responses to a questionnaire comprised of items relating to disadvantage. Any school in which there was at least one pupil which satisfied any of the criteria associated with socio-economic disadvantage was entitled to additional resources under Giving Children an Even Break.</P>
      <P>Resources were allocated to schools on a sliding scale, and schools with greater proportions of pupils from disadvantaged backgrounds were allocated proportionately more resources than those with fewer numbers of such pupils.</P>
      <P>In the urban dimension, schools identified as having the highest concentration of pupils with characteristics that are associated with educational disadvantage have been considered for additional staffing to implement a maximum class size of 20:1 in junior classes &ndash; infants through second class &ndash; and 27:1 in senior classes &ndash; third through sixth class.</P>
      <P>Based on data supplied by the school to the ERC, the school was selected in 2001 for inclusion in this category. In addition, the school in question was allocated additional funding based on the percentage of disadvantaged pupils enrolled as estimated by the Educational Research Centre survey carried out in 2000.</P>
      <P>Unfortunately, the school referred to by the Deputy misinterpreted a question on the survey form which resulted in miscalculation of points by the ERC. In consequence, the ERC has now re-examined the data supplied in the survey form submitted in 2000 and calculated the correct points total in respect of the school. The total is lower than that on which the original level of staffing and funding allocation granted to the school in question under Giving Children an Even Break was based.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Following this correction, the school in question does not fall into the category of schools con<Col N="232" /> sidered for additional teaching staff under Giving Children An Even Break. In addition, the level of funding allocated to the school is no longer appropriate based on the revised points awarded. The post allocated to the school will be suppressed at the end of the 2002-03 school year and the teacher in question will be placed on the diocesan teaching panel. In addition, the amended funding entitlement under Giving Children an Even Break in respect of the 2002-03 school year has been offset against the amount overpaid for the 2000-01 and 2001-02 school years.</P>
    <P>Having regard for the amount of funding available and the selection criteria, I regret that it is not possible to accede to the school's appeal. Tackling educational disadvantage remains a key priority of my Department.</P>

      <P>Following the NEPS review, the school was advised in February 2003 that the supports sought could not be sanctioned.

      <P>Under EU rules, where projects are financed on a deferred payment basis by the private sector, such as public private partnerships, the capital value of such projects is a charge on the general Government balance over the construction phase. The GGB is the critical measure of what can be accommodated within our obligations under the Stability and Growth Pact of the Maastricht Treaty. A EUROSTAT group is currently reviewing the accounting rules on this issue, as will a standing committee established by my colleague, the Minister for Finance, to advise on the GGB implications of private sector financed projects. Consideration of any new PPP projects will also be based on an evaluation of the completed pilot PPP schools project, together with a thorough assessment of affordability of the project in the context of the competing demands on the likely capital funding envelopes going forward and taking into account the issues surrounding the general Government balance.</P>

      <P>In 2002 my Department introduced the school completion programme, SCP, which is a new and significantly expanded programme to deal with early school leaving incorporating the learning, experience and best practice derived from previous early school leaving initiatives, mainly the eight to 15 early school leaver initiative, ESLI, and the stay in school retention initiative at second level, SSRI. The objective of the school completion programme is to provide a range of interventions in areas of disadvantage that support the retention of young people in education. It is based on an integrated approach involving primary and post-primary schools, parents, communities and relevant statutory and voluntary agencies.</P>
      <P>Sites for participation in the programme were selected on the basis of a detailed analysis of pupil retention rates at second level using my Department's post-primary pupils database. Based on this analysis and having regard to the funding available, 82 project sites &ndash; 65 new project sites together with the existing 17 ESLI projects &ndash; were selected to participate in the school completion programme. In addition to the 82 school completion projects, my Department is continuing to support 53 second level schools which were funded previously under the stay in school retention initiative but were not selected for the project strand of this programme on this occasion. These 53 schools, which includes the school referred to by the Deputy, will be supported under the stay in school retention strand of SCP up to 31 August 2005.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Having regard to the amount of funding available to the school completion programme in the future, any decision to include further project <Col N="241" /> sites will be based on a selection process using the most current detailed analysis of pupil retention rates at second level from my Department's post-primary pupil database.</P>

      <P>EU Directive 89/48/EEC provides for a general system for the recognition of higher education diplomas awarded on completion of professional education and training of at least three years' duration. My Department is responsible for monitoring and co-ordinating those cases where citizens of other EU member states seek recognition of qualifications as provided for by this directive in order to practice their profession in Ireland. The European Commission is the guardian of the treaty and infringements or alleged infringements of it is a matter in the first instance for the Commission and ultimately for the Court of Justice. The issue of making representations to the European Commission on behalf of Irish nationals who encounter difficulties in other member states in the context of the recognition of qualifications is a matter for the Department of Foreign Affairs.</P>

      <P>A school may appoint teachers within the limit of its approved teaching post allocation. It may also engage substitute teachers in respect of teachers, within its approved teacher allocation, who are absent on approved leave. School management is required to manage its curriculum and staff timetables within its approved staffing limits. In addition to its normal allocation for the 2002-3 school year, the school referred to by the Deputy was granted 1.82 extra wholetime equiv<Col N="242" /> alent teaching posts to meet particular curricular needs and was also allowed to retain four surplus teaching posts on an over quota basis. In the particular situation referred to by the Deputy, it was found that recoupment was claimed by the school in respect of a substitute teacher who was employed outside the approved teacher allocation for 2002-3. The overclaimed recoupment was recovered by my Department.</P>

I met with representatives of the school retention committee in October last and, notwithstanding all previous reviews, I undertook to have my officials again re-examine all the issues, including the most up-to-date demographic data from census 2002, housing and planning applications data from the local authorities, pupil movement into and out of the catchment area and the capacity of the neighbouring schools.</P>
      <P>Following this review, I arrived at the definitive conclusion that there is no basis for the retention of a second level school in the area concerned. I am satisfied that there is sufficient capacity overall in the remaining schools in the catchment area to meet the projected post-primary education needs of pupils in this area. All the relevant parties have been advised of my decision.</P>

      <P>Under the terms of my Department's free fees initiative, tuition fees are payable in respect of eligible EU nationals who have been ordinarily resident in an EU member state for at least three of the five years preceding entry to their third level course. This condition applies equally to all EU nationals, in accordance with a judgment of the European Court of Justice that access to vocational training must apply equally to all EU nationals.</P>
      <P>Under the terms of my Department's maintenance grant schemes grants are payable to candidates holding EU nationality who fulfil certain conditions pertaining to residence, nationality, means and previous academic attainment. To fulfil the residency requirement, a candidate's parents, or in the case of an independent mature candidate, the candidate herself or himself, must have been resident in the State from 1 October of the year prior to entry on an approved course. The awarding body has discretion to waive this requirement in exceptional circumstances.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Candidates who are EU nationals and who do not meet the residency requirement in the grants schemes are eligible to apply for a means tested fees only grant in respect of approved courses in <Col N="247" /> third level institutions in this State, provided they have been ordinarily resident, for a purpose other than wholly or mainly to receive full-time education in an EU member state from 1 October of the year prior to entry to college. This provision mainly applies where the student in question does not qualify for free fees under the criteria set out in the free fees initiative.</P>
    <P>It is not possible at this point to assess accurately the effects which the proposed increase in tuition fees in the UK will have in terms of increased applications from the UK for entry into third level courses in this State. My Department is currently undertaking a review of existing student support provisions with the aim of ensuring that the benefits of the substantial investment being made are maximised.</P>

      <P>My Department funds three means tested maintenance grant schemes for third level education students in respect of attendance on approved courses in approved third level institutions: the higher education grants, HEG, scheme; the vocational education committees, VEC, scholarship scheme; and the third level maintenance grants scheme for trainees, TLT. Under the terms of the HEG scheme and the VEC scholarship scheme, candidates who have previously pursued an undergraduate course approved for the purposes of any of the third level schemes are not eligible to be considered for grant assistance until they have completed an equivalent period of study at undergraduate level. The awarding body has discretion to waive this provision in exceptional circumstances, such as certified serious illness.</P>
      <P>However, the position of repeat students pursuing national certificate and diploma courses under the TLT scheme differs from that of students pursuing a repeat period of study under the other two third level schemes. In general, a grant holder may only receive funding for the approved duration of one third level training, TLT, course. However, subject to a maximum duration of four years in all, where trainees have passed, failed or not completed the first year of a course, they are allowed to transfer to a different course and receive a grant for the normal duration of the new course.</P>
      <P>An Agreed Programme for Government of June 2002 contains a commitment to introduce the payment of maintenance grants through a unified and flexible grant payment scheme. The variations between the schemes referred to above will be considered in that context.</P>

      <P>Under the terms of the higher education grants scheme administered by the local authorities under the aegis of my Department, the position is that students who are entering approved courses for the first time are eligible for grants where they satisfy the relevant conditions as to residence, means, nationality and previous academic attainment. The candidate's reckonable income for the purposes of the means test is his or her gross income from all sources and the gross income of his or her parents or guardians, where applicable, with certain specified social welfare and health board payments being exempt. Grant assistance may not be awarded in any case where the reckonable income exceeds the prescribed income limits for the award of a grant.</P>
      <P>However, the schemes contain a change in circumstances clause whereby the eligibility of a person may be assessed or re-assessed by the grant awarding body in the event of changes in circumstances relating to, <i>inter alia,</i> the candidate's reckonable income, which are likely to be permanent. Apart from the maintenance grants schemes, my Department also provides funding to approved third level institutions in the State to operate a student assistance fund. The objective of the fund is to assist those students who might, due to their financial circumstances, be unable to continue their third level studies. The fund does not extend to students pursuing courses of study outside the State.</P>

      <Quest>the evaluation which was carried out on the likely costs associated with court cases that might be taken by persons alleging abuse in residential institutions who would choose to seek redress through the courts rather than through the Residential Institutions Redress Board; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. N. Dempsey Mr. N. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Mr. N. Dempsey)</NameTxt>
      <P>In May 1999 the Government publicly recognised that abuse had occurred in residential institutions which were under the State's supervision. A significant number of former residents of reformatory and industrial schools who alleged abuse had initiated court proceedings against the State following that apology. The Government decided to set the Residential Institutions Redress Board to provide an alternative mechanism for victims of abuse and allow victims a less adversarial alternative to having to process their claims for compensation through the courts. The decision to set up the scheme was based in equity and justice for the victims. Therefore, the potential legal costs if all cases were to proceed to the courts were not a factor in the Government's decision and no evaluation as to those potential legal costs was undertaken. In any event, it would have been difficult to carry out such an evaluation with any degree of accuracy, as every case is different.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy is aware, the Compensation Advisory Committee recommended a scale of awards having examined on the level of awards made for personal injury in the Irish courts. These recommendations have been made into regulations for use by the redress board. It would be reasonable to expect therefore that the overall cost of awards in legal cases would not exceed the overall cost of awards by the redress board. However, as the redress board will make awards based on medical evidence, and will be speedier and less adversarial than the courts, I expect that the level of legal costs associated with cases dealt with by the redress board should be lower than if all cases were to proceed through the courts.</P>

      <P>In line with a PPF commitment to mainstream certain services which were previously provided by FÁS, my Department secured the transfer of &euro;58.4 million per annum on a phased basis between 2001 and 2003, as the FÁS school based CE schemes come to an end. The availability of this funding has enabled significant progress in relation to the provision of secretarial and caretaking services to schools by putting in place an equitable system of funding for ancillary services throughout the free education system.</P>

    <P>At second level, the extra funding continues to be allocated to schools under the schools services <Col N="251" /> support fund that was introduced in September 2000.

In the school year 2001-2002 Gorey Community School received &euro;89,453 under the schools services support fund. In the year 2002-2003 the school will receive &euro;152,046 based upon an enrolment of 1,590 pupils and in the year 2003/2004 will receive &euro;157,410 based upon the same enrolment numbers.

    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. N. Dempsey Mr. N. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Mr. N. Dempsey)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy may be aware that Giving Children an Even Break was launched in 2001 to tackle educational disadvantage at primary level. Schools participating in Giving Children an Even Break are in receipt of a range of additional supports, including teacher posts and other non-teaching supports to be targeted at disadvantaged pupils. The additional supports to be provided reflect the level of concentration of pupils from educationally disadvantaged backgrounds in each school invited to participate in the programme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These levels of disadvantage were established as a result of a comprehensive survey of primary schools carried out by the Educational Research Centre, ERC, in March-April 2000 at the request of my Department. All the schools identified as having pupils enrolled with characteristics of disadvantage have been invited to participate in Giving Children an Even Break. The aim of the survey was to gain an indication of the level of disadvantage in each school using principals' responses to a questionnaire comprised of items relating to disadvantage. Any school in which there was at least one pupil which satisfied any of the criteria associated with socio-economic disadvantage was entitled to additional resources under Giving Children an Even Break. Resources were allocated to schools on a sliding scale and <Col N="255" /> schools with greater proportions of pupils from disadvantaged backgrounds were allocated proportionately more resources than those with fewer numbers of such pupils.</P>
    <P>In the urban dimension, schools identified as having the highest concentration of pupils with characteristics that are associated with educational disadvantage, have been considered for additional staffing to implement a maximum class size of 20:1 in junior classes, infants through second class, and 27:1 in senior classes, third through sixth class. Based on data supplied by the schools to the ERC, the two schools to which the Deputy refers were selected in 2001 for inclusion in this category. In addition, both schools were allocated additional funding based on the percentage of disadvantage pupils enrolled as estimated by the Educational Research Centre survey carried out in 2000.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately, the schools referred to by the Deputy misinterpreted a question on the survey form which resulted in miscalculation of points by the ERC. In consequence, the ERC has now re-examined the data supplied in the survey forms submitted in 2000 and calculated the correct points total in respect of both schools. In each case, the total is lower than that on which the original level of staffing and funding allocation granted to the schools in question under Giving Children an Even Break was based. Following this correction, both of the schools in question do <Col N="256" /> not fall into the category of schools considered for additional teaching staff under Giving Children An Even Break. In addition, the level of funding allocated to the schools is no longer appropriate based on the revised points awarded. The posts allocated to the schools in question will be suppressed at the end of the 2002-2003 school year and the teachers in question will be placed on the diocesan teaching panel. In addition, the amended funding entitlement under Giving Children an Even Break in respect of the 2002-2003 school year has been offset against the amount overpaid for the 2000-2001 and 2001-2002 school years. Having regard for the amount of funding available under this initiative and the selection criteria, I regret that it is not possible to accede to their appeal.</P>

      <P>The review of student support provisions is currently being undertaken within my Department, with the aim of ensuring that the benefits of the substantial investment being made are maximised, in accordance with the following terms of reference: &ldquo;To review the present system of tuition fees and student supports, having regard to international experience, in order to provide options for the Minister's consideration with a view to ensuring greater equity in access to and participation in higher education.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The review is considering various options, including a review of schemes in operation in a number of OECD countries. Officials of my Department are conducting the review. However, some issues require the engagement of external expertise. In this regard, the Economic and Social Research Institute has undertaken work to enable my Department to estimate the cost of various options. The review is one being undertaken by my Department officials who are having regard to all relevant reports and policy documents, including the report of the Action Group on Access to Third Level Education which was launched in July 2001. The action group members, who were representative of a large number of interest groups and bodies, sought and considered a large number of submissions. Accordingly, consultations have not taken place with outside bodies nor have submissions been sought.</P>

      <P>My Department funds three means tested maintenance grant schemes for third level education students in respect of attendance on approved courses in approved third level institutions and one maintenance grant scheme in respect of students attending approved post leaving certificate courses. Students who are entering approved courses at undergraduate or postgraduate level for the first time are eligible for maintenance grants where they satisfy the relevant conditions as to residence, means, nationality and previous academic attainments.</P>
      <P>Apart from the maintenance grants schemes and the free fees initiative, under which my Department meets the cost of tuition fees for eligible undergraduate students in approved institutions, financial support is also available to students in approved third level institutions through the student assistance fund. The objectives of the fund, which is ESF aided, are to assist students, in a sensitive and compassionate manner, who might otherwise, due to their financial circumstances, be unable to continue their third level studies.</P>
      <P>My Department is at present conducting a review of student support provisions aimed at ensuring that the benefits of the substantial investment being made are maximised, in accordance with the following terms of reference: &ldquo;To review the present system of tuition fees and student supports, having regard to international experience, in order to provide options for the Minister's consideration with a view to ensuring greater equity in access to and participation in higher education.&rdquo;</P>

      <Quest>if he will review the decision of school transport in relation to a person (details supplied) in County Kildare in view of the fact that this person's children commenced school in Sallins National School in 1988; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <P>A school transport service to a national school may be established or retained where there is a sufficient number of eligible children, living in a distinct locality, offering for transport to their nearest national school. A minimum of seven eligible pupils are required to establish a service. In order to be eligible for free transport, children must live at least two miles from their nearest school and be attending that school.</P>
      <P>The position in this case is that the family in question were not attending their nearest school and, accordingly, were given concessionary transport only on an existing service to Sallins National School. As there were no eligible pupils offering for transport to Sallins National School from the area concerned, the service had to be withdrawn. In the circumstances, a review of the case would serve no useful purpose.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources (Mr. D. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>The provision of communications infrastructure and services is a matter for the private sector companies that operate in the fully liberalised telecommunications market with reference to the direction and supervision of the Commission for Communications Regulation. To accelerate the delivery of faster and cheaper communications services throughout the country by the private sector, my Department has run a number of programmes of targeted intervention in recent years.</P>
      <P>In 1999, under the National Development Plan 1994-1999 and INTERREG II, &euro;26.5 million was made available to support the roll-out of broadband to the regions. Some 13 projects which rolled-out broadband infrastructure nation-wide to a value, both public and private funding, of &euro;70 million were supported and are now completed. One of the projects funded under this measure was undertaken by Esat. The project involved the roll-out of fibre optic cable in many urban areas, including Dundalk. The 4,500 metre Dundalk ring services Dundalk Regional Technical College, the Finnabair Industrial Estate and the Coes Road Industrial Estate.</P>
      <P>Under the National Development Plan 2000-2006, approximately &euro;200 million was allocated under the two regional communications and e-commerce measures. Funding under these measures is intended to leverage and accelerate investment in competitive advanced information and communications infrastructure and services. This will enhance the potential for the development of electronic commerce facilities and enable the electronic provision of public services, including education services, virtual libraries, welfare and health services.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="262" />A first call for proposals was run in 2000 and, on foot of submissions received, nine contracts were signed at the beginning of 2001 which will result in additional investment in the regions in broadband infrastructure and increased availability of broadband services for business and residential users. The projects involved are scheduled to be completed by the end of 2003 and will entail an overall investment of &euro;160 million in broadband leveraged from grant assistance of approximately &euro;55 million. Projects funded under this call include the construction of a new national fibre backbone by ESB Telecom which will serve both Drogheda and Dundalk and accelerating Esat BT's roll-out of DSL in 40 locations, including Drogheda. I also understand that Eircom is offering DSL services in Drogheda and Dundalk.</P>
    <P>The broadband programme announced in March 2002 will result in the construction of open access metropolitan area fibre optic networks in upwards of 19 towns around the country. By reducing the cost of access to fibre rings, these networks will facilitate the provision by the private sector of &ldquo;always on&rdquo;, low cost and high speed Internet access to consumers, educational establishments, industry and business. It is expected that these projects will be completed progressively over the next two years at a cost in the region of &euro;60 million. My Department is currently in discussions with the Department of Finance representatives regarding a proposal from local authorities in the north east to construct further fibre optic networks in a number of locations in the north east, including County Louth.</P>
    <P>My Department is also exploring the potential of wireless based technologies to promote the deployment of broadband access in Ireland, particularly in remote areas. Pilot projects utilising Wireless LAN technologies in diverse user communities to assess their suitability as a platform for the delivery of advanced broadband services in the regions included are currently under way. Five projects have been recommended for funding of &euro;260,510, including one by Digiweb to provide services in County Louth. It is intended that the projects will run from January to October 2003.</P>

      <P>Under the EU-Norway Salmon Agreement anti-dumping and countervailing measures remain in place since October 1997 in regard to farmed salmon imports from Norway. No measures are in place in regard to imports from either the Faeroes or Chile. The results of investigations last year by the EU Commission of alleged dumping by Norway, the Faeroe Islands and Chile of farmed Atlantic salmon on the EU market were published by the Commission immediately before Christmas. The question of putting in place any future measures in respect of either Norway, <Col N="264" /> the Faeroes or Chile is dependent on the outcome of these investigations.</P>
      <P>The Commission has recommended the termination of proceedings without the imposition of any measures on imports into the Community. The findings and recommendations of the report were rejected by Ireland and the UK, particularly the conclusion that there is no imminent threat of dumping by Norway. In the context of the threat to Community producers from large scale low priced imports, Ireland advised that it would be prudent to monitor market trends over the coming months to reflect further on the conclusions and reconsider the matter. Because of the views of Ireland and the UK, the Commission has agreed to allow a further short period of reflection to consider all objective criteria raised by industry and by member states since publication of the documents. It should be noted, however, that Ireland and the UK are alone in opposing the Commission's proposal to terminate the proceedings. My Department, together with the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, are continuing to monitor the situation and maintain close contact with the Commission and other relevant parties in a bid to secure a satisfactory outcome to this issue.</P>

      <P>The national grid is normally understood to refer to transmission rather than distribution. Eirgrid plc was established as the independent transmission system operator under the European Communities (Internal Market in Electricity) Regulations 2000 (SI 445 of 2000). The company was formally incorporated on 7 February 2001 and received its certificate to commence trading on 14 February 2001. It has been licensed by the CER. An infrastructure agreement to govern the relationship between Eirgrid and ESB is being finalised under the supervision of the CER. A transfer scheme for the staff involved as between ESB and Eirgrid must also be settled. In the meantime, the transmission system operator functions are being carried out by ESB National Grid, as a ring-fenced business unit within ESB.</P>

      <P>In March 2002 Donegal County Council submitted an application under the marine tourism grant scheme of the national development plan for funding towards the development of berthing facilities at Rathmullan and Buncrana. However, as the applicants had not obtained the necessary statutory permissions, that is, foreshore leases as required under the scheme, their application could not be considered further. The applicants were informed of this and that they could apply under a future call following the receipt of the foreshore leases.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will be aware, however, that the revised Estimates for 2003 included major adjustments in marine spending. The funds allocated to marine tourism in 2003 are already fully committed to a small number of flagship projects.

      <P>In my reply to an earlier question on this subject on 30 January 2003, I outlined the importance of the Irish Open for Irish tourism and the background to Bord Fáilte's decision to invest in the opportunity it provides to market <Col N="269" /> Irish tourism. I further pointed out that Bord Fáilte's relationship is with the European Tour, not the owners of the course in question. It is the tour which owns the Irish Open event, not the club. In fairness to the club in question, without the last minute offer of its course, it is doubtful if there would have been any Irish Open this year.</P>
      <P>I met representatives of the club shortly before Christmas and we discussed the membership issue. I expressed my personal preference that they would lift the rule on not allowing women to be members of their club. The representatives maintain that they do not discriminate against women in relation to access to the course and treat all non-members in the same way. They are also firmly of the view that the club is a legitimate single sex club and that its members have a clear right to exercise their constitutional freedom to associate. That freedom is one of the key rights in any free society and is recognised by the Constitution and in the Equal Status Act.</P>
      <P>There has been no legal ruling on the issue as to whether Portmarnock Golf Club is a discriminating club under the Equal Status Act. While the matter has, I understand, been taken up by the Equality Authority, it is for the courts to make the final judgment on these matters. At this time and in these circumstances, it would be inappropriate of me to prejudge the outcome of any proceedings.</P>

      <P>Responsibility for the provision of services to persons with an intellectual disability and those with autism in the Meath Area is a matter for the North-Eastern Health Board.</P>
      <P>In response to the Deputy's question the North-Eastern Health Board has informed my Department that funding for the health related needs of autistic services in County Meath are allocated on a county basis to an autism specific team. The resources available for autism specific services in 2003 remain unchanged from 2002. However, due to a continuing significant rise in the numbers of children with autism in the county, it has been necessary for the health board to review the use of the available resources. For the past four years, the North-Eastern Health Board has primarily focused this resource on providing health related supports to children with autism attending a small number of educational placements in County Meath. With a large increase in children not in mainstream or special school educational placements, the board made a decision in 2003 to utilise this resource for the benefit of those children. These children greatly outnumber those in school placements and are primarily of the pre-school age group.</P>
      <P>The North-Eastern Health Board is aware that children who have to date received a high quality service through their partnership with the special class educational model will be disadvantaged by this decision. The board, however, is continuing to explore all available options to ensure that their therapeutic needs can be met. The task force on autism has recommended that the therapy needs for children with autism in education could be met by the educational services.</P>
      <P>The North-Eastern Health Board state that it is open to the provision of these therapeutic services using any agreed model of resourcing and delivery and is committed to working in partnership with the education services to explore all possible options.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>Following receipt of the report, Diabetes: Securing the Future, from the Diabetes Federation of Ireland last year, a meeting took place between officials of my Department and the federation. The federation was informed that the report would be considered in the context of the current health strategy Quality and Fairness &ndash; A Health System for You, the primary care strategy A New Direction and within the limits of available funding. My Department is currently examining how best diabetes services can be improved nationally.</P>
      <P>A full range of services for persons with diabetes is provided by the health services generally and many initiatives have significant benefits for persons with diabetes and in the prevention of the disease. A particular case in point is the cardiovascular health strategy, Building Healthier Hearts, which made a number of recommendations on the prevention of heart disease and many of these are also relevant to the prevention of diabetes.</P>
      <P>The strategy recommends the expansion of primary prevention initiatives to reduce the development of risk factors, and related diseases such as diabetes, in the population. Awareness of the need to adopt a more healthy lifestyle was one of the main objectives of the first phase of the heart health campaign, Ireland needs a Change of Heart.</P>
      <P>A combination of primary prevention in the general population and secondary prevention in those known to have heart disease, as outlined in Building Healthier Hearts, can be expected to substantially reduce the risk of heart disease, including in patients with related conditions such as diabetes, in the coming years.</P>
      <P>The funding allocated by Government to the health services in 2003 is designed to maintain the existing level of service in overall terms. The economic outlook for 2003 is reflected in the approach taken by the Government to spending estimates and the budget. Of the overall level of investment in public services in 2003, some two-thirds has been allocated to the health services.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Service plans have been prepared by each health board including the Southern Health Board, on the basis of the letter of determination <Col N="272" /> issued by my Department. Discussions with each agency on their service plan have concluded and the focus within each agency is now on putting the various measures proposed into action and on managing activity, employment and finances over the course of the year.</P>
    <P>While the measures proposed in each case vary from agency to agency on the basis of local needs and priorities, the overall pattern is one of consolidation in 2003, following a number of years of rapid expansion and development of services.</P>

      <P>The revised determinations for the health boards and the Eastern Regional Health Authority for 2002 amounted to &euro;6.809 billion, an increase of some &euro;2 million on the original figure and an increase of some 16% over the 2001 funding. In the acute hospital service programme in particular, productivity increased, yet again, with an overall increase in discharges of 5.5% on the 2001 outturn. Within this figure day cases increased by almost 15% on 2001. While no specific moneys were provided for the treatment of the winter vomiting bug, the health boards and the Eastern Regional Health Authority were able to manage this aspect, and other such pressures, within the overall increase of funding in 2002, which was significant.</P>

      <P>The additional funding provided to the health boards and the Eastern Regional Health Authority, advised in the 2003 letters of determination, was an increase of some 9% on the 2002 original figure. The letter of determination requested the health boards and the Eastern Regional Health Authority to develop their service plan levels and supporting financial budgets within the limits of the approved funding. While the 2003 determination did not identify specific funding for asylum seekers or refugees, the various service programmes across the health care system make provision for such groups in the context of the agreed service plans for 2003.</P>

      <P>I assume the Deputy is referring to recommendations which may emerge from the audit of structures and functions of the health system. As I have already outlined to the House, the report of the consultants has not yet been completed. The terms of reference included consideration of the structures and functions of both health boards or authorities and other specialist, advisory, regulat<Col N="275" /> ory and executive agencies under my aegis. The terms of reference also require prospectus to make recommendations to improve corporate governance arrangements in the health system.</P>
      <P>The details supplied by the Deputy also refer to the ongoing work of the national task force on medical staffing. While the prospectus report takes cognisance of the ongoing work of the task force, it does not attempt to pre-empt or constrain the Government regarding any implications for the configuration of hospital services in the future arising from this separate and independent study.</P>
      <P>It is not possible at this stage to speculate on the recommendations and their potential impact, if any, on specific service delivery units whether they be acute, primary care, continuing care or other community services. However, given the terms of reference outlined, I am confident the recommendations will be in the interests of an improved system of service delivery, greater accountability, quality and value for money.</P>

      <P>Information on the number of straitjackets in the possession of the health boards and other agencies funded by the State involved in the care and treatment of prisoners and persons with psychiatric illnesses and intellectual disabilities is not available within my Department.</P>
      <P>I am informed by the Inspector of Mental Hospitals that the use of seclusion and mechanical constraint has been largely eliminated from mental health care. However, there are still a very small number of instances where such measures are utilised as a last resort. In the guidelines on good practice and quality assurance in mental health services 1998 issued to service providers by the Inspector of Mental Hospitals, the proper safeguards and precautions governing the use as a last resort of seclusion and mechanical constraint are set out. These include recommendations that: only a consultant psychiatrist may prescribe such treatments in writing; this decision should be reviewed every six hours; the patient should be visited by a nurse, and observations recorded and documented, every 15 minutes; and a separate care plan be maintained for patients where such measures are required, recording information on events and the actual behaviour and interventions used prior to the episode.</P>
      <P>The implementation of these guidelines is monitored by the inspector in his annual inspection of each service. Copies of the guidelines are available on request from my Department. In recent times many psychiatric hospitals and acute units provide multi-sensory rooms for patients, where a very calm and quiet atmosphere is created to help patients relax. The Inspector of Mental Hospitals considers such facilities most helpful to patients.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy will be aware, the expert group on various health professions considered that the introduction of therapy assistants had the potential to provide practical support for therapists, including speech and language therapists, and therefore recommended that a grade of therapy assistant be introduced where appropriate. In making this recommendation, the expert group also emphasised three fundamental conditions which would underpin the introduction of the new grade and which should be considered prior to the introduction of the grade.</P>
      <P>The expert group was of the view that the introduction of a therapy assistant grade should not be regarded as a substitute for existing personnel but rather should complement the role of the fully trained professional therapist. The expert group also considered that the role of the therapy assistant in service provision was an issue that should be addressed to ensure that the role adequately supports and complements the role of the therapist. Third, the group highlighted the need for the establishment of a suitably accredited training programmes to provide therapy assistants with the necessary skills for the job.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="279" />In taking account of these three issues and in progressing the introduction of the assistant grade, my view has been that the interaction between the assistant grade and the therapist grade is fundamental to the successful introduction of the new grade and its effectiveness. A key prerequisite therefore to the introduction of the new grade is the adequate availability of fully qualified therapists to appropriately oversee and supervise the provision of services provided by assistants, consistent with the provision of quality health care services to the public. The Deputy will be aware however of the scarcity of qualified therapists. Since the publication of the expert group report, steps have therefore been taken at both national and local level to address acute shortages in the numbers of therapy professionals employed in the health service. These include the ongoing implementation of the recommendations of the report by Peter Bacon and Associates on current and future supply and demand conditions in the labour market for certain professional therapists, involving the provision of a very substantial increase in training places. They also include the introduction of new pay scales, career and management structures, the undertaking of a concerted overseas recruitment drive, the introduction of a fast-track working visa scheme for health and social care professionals and the streamlining of procedures for the validation of overseas qualifications. These measures have already shown results reflected in the increase in therapists employed in the health service since the publication of the expert group's report. In speech therapy alone, there has been an increase of 54 speech and language therapists, +15.6%, employed in the public health service between end 1999 and end 2001.</P>
    <P>The next steps in the development and introduction of the assistant grade are the consideration of the role of the grade in service provision and the question of suitable training for the grade. The establishment of a therapy advisory unit in my Department &ndash; a further recommendation of the expert group &ndash; working together with the health skills group, recently established under the aegis of my Department to examine key workforce planning issues including skills mix, can play an important role in progressing these issues.</P>
    <P>I will keep the Deputy informed of developments in the matter.</P>

      <P>BreastCheck, the national breast screening pro<Col N="280" /> gramme commenced in March 2000 with phase one of the programme covering the Eastern Regional Health Authority, Midland Health Board and North-Eastern Health Board areas. Screening is being offered free of charge to all women in those areas in the target age group 50 to 64 years of age. The target population consists of approximately 140,000 women and it represents about 50% of the national target population. By end December 2002, 110,636 women had been called for screening and 83,000 women had been screened. This represents an uptake of 75%.</P>
      <P>I have publicly expressed my commitment to the nationwide extension of BreastCheck. As evidence of my commitment I recently announced the extension of BreastCheck to a further three counties. Approximately, 19,000 women in the 50 to 64 age bracket in counties Wexford, Kilkenny and Carlow will be invited for screening.</P>
      <P>In relation to the further expansion of the programme, the board of BreastCheck has submitted a business plan to my Department. Two static units are proposed in host hospitals, one in Cork and the other in Galway at which breast surgery would be performed for women in the South, West, Mid West and North West. A number of key issues have been raised by health boards and health professionals in relation to the national roll-out of BreastCheck which need to be addressed in advance of further expansion. I will be meeting with BreastCheck shortly to discuss these issues.</P>
      <P>Following such extension and when the programme is sufficiently developed and it is assured that a quality services can be delivered at national level, consideration will be given to including older women and continuing the screening of women already in the programme who have reached 65 years of age.</P>
      <P>Any woman irrespective of her age or residence who has immediate concerns or symptoms should contact her GP who, where appropriate, will refer her to the symptomatic services in her area.</P>

      <P>The working group found that the internationally acknowledged best practice for the provision of child and adolescent psychiatric services is through the multi-disciplinary team. In 2002, additional revenue funding of &euro;6.061milion, £4.773, was allocated to provide for the appointment of additional consultants, for the enhancement of existing consultant-led multi-disciplinary teams and towards the establishment of further teams. A further &euro;1.64 million was allocated in 2003.</P>
      <P>I have noted the comments contained in the correspondence referred to in Deputy Perry's parliamentary question and have requested senior officials of my Department to examine the matters contained therein and report to me as soon as possible.</P>

      <AskConj>asked the </AskConj>
      <askee>Minister for Health and Children</askee>
      <Quest>the level of turnover of social worker staff in each of the health board regions between 1988 and 2002.</Quest>

    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>Information on the turnover of staff is not collected on a routine basis by my Department. I have asked the chief executive officers of the health boards and the regional chief executive of the Eastern Regional Health Authority to supply the information available to them on the turnover of social work staff in their health board areas over the years in question and I will communicate directly with the Deputy when this information is received.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will be aware however that one of the functions of the National Social Work Qualifications Board is to conduct research to inform labour force planning. The board has recently published a report of a survey on social work posts nationally, conducted on 1 September 2001. Turnover rate, the number of employees who left an agency in the year leading up to 1 September as a percentage of employment, was measured in the survey and a turnover rate of 18.1%, 362 staff, is shown. The survey indicated that 176 or nearly half the social workers who left their posts did so to take up another social work post or a secondment to another Irish agency, illustrating the mobility within the profession. Only 6% left to take up a non-social work post.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am very conscious nonetheless that difficulties have been experienced by some health boards in recruiting and retaining social work staff in certain areas. A number of steps have been taken therefore to improve recruitment and retention generally. The provision of additional training places is a central element of the strategy to meet the human resource requirements of the health services in social work. A further 54 social work training places were provided in 2002, bringing the total number of training places to 192, com<Col N="282" /> pared to 138 in 2001. This represents an increase of +85 training places, 80%, over the level of training provision in 2000. In addition, the National Social Work Forum has been established to progress a number of key issues for the social work profession, arising from the recommendations included in the report of the expert group on various health professions published in April 2000. Major developments designed to improve job satisfaction and career and professional development for social workers include the creation of a new grade of senior social work practitioner and the upgrading of single-handed and certain specialised posts. A further initiative is the undertaking, under the aegis of the National Social Work Forum, of a social work workload management study designed to facilitate the best use of social work time and human resources. All these developments, along with the implementation of the action plan for people management under the health strategy, will make an important contribution to strengthening the capacity of the health services to recruit and then retain social work staff. The effectiveness of the initiatives already undertaken can be seen in the significant increase in the overall number of social workers employed in the health service by 35%, +437, in whole time equivalent, WTE, terms over the two years to end-2001, with total employment rising to 1,682 WTEs over that period. This substantial increase highlights the increased attractiveness of employment in the health services for social workers, reflecting the impact of pay increases, improvements in career structure and enhanced opportunities for professional development.</P>

      <P>The Eastern Regional Health Authority is charged with responsibility for commissioning health and personal social services on behalf of the population of the region, and also on behalf of those outside the region who are referred for specialist treatment.</P>
      <P>The Eastern Regional Health Authority is currently in discussions with all providers within its region, including the major acute hospitals in the Dublin area, to finalise the level of services to be provided in 2003. It will be a matter for the authority and each of the respective hospitals to agree on any specific measures to be taken to ensure that each hospital continues to maintain a high level of service within available resources. I want to emphasise that none of the proposals contained in the leaked document, referred to recently in the House, has been agreed with the ERHA.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="283" />The provider discussions are expected to conclude within the next two weeks and I have asked the ERHA to report back to my Department on the outcome.</P>
    <P>The authority accepts that 2003 will be a difficult year for the acute hospitals sector, as increases in funding over last year will be limited. There is a clear need for tight management of cost and activity in 2003 in the context of working within available resources.</P>
    <P>Provision has been made in the authority's service plan for the completion of major initiatives which commenced in 2002, such as the introduction under the Government's bed capacity initiative of over 300 additional acute hospital beds in the region, including an additional 35 beds at Beaumont Hospital. The revenue funding for these additional beds has already been notified to the authority. The hospital has advised that these additional beds will come on stream in the very near future.</P>
    <P>The authority has received additional funding of &euro;9.450 million to support the consolidation of acute hospital services. This funding will be allocated among the service providers to assist in meeting the increased costs of current levels of activity, and to fund service developments initiated in 2002. This funding includes an additional &euro;1.4 million for the continued provision of national specialty services.</P>
    <P>Additional funding has also been provided to meet the cost associated with the recruitment of additional consultants in emergency medicine and consultant anaesthetists, and for cancer, cardiology and renal dialysis services.</P>

      <Quest>if his attention has been drawn to the fact that many dentists offering tooth-whitening facilities may be breaching an EU regulation that makes it illegal to administer hydrogen peroxide bleach at a greater than 0.1% concentration; if a recommendation by the EU Scientific Committee for Cosmetic Products and Non-Food Products to raise the permitted level of hydrogen peroxide to 6% is likely to be implemented; the action he proposes to take in the meantime; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <P>The European Communities (Cosmetic Products) Regulations, 1997, (Statutory Instrument No. 87 of 1997) restricts the maximum concentration to 0.1% hydrogen peroxide in an oral hygiene cosmetic product placed on the market by any person. These regulations provide for the enforcement of these provisions by my Department, the health boards and the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment. The chief dental officer of my Department has also informed me that the Dental Council and the Irish Dental Association have been advised to remind dentists of this prevailing restriction on the use of hydrogen peroxide in tooth-whitening products and the importance of complying with it.</P>
      <P>I am informed that this issue is being examined by the European Commission in consultation with the Scientific Committee on Cosmetic Products and Non-Food Products. The current position is that further clarifications are required from this Committee regarding certain aspects of its previous opinion to relax the restriction on the concentration of hydrogen peroxide in tooth-whitening products. However, the outcome of these deliberations and the likelihood of amending the concentration of hydrogen peroxide may not be predicted.</P>

      <P>When the Government gave its approval to the establishment of the clinical indemnity scheme it decided that the scheme should have no retrospective effect. The principal reason for taking this decision was that health service agencies and doctors had paid insurance premiums or subscriptions to medical defence bodies to cover the cost of claims arising from events which occurred before the inception of the new scheme. It was the responsibility of the commercial insurance companies and the mutual medical defence bodies to ensure that they set rates which would generate sufficient resources to meet their liabilities. As the State is not the named insured in the insurance policies, it is not entitled to any benefits under them. Similarly, only members of the defence bodies are entitled to seek an indemnity from them.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 425 and 430 together.</P>
      <P>The report which the Deputy refers to is the Deloitte and Touche Value for Money Audit of the Health System. This report was published in 2001 and was in the process of being finalised as work on the health strategy was being completed. Its findings were flagged during the process to the group working on preparation of the health strategy. This is why many of the findings of the Value for Money Audit of the Health System report are dealt with directly in the context of the health strategy, and in particular in the context of the framework for organisational reform.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy rightly points out, the role of the Department, and the system generally, is extremely broad and complex in its remit by international standards. While this remit presents challenges in terms of its scope, it also presents unique opportunities to advance a broad concept of health status as defined by the World Health Organisation, WHO, which includes health and well-being, quality of life issues and the achievement of full health potential. It also provides good opportunities to develop integrated care systems for those with complex needs which range from acute medical interventions to personal social services.</P>
      <P>The Deputy refers in particular to the role, skills sets and resources of the Department. I would like to draw the attention of the House to the fact that the findings of the Value for Money Audit of the Health System report related to a much wider set of concerns, including the establishment of a health information and evaluation agency, financing mechanisms for the Irish health system, the structure and organisation of the health system, the development of health care policy, resource allocation and performance measurement and information systems, among other items.</P>
      <P>These issues are all being advanced at present in a number of projects, namely, the audit of structures and functions of the health system; the Commission on Financial Management and Controls in the Health Service; the development of a national health information strategy; ongoing work on the implementation of the strategy at regional level; and the internal restructuring of the Department, including the development of a population health division. The report on the audit of structures and functions of the health system and the Commission on Financial Management and Controls in the Health Service will be brought to Government in the coming weeks for decision.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These various projects are focused on improving governance and accountability processes within the system and on concentrating the various resources in the most effective and cost-efficient way and at points in the system where they can have the greatest impact. These interlinked projects aim to develop a practical agenda for reform which avoids incremental and piece<Col N="291" /> meal approaches. The recommendations will establish an organisational map which defines the most appropriate location and use of system expertise and resources to support maximum system performance.</P>
    <P>Following presentation to and consideration by the Government, the reform programme being outlined is likely to involve significant change in roles at every level in the health system, including my Department. The implementation plan will include identification of the various competencies required at each level to discharge the policy-making and managerial roles assigned. I believe that reform will result in greater clarity of roles between the Department and the executive part of the system; much improved information systems; improved governance and accountability frameworks; and a greater pooling and concentration of expertise and resources; and will greatly assist the Department in maximising its own role in the system in population health planning; policy development; and monitoring, evaluating and managing system performance.</P>

Dublin Bus has also advised me that in 2002 this operation resulted in 80 prosecutions, with fines ranging from &euro;50 to &euro;240. I am advised that Dublin Bus proposes to continue with this type of covert monitoring operation this year. This approach is a very positive one and deserves our full support.</P>

      <P>As the Deputy is aware, the delivery of orthodontic services is a matter for the chief executive officers of the health boards in the first instance.</P>
      <P>In its report on the orthodontic service, the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Health and Children has &ndash; quite rightly &ndash; drawn attention to the fact that the co-operation of all regional consultants is required for an efficient service to be delivered in all health boards. I have no doubt that the absence of agreement has led to a lower increase in treatment numbers and a lower reduction in waiting lists than would otherwise be the case. I strongly agree with the committee's view that the interests of children are paramount and must take precedence over all other interests. My Department stands ready to support increased co-operation among the relevant stakeholders.</P>
      <P>The chief executive officers established a review group on the public orthodontic service that considered the recommendations of the Oireachtas joint committee in the context both of the historical development of the service and of the national health strategy. The chairperson of this group has informed me that the group was established on 23 April 2002 with the following terms of reference: to review and report on progress to date on the recommendations set out in the Moran report; to consider the recommendations in the February 2002 report of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Health and Children; and to make revised recommendations and prepare and cost an action plan in the context of the approach set out in the national health strategy, Quality and Fairness &ndash; a Health System for You.</P>
      <P>I understand that the review group comprised senior administrative and clinical personnel from the health boards. The chairman of the group has informed me that its report will be submitted to me in the near future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In line with the recommendations of the joint committee, my Department and the health boards are funding 13 dentists this year for internationally recognised specialist in orthodontics <Col N="294" /> qualifications at training programmes in Ireland and the UK. These 13 trainees are additional to the six dentists who commenced their training last year and one dentist whose specialist training is nearing completion. This is an aggregate of 20 public service dentists currently in training for internationally recognised specialist in orthodontics qualifications. Two dentists that had been sponsored for such specialist training qualified last year and took up duty with the Western Health Board.</P>
    <P>My Department has also funded the recruitment of a professor in orthodontics at Cork University dental school to facilitate the development of an approved training programme leading to specialist qualifications in orthodontics.</P>
    <P>Other recommendations of the Oireachtas joint committee are also being acted upon. In particular the grade of specialist in orthodontics has been created in the health board orthodontic service; the number of specialist in orthodontics posts for the health boards is being finalised, using the estimated number of children eligible for orthodontic treatment under the 1985 guidelines. These national manpower requirements will feed into an orthodontic action plan. Health boards have initiated reviews of their assessment waiting lists as recommended. The committee also stated that it would support a public/private mix of staff and facilities that would lead to a continuous reduction in the number awaiting treatment. Last June, my Department provided additional funding of &euro;5 million from the treatment purchase fund to health boards specifically for the purchase of orthodontic treatment. This funding is enabling boards to provide both additional sessions for existing staff and purchase treatment from private specialist orthodontic practitioners; the committee referred to the need to employ orthodontic auxiliaries in the public orthodontic service in order to increase caseloads. I have approved a scheme submitted by the Dental Council for the creation of this grade to be known as orthodontic therapist.</P>
    <P>Finally, the chief executive officers of the health boards-authority have informed me that, at the end of the December 2002 quarter, there were 20,151 patients receiving orthodontic treatment in the public orthodontic service. This is an increase of approximately 2,856 patients in orthodontic treatment when compared with the number of patients receiving treatment in December 2001. I expect that the number of patients receiving orthodontic treatment in the public orthodontic service will continue to increase as the measures that I have taken impact further on the service.</P>

      <P>As the Deputy is aware, the provision of orthodontic treatment to eligible persons is the responsibility of the health boards-authority in the first instance. I am pleased to advise the Deputy that I have taken a number of measures to improve orthodontic services on a national basis.</P>
      <P>The grade of specialist in orthodontics has been created in the health board orthodontic service. This year, my Department and the health boards are funding 13 dentists from various health boards for specialist in orthodontics qualifications at training programmes in Ireland and at two separate universities in the United Kingdom. These 13 trainees for the public orthodontic service are additional to the six dentists who commenced their training last year and one dentist whose specialist training is nearing completion. Thus there is an aggregate of 20 public service dentists currently in training for specialist in orthodontics qualifications. These measures will complement the other structural changes being introduced into the orthodontic service, including the creation of an auxiliary grade of orthodontic therapist to work in the orthodontic area.</P>
      <P>Orthodontic initiative funding of &euro;4.698 million was provided to the health boards-authority in 2001, and this has enabled health boards to recruit additional staff, engage the services of private specialist orthodontic practitioners to treat patients, and build additional orthodontic facilities.</P>
      <P>In June 2002, my Department provided additional funding of &euro;5 million from the treatment purchase fund to health boards specifically for the purchase of orthodontic treatment. This funding is enabling boards to provide both additional sessions for existing staff and purchase treatment from private specialist orthodontic practitioners.</P>
      <P>Finally, the chief executive officers of the health boards/authority have informed me that, at the end of the December 2002 quarter, there were 20,151 patients receiving orthodontic treatment in the public orthodontic service.

I expect that the number of patients receiving orthodontic treatment in the public orthodontic service will continue to increase as the measures that I have taken impact further on the service.</P>

      <P>I have expressed my concerns about the issue of alcohol misuse on many occasions. One of the recommendations of the strategic task force on alcohol which I established last year concerns limiting harm in the drinking environment by restricting sales promotions that encourage high-risk drinking. An interdepartmental group is now being established to co-ordinate the responses of the relevant Departments to these recommendations. The first meeting of the interdepartmental group will take place later this month, and I expect a report from the group by early autumn.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The health promotion unit of my Department also supported an initiative aimed at tackling alcohol promotions on third level campuses. A National Working Group on Alcohol Consumption in Higher Education was established by the heads of universities and third level institutions to formulate a response to a growing concern about alcohol promotion practices on campus, high-risk drinking among students and its impact on student academic achievement and student attrition. A framework for the development of a college alcohol policy was developed by the national alcohol policy adviser, who is a member <Col N="298" /> of the working group, and each third level institution can adopt the guidelines to reflect the needs and aspirations of their own campus environment. An evaluation of this initiative will take place later this year.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy is aware, the health strategy includes a commitment that significant improvements will be made in the medical card income guidelines in order to increase the number of persons on low income who are eligible for a medical card and to give priority to families with children and particularly children with a disability. This should be viewed in the broader context of the strategy's emphasis on fairness and its stated objective of reducing health inequalities in our society. Due to the prevailing budgetary situation, I regret that it is not possible to meet this commitment this year, but the Government remains committed to the introduction of the necessary changes within the lifetime of this Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It should be remembered that health board chief executive officers have discretion in relation to the issuing of medical cards and also that a range of income sources are excluded by the health boards when assessing medical card eligibility. Many allowances such as carer's allowance, child benefit, domiciliary care allowance, family income supplement and foster care allowance are all disregarded when determining a person's eligibility. Given these factors and the discretionary powers of the chief executive officers, having an income that exceeds the guidelines does not mean that a person will not be eligible for a medical <Col N="299" /> card, and a medical card may still be awarded if the chief executive officer considers that a person's circumstances would justify this.</P>
    <P>Non-medical card holders, and people with conditions not covered under the long-term illness scheme, can avail of the drugs payment scheme. Under this scheme, no individual or family unit pays more than &euro;70 per calendar month towards the cost of approved prescribed medicines.</P>
    <P>The national health strategy includes a whole series of initiatives to clarify and expand the existing arrangements for eligibility for health services, including recommendations arising from the review of the medical card scheme carried out by the health board chief executive officers under the PPF which include: streamlining applications and improving the standardisation of the medical card applications process to ensure fairness and transparency; providing clearer information to people about how and where to apply for medical cards; proactively seeking out those who should have medical cards to ensure they have access to the services that are available.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 439 and 450 together.</P>
      <P>One of the goals the health strategy, Quality and Fairness &ndash; A Health System for You, is to ensure that there is equitable access for all categories of patients in the health system. The strategy acknowledges the need to clarify and simplify eligibility arrangements and sets down a commitment to introduce new legislation to provide for clear statutory provisions on eligibility and entitlements for health and personal social services. As part of the implementation process, a review of all existing legislation relating to eligibility for services is ongoing in my Department. The outcome will inform the approach to the drafting of a new legislative framework clarifying eligibility for services.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Arising from the health strategy, the national treatment purchase fund has been established. It is being used to target those waiting longest for <Col N="300" /> treatment. Funding of &euro;31 million has been provided for the national treatment purchase fund. To date approximately 3,000 long waiters have received treatment under the national treatment purchase fund.</P>
    <P>The acute hospital system has continued to improve its productivity. A provisional figure of 968,000 people were treated in 2002 as either in-patients or day patients in acute hospitals. This figure represents an increase of 5% when compared with the 2001 figure. Since 1997 the number of patients treated in our acute hospitals has increased by approximately 23%.</P>
    <P>On foot of the report entitled Acute Hospital Bed Capacity &ndash; A National Review the Government decided, in the context of the strategy, to provide an additional 3,000 beds in acute hospitals over the next ten years. This represents the largest ever concentrated expansion of acute hospital capacity in Ireland. In 2002, I announced the first phase of these additional beds with the commissioning of an extra 709 beds in acute hospitals. I am pleased to inform the House that 520 of these beds are in operation, and the remaining beds will be brought into use shortly. My Department is currently addressing the national speciality and regional issues associated with the allocation of the remainder of the 3,000 acute beds.</P>

      <P>Responsibility for the provision of hospital services to residents of Dublin rests with the Eastern Regional Health Authority (ERHA).</P>
      <P>The Department is advised that the ERHA is continuing to work closely with individual hospitals in the region to further improve access to hospital services. Funding of &euro;47 million has been provided by my Department in 2003 to the ERHA to support the commissioning of 335 acute hospital beds in the eastern region approved under the bed capacity initiative. Over 200 of these additional beds were commissioned in 2002 with the remaining beds scheduled to be commissioned in the current year.</P>
      <P>Significant progress has been made in treating patients on waiting lists. The ERHA has advised my Department that, during 2002 in the eastern region, over 5,000 patients were treated under the waiting list initiative and that more than 1,100 patients were treated through the treatment purchase fund since referrals under the fund commenced in mid-2002.</P>
      <P>Overall, patients treated in the acute hospitals in the eastern region increased from 1,824,595 in 2000 to 1,916,622 in 2002 which represents an increase in overall activity of 5%. Within this total, day case activity increased by 25%.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Various measures to improve access to accident and emergency services have been introduced in recent years including the appointment of eight additional accident and emergency consultants. Minor injury units have been opened in all the acute hospitals in the region, to ensure rapid treatment of people coming to accident and emergency units with minor injuries. Specialist <Col N="302" /> clinics have been opened in a number of the accident and emergency hospitals to fast-track patients coming to accident and emergency with specific conditions.</P>
    <P>Funding provided in recent years to the ERHA has supported a range of additional initiatives in accident and emergency departments including the development of accident and emergency facilities at St. James's Hospital; the development of a new accident and emergency department at St. Vincent's Hospital, Elm Park; the development of a new accident and emergency department at The Children's Hospital, Temple Street; an extension to the accident and emergency department at St. Columcille's Hospital; the provision of a chest pain service at St. James's Hospital; the recruitment of discharge planners and patient liaison personnel at accident and emergency sites in the eastern region; the development of pilot services for deep vein thrombosis in Beaumont Hospital.</P>
    <P>Additional measures designed to improve the utilisation of acute beds include the Homefirst programme which was introduced as a pilot scheme between the Northern Area Health Board and Beaumont Hospital and is now being extended to the remainder of the Northern Area and the East Coast Area Health Boards. This programme facilitates earlier discharge after an acute illness. Additional sub-acute capacity has also been provided in the eastern region, with the opening of community nursing units, each with a 50 bed capacity, in Lusk, Maynooth, Dalkey and Leopardstown Park. Revenue funding has been provided to the ERHA to ensure that all of these additional beds will be commissioned in the current year.</P>
    <P>This range of measures is designed to improve patient access to acute hospitals and represent tangible evidence of the commitment by the Government in addressing this important issue.</P>

    <P>Circular 21/85, which was issued by my Department, sets out the criteria that must be applied when considering applications for authorisation to receive medical treatment outside the State. The responsibility for applying these criteria to the specific circumstances of each case rests with the health boards and the ERHA.

      <P>As the Deputy is aware, the provision of orthodontic treatment to eligible persons is the responsibility of the health boards/authority in the first instance. I am pleased to advise the Deputy that a number of measures have been taken to improve orthodontic services on a national basis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The grade of specialist in orthodontics has been created in the health board orthodontic service. This year, my Department and the health boards are funding 13 dentists from various health boards for specialist in orthodontics qualifications at training programmes in Ireland and at two separate universities in the United Kingdom. These 13 trainees for the public orthodontic service are additional to the six dentists who commenced their training last year and one dentist whose specialist training is nearing completion. Accordingly, there is an aggregate of 20 public service <Col N="304" /> dentists currently in training for specialist in orthodontics qualifications. These measures will complement the other structural changes being introduced into the orthodontic service, including the creation of an auxiliary grade of orthodontic therapist to work in the orthodontic area.</P>
    <P>Orthodontic initiative funding of &euro;4.698 million was provided to health boards/authority in 2001 and this has enabled boards to recruit additional staff, engage the services of private specialist orthodontic practitioners to treat patients and build additional orthodontic facilities.</P>
    <P>In June 2002, my Department provided additional funding of &euro;5 million from the treatment purchase fund to health boards specifically for the purchase of orthodontic treatment. This funding enables boards to provide both additional sessions for existing staff and purchase treatment from private specialist orthodontic practitioners.</P>
    <P>The chief executive officers of the health boards authority have informed me that at the end of the December 2002 quarter, there were 20,151 patients receiving orthodontic treatment in the public orthodontic service. This is an increase of approximately 2,856 patients in orthodontic treatment when compared with the number of patients receiving treatment in December 2001. I expect that the number of patients receiving orthodontic treatment in the public orthodontic service will continue to increase as these measures impact further on the service.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>There are a number of important initiatives currently under way to meet the human resource needs of the health services. The implementation of these developments will make an important contribution to strengthening the capacity of the health services to recruit and retain the high calibre professionals required in all disciplines to fill challenging and demanding roles central to the delivery of quality health and social care services to the public. Before setting out these initiatives in detail, it is important to emphasise that staffing requirements overall must be viewed in the context of the very substantial increases in employment levels achieved in the health services over the past several years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There were a total of 92,996 persons in wholetime equivalent (WTE) terms recorded in the annual health service personnel census at the end of 2001. This is an increase of nearly 30,000 staff or 47% since 1997. Information in respect of the end-2002 position is currently being compiled by <Col N="305" /> my Department and is likely to disclose further increases in staffing levels.</P>
    <P>The Deputy may wish to note that comparing employment levels at end-2001 to those five years previously, there were nearly 28% (+6,845) more nurses, 34% more medical/dental personnel (+1,601) and almost two thirds more health and social care professionals (+3,652) employed in the health services. This is a considerable achievement which reflects the success of the steps taken to increase the attractiveness of employment in the health services and also the ongoing measures being taken in areas experiencing shortages of fully trained and qualified staff.</P>
    <P>Developments such as pay increases, improvements in career structure and enhanced opportunities for professional and career development have all played a part in increasing staffing levels. The implementation of the pay recommendations of the Public Service Benchmarking Body will make a further contribution to the recruitment and improved retention. Overseas recruitment by health agencies has, over recent years, also contributed significantly to meeting the workforce needs of the health services, particularly in professions where qualified staff are scarce.</P>
    <P>As mentioned earlier, specific human resource initiatives are under way in a number of key areas which have expanded considerably over recent years. For example, with regard to the therapy professions, the report Current and Future Demand Conditions in the Labour Market for Certain Professional Therapists commissioned by my Department from Dr. Peter Bacon and Associates, concluded that a major expansion was essential in the numbers of therapists and this required a very significant increase in therapy training places in order to meet the long-term requirements of the health services. Significant progress has been achieved in boosting the number of therapy training places in line with the recommendations of that report. In May 2002, I announced, in conjunction with the Minister for Education and Science, an additional 175 therapy training places in physiotherapy, occupational therapy and speech and language therapy to achieve the recommended increase in the number of therapists over the next decade recommended in the report. The first intake into the occupational therapy and speech and language therapy courses in the University of Limerick, University College, Cork, and the National University of Ireland, Galway, is planned to take place later this year, while 28 students commenced the new physiotherapy course in the University of Limerick in the 2002-03 academic year.</P>
    <P>In the nursing area, a comprehensive report on the nursing and midwifery resource Towards Workforce Planning was published in July 2002. Developments in relation to the education of nurses have coincided with a dramatic increase in the number of places available for nursing students. This year, 1,640 nursing training places are available, 58% higher than the number available in 1998. In addition, there are now in excess <Col N="306" /> of 800 places available on specialist post-graduate courses including accident and emergency, coronary care and oncology. A comprehensive package of incentives, including payment of fees and other financial supports, are available to nurses undertaking these courses.</P>
    <P>The report of the National Task Force on Medical Staffing, which is currently being completed, will make an important contribution to planning how the health services should provide a high quality, consultant-provided service.</P>
    <P>I am conscious that, in view of the large numbers of staff employed and the unique nature of the services being delivered, it is imperative that a coherent, strategic approach to workforce and human resource planning be developed further and aligned closely with strategic objectives and the service planning process. Planning for the development of new and existing services in the future must be soundly based on a robust and realistic assessment of the skill and human resource needs to deliver these services. The issue of skill mix is also of paramount importance in meeting human resource needs. Enhanced skills mix by matching skills to service needs benefits patients and empowers health personnel to reach their full potential and optimise their contribution to quality care.</P>
    <P>In addition I am aware of the need for effective planning to ensure the continued availability of a qualified, competent workforce, it is also necessary for the health service to become an employer of choice to further improve potential for recruitment and retention. While the record number of staff recruited into the health service in the past number of years shows the progress that has been made in this regard, even more can be achieved. Having recruited and developed such a large number of staff over recent years, it is a priority to retain them by offering a challenging and rewarding career path. In the human capital and skills intensive health sector, retention has been identified as a key issue in better people management. The implementation of the action plan for people management has a crucial role to play in improving retention and reducing turnover of skilled staff, while providing the opportunity for each member of the workforce in the health sector, to maximise their contribution to the creation of a quality and patient-centred health service in line with the objectives of the health strategy.</P>

      <P>The Eastern Regional Health Authority is charged with responsibility for commissioning health and personal social services on behalf of the population of the region, and also on behalf <Col N="307" /> of those outside the region who are referred for specialist treatment.</P>
      <P>The Eastern Regional Health Authority is currently in discussions with all providers within its region, including the major acute hospitals in the Dublin area, to finalise the level of services to be provided in 2003. It will be a matter for the authority and each of the respective hospitals to agree on any specific measures to be taken to ensure that each hospital continues to maintain a high level of service within available resources. I want to emphasise that none of the proposals contained in the leaked document on Beaumont Hospital, referred to recently in the House, has been agreed with the ERHA. The provider discussions are expected to conclude in the near future and I have asked the ERHA to report back to my Department on the outcome.</P>
      <P>The authority accepts that 2003 will be a difficult year for the acute hospitals sector, as increases in funding over last year will be limited. There is a clear need for tight management of cost and activity in 2003 in the context of working within available resources.</P>
      <P>Provision has been made in the authority's service plan for the completion of major initiatives which commenced in 2002, such as the introduction under the Government's bed capacity initiative of over 300 additional acute hospital beds in the region, including an additional 35 beds at Beaumont Hospital. The revenue funding for these additional beds has already been notified to the authority. The hospital has advised that these additional beds will come on stream in the near future.</P>
      <P>The authority has received additional funding of &euro;9.450 million to support the consolidation of acute hospital services. This funding will be allocated among the service providers to assist in meeting the increased costs of current levels of activity, and to fund service developments initiated in 2002. This funding includes an additional &euro;1.4 million for the continued provision of national speciality services.</P>
      <P>Additional funding has also been provided to meet the cost associated with the recruitment of additional consultants in emergency medicine and consultant anaesthetists, and for cancer, cardiology and renal dialysis services.</P>

      <P>The overall economic position in 2003 has implications for all aspects of public investment, and this is reflected <Col N="308" /> in the Estimates and budget adopted by the Government for 2003. Within this overall framework, however, some two thirds of the additional funding available for non-capital investment in services has been allocated to the health services. This funding is being applied largely to maintaining existing levels of service across all service programmes including services for people with a disability.</P>
      <P>Significant additional funding in the region of &euro;180 million has been provided by the Government since 1997 for physical and sensory disability services. This level of funding is indicative of the Government's ongoing commitment to the provision of quality services and includes &euro;60 million ongoing funding for the development of services, including residential, respite, home support and personal assistance and therapy services.</P>
      <P>The Department, in conjunction with the Health Research Board, the health boards and the voluntary sector, is currently implementing a national physical and sensory disability database which will provide a picture of the specialised health and personal social service needs of people with a physical or sensory disability within a five year period. With the availability of information from both databases (i.e. the national intellectual disability database and the physical and sensory database) to facilitate planning and monitoring of services delivery, the Government can pursue its proven commitment to the ongoing development of these services.</P>
      <P>Between 1997 and 2002, additional revenue and capital funding of &euro;327 million has been provided for intellectual disability and autism services. This has provided around 1,700 additional residential places which are mainly based in the community. This figure also includes new residential respite places developed in 1997 and 1998. Since 1998, approximately &euro;14.6 million has been put into the system to enhance the early intervention, pre-school and multidisciplinary support services for children with an intellectual disability and those with autism. The Department has also provided additional funding of &euro;11.43 million between 1999 and 2002, to enable health boards to put in place a range of support services for persons with an intellectual disability or autism who present major behavioural problems and, therefore, require a more intensive level of support.</P>
      <P>While it is regrettable that the level of investment achieved in these services in recent years could not be maintained in 2003, my Department will work closely with the health boards and other services providers in relation to service provision this year.</P>

      <P>In 2001, the national health strategy was launched which is a comprehensive strategic plan for the health system. One of the main conclusions in the health strategy was that while the health system has served us well in many respects, some significant concerns remain. These include the need for stronger co-ordination and integration of functions and services; greater consistency in access to services and delivery of services throughout the country; and greater clarity around levels of decision-making in the full range of organisations (particularly, <i>vis-à-vis</i> the role of the Department) and the requirement for whole system effectiveness.</P>
      <P>Action 114 of the strategy was intended to support organisation development in helping to clarify roles and co-ordinate the work of different organisations. It was for this reason that prospectus strategy consultants were contracted in June of 2002 to complete an audit of structures and functions of the health system. The terms of reference included consideration of the structures and functions of both health boards/authority and other specialist, advisory, regulatory and executive agencies under my aegis. The terms of reference also require the prospectus to make recommendations to improve corporate governance arrangements in the health system generally. This includes consideration of interactions between all agencies who play a pivotal role in the system, including the Department of Health and Children. The outcomes sought are to ensure that the structures in the system are the most appropriate and responsive to meet current and future service needs; constitute an adequate framework for overall governance of the health system; achieve an effective integration of services across all parts of the system; adequately represent the views of consumers in the planning and delivery of services; focus on the principles of equity, accountability, quality and people-centredness and the national goals of the strategy.</P>
      <P>The project is being overseen by a steering group. Drafts of the report have been provided to the steering group and further work is being completed by the consultants. On completion, I will be bringing the report to the Government for decision. Once decisions have been made by Government, I anticipate that the report will be published in full and made available generally.</P>

      <P>The target set out in the national health strategy states that, by the end of 2004, all public patients requiring admission to hospital will be scheduled to commence treatment within a maximum of three months of referral from an out-patient department. Intermediate targets have been set to achieve this aim to ensure that the focus is being turned towards those patients waiting longest for treatment. Waiting list data in respect of the quarter ending December 2002 is being collated at present by my Department.</P>
      <P>Considerable progress has been made in reducing waiting times for public patients in 2002. The total number of adults waiting for more than 12 months for orthopaedic in-patient procedures has fallen by 10% between June and September 2002. The total number of adults waiting for more than 12 months for in-patient treatment in the nine target surgical specialities (which includes orthopaedics) covered by the waiting list initiative has fallen by 15% between June and September 2002.</P>
      <P>While the waiting list initiative will continue to fund additional elective activity, the dedicated national treatment purchase fund is being used to target those waiting longest for treatment. Funding of &euro;43.8 million has been provided in 2003 for the waiting list initiative and a further &euro;31 million has been provided for the national treatment purchase fund. To date approximately 3,000 patients have received treatment under the national treatment purchase fund.</P>

    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. Brennan Mr. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Transport (Mr. Brennan)</NameTxt>
      <P>Last year, the Government agreed that the development of the Dublin metro should be undertaken on a phased basis and as a public private partnership (PPP). The proposal for a metro in Dublin is part of the Dublin Transportation Office's strategy A Platform for Change. Phase 1 of the metro involves a line from Blanchardstown and Dublin Airport to the City Centre and to Shanganagh. Since then the Railway Procurement Agency (RPA) has concentrated its work on developing the outline business case (OBC) for phase 1. The RPA have also conducted a preliminary public consultation and a prequalification exercise for potential bidders.</P>
      <P>In November 2002, my Department received the OBC for phase 1 from the RPA. The OBC includes cost benefit analyses, a financing model, system options, the estimated cost over the lifetime of the project and the estimated timescales involved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In dealing with the likely costs involved, the OBC, as well as providing estimates of direct capital costs, also outlines the effect of issues such as expected inflation, the cost of transferring risk and interest during construction. The actual costs involved will be determined by a number of factors including the route alignment chosen, the structure of the PPP and the bids received. Evidence of interest shown to date suggests that a very competi<Col N="312" /> tive tendering process can be expected and this, of course, will also influence the costs.</P>
    <P>Following completion of the evaluation of the OBC in the coming weeks, I intend to bring my recommendations to the Government. Commencement of work on the project will also be influenced by factors such as public consultation on the route alignment selected; negotiation and conclusion of the PPP contract; an independent public inquiry required under legislation before the railway order granting planning permission for any major railway works can be granted.</P>
    <P>These issues will not arise until after the Government has considered my recommendations.</P>

      <P>The programme for Government states that a three year road safety strategy will be developed and will target speeding, drink driving, seat belt wearing and pedestrian safety, in order to reduce deaths and injuries. The high level group on road safety has been charged with preparing the new strategy. The preparation of the new strategy will take account of the achievements in meeting the targets of the strategy between 1998 and 2002, a comprehensive review of that strategy and the evolving developments in relation to the proposed EU third road safety action plan. Preparation of the new strategy is well advanced and I expect to bring specific proposals to the Government before the summer. Pending the introduction of a new strategy, my Department and all the agencies concerned with the implementation of road safety measures are ensuring that the successful measures brought forward under the previous strategy continue to be implemented. There has been a further reduction in road crash fatalities so far this year &ndash; provisional figures show 49 road deaths compared to 69 at this time last year.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 467 and 468 together.</P>
      <P>I have been informed by the Railway Procurement Agency that the Luas engineering construction works at the rear of the Lakelands housing estate have been completed. The agency has also informed me that, during construction, the noise emanating from the works carried out in the Lakelands area, such as spoil removal and laying of ballast and track, was regarded as equivalent to that which would be expected from similar works on constructing roads or erecting poles. Accordingly, the RPA did not deem it necessary to engage in ongoing monitoring of the essential works involved. Representations were made by Lakelands residents to the public inquiry held into the construction and operation of the line from Sandyford to St. Stephen's Green. I understand that, in the course of the inquiry, an inspector engaged an independent noise emissions expert to comment on the case made by the residents. In his findings, the inspector indicated that he was satisfied with the proposals outlined by CIE, which was responsible for the Luas project at that time, for dealing with the noise issue. My predecessor granted the light railway order based on the inquiry's findings.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have been informed by the RPA that noise will be monitored at Lakelands when Luas oper<Col N="315" /> ations commence. I understand that Dun Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council has approved this. The RPA has also informed me that plans to establish a park and ride facility at the rear of Lakelands were developed having taken cognisance of the views of the Dublin Transportation Office and in accordance with the light railway order for the Sandyford to St. Stephen's Green line. It should be noted that the park and ride facility in question is located in close proximity to a major junction of a motorway which is currently under construction.</P>

      <P>Proposals devised in 2002 by Dublin City Council for the determination of orbital routes were not in compliance with the provisions of the traffic signs manual, a copy of which is available in the Oireachtas Library, and were not proceeded with. My Department has engaged in a detailed consultation process with Dublin City Council, the Department of the Environment and Local Government and the National Roads Authority for the purpose of devising an appropriate structure to provide for orbital directional signs on a national basis. This consultation process recently concluded and detailed proposals for a new orbital signage structure have been developed. I am reviewing those proposals with a view to granting a general direction for their deployment as local authorities deem appropriate.</P>

      <P>Bus Éireann has taken delivery of 228 buses to date under the national development plan. The purchase of these buses has led to a very substantial improvement in services both in provincial cities and the greater Dublin area. Peak capacity has been increased by at least 40% on all main corridors into Dublin.</P>
      <P>In recent years, Bus Éireann has converted its entire regular urban bus fleets in Cork, Limerick, Galway and Waterford to low-floor wheelchair accessible vehicles and the size of the fleet in each city has been expanded. In addition, the company is operating some twenty low-floor wheelchair-accessible buses on a number of local rural services and has six low-floor buses on the Ashbourne-Dublin commuter route.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 477 and 478 together.</P>
      <P>In recent years Iarnród Éireann has been engaged in a programme of platform lengthening throughout the Dublin area to accommodate longer trains. The programme is continuing this year, during which the platforms at Sallins and Hazelhatch stations will be extended to accommodate eight carriage trains.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>All platforms between Drogheda and Dublin &ndash; apart from DART stations &ndash; Maynooth and <Col N="318" /> Dublin, Kildare and Dublin &ndash; except Clondalkin and Cherry Orchard &ndash; and Greystones and Dublin will then be capable of catering for eight-car trains.</P>
    <P>A similar programme is about to commence shortly to lengthen all DART station platforms to eight-car standard and this will be completed within two years. At provincial locations, some platforms are not long enough to cater for trains currently operating to them. As part of a process to address this issue, I have recently approved expenditure by Irish Rail for a feasibility study in the BMW region to examine all railway platforms. In the meantime, I have also allocated funds to raise and lengthen platforms at Mullingar, Longford, Ballyhaunis, Castlebar, Westport and Clara.</P>

      <P>The platforms at Maynooth, Leixlip and Confey stations can cater for eight-car trains and it is planned to extend Kilcock later this year so that it too can cater for them. The capacity of a particular station will depend on the length and frequency of trains serving these stations. This year there will be an increase of 24% in capacity arising from the introduction of longer trains and extra frequencies on the Maynooth line following the introduction into service of 80 new diesel rail cars which have started to be delivered and are being commissioned.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. Brennan Mr. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Transport (Mr. Brennan)</NameTxt>
      <P>The national development plan provides that the objectives of rail investment are: to improve the safety of the network; to increase the physical capacity of the railway to cater for growing passenger demand; to exploit more fully the potential for development of the suburban rail network in the greater Dublin area; and to improve the quality, speed and reliability of services.</P>
      <P>Significant progress has been made by Iarnród Éireann in respect of each of these targets. A sum of &euro;533.7 million has been invested under the railway safety programme to date. This has resulted in the upgrade of more than 300 miles of track, the improvement or permanent closure of nearly 500 level crossings and the renewal of approximately 90 bridges. These works have improved the safety, speed and reliability of services.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In addition, DART capacities have increased by 50% and capacity on the Maynooth line has increased by 100% since 2000. Significant additional capacity will be added to all the sub<Col N="319" /> urban services in the greater Dublin area and on the Cork-Cobh line when 80 new diesel rail cars enter service later this year. The upgrade of Heuston station will also be completed later this year and will significantly enhance the capacity of the station and the reliability of services into it.</P>
    <P>Further progress will be made over the next two to three years on completion of the DART upgrade project, construction works on which have commenced this year and the entry into service of 67 new mainline carriages which were ordered recently.</P>

      <P>In addition to the new DART and diesel railcars delivered over the past two years, the first batch of 80 new diesel rail cars was delivered recently. The balance will be delivered over the coming months and enter service after commissioning later in the year. In 2002, 67 new main-line carriages and 40 new DART carriages were ordered and are being manufactured. This investment of approximately &euro;310 million under the national development plan represents the most significant purchase of new rolling stock by Iarnród Éireann in decades. Additional rolling stock requirements will be considered in the context of the strategic rail review, which I hope to publish shortly.</P>

      <P>I refer the Deputy to my com<Col N="323" /> prehensive replies in this matter to Parliamentary Questions Nos. 290 of 5 March, 2003 and 135 to 139 inclusive of 6 March, 2003.</P>
      <P>The Government does not have plans, as the Deputy appears to suggest, to store personal information on every phone call, mobile number or internet session originating in this country. What is proposed is that, following on from EU directives concerning the processing of personal data and the protection of privacy in the electronic communications sector, a time limit be set on the period for which certain data on telecommunications usage must be retained by the licensed telecommunications operators for possible access, under specific circumstances and subject to specific safeguards, by the Garda Síochána and the Defence Forces. The time limit being considered is three years which is shorter than the period which licensed operators historically retained such information for billing purposes.</P>
      <P>Access to retained data for various purposes is already allowed in law by virtue of section 98 of the Postal and Telecommunications Services Act 1983 as amended by the Interception of Postal Packets and Telecommunications Messages (Regulation) Act 1993. The 1993 amendment specifically allows for the disclosure of information concerning the use made of telecommunications services for the prevention or detection of crime, for the purpose of any criminal proceedings or in the interests of the security of the State on a request from a member of the Garda Síochána not below the rank of Chief Superintendent and a member of the Defence Forces not below the rank of colonel. This amendment put the disclosure of such information on a statutory basis to ensure compliance with Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights.</P>

      <P>Prisoners with personality disorders who develop a mental illness while in prison have access to medical, nursing, psychiatric, and psychological services within the prison system. In some institutions, the incidence of such problems is insufficient to justify the provision of dedicated services. Where a prisoner detained in such an institution develops a mental illness, arrangements may be made for a temporary transfer to another prison where appropriate care can be provided. Mentally ill prisoners may also be transferred to the Central Mental Hospital, Dundrum, when it is indicated that in-patient treatment is required.</P>

Local Garda management is satisfied that this is adequate bearing in mind the geographical spread and border location of the district. The extension of the current opening hours of other garda stations in the district to 24 hours would necessitate the employment of Garda personnel on indoor administrative duties.

The tribunal examines allegations of misconduct by solicitors and reports to the High Court. The Registrar's Committee may itself determine complaints lodged directly to it by members of the public.</P>
      <P>The Law Society has appointed an independent adjudicator to deal with complaints about the handling by the society of complaints against solicitors. He is Mr. Eamon Condon and his address for correspondence is 26-27, Upper Pembroke Street, Dublin 2.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Solicitors (Amendment) Act 2002, the relevant provisions of which came into operation on 1 January, 2003 strengthens the disciplinary regime for solicitors in a number of respects. It doubles the size of the tribunal to cater for an increased workload and the speedier processing of cases. The tribunal will be required to make a separate finding on each ground of alleged misconduct. In addition, regard must be had to previous findings of misconduct by a solicitor when imposing a sanction in the current case. The maximum amount which a solicitor, in respect of whom there has been a finding of misconduct, may be ordered to pay to an aggrieved party or <Col N="328" /> to the Law Society's Compensation Fund will increase from £5,000 to &euro;15,000. There will be a right of appeal to the High Court on all aspects of the tribunal's work. The Act also provides for remedies against solicitors who fail to co-operate with investigations.</P>
    <P>In addition, the circumstances in which the Law Society may refuse to issue a practising certificate or impose conditions on a certificate are spelt out in more detail than before. The circumstances in which the society can send an investigator to inspect documents at a solicitor's office are also extended.</P>

      <P>While medical and therapeutic factors are very important issues in assessing a transfer application, I must also have regard to other relevant factors such as the nature of the offence, which in this case was linked to subversive activity, and the individual's subsequent prison security status.</P>
      <P>While the visiting consultant psychiatrist in Portlaoise Prison has supported this person's transfer to the open centre at Shelton Abbey, it is also the case that the medical director of the Irish Prison Service has advised of his concerns about such a move given that Shelton Abbey does not have provision for a scheduled psychiatric service. As a general rule, it is not considered appropriate to accommodate prisoners who need psychiatric support in an open centre and therefore prisoners with current psychiatric health issues are not transferred to such a location. The medical director is also of the view that Portlaoise Prison is a more appropriate location for this man from a health care viewpoint as it is better suited to provide appropriate treatment for his problems.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. McDowell Mr. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. McDowell)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 503 and 510 together.</P>
      <P>I am informed by the Garda authorities that the street value of drugs seized by the force actually increased in 2002 and was in the order of &euro;49 million compared to &euro;45 million in 2001. The 2001 figure was itself an increase on 2000 when the estimated value of drugs seized by An Garda Síochána was approximately &euro;20 million.</P>
      <P>A key performance indicator in the national drugs strategy 2001-08 is to increase the volume of opiates and all other drugs seized by 25% by end of 2004 and by 50% by end 2008, using 2000 seizures as a base. These indicators reflect a major supply reduction objective of the strategy which is to reduce significantly the volume of illicit drugs available in Ireland, to arrest the dynamic of the existing markets and to curtail new markets as they are identified.</P>
      <P>As I informed the House recently, it is the view of the Garda authorities that there would appear to be an increase in the availability of cocaine in the Dublin area. Operations have been initiated in divisions throughout the Dublin area and a number of significant seizures have been made. In addition, joint Garda-Customs operations have resulted in the detection of a number of attempted cocaine importations at Dublin airport. The situation will continue to be monitored and Garda operations targeting known suppliers of cocaine will also continue.</P>
      <P>In addition, the Garda Síochána Policing Plan for 2003 contains a commitment to conduct research on the level of cocaine use. The Garda Research Unit will implement the commitment in consultation with the Garda National Drugs Unit and will bring forward policing recommendations accordingly. The Garda authorities have already initiated a broad study into illegal drug use and associated crime. The results of this research will provide a clear picture in relation to overall trends in drug misuse.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am informed also by my colleague, the Minister for Health and Children, that significant additional funding has been made available for drug treatment and rehabilitation services. These <Col N="330" /> include specific services to respond to the problem of cocaine abuse.</P>

      <P>The Government attaches considerable importance to the provision of e-Services. In the context of the courts, electronic services offer the potential to maximise operational efficiencies, reduce paper log-jams, assist in reducing court waiting times and generally provide an enhanced level of service to all court users.</P>
      <P>The Courts Service, in February 2001, published its five year strategy for information technology entitled &ldquo;eCourts&rdquo;. The key strategic business objectives detailed in the plan include the delivery of a range of eGovernment initiatives which are consistent with the Courts Service's commitment to participate fully in the Government's initiative for the delivery of services by electronic means. The proposed electronic services will provide for electronic data interchange between the courts systems and the Garda Síochána, Prisons Service, Chief State Solicitor's Office, Probation and Welfare Service, etc. initiatives such as e-filing &ndash; capability for legal practitioners to file documents electronically with the Courts Service &ndash; and e-payment &ndash; capability to complete financial transactions electronically with the Courts Service &ndash; and initiatives such as self service HRMS, Human Resource Management System and Knowledge Web, providing the capability for all users to access common databases of knowledge.</P>
      <P>The Courts Service, in collaboration with the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, initiated a project to establish an on-line small claims procedure. A steering committee has been set up to oversee the development of the procedure on a pilot basis which will deal with disputed transactions, including e-commerce transactions, by consumers in relation to goods or services. I am advised that Phase 1 of the pilot project will be completed before the end of 2003.</P>
      <P>I am further informed that the relevant forms necessary for lodging a case with the Small Claims Court can currently be obtained electronically.</P>

      <P>The use of electronic systems to monitor offenders in other jurisdictions is an issue which my Department has been examining for some time. Satellite tracing, using GPS &ndash; ground position by satellite &ndash; signals, is in use in the United States, but on a limited basis. Satellite tracing systems have been available commercially for ships and a wide range of vehicles for some years. However, I have been advised that problems of battery size and weight, signal interference, costs and location complexities have hindered the initial GPS systems and the advice to me is that we should await current developments which are targeted to improving GPS systems. I also understand that lower technology and lower cost curfew tracking systems are being developed in a number of jurisdictions based on a combination of mobile phone technology and voice verification technology and my officials are also monitoring current developments in that regard.</P>
      <P>Studies on the use of electronic systems to monitor offenders in other jurisdictions suggest that tagging is effective only over a three to six month period and suitable only for low risk offenders whereas our court requirements may well be for the most serious offences and longer periods. Recent research suggests that the advance of such systems has been curiously muted, not least because of its inability to deliver specifically on its aim. I intend to keep the situation under review in the light of international developments.</P>

      <P>I am informed by the Garda authorities that, since its establishment in October 1996 until 31 December 2002, the Criminal Assets Bureau has obtained final restraint orders on assets to the value of almost &euro;19 million. In the same period, taxes and interest <Col N="333" /> demanded were of the order of approximately &euro;69 million with more than &euro;46 million collected. In addition, savings on social welfare payments amounted to more than &euro;1.4 million.</P>
      <P>The figures outlined are provisional pending the presentation by the Garda Commissioner of the bureau's report on its activities for 2002. In accordance with the relevant legislation, the Garda Commissioner presents a report annually to the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform not later than six months after the end of each year. The reports to date have been laid before both Houses of the Oireachtas and are available in the Oireachtas library.</P>
      <P>The Proceeds of Crime Act 1996, provides for the disposal of property by the courts for the benefit of the Exchequer where a final restraint, or interlocutory, order has been in force for not less than seven years. Therefore, the issue of such disposal orders has not arisen to date. Moneys obtained by the bureau as a result of actions taken under the Revenue Acts are remitted to the Collector General forthwith.</P>
      <P>The Government has committed, and continues to commit, significant resources towards the drugs initiative. Up to the end of last year, more than &euro;62 million had already been allocated in implementing projects established via the local drug task forces. In addition, the Government has committed &euro;130 million over the lifetime of the national development plan to the young peoples' facilities and services fund which also targets areas of disadvantage with greater risk of drug misuse among young people. This fund was established in 1998 and approximately &euro;68 million has already been allocated to support more than 350 facility and service projects within these targeted areas.</P>

    <P>The five CCTV cameras that are currently located in a community scheme at Moyross and a single camera in a similar scheme at Roxborough will also be video-linked to Henry Street Garda station for monitoring purposes. This will give a total of 29 cameras in all that will be monitored at the station.</P>
    <P>The Office of Public Works has recently completed the necessary refurbishment works to accommodate the monitoring equipment in Henry Street Garda station. Installation of the system is being progressed by the contractor who is at present completing the fitting out of the monitoring room at the station and the installation of cabling and ducting works. It is expected that the installation of cameras will commence following the granting of the required wayleaves <Col N="335" /> and the completion of the planning process with Limerick City Council.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. McDowell Mr. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. McDowell)</NameTxt>
      <P>I presume that the Deputy is referring to the central transfer lists for provincial locations which are maintained by my Department in respect of general Civil Service grades. These lists include staff currently serving in my own Department and those in other Government Departments who have expressed an interest in transferring to my Department's offices outside of the Dublin area.</P>
      <P>I should mention that the position in relation to transfers to provincial areas for staff officers and clerical officers is that they are arranged in accordance with the standardised transfer system which has been agreed with the Civil and Public Service Union and which applies to all Government Departments. The agreement provides that applications for transfer are recorded in order of the date of receipt of each application. When vacancies arise they must then be offered in this order. No formal transfer agreement with the relevant unions exists for staff at executive officer level or above and the lists maintained by my Department for those grades may only be regarded as a record of a person's interest in being accommodated with a transfer to a particular location should a suitable opportunity arise.</P>
      <P>I propose to provide the Deputy with three separate tables with details of the numbers and grades currently on my Department's transfer lists. This is because the Courts Service has established its own transfer lists in respect of staff wishing to transfer to the Circuit and District Court offices around the country.</P>
      <P>Table A is used to fill general service grade vacancies in Garda Síochána offices and probation and welfare service offices around the country as well as the Waterford office of the Land Registry and the finance division in Killarney. Table B provides details of those who have applied for a transfer to or within the Courts Service only. Table C is used to fill clerical officer typist grade vacancies in the Legal Aid Board.</P>
      <P>I should mention that all tables may include persons who, since making their application, have been promoted or left their parent Department for reasons unknown to my Department. The tables also reflect multiple applications by individuals for separate locations.</P>

      <P>Section 107 of the Environmental Protection Agency Act 1992 provides local authorities with powers to require measures to be taken to prevent or limit noise. I am aware that Dublin City Council, for example, regularly uses these powers in relation to noise from intruder alarms.</P>
      <P>In addition, I understand a Private Security Services Bill, sponsored by my colleague, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, is currently before Dáil Éireann. The Bill provides for a private security authority to license, control and supervise all alarm installers and for the authority to have powers to maintain and improve standards in the provision of services, including standards for intruder alarms.</P>
      <P>In light of the above there are no plans to introduce further legislation on intruder alarms.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment and Local Government (Mr. Cullen)</NameTxt>
      <P>Dun Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council has benefited considerably from the significantly increased funding available in recent years for non-national roads. The council's non-national road grant allocation for 2003 is &euro;9.007 million, an increase of 153% on its 1997 outturn.</P>
      <P>The selection of particular tertiary and other road lengths for improvement or maintenance under these general allocations or from the authority's own resources is a matter for the individual local authority. My Department has occasionally reallocated moneys to county councils for tertiary roads as a mid-year adjustment of the annual non-national roads programme. No such reallocations were notified in 2002.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 530 and 531 together.</P>
      <P>I assume that both questions refer to the proposed directive of the European Parliament and of the Council establishing a scheme for greenhouse gas emission allowance trading.</P>
      <P>The Council of Environment Ministers, at its meeting on 9 December 2002, reached political agreement on a common position on the proposed directive. This common position is now subject to a second reading by the European Parliament.</P>
      <P>To inform the Irish Government's position on the proposed directive and relevant implementation issues, an emissions trading advisory group, chaired by the National Treasury Management Agency, was established in 2002. This group includes representatives of future trading sectors, officials from relevant State agencies, and national experts on emissions trading.</P>
      <P>In common with other member states, Ireland is currently assessing the requirements of the directive and exploring options for the development of a national allocation plan. Once the draft directive is finalised, implementation will be pursued as a matter of urgency. I intend to provide Irish participants with as much certainty as possible, with regard to the allocation plan, as soon as possible.</P>
      <P>In relation to progress generally towards Ireland's commitment to limit growth in greenhouse gas emissions to an average of 13% above 1990 levels in the period 2008-2012, under the Kyoto Protocol, I refer to the reply to Questions Nos. 132 and 140 of 4 February 2003.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 532 and 533 together.</P>
      <P>Study relevant to the hydrological impact of peat extraction has been undertaken from the early 1990s in the context of a joint Irish-Dutch raised bog research project. The report of this overall project will shortly be jointly published by my Department, the geological survey of Ireland and the Dutch state forest service under the title Conservation and Restoration of Raised Bogs: Geological, Hydrological and Ecological Studies.</P>
      <P>Information regarding environmental impact assessments is not available to my Department on a current or up to date basis. However, neither the report on EIAs published by my Department in 1996, the inventory of environmental impact statements submitted from July 1988 to December 1996, nor later information now being compiled by my Department indicate that an environmental impact assessment has so far been carried out in relation to any proposed peat extraction in Ireland.</P>

      <P>My Department operates a scheme of grants to assist in the renewal and repair of traditional thatched roofs and has in recent years introduced significant improvements to the grant levels under the scheme. The basic maximum grant was increased in 1999 from &euro;3,047 (£2,400) to &euro;3,810 and from &euro;4,571 (£3,600) to &euro;5,720 for houses on specified offshore islands. The grants may meet two-thirds of the approved cost of thatching works, subject to the maximum limits.</P>
      <P>The Department also introduced a new measure to assist lower income households, for which the cost of maintaining a thatched roof imposed a particular burden. Householders with medical cards are eligible for thatching grants up to a maximum of &euro;6,350 or &euro;8,260 in the case of the specified offshore islands. In addition, in such cases the grant may cover up to 80% of the approved cost of the works, again subject to the maximum grant limits.</P>
      <P>While there is no proposal to increase the rate of thatching grants at this stage, my Department keeps the terms of the scheme under review. </P>

      <P>Primary responsibility for investigation of unauthorised waste activity lies with the relevant local authority or the EPA, as appropriate. In such investigations, assistance may be sought from other State agencies, including the gardai.</P>
      <P>Improving implementation and enforcement of environmental legislation generally is one of my key concerns and action in this regard is being taken on a range of fronts.</P>
      <P>The Protection of the Environment Bill 2003, now before Seanad Éireann, proposes a number of amendments to the Waste Management Act 1996 that will facilitate more effective and direct enforcement of that legislation. In particular, they will enable more expeditious legal proceedings to secure the cessation of unauthorised activity and-or appropriate environmental remediation.</P>
      <P>I propose very shortly to allocate resources from the environment fund directly to local authorities, to enable them to improve their overall environmental enforcement efforts, with particular regard to unauthorised waste activity.</P>
      <P>Finally, An Agreed Programme for Government provides for the establishment of an office of environmental enforcement to secure further improvements in implementation and enforcement of environmental legislation, including in the waste management area. Work is under way on the development of detailed proposals in this regard and will be completed as soon as possible.</P>

      <P>The operation of fire safety in Ireland is governed by the Fire Services Act 1981 and regulations made under that Act, in addition to the fire safety certification requirements of the building regulations made under the Building Control Act 1990. Fire safety in night clubs and other places of entertainment is the responsibility in the first instance of those who organise and promote such events and those who own or occupy the premises in which the events are held. Detailed guidance is provided to such persons in the code of practice on the management of fire safety in places of assembly and in the code of practice for safety at indoor concerts, published by my Department.</P>
      <P>Enforcement of the provisions of the Fire Services Act 1981 is a matter for fire authorities, who maintain a high level of vigilance in respect of fire safety in places of entertainment. For example, fire prevention statistics compiled by my Department indicate that about 6,000 inspections of premises are undertaken annually by fire authority inspectors under section 24 of the Fire Services Act, relating to applications for liquor, dance and club licenses. In addition, senior fire officers throughout the country are provided with up to date training on fire safety issues, including experience of serious fires abroad, through courses organised by the Fire Services Council.</P>

      <P>I propose to take the following Questions Nos. 540, 541, 549, 551 and 552 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>EU legislation on the conservation of wild birds provides that species listed in annex I to the Birds Directive (1979) shall be the subject of special conservation measures concerning their habitat, in order to ensure their survival and <Col N="348" /> reproduction in their area of distribution. The classification of suitable areas as special protection areas for the conservation of these species is envisaged as one means of achieving this objective.</P>
    <P>The hen harrier is a species listed in annex I. EU legislation does not prescribe detailed quantitative criteria, in relation for example to numbers of rare birds or size of protected areas, for the designation of SPA's. However, account is to be taken where appropriate of whether the annex I species concerned is to be considered vulnerable to specific changes in their habitat, or rare because of small populations or restricted local distribution.</P>
    <P>A recent survey estimated the total population of breeding pairs of hen harriers in the country at between 104 and 131 pairs, of which between 33 and 41 pairs were in the Stack's and adjoining Glanaruddery, Knockanefune and Mullaghareirk mountain ranges.</P>
    <P>I have already emphasised that I will take decisions on the formal designation of proposed sites for hen harrier conservation, only when my Department's preparatory scientific work is complete and all relevant information is available to me. Formal proposals of this kind would initiate a statutory three month period of consultation during which submissions made by concerned parties would be invited and considered. In addition to the statutory provisions for notification of proposals to landowners and relevant public authorities, my Department, together with the Department of Agriculture and Food, has standing arrangements for discussion with the main farming organisations of matters relating to the designation and conservation of SPAs and other areas designated for nature conservation.</P>

      <P>Section 6 of the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 1992 provides <Col N="350" /> that a housing authority may assist an approved housing body in the provision of housing accommodation by, <i>inter alia,</i> the making of a loan to such body. Section 15 of the Housing Act 1988 provides, <i>inter alia,</i> for the payment of a subsidy from my Department's vote in respect of assistance given by a housing authority to an approved housing body under section 6 of the 1992 Act. These provisions are given practical effect in my Department's capital loan and subsidy scheme, formerly referred to as the rental subsidy scheme.</P>
      <P>The voluntary housing sector has made an important contribution in responding to social housing needs.

      <P>However, there will be various options for the ownership and management of a project which may be considered by the relevant housing authority, as mortgagee of a housing project, in a situation such as that referred to in this question. As the administration of the scheme is devolved to the relevant housing authority, it will be a matter for the authority to identify and put in place the most appropriate arrangement having regard to the circumstances of the particular case.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment and Local Government (Mr. Cullen)</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no reliable data on the existing dog population in Ireland. A survey conducted some years ago indicated an approximate level of ownership of one in five persons, which would suggest a dog population of 780,000 approximately. In 2001, the latest year for which statistics are available, a total of 155,761 dog licences and 203 general dog licences were issued. My Department regularly reminds local authorities of the need to promote dog licensing through local publicity and licence checking campaigns.</P>
      <P>The statutory framework for the control of dogs, the Control of Dogs Acts 1986 and 1992 and the Control of Dogs Regulations 1998 is comprehensive. The principal features of the system involve local authorities or, in some cases, the ISPCA acting on their behalf, discharging dog control functions, including appointing dog wardens, operating shelters for stray or unwanted dogs, seizing stray dogs and arranging for the destruction of dogs that are not reclaimed or for which new homes cannot be found. Dog control legislation also imposes requirements on the owner or other persons in charge of a dog not to permit the dog to be in any place other than the premises of the owner or other person whose consent has been obtained. In any other place, the dog must be accompanied and kept under effectual control.</P>
      <P>As regards dangerous dogs, the Control of Dogs Regulations 1998 prescribe leashing and muzzling requirements in respect of ten breeds of dogs. These requirements must be observed when the dog is in a public place and the person in charge must be over 16 years of age and must be capable of controlling the dog. Furthermore, the 1986 Act gives specific powers to the courts to order that a dog, which the court considers dangerous, shall be kept under proper control or be destroyed.</P>

      <P>Pre-development work has been undertaken in Rathnew and Arklow, County Wicklow, with a view to establishing community development projects.</P>
      <P>However, the tighter economic situation this year may mean that the expansion of the community development support programme may not occur at the same pace as in previous years. In light of this, my Department is currently assessing the situation in relation to current commitments and available resources. In this regard, I expect to be in a position very soon to announce details of those areas to which funding will be allocated this year for new community development projects. Priority will be given in 2003 to areas of most disadvantage.</P>

The LDTFs are made up of representatives from the statutory, community and voluntary sectors and each area develops a local action plan. <Col N="354" /> The selection of projects, and the funding allocated, is based on the task force's prioritisation of the identified needs within its area and the ability of the proposed projects to meet those needs. Most of the LDTFs are currently implementing their second round plans and to date, over &euro;14 million has been allocated to implement these plans.</P>
      <P>As regards the SWAN project, this group has been allocated funding of &euro;19,046 under the second round plan of the Tallaght LDTF. To date, projects under both of the task force plans for Tallaght, including mainstreamed projects, have been allocated over &euro;4 million. In addition, just over &euro;1.4 million has been allocated to drugs projects in the area under the premises initiative and approximately &euro;2.8 million has been allocated to Tallaght under the young peoples facilities and services fund.</P>

However a child who is in employment or on an apprenticeship is not regarded as an excepted person for the purpose of the schemes.</P>

      <P>The continued entitlement to unemployment benefit of the person concerned was reviewed on 21 May 2002 when she was requested to provide details of her efforts to find full-time employment. In the light of the details provided, the deciding officer concluded that she had failed to show that she was genuinely seeking full-time work and disallowed her claim accordingly from 6 June 2002. She appealed this decision to the Social Welfare Appeals Office in July 2002 and an oral hearing of her appeal was held on 8 October 2002. Having considered all of the available evidence, including that adduced at the oral hearing, the appeals officer was not satisfied that the person was genuinely seeking full-time employment and disallowed her appeal.</P>
      <P>The person was notified of the decision of the appeals officer on 18 October 2002. The person recently submitted new evidence for consideration by the appeals officer regarding her efforts in seeking full-time employment. The departmental papers have now been requested from the local office and on receipt of these the matter will be referred to the appeals officer for early attention. Under social welfare legislation decisions in relation to claims must be made by deciding officers and appeals officers. These officers are statutorily appointed and I have no role in regard to making such decisions.</P>

He appealed this decision to the Social Welfare Appeals Office and in the context of his appeal he was examined by another medical assessor on 19 December 2002 who was also of the opinion that he did not satisfy the relevant medical eligibility criteria.</P>
      <P>His case has now been considered by an appeals officer who is of the opinion that an oral hearing is required. This will be arranged for week commencing 31 March 2003. The person is currently in receipt of supplementary welfare allowance pending the outcome of his appeal. Under social welfare legislation, decisions on claims must be made by deciding officers and appeals officers. These officers are statutorily appointed and I have no role in regard to making such decisions.</P>

      <Quest>the reason her Department has taken the decision to restrict the payment, during the period of June to September 2003, of the back to education allowance, third level option, and also to restrict the payment of BTEA to undergraduate students only; if her attention has been drawn to the fact that very often for the purpose of career prospects, it is necessary to pursue a post-graduate qualification and that these new measures will effectively deny those who suffer from socio-economic disadvantage to pursue such a qualification; if she will have same reviewed; and if she will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <P>It is proposed to take Questions Nos. 564 and 574 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The back to education allowance scheme is a second chance opportunity for people to improve their education and to enhance their opportunities to access the labour market. In framing proposals to change elements of the BTEA scheme, I was conscious of the need to ensure that payments were geared to those most in need of support. It is common practice for students in <Col N="358" /> third level education to take up employment during the summer months. It is reasonable, therefore, to expect students on the BTEA scheme to take up employment during this time. If these students fail to find employment they may be entitled to an unemployment payment, subject to satisfying the usual qualifying conditions.</P>
    <P>People in possession of a third level qualification are already well placed to get employment. In these circumstances, I concluded that giving further support to people to gain post-graduate qualifications is not appropriate and that the moneys should be directed to those with more pressing needs. Students already pursuing a postgraduate course will not be affected by the changes to the scheme. I am satisfied the new arrangements will ensure that the BTEA scheme is focused on providing supports to those people with the greatest need.</P>

      <P>Social welfare legislation provides in certain circumstances for the return of amounts of employee, self-employed, voluntary or optional social insurance contributions paid by a contributor in respect of any payment made by him or her in accordance with a maintenance arrangement. In this regard, a maintenance agreement is defined in legislation as being an order of a court, rule of court, deed of separation, trust, covenant, agreement, arrangement or any other act giving rise to a legally enforceable obligation and made or done in consideration or in consequence of the dissolution or annulment of a marriage.</P>
      <P>In relation to consent orders, terms and conditions can vary significantly from case to case. Consequently, each order would require examination on its own merits before it is possible to establish whether it is legally enforceable. In the event of an individual consent order being found not to be legally enforceable, no PRSI refund would be due.</P>

      <P>The person concerned claimed unemployment benefit on 9 January 2003. Her claim was disallowed by a deciding officer on the grounds that she was not genuinely seeking work. Social welfare legislation provides that a person must satisfy the conditions of being available for and genuinely seeking work in order to be entitled to unemployment benefit or unemployment assistance.</P>
      <P>Claimants are expected to demonstrate that they have taken reasonable steps to secure employment and to provide examples of such steps.

      <P>In addition to satisfying the relevant contribution conditions, those applying for retirement pension must be retired from employment or self employment. Retirement is defined as not having earnings from employment of more than &euro;38 per week or earnings from self-employment of more than &euro;3,174 per annum. The retirement pension was introduced in 1970 and was intended to bridge the gap between retirement at 65 and the pension age for social welfare purposes, which at the time was 70 years of age. The qualifying age for old age pension was subsequently reduced over time to 66 years of age. In the circumstances, the retirement condition now only applies for one year.</P>
      <P>The Government is committed, as part of the programme for Government, to removing the requirement to retire at 65 in order to receive a retirement pension. Progress in this regard will be made as soon as possible, having regard to the availability of resources and the priority attaching to other elements of the Government programme. The current weekly rate of retirement pension is &euro;157.30.</P>
