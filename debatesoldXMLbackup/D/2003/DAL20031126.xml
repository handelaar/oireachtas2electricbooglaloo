      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>It is now obvious we are watching the disintegration of the Government. In recent months, two senior Ministers, the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Cullen and the Minister for Arts, Sports and Tourism, Deputy O'Donoghue, openly revolted on the smoking ban regulations. During the Laffoy debacle, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy McDowell, directly contradicted the Taoiseach on the Government's handling of the core deal. Two weeks ago, the Minister for Defence, Deputy Michael Smith, breached Cabinet collective responsibility on three separate occasions and, yesterday evening, 40 backbenchers, led by a Minister of State, openly revolted against the Government's proposals in the Estimates. It is becoming increasingly clear that the Taoiseach is leading a rabble. It is no wonder the Tanáiste wants to jump ship before things get much worse.</P>
      <P>Last night, we heard two versions &ndash; the Taoiseach's comments at the Fianna Fáil Parliamentary Party meeting and the views expressed by the Tánaiste &ndash; of how Ireland came to support a decision, at European Union level, to provide &euro;1.1 billion of public funds for research on embryonic stem cells. Is the Taoiseach prepared to tell the House the truth about this matter? Was the Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture and Food, Deputy Treacy, acting on behalf of the Government when, as Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, he supported this research programme 18 months ago? Did the Taoiseach and the Tanáiste have personal knowledge of the programme before the Minister of State pledged support for it?</P>
      <P>The Taoiseach bypassed the primacy of this House on this controversial and complex matter. Why did he not consider it necessary to have it debated in the House, given that yesterday, the Cabinet expressed regret at the widespread confusion that exists on the issue?</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The European Sixth Framework Directive was put and agreed by the European Commission in December 2001 and again in summer 2002. It was, at that stage, a matter of agreeing the &euro;16 billion fund for research in various areas, including funding of &euro;1.1 billion on human genome research, the issue under discussion today at European Council level. The Minister of State, Deputy Treacy, acted with the total knowledge and support of the Government and various Departments, including my Department, the Department of Foreign Affairs and the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, at which he was at that time a Minister of State. The matter was fully dealt with.</P>
      <P>The issue under discussion in Europe today &ndash; we should not lose sight of this &ndash; is not about funding that has already been agreed, but about whether proper guidelines, safeguards and procedures will be put in place to deal with this matter when the moratorium ends. That is the decision before the European Commission today.</P>
      <P>Deputy Kenny asked about the current position. There was no disagreement on the matter. At that stage, only Italy expressed a reservation while all other countries, including Ireland, agreed to the programme. The issue is concerned with research that will take place outside Ireland and we had no reason whatsoever to oppose the programme at that stage.</P>

      <P>The Cabinet said yesterday that it regretted the widespread confusion caused. The Taoiseach has bypassed the primacy of this House. Let me finish with this question to the <Col N="692" />Taoiseach. The Tánaiste travels to Brussels today to speak and vote for Ireland. Will she reflect before that vote on the unanimous conclusion of the all-party Oireachtas Joint Committee on Enterprise and Small Business that Ireland should not support the spending of public funds on embryonic research? Does the Fianna Fáil Party support the spending of public funds on embryonic stem cell research? That has nothing to do with Italy or the genome project. It has to do with internal politics and the spending of public money from taxpayers, to be ratified by the Taoiseach's Government without bringing it to the floor of this House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I have already answered two of Deputy Kenny's questions. The third was on the framework programme. The Common Position on the sixth framework programme, which is known as FP6, was agreed at the Research Council in December 2001. It was formally adopted by the Employment and Social Policy Council on 26 June 2002, and the following co-decision procedure, which is Article 166(1), was agreed with the European Parliament. That was done with the knowledge of the various Departments. The funding programme was broad. Rather than a specific programme about stem cell research, it was about human genomics, and that was the programme put before the Council. It was not in the normal course of events. It was not about funding or research in this country, and the framework programme would not normally be put before this House. That answers the Deputy's question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny" hpid="Mr. Kenny Mr. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>So he did not know what he was voting for.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The details of the programme were not known at that time. It was a broad programme on human genomics. It was &euro;1.1 billion of &euro;16 billion for that general programme. The Minister's decision today will be consistent with her decision throughout, namely, that this country does not believe that research should start. The issue today is not about whether resources will be spent, since that decision has already been made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny" hpid="Mr. Kenny Mr. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>No member of the Fianna Fáil Party supported it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Today's decision is as follows. When the money was passed, as I have just outlined, Ireland, Germany, Italy, Austria, Portugal and Luxembourg stated that the research should not start and that there should be a moratorium until proper European Commission guidelines, safeguards and procedures had been drawn up. The European Commission asked for 18 months, a period which will soon expire. The decision today is whether the research can go ahead without those guidelines. Our position is that research should not go ahead in this country. We also believe that it should not go ahead anywhere until <Col N="693" />those guidelines and procedures are in place. That is the issue.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>If this matter is a settled position decided on by the Fianna Fáil Minister of State, Noel Treacy, with the Taoiseach's knowledge, why is a senior backbencher attacking the Tánaiste, Deputy Harney, this morning, on the basis that she is doing a solo run and that the position is false and mischievous? Why, if one of their own made this decision, would Fianna Fáil backbenchers be doing that? Why are they working themselves up into such a lather about stem cell research when the most needy children in society are deprived of crèche facilities because of the child care cuts? At a time when the Society of St. Vincent de Paul says that 70,000 children are living in deprivation and 300,000 in relative poverty, what exactly is going on in Fianna Fáil?</P>
      <P>They revolt on stem cell research after the decision has been made. On the Hanly report, they revolt after the document has been approved by the Cabinet. On the smoking ban, they revolt on behalf of publicans after the Minister for Health and Children has committed himself. On the community employment scheme, 40 of them sign a motion only after they can be sure that it has been safely decided in the Book of Estimates and voted through the House the previous week. Perhaps the Taoiseach will tell us what exactly is going on. Is this a revolt against his leadership? Is Deputy Batt O'Keeffe a stalking horse? Are the meetings in Cork about that? If not, why should the Taoiseach be accused by Deputy Batt O'Keeffe of misrepresenting the position of the Minister, Deputy Harney, at a Fianna Fáil meeting? Why should the Taoiseach decide to misrepresent the Minister's position? God knows that she has been loyal enough to him.</P>

      <P>Is this the appropriate manner for the Taoiseach to regard the dissent that is now evident regarding every decision that the Government has tried to announce and implement? They have all gone wrong, starting with the penalty points back in 1998. Emergency legislation is now having to be put through to correct that. There is the smoking ban, the Hanly report, the community employment schemes, stem cell research &ndash; you name it. Then the Taoiseach goes to the parliamentary party and, on the word of a senior backbencher, misrepresents the position of the Tánaiste, Deputy Harney. When it came to tax evasion on the backbenches, Deputy Harney explained it away on the basis that it had not taken place in Government. When it came to Punchestown, she explained it away on the basis that&mdash;</P>

      <P>Deputy Rabbitte did not ask me a question, but I have a minute to reply. The Fianna Fáil Party and the Progressive Democrats have brought in far-sighted proposals, and I notice that those across the water are now also considering our smoking ban legislation. I wish them well in that. The Hanly report is part of our overall reform, along with the Prospectus and Brennan reports, to try to give better medical <Col N="695" />treatment to people in this country. In our social welfare Estimate, we have moved to &euro;10.6 billion this year. Regarding the vote today, the Government and the parliamentary parties totally support the Minister's view, which is to try to ensure that guidelines and proper procedures are put in place and that no research can happen in Europe without them. On all the other issues, both parties in this Government have proper debate and analysis. It is a pity that Deputy Rabbitte's parliamentary party could not have the open and excellent debate that we have in Fianna Fáil.</P>

      <P>Before I call Deputy Joe Higgins, I repeat for the benefit of Members of the House that the Standing Order allows for a brief question on a matter of topical public importance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeHiggins" hpid="Mr. J. Higgins Mr. J. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>There are 140,000 construction workers in the State, only 40,000 of whom are calculated to have the benefit of pension schemes. Building workers' unions have in recent days highlighted outrageous behaviour by a wide range of construction companies who have failed to put their workers on pension schemes. Incredibly, there is even comprehensive evidence of the most cynical fraud, whereby companies, some of them large and prestigious, deduct pension money from their workers' wages without putting them on the scheme. In other words, millionaire construction bosses are stealing from the hard-earned money of their employees. This has the most serious economic consequences for workers when they get sick or, in the case of premature death, for their families, apart from the emotional trauma.</P>
      <P>Of the 30 construction workers who died tragically since January 2002, only eight were covered by pensions schemes. After six and a half years of this Government, why is such calculated abuse by a powerful industry allowed? Is it not appropriate that some of the lather which Government backbenchers have been working themselves up to in recent days about embryonic cells should be transferred into getting the Government to look after real, living, working, suffering and exploited human beings? The existing legislation is unworkable for the most part, cumbersome and open to huge delays. Will the Government introduce legislation to protect construction workers in this situation?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The legislation which governs this matter is the Pensions (Amendment) Act 2002 and the Pensions Board is the regulator of the issues the Deputy raised. In regard to the case of the IFI, the case has gone to the Director of Public Prosecutions. Generally, the Government's proposals for the past number of years have been to try to improve the scope and range of occupational pension schemes. We have done <Col N="696" />this in many ways, through procedures which have worked quite well. If there are abuses, the Pensions Board, as regulator, if it is not already involved in the cases to which the Deputy refers, would be glad to hear about them.</P>
      <P>Over the years, some sectors of the construction industry have seen a lack of employers putting workers on pensions schemes, particularly occupational ones. Nonetheless, the Government has endeavoured to insist that they do so. The figure is something like 76%. Admittedly, there is still a large percentage of people not covered by pension schemes. In the various Acts, including the Pensions (Amendment) Act 2002 and other Finance Bill regulations in past years, we have endeavoured to make it easier and more attractive for people to have their own pension schemes.</P>
      <P>I am not sure if the Deputy is referring to self-employed categories or those who are working directly for employers. Perhaps he will clarify that. In the self-employed sector there are attractive schemes and many sub-contractors are availing of them. If the Deputy is referring to people directly employed by contractors, the Pensions Board, as regulator, would be interested in what he said if it is not already dealing with the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeHiggins" hpid="Mr. J. Higgins Mr. J. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no question of &ldquo;if&rdquo;&ndash; there are abuses. Tens of thousands of workers are being denied their pension rights by powerful construction bosses as is demonstrable through facts and figures. It is not good enough to state that the Government is endeavouring to do this and that.

      <P>Two freedom of information requests were received in my Department in October 2003, bringing the total so far this year to 133. This compares with 111 received in my Department for the same period in 2002. Of the two received in October, one was part granted and the other was withdrawn. My Department has received &euro;205 in up-front fees since they were introduced on 7 July 2003.</P>
      <P>The Freedom of Information (Amendment) Act 2003 came into effect on 11 April 2003 and relevant training was provided for staff dealing with FOI requests. All requests received in my Department are processed in accordance with both the 1997 Act and the 2003 Act and their implementation is kept under constant review.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>In regard to the Taoiseach's Department, how can he account for a drop of 83% in the number of weekly freedom of information requests in the period from January 2003 to the end of September 2003? I trust that is in order, Sir. It is in the context of similar drops in other Departments that I make the point. The Taoiseach must account for that drop.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I have given the figures. My Department received two freedom of information requests in October, bringing the total to 133. This compares with 111 requests received by my Department for the same period in 2002. I cannot come to a conclusion, nor can the Deputy, until we can see a full year and compare like with like.</P>
      <P>I made inquiries with the people involved in this area in my Department and they made the point that there has been no change whatever in respect of personal requests. People do not have to pay for such requests. It seems that many people were involved in trawls or were seeking information just for the sake of doing so. Now that they are obliged to pay for such information, the position has changed. My main concern relates to personal information, in respect of which there does not seem to be any change.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not have statistics for October of last year. However, in January of this year there were 20 requests and there were nine in April just before the new regime came into play. It ranged somewhere between 20 and six in my Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>The pattern is clear, namely, that there has been a diminishing resort to the Act since the drastic changes introduced by the Government. The Taoiseach invites us to compare like with like, but we would need to know the figure for October 2002 in order to compare the position this year as against last year. There were two applications last month. It seems extra<Col N="700" />ordinary. Is it not the case, as Deputy Kenny suggests, that the Government has effectively killed off, in certain areas of its operation, the Freedom of Information Act and put it beyond the reach of citizens in many instances? Will the Taoiseach confirm that the staff dealing with this issue in his Department have been transferred to other duties?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The staff in my Department deal with freedom of information requests as part of their ongoing duties. We do not have a dedicated staff for this purpose.</P>
      <P>With regard to individuals, personal information, appeals and requests, there has been no change whatever. There has clearly been a change, however, in that those who were either engaged in trawls or making it their mission to seek frivolous information have disappeared from the process because they are obliged to pay to make requests.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not rubbish, it is fact. There is no fee for requests for personal information. If there has been a change it is that those who submitted questions as part of a general trawl are no longer doing so on foot of the fees that were introduced. That is the only change in my Department and it probably applies in general.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>It is my understanding, I am open to correction from the Taoiseach, that there were people in the Department who were charged to deal, either exclusively or principally, with freedom of information requests. Will he indicate whether these people have been transferred? If they have not been transferred, what were they doing during October?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I have made the point on several occasions that there are no staff designated in my Department to deal with freedom of information requests. Last year there were 146 cases, while to date this year there have been 133. There would be no significant change in my Department, even across two months in which few cases were received. The position would be the same as last year. Staff are designated to deal with freedom of information requests but that is not what they do on a full-time basis. I accept that some Departments may have staff dealing with matters of this nature full-time, but the latter would not be justified in my Department. Even in our busiest year, we would receive approximately four or five requests per week.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent" hpid="Mr. Sargent Mr. Sargent">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Taoiseach accept that there is a direct connection between the charges that were put in place, which can mount up to <Col N="701" />&euro;240 on appeal to the Information Commissioner in respect of a particular request, and the figures released in October, which indicate that the number of applications has halved since the legislation was restricted in April and that the decline accelerated in July when the charges came into play?</P>

    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle An Ceann Comhairle">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>The question tabled refers specifically to the Department of the Taoiseach, whereas the question the Deputy is now posing is more appropriate to the Minister for Finance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent" hpid="Mr. Sargent Mr. Sargent">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate the Ceann Comhairle's ruling but I wish to know if the Taoiseach accepts the basic thrust of my question.</P>
      <P>With regard to the Government's indemnity agreement, which was the subject of a number of applications, fewer than one third of the 281 known documents held by the State were released to <i>The Irish Times</i> last month. Only one of the 48 documents the Taoiseach's Department holds was released and none was released by the Attorney General's office.</P>
      <P>Why were the figures relating to the Taoiseach's Department so low? Government Departments &ndash; I wish to know if the Taoiseach's Department is involved in this regard &ndash; are posting on the Internet the names, addresses and full content of queries made by individuals and businesses. Is such behaviour acceptable, particularly in light of the fact that some people make inquiries for very personal reasons? Is it a breach of confidentiality, in cases where personal information is requested, to post details on the Internet? Does the Taoiseach accept that there is a need to respect people's reasons for making applications, some of which may be personal in nature and based on information already held by those individuals?</P>
      <P>Does the Taoiseach believe that the Cabinet's decision to have a secretive three-year retention scheme on land line and mobile telephone calls is questionable, particularly in terms of the freedom of information legislation? Are citizens entitled to obtain the information relating to their land line and mobile telephone calls? Should the Cabinet decision, which involves the retention of information, not have come before the Dáil to be discussed? I thought the idea was that people would be able to seek information relating to them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I will try to answer as many as possible of the Deputy's questions. In so far as my Department is concerned, there appears to have been a fall-off in the number of applications since July. It is probably too early to draw specific conclusions, but undoubtedly the introduction of the fee has had an impact. The latter does not affect requests for personal information, however, because there is no fee attaching to such requests. I do not believe that details of requests for personal information are posted on the Inter<Col N="702" />net. We should wait to see how trends develop over a longer period.</P>
      <P>I stated on previous occasions that there were a number of people who submitted long and convoluted requests for information and it was not always clear what was required. I am not referring to businesses or journalists but to certain members of the public. Such requests were enormously costly and time-consuming. It was decided that the introduction of a fee structure for FOI was overdue and that a better balance should be struck between the burden and cost of administrating the Act, which is unquestionably significant. We need to allow people to continue to have access to information and a balanced system of charges was needed to deter irresponsible use of the Act. That does not in any way affect people seeking personal information or appeals relating to requests of that nature. That entire category is excluded.</P>
      <P>The majority of people make good use of the Act. Taxpayers and public bodies must be protected against members of the small minority who are using it to make frivolous and vexatious requests. I provided facts about the latter in respect of my Department since the Act was introduced.</P>
      <P>I wish to outline the position in my Department in respect of internal reviews and the cost of complaints. Of a total of 132 freedom of information requests to my Department, internal reviews were requested only in respect of six. There is no cost attaching in that regard. Of these six cases, the original decision was upheld in five and it was decided to release further records in the other case.</P>
      <P>As regards cases refused for fees, only two applications were received that did not include fees so that is not a big issue. Since the introduction of the Act only 2% of applications to my Department were appealed to the Information Commissioner. We had a major debate in the House about the use and abuse of sections 19 and 20 certificates but none has issued under either category from my Department. While it is too early to say, we have only reviewed the past six months but there are no difficulties whatsoever.</P>

      <P>I am talking about his Department. I also asked about the Government's indemnity agreement. His Department only released one out of 48 documents relating to the agreement following an FOI request. Why is that figure so low? I finally asked about the secretive scheme involving retention of land line and mobile telephone call records for three years. Can people establish what information is held about them under the Act in regard to such calls?</P>
    </Speaker>

      <P>I remind the Deputy that the information provided is totally a matter for the information officer. I have no control over the information. To the best of my knowledge, all information relating to land line and mobile telephone calls is made available because I regularly read about it in newspapers. I do not have control over what information is entitled to be provided.</P>
      <P>Personal requests are not on the system. If I check on someone indirectly, for example, the Ceann Comhairle, the Deputy asked whether I should protect that information but I do not see why I should. That is not a personal issue. My Department does not put these requests up on the system but we do not get individuals spying on others. If somebody asks a question about a matter and it is accessible to publish, it is published and, if it is not, it is not under the regulations. There is no great change in that.</P>

      <P>The Taoiseach will recall that on the last occasion this set of questions was tabled, I pointed out that, following the passage of the Freedom of Information (Amendment) Bill 2003, the definition of &ldquo;Government&rdquo; had been widened. Under the provisions of the Act, a Secretary General can certify a committee or working group of a given Department and, thereby, preclude its deliberations under the Act by virtue of the fact that it is a part of Government. Has that section been invoked in the Taoiseach's Department since the legislation's passage? How many such requests, if any, have been denied on that basis? Which committees or working groups has his Secretary General or any Secretary General prescribed? Is there a list of such committees and working groups within his Department and all other Departments?</P>

      <P>I am happy with the operation of the Act and I have provided information. A small number of cases are appealed in my Department and there is no change to personal requests. There are no proposals to amend the legislation. I do not mind people trawling for information but they should pay towards it.</P>

      <P>I did not hear the Taoiseach's reply to the second question and I ask him to repeat it. Can I take it there is a designated freedom of information officer in his Department who works exclusively on requests for information? How many staff work on such requests as part of their duties? Has that number been affected since the Act was amended? Will the Taoiseach outline the breakdown of costs to his Department of such requests on foot of the changes made to the Act?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>There are designated officers in each section of my Department and the work comprises part of their duties. Under the original legislation, each Department has an FOI officer to whom requests are made and that has not changed. He or she in turn forwards the requests to designated officers in individual areas and, if a case is appealed or reviewed, the designated officer looks after that. The number of FOI requests to my Department does not justify the deployment of full-time staff. It is part of the duties of various staff. The cost of fees to my Department in the six months since the legislation was enacted is the enormous sum of &euro;205. I examined a number of cases last night. Many of the larger cases in my Department were free because they involved personal information.</P>
      <P>With regard to applications involving trawls, the fees are a little higher. Many of the trawlers have stopped but perhaps, they will come back again.</P>

      <P>That section in the Taoiseach's Department briefs him well. If an FOI request involving the Taoiseach is made to the Department, for example, in regard to meetings he attended, is he informed by the FOI officer? Does he or she make the Taoiseach aware a request has been received regarding a meeting he attended or an appearance he made?</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Most of the time he or she does not but, if he or she does, the practice in my Department is that I am informed after the information is released to whoever made the request. The information is requested by journalists in <Col N="705" />many cases relating to myself. That is a satisfactory way because I do not want to get it.</P>
      <P>I am not shown requests relating to travel and telephone calls and most of the requests are straightforward. Requests relating to my diary seek factual information. I do not seek to know because I would rather not. I usually read about the requests.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 6 to 11, inclusive, together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I received Mr. Justice Barron's report into the Dublin and Monaghan bombings of 1974 on Wednesday, 29 October 2003. The bombings, which took place in Dublin and Monaghan on 17 May, 1974, were among the most appalling outrages in the history of this island. Three car bombs which had been placed in Parnell Street, Talbot Street and South Leinster Street exploded without warning within minutes of each other at around 5.30 p.m. As a result, 26 people and an unborn child were killed. Later, at almost 7 p.m., a fourth no-warning bomb exploded in Monaghan town, resulting in a further seven people being killed. More than 240 people required hospital treatment as a result of the bombings. <Col N="706" />Not only were 34 innocent lives lost on that terrible day but the injured, relatives and friends were left a terrible legacy of pain and suffering.</P>
    <P>When I met with Justice for the Forgotten on 26 April, 1999, I gave them my commitment to ensure that the truth was established in relation to the bombings and their aftermath. The former Chief Justice, Mr. Liam Hamilton, began that work in January 2000 and the former Supreme Court judge, Mr. Justice Henry Barron, carried it on from October of that year. I take this opportunity again to thank the judge and his team for all their work in preparing the report and for their commitment and dedication to this difficult task. I also pay tribute to the earlier work of the former Chief Justice, the late Liam Hamilton.</P>
    <P>The Government will consider Mr. Justice Barron's report next week. Also next week, I will forward the report to the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Justice, Equality, Defence and Women's Rights. It is intended the report will be published by the committee and considered in public session. I understand that Mr. Justice Barron will report, in the coming weeks, on the Dublin bombings of 1972 and 1973 and early in the new year on the other cases referred to him, including the Dundalk bombing and the Seamus Ludlow case. I take this opportunity to pay tribute to the group, Justice for the Forgotten, for their work on behalf of the families and their assistance to the inquiry.</P>
    <P>The establishment of the inquiry followed on from the recommendations of the report of the Victims Commission, the sole member of which was the former Tánaiste, John Wilson. That report also made recommendations regarding payments to victims of the troubles in Northern Ireland in this jurisdiction. The Remembrance Fund Commission has now been established and will administer the remembrance fund for a three year period. The Government has approved expenditure of &euro;9 million over the lifetime of the commission.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeHiggins" hpid="Mr. J. Higgins Mr. J. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>The Dublin and Monaghan bombings of 1974 were the cause of huge trauma for victims, their families and friends. Does the Taoiseach agree that the investigation into this outrage and particularly the publication of the conclusions of that investigation are being looked to by many of those who were concerned and have suffered as a form of catharsis to an awful tragedy &ndash; a resolution, perhaps, in so far as that is possible, to questions which have lingered ever since?</P>
      <P>Will the Taoiseach say whether the position of the Government on the publication of the Barron report is as he indicated to Deputy Gregory on 22 October? He indicated then that the full and unexpurgated report would be published. Is that still the case? When precisely will the report be sent to the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Justice, Equality, Defence and Women's Rights and what is the precise date on which it will be published?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="707" />
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I again assure the Deputy of my commitment to see the report through Cabinet next week and then on to the committee as soon as possible thereafter. It is the committee which will deal with the matter of publication.</P>
      <P>As to the final form of the report, there is an issue, which Mr. Justice Barron has made clear to me, as to the sensitivity of some of the names in the report and how best to deal with that aspect. As I said to Deputy Gregory, even if I have to suppress the names in the publication &ndash; though I should say it is the committee, not I, which will publish the document &ndash; it would be my intention to give the details, as they were given to me by Mr. Justice Barron, to the committee.</P>
      <P>However, I believe we have to be careful, for obvious reasons, about the security of individuals named in a report. Mr. Justice Barron has emphasised that and, since then, there has been quite a lot of discussion about that matter between the PSNI, the Garda, the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform and others. We just have to be careful in that regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeHiggins" hpid="Mr. J. Higgins Mr. J. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Taoiseach agree that the suppression of any part of the report, including the deletion of names &ndash; we are speaking of an event which happened almost 30 years ago &ndash; would fuel speculation and suspicion and might even jeopardise the integrity of the report itself in people's minds? For what reason would names be expurgated from the report? Would that not really devalue the worth of the report in getting to the truth of this awful criminal act?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I certainly do not wish to hold back information on any of these issues. The only reason for holding back is the safety of individuals against whom there is no charge. Some of these names were never in the public domain.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeHiggins" hpid="Mr. J. Higgins Mr. J. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Taoiseach referring to intelligence people?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>No, I refer to individuals who would, perhaps, never have had any record or have come to the attention of the security forces, but this investigation would have uncovered them. There is also a question of their right to life. That is the concern of Mr. Justice Barron.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent" hpid="Mr. Sargent Mr. Sargent">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
      <P>If I may pursue that matter, does the Taoiseach understand that the families of victims of the Dublin and Monaghan bombing atrocities would wish to see the Barron report before it goes into the public domain? Is he making any arrangements in that regard? Does he accept that the demand of the Justice for the Forgotten group for a public tribunal of inquiry is still part of its campaign? Is the Taoiseach evaluating the merits of that, following the Barron report, or is he saying, as he did in reply to me in October, that he envisages the Oireachtas joint committee's consideration of the report in public session as in some way conceding to the request for a tribunal?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="708" />Is there anything further the Taoiseach can say about the merits of such a tribunal? Having regard to the fact that, since Abbeylara, Oireachtas committees cannot compel witnesses, perhaps there is a need to look at the matter again, rather than being satisfied with an Oireachtas committee dealing with it in public session. If, as I believe is expected, there is to be a separate report from Mr. Justice Barron on the Dublin bombings of December 1972 and January 1973, when does the Taoiseach expect such a report to be completed?</P>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>As I have stated previously, the 1972-73 reports of the Sackville Place bombings and some other events, the Seamus Ludlow case later and the Dundalk bombings will come in two separate reports from Mr. Justice Barron in the months ahead. I do not have exact dates, but I expect it will be within the next few months. I understand that Mr. Justice Barron does not intend to spend very much longer on this work.</P>
      <P>On the Deputy's reference to Justice for the Forgotten, the answer is &ldquo;Yes&rdquo;. I believe there have been discussions about the report already and further discussions are taking place today with that group. That has been an ongoing process right through. With regard to the redactions, as I have already stated, it is clear that the Garda and the PSNI are not in a position to offer perhaps security information on some of the individuals concerned. We will have to wait and see what happens in that regard.</P>
      <P>I gave a commitment in 1999, having always had an interest in this, as has Deputy Gregory &ndash; one could say we have spent much of our political lives discussing this matter for almost 30 years &ndash; that I would bring the matter to the stage it has now reached. After that, it is a matter for discussion. I do not wish to get into the next phase until people have had an opportunity to reflect on the situation.</P>
      <P>Over the years, I have taken the view, when people have been advocating a fully sworn judicial inquiry, that there was no point in incurring huge costs on an inquiry from which one could not be confident of achieving anything. There was no purpose in going in that direction until we had first reached the present stage and reflected on it. Quite frankly, such reflection may not be so much for me as for legal minds to consider as to whether the matter can be brought any further. In many cases, the named individuals are long dead and gone. Many of those who were in authority in various places in those days are also long since dead. It would be difficult to think back and reconstruct where one was during that period, but that is a matter for legal minds to reflect on. I would not be in the best position to do that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What Mr. Justice Barron and Mr. Justice Hamilton did was go back over almost the past 29 years and reconstruct matters from every available source. It has been an exhaustive exercise because of the pressure they were under, the <Col N="709" />efforts involved and the contacts that were made. Nobody could have done better. The two judges adopted a no holds barred approach. I read the report not only because I have always had an interest in this issue but also because of the horror it created in my community. People will have to reflect on that. The best people to do so are the members of the committee.</P>
    <P>I earlier indicated to Deputy Rabbitte that we would consult Opposition Deputies regarding the detail of the report that will be considered by the committee in light of the Abbeylara judgment. My officials will do that.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>I was interested in the point Deputy Sargent raised about the killing of Seamus Ludlow. Do I gather from what the Taoiseach said that Mr. Justice Barron is still seized of this matter or that his inquiry is still sitting and that he will bring in a separate report? There was also a bombing in Dundalk which, if I recall correctly, was in the original remit of Mr. Justice Barron. Will the Taoiseach say what matters will be the subject of subsequent reports? I am not clear from his earlier answers about the extent of the deletions recommended from the report by the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform and others. As Deputy Joe Higgins suggested, there could be a narrow balance between on the one hand, the report having public confidence and, on the other hand, the extent to which deletions could undermine that confidence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>On that matter, I would be happy if there were none, but I will have to go on the judgment of the Attorney General on where that is necessary. Consultations are taking place on that and some checking is being done on the names involved. I would like to give the full report to the committee. Perhaps the committee would have one with redactions and one with none. Mr. Justice Barron pointed out in a covering letter the dangers in some of this. He has submitted the report as it is but he pointed out the difficulties. The only difficulty is one of security for some of these individuals.</P>
      <P>On the Deputy's first question, Mr. Justice Barron will report in the coming weeks on the Dublin bombings of 1972 and 1973. I take it he will do that very shortly, I think before Christmas in a separate report and after Christmas in respect of the other cases referred to him. There were a number of them. By and large, these were cases he came across when he was doing all his other work. He was able to report on them. They include the Dundalk bombing and the case involving Seamus Ludlow. I understand there were some other cases which I cannot recall.</P>

      <P>Do I take it from the Taoiseach's last response that the Attorney General has completed his examination of the Barron report and that he has now presented his views to Government? Will the report be referred to the committee by a motion of this House? Will <Col N="710" />we in this Chamber have an opportunity to debate the report either in advance or subsequent to the committee's deliberations? When will Members of this House receive copies of the report?</P>
      <P>Mindful of the situation in the Abbeylara case, how does the Taoiseach envisage the committee's proceedings getting under way and progressing? Does he anticipate that the committee will have the power to summon people to come before it as witnesses? Will it go into its deliberations in that depth? Is there a need for legislation to further empower the committee to carry out its work in an effective and efficient manner? Will the powers of the committee be enhanced and developed? Will further resources be provided to it, given that, certainly from my expectation, this will be an onerous task? In the context of the Abbeylara case, there are lessons to be learned.</P>

      <P>I do not want to be disrespectful and give the Deputy a short answer, but the best way is for me to get the report through the Cabinet, then to pass it to the committee and then work out these issues. The Deputy is correct in that after the judgment in the Abbeylara case and other issues, we will have to look at this. I envisage that the report will be considered in public session and we need to provide for whatever is necessary to achieve that. The Oireachtas Commission will have to examine that, but that is what we should achieve. I want to honour the commitment given in 1999 in this regard. We need to get the report past the Cabinet to the committee, published and discussed in public session in the committee. Whatever is necessary for us to do that&mdash;</P>

Does he accept that publishing a report after this length of time and deleting key individual names from it devalues its purpose? Surely it adds strength to the argument of the relatives' committee and the victims' committee that what is required is a full public inquiry into these events. The publication of a report in which key names have been deleted will strengthen that campaign and it will become an absolute demand for a full public inquiry.</P>

      <P>It is more, in the order of ten. I do not agree with the Deputy that the people concerned will be disappointed with this. The Deputy is arguing that once we get the report, we should proceed with a public inquiry and, a few hundred million euro later, we will end up with a final report that will not be as good as the first. That is not the line to go down because that is not what Justice for the Forgotten or the people are concerned with. The people will get the names. However, I do not believe that any of the people involved will want to see them. The names will be known to the members of the committee. However, I do not believe that they want to get to a position where in the right to life considerations of individuals that have been pointed out by Mr. Justice Barron someone may be killed over this matter.</P>
      <P>I put to Deputy Gregory a scenario that was put to me in the discussions. If you are an innocent person living in Northern Ireland and have never been a source of knowledge to the police, are not on record as being charged or sentenced, and your name appears in this report 30 years later, how willl you feel?</P>

      <P>No, it is not. To be frank, that is nonsense. A full public judicial inquiry will not uncover any more information than what Mr. Justice Hamilton and Mr. Justice Barron uncovered. One could reveal the name of a person who is dead &ndash; it is not known in all these cases whether the persons concerned are dead. Putting these names into the public domain may create difficulties.</P>
      <P>If the committee wants to take responsibility for putting these names in the public domain, with the subsequent consequences of what might happen to a named individual, it can do so, and the members could sign up to take responsibility. That, however, is not something I would wish to do to individuals where no evidence is held against them. I will make the Deputies' concerns known to the committee.</P>
      <P>I hope that having gone through this work painstakingly the objective is not just simply to call for an inquiry without an examination of the report. That is the wrong way to approach this issue. This has to be carefully examined and then we must decide if that is the road we wish to go down.</P>

      <P>&mdash;there is now no need to guillotine motions. The only time there was such a need was when the filibuster was organised by the Opposition. In this case, there is inadequate debate on a Bill if enough time is not provided in the limited speaking slots available to Members. When a Member wants to speak on a Bill, he or she should be allowed to speak in these limited times. I recommend that the Taoiseach looks at the Labour Party's proposals for Dáil reform which deal with this issue. These would give adequate time for legislation without the need to <Col N="716" />guillotine motions and for late sittings. It is not acceptable that Bills such as these are guillotined.</P>

      <P>As in the previous case, the same argument concerning guillotines pertains here. The point made by Deputy Sargent on No. 1 is pertinent, in so far as proposals have been made by all Opposition parties on Dáil reform which would eliminate the need for guillotines and give 30% additional time for work in the Dáil Chamber. In spite of that, when we raised the matter with the Chairperson of the Sub-committee on Dáil Reform, the Government Chief Whip, we were told there might be a meeting some time in the new year. There does not seem to be any urgency on the Government's side to bring in Dáil reform that would eliminate the need for guillotines on important Bills.</P>

      <P>The disabilities Bill, which is to provide measures to facilitate the equal participation of people with disabilities, is listed for publication during this session but we have not seen it yet. Is the publication of the Bill dependent on finalisation of the Education for Persons with Disabilities Bill? When is Committee Stage of this Bill expected to take place? There are serious concerns and a great deal of anxiety among people in the disability sector about both of these Bills. Can the Taoiseach clarify the true position?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>It is hoped to take Committee Stage of the Education for Persons with Disabilities Bill in January. While we would like to have that Bill in place, it is not the reason for the hold up with the disabilities Bill. As I explained yesterday, we are trying to finalise the Bill across a number of Departments under five frameworks. Hopefully, work on the Bill will be concluded during the Christmas break. We are not waiting for the Education for Persons with Disabilities Bill, we are waiting for the physical completion of the work.</P>
      <P>It is hoped the Education for Persons with Disabilities Bill will be passed in the spring, by which time the disabilities Bill should be before the House.</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a large volume of work involved in getting the Bill through. I hope it comes before the House during the spring session during which time consideration of the Education for Persons with Disabilities Bill will be completed also.</P>

The Minister stated this to presenter Mr. Ger Gilroy on three occasions. When he returned to his Department, <Col N="721" />it had to issue a statement saying that he was wrong.</P>

      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I am pleased to open this debate on the Broadcasting (Funding) Bill 2003. This Bill is a core element in the programme of public service broadcasting reforms announced in December of last year. It provides for the allocation of 5% of the net proceeds of the television licence fee, almost &euro;8 million annually, to a scheme to fund new programmes on television and radio.</P>
      <P>This initiative will increase the availability of high quality programmes on television and radio in both the private and public broadcasting sectors. In particular, the scheme will be available for new programmes on Irish culture, heritage and experience, new programmes to improve adult literacy and for additional Irish language programming. Programmes to be funded will be in addition to existing elements of the schedule of public or private sector broadcasters. The scheme will also fund the development of archiving of television and radio programmes. The objective behind the scheme is to improve the range and quality of programmes available to television and radio audiences in Ireland and to focus on programmes relating to our culture and heritage, in particular.</P>
      <P>The issue of the quality and impact of broadcast material is part of an ongoing debate both here and in Europe about the direction of broadcasting. The number of broadcasting services on offer has exploded and new opportunities are provided by changing technologies. We need to ensure that Irish audiences have access to a comprehensive, quality, distinctively Irish and free broadcasting service, Irish broadcasting services keep up with technologies and Irish audiences, broadcasters and producers are not disadvantaged by global broadcasting markets. I fundamentally disagree with those who argue that a public broadcasting services is no longer needed, that it should not be funded by the State or that it should be limited to a restricted output of niche programming.</P>
      <P>It is in the public interest to ensure that a comprehensive, varied and quality broadcasting service is available to everyone free of charge. The expansion in the market, if anything, strengthens the case for public service broadcasting, particularly in the context of tendencies towards generic minimum cost programming and subscription services for special interest niche programming.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The decision last year to substantially increase the level of public funding for RTE was a clear indication of the Government's commitment to the principle of public service broadcasting. As we move to a digital era, RTE must be able to continue to deliver to Irish audiences free of charge the distinctive broadcasting service they deserve and expect. Equally, it must meet high <Col N="727" />standards and deliver on the challenging agenda which has now been set for it. Part of RTE's mandate is to provide a range of radio and television services for all the people. It is the very nature of these services, with the variety and quality required by legislation, that underlies the specific nature of public service broadcasting.</P>
    <P>While independent broadcasters are providing a different kind of service, there is scope for them to offer high quality programming of interest and relevance to Irish audiences. The proposed new scheme is an initiative which will, I hope, raise expectations about programming variety and content, prove that the talent and ideas are out there and highlight our own rich culture and heritage.</P>
    <P>A distinctive broadcasting service is a fundamental requirement but has to develop in the realities of the increasingly globalised market. The digital technology issue has dominated debate on broadcasting in Europe to a significant degree, focusing on what technology will win out or what business model is most likely to succeed.</P>
    <P>There has been criticism of the lack of progress in this area in Ireland but this fails to recognise the number of the complex realities. A number of pay DTT platforms have been spectacular failures and rights issues have to be teased out to prevent our broadcasters facing major difficulties on many digital platforms. It is vital that Ireland gets digital platforms which work. However, there is no point rushing to mimic the pay DTT platforms which have lost billions or the satellite platforms where copyright issues would entail huge financial and, ultimately, programming losses for Irish broadcasters.</P>
    <P>The Department is assessing the options for rolling out digital television services in Ireland, taking the practicalities and the international experiences into account. The eventual outcome will ideally include the possibility of a broadband offering. This would improve the economics of the platform and provide much needed cross-platform competition in the broadband sector. The industry will be consulted as part of the assessment and a report should be with the Minister by the end of the year.</P>
    <P>We must also recognise a major concern that the digital era will result in less choice for audiences and an overall reduction in programming quality. The purely commercial pursuit of the most economically advantageous audiences can lead to lowest common denominator programming, generic schedules, cultural imperialism and specialised niche programmes for those who can pay.</P>
    <P>A third issue in the broadcasting sector which I would like to highlight is local and community broadcasting services, which can provide valued services for particular regions and communities. Their potential is recognised in the broadcasting funding scheme, which specifies &ldquo;the development of both local and community broadcasting&rdquo; as one of the objectives under section 3.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="728" />There is huge potential for local and community broadcasting services and for radio, in particular, to carry or, indeed, commission the kind of programmes envisaged in the Bill. While it is envisaged that the scheme will encourage applications from this sector, no specific financial allocations are made in the legislation for this or any other specific area.</P>
    <P>It is important that the scheme can operate within a flexible framework which allows it to meet all its objectives, make the best use of the funding and evolve over time in response to circumstances. I am also aware that community services, in particular, are interested in accessing funding of a more general nature, such as for capital, start-up or training costs. The purpose of this Bill, however, is specifically related to programmes.</P>
    <P>As I have already outlined, the aim of the broadcasting funding scheme is to encourage broadcasters to include in their schedules additional high quality programming of interest and relevance to Irish audiences. It is a clear indication of the Government's resolve that the people should continue to be guaranteed a minimum level of distinctive, high quality programming.</P>
    <P>The emphasis on additionality is central to the scheme. Programmes must be in addition to any existing requirements relating to broadcasters and to their existing outputs. The scheme will also be used to fund the development of archiving of television and radio programme material. This is a follow up on one of the recommendations of the forum on broadcasting which reported to the Minister last year.</P>
    <P>The forum highlighted the lack of a coordinated approach or overall direction to the archiving of programme material at present. A variety of agencies, in addition to RTE, are already involved in the archiving of audio-visual material, including, for example, the National Archives, the Irish Film Board and the Irish Traditional Music Archive.</P>
    <P>The Bill provides the legislative framework for the scheme, which will be prepared and administered by the Broadcasting Commission. It does not set out the detail of the scheme, such as grant rates, the allocation of funding to various categories, or the assessment criteria and procedures. That detail will be developed as the scheme is put together, and the final scheme or schemes will be subject to my approval and be laid before each House of the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>It may be useful to Members to have some idea of the timeframe of the scheme. If the legislation is enacted by the end of the year, 5% of this year's net television licence fees will be allocated to the scheme and the Broadcasting Commission can begin preparation of the scheme in the new year.</P>
    <P>The scheme, because of its complexity and intention to consult widely, will take some months to complete. It will then have to be put to the European Commission for approval as a <Col N="729" />State aid. Following such approval and the formal agreement of the Minister, the scheme will be published and applications will be invited, hopefully in the second half of 2004. Allowing time for interested parties to develop and submit proposals and for applications to be assessed, audiences may begin to enjoy the new programmes on radio and television in 2005.</P>
    <P>I will now describe the detail of the Bill, which is a short one with just nine sections. It sets out the framework for, and objectives of the scheme, the amounts to be paid to the scheme, the details of the scheme to be included in annual reports and accounts of the Broadcasting Commission, and contingency provisions for the winding up and dissolution of the scheme. I will comment briefly on each section and outline the main provisions.</P>
    <P>Section 1 is a standard provision which gives definitions for the purposes of the Bill. Section 2 provides that the Broadcasting Commission will prepare and submit for the Minister's approval a scheme or schemes to support new television or radio programmes on Irish culture, heritage and experience, new television or radio programmes to improve adult literacy, programmes under both of these categories in the Irish language, and the development of archiving of programme material.</P>
    <P>The categories of programmes are specifically defined, so that best use can be made of limited funding. News and current affairs programmes are specifically excluded, as particular requirements are already set out in legislation and contracts applicable to broadcasters. RTE already commissions independent productions as a substantial part of its programming schedule, covering a wide variety of topics and ideas.</P>
    <P>Having a specific focus in the context of finite resources will encourage new and distinctive programmes, and the focus in this Bill is on Ireland's heritage, environment and culture. This concept of who we are, and why we are what we are, offers considerable scope for programmes, as can be seen from the examples in subsection 2(1)(<i>a</i>).</P>
    <P>Television programmes may be funded only if broadcast on a free television service which provides near universal coverage, thus ensuring the widest audience within the State, or on a cable or MMD system, multipoint microwave distribution system, as part of a community content contract, thus enabling community television to access the scheme. Radio programmes may only be funded if broadcast on RTE services or on services licensed by the Broadcasting Commission. The scheme is, therefore, available for additional programmes carried on national, local and community services.</P>
    <P>For reasons relating to EU legislation, it is not possible to construct the Bill so that the scheme is available only to broadcasters based in Ireland. The focus must be such that the benefit of the scheme, the new programmes, is available to Irish audiences, regardless of the provider. I stress that <Col N="730" />the scheme is not for broadcasters; it is for the audience.</P>
    <P>Section 2 also provides that the Minister may direct the commission to amend or revoke a scheme. This could arise, for example, where the operation of a scheme turns up particular anomalies, difficulties or unintended effects. The Bill also provides powers to direct the commission to prepare a particular scheme, if, for example, it does not put forward for approval a scheme covering a particular category. The section finally provides that any scheme approved by the Minister will be laid before each House of the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>Section 3 sets out the objectives of the scheme. With regard to programmes on Irish culture, heritage and experience, these are to develop high quality programmes, and programmes in the Irish language, to increase the availability of such programmes to audiences, to represent the diversity of Irish culture and heritage, to record oral heritage and aspects of heritage which are disappearing, under threat, or which have not been previously recorded, and to develop local and community broadcasting.</P>
    <P>The objective on the development of archiving of programme material is to develop an integrated approach, including the development of suitable storage processes and formats and the accessing of material by interested parties. An objective for adult literacy programmes is not included in this section as there is already a specific reference to it in section 2. My colleague, the Minister for Education and Science, will be closely involved in the particular aspect of the scheme regarding the national adult literacy strategy under the national development plan.</P>
    <P>Section 4 provides for annual payments to the scheme of 5% of net television licence fee receipts. This will amount to an annual payment to the scheme of approximately &euro;8 million. At present the full value of the licence fee receipts, less collection costs, goes to RTE to fund its public broadcasting service. The 5% payment will be for the purposes of both the scheme and any administration or reasonable expenses relating to it. Costs to the Broadcasting Commission of administration, including additional staff, are estimated at about &euro;400,000 per year.</P>
    <P>Section 5 requires the Broadcasting Commission to review and report on the operation, impact and effectiveness of the scheme every three years, or at such other time as may be requested by me. The review will be laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas. If necessary following such a review, the scheme can be amended or revoked under section 2, either on the commission's volition or the Minister's direction. The ultimate option of winding up the scheme is provided for in section 7.</P>
    <P>Section 6 provides that details of the scheme will be provided in the commission's annual report and accounts. Section 7 provides for the winding up and dissolution of the scheme. This is included as a last resort provision, as once the <Col N="731" />scheme is wound up and dissolved by order it ceases to exist and cannot be revived. Section 2 of the Bill already allows for the fine-tuning of the scheme over time, by means of amendments or revocations. Winding up the scheme would require the consent of the Minister for Finance and the dissolution order will be laid before each House of the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>Section 8 is a standard provision that the expenses incurred by the Minister in the administration of the Act will be paid out of moneys provided by the Oireachtas. Section 9 sets out the short title of the Bill.</P>
    <P>Members will, I hope, see the Bill as straightforward and non-controversial and give it their support. I look forward to hearing their observations on it. I commend the Bill to the Dáil.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SimonCoveney" hpid="Mr. Coveney Mr. Coveney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coveney</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to speak on broadcasting generally and also to talk in detail about some of the welcome aspects of the Bill, on which I congratulate the Minister, and some aspects which I feel are missed opportunities. Without being political, I hope the Minister will take the concerns of Fine Gael on board between now and Committee Stage.</P>
      <P>I reaffirm Fine Gael's support for something the Minister of State outlined at the beginning of his speech &ndash; the existence of one strong national public service broadcaster, in the form of RTE. Fine Gael is very supportive of proper funding for RTE. It is obvious that such funding should be used and monitored in an efficient manner. We wholeheartedly subscribe to the Forum on Broadcasting's recommendation that RTE should continue to exist as a strong public service broadcaster. This is the best way of providing for the public service broadcasting needs of a country like Ireland. It is important that I clarify this belief before I say anything else.</P>
      <P>Before I talk about the detail of the Broadcasting (Funding) Bill 2003, what happened yesterday to the Supplementary Estimate which was supposed to be discussed by the Select Committee on Communications, Marine and Natural Resources today? It was intended that the Supplementary Estimate would allocate an additional &euro;1 million in grant-in-aid to Teilifís na Gaeilge. The Dáil agreed yesterday that Vote 30 would be referred to the select committee, but the meeting planned for today has been cancelled. I have been informed that the Department of Finance is no longer prepared to make the money available. This issue needs to be clarified. Will Teilifís na Gaeilge receive an additional capital allocation of &euro;1 million? If the money is to be allocated, why is the matter not being discussed by the select committee today, as was the intention until yesterday afternoon? There are some concerns in respect of the funding. The matter needs to be clarified by the Department, in this forum or elsewhere, at the next possible opportunity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is a rare occasion because I would like to congratulate the Minister for showing some cour<Col N="732" />age. I refer to the establishment of the independent fund last year, which was a somewhat controversial thing to do. I support the concept of the fund, however. The Bill will establish a new broadcasting funding scheme for television and radio programmes. Under the scheme, which will be administered by the Broadcasting Commission of Ireland, 5% of television licence fee receipts will be used to establish an independent broadcasting fund. The new fund will be used to support a range of broadcasting sectors, as outlined in section 2 of this Bill, to which I will return later in my contribution.</P>
    <P>The Bill sets out the general objectives and the framework of the scheme, as the Minister of State has outlined. The details of the scheme are to be prepared and administered by the BCI, however, before being approved by the Minister. I ask the Minister to consider bringing the details of the scheme to committee, if possible. The fund is a new departure for Irish broadcasting. The parliamentary spokespersons in this area are interested in this matter. We would like to discuss it in a positive and constructive way at the committee. When the details of the scheme have been prepared by the BCI, it would be a positive approach to discuss them at the committee.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State has outlined that this Bill is a key element of the Government's public service strategy. I support the concept that underpins the Bill. The fund will be significant as it will consist of 5% of the &euro;150 that is paid per television licence. This comes to about &euro;8 million in 2003. The figure is likely to increase significantly as we move forward. RTE's television licence fee receipts came to &euro;80 million in 1998, but this figure had increased to almost &euro;160 million by 2003. The television licence fee receipts used for public service broadcasting doubled from &euro;80 million to &euro;160 million in five years. I know that a commitment has been given, subject to certain safeguards, to increase the licence fee in line with inflation. If the trend I have outlined continues, the figure of &euro;8 million will increase each year until it has become a very significant sum of money. It is important, therefore, that the fund is managed in a transparent and open manner.</P>
    <P>Will the Minister outline in his response the anticipated cost of administering this fund? A colleague has told me that it will cost &euro;400,000 to administer the fund each year. I assume this figure emerged from the Minister's contribution in the Seanad. It seems a lot of money. When one considers that just &euro;8 million is being handed out, it seems that a high percentage of the overall take will be spent on administration. It would be helpful if the Minister would clarify that figure.</P>
    <P>Under this Bill, independent broadcasters will be able to apply for funds for independent projects. They will no longer have to rely on RTE, TV3 or sponsors to provide the funds for certain types of programme or broadcasting activity. This is a very welcome development. Although RTE has done a reasonably good job in supporting certain cultural projects and other public service <Col N="733" />broadcasting projects in the past, it makes sense to have an independent fund in the future.</P>
    <P>The key area of the Bill is section 2, which outlines the types of schemes that may be supported by the BCI under the independent fund. I seek clarification about one aspect of the section before Committee Stage. I am interested in the definition of &ldquo;Irish culture&rdquo; in the section. The Bill states that funds can be approved to support &ldquo;television or radio programmes on Irish culture&rdquo;. An attempt is made to clarify this statement in section 2(1)(<i>a</i>), which states that such programmes may be about:</P>
    <P>(i) history (including history relating to particular areas, groups or aspects of experience, activity or influence),</P>
    <P>(ii) historical buildings,</P>
    <P>(iii) the natural environment,</P>
    <P>(iv) folk, rural and vernacular heritage,</P>
    <P>(v) traditional and contemporary arts,</P>
    <P>(vi) the Irish language, and</P>
    <P>(vii) the Irish experience in European and international contexts,</P>
    <P>A number of people have expressed concern to me in recent days about this aspect of the Bill. It has been argued that the new Irish culture &ndash; multiculturalism &ndash; is not covered in this section. Irish society struggles to cope with multiculturalism at times, but most of the time we welcome new cultures to this country as part of an overall Irish multiculturalism that exists, particularly in cities such as Dublin, Cork and Limerick. If a broadcaster or programmer wishes to apply for funding to reflect the multicultural aspects of immigrant communities such as asylum seekers, for example, such a desire should be catered for in this legislation. If that is what is meant by &ldquo;the Irish experience in European and international contexts&rdquo;, that is fine, but we have a responsibility to offer a little more clarity in that area. The wording of section 2(1)(<i>a</i>) could be improved.</P>
    <P>I welcome the provisions of section 2 relating to adult literacy levels, which are not as good in Ireland as they should be. It is a hidden problem in many cases because some adults may be too proud to address it. They may be afraid to deal with it because they do not want to be seen as people who, for whatever reason, have not received the education required to be fully literate. Public service broadcasting offers us a way forward in this regard. Adults can access literacy education through television or radio in the privacy of their sittingrooms or bedrooms.</P>
    <P>I commend the work that has been done by RTE in respect of adult literacy, particularly on Radio 1. I have had the pleasure of listening to such programmes while driving to Cork late at night. It has shown some initiative in this area but that is only the tip of the iceberg from an opportunity point of view. I welcome the Government's intention, which is long overdue, to <Col N="734" />address, through broadcasting, adult literacy in a more enthusiastic manner.</P>
    <P>Section 2(2) provides that funding can only be committed to television programmes that are free to air and have a wide coverage or are on cable or MMD systems in a community context. I welcome that provision. There are huge opportunities, in rural parts of Ireland in particular, for community television to be successful. Community radio has, in the past five years in particular, achieved success beyond everyone's aspirations. The listenership figures for local and community radio, primarily dealing with local issues in certain areas, has been a phenomenal success. Deputies from outside Dublin know the primary media for getting their message across to the electorate is local radio. I would like to encourage a similar development with local and community television.</P>
    <P>My constituency is the heartland for Southcoast television, the largest and most vocal community television grouping in Ireland.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBrowne2" hpid="Mr. Browne Mr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>It has been very controversial in its day.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SimonCoveney" hpid="Mr. Coveney Mr. Coveney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coveney</NameTxt>
      <P>That is true. It has been highly political and controversial in its day. Nevertheless, it has survived and is now operating legally, although it might not have been possible to say that when it commenced operations. I admire those involved with that station who, against the odds, have successfully competed with much larger organisations and continue to do so.</P>
      <P>Local and community radio is filling the niche for a visual form of media providing local content, discussing local issues and offering local public service broadcasting. There is a tendency to move towards the Sky network where all sports is international and all current affairs programming is becoming international and television programming is moving away from the local angle of a story. At the same time, radio has made a move in the other direction. The reason is that we have not provided local television with any oxygen. This fund can address that issue. I know my colleagues in Fine Gael also want to raise this matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Having welcomed a number of sections in the Bill, I would like to address my remarks &ndash; and I hope the Minister of State will listen carefully to what I have to say &ndash; to captioning and subtitling on television, and the legislation has missed a huge opportunity to address this issue. The Broadcasting Commission of Ireland is involved in a consultative process with RTE and TV3 in particular on improving the level of subtitling on television. The legal term is captioning but everybody knows it as subtitling. I have committed Fine Gael to the approach of legislating to set targets which broadcasters must meet over a phased period. This approach has worked well in other countries, Canada being the prime example. It has now reached 100% subtitling on many channels. A number of US states have <Col N="735" />achieved up to 95% subtitling. The BBC is committed to 100% subtitling by 2008. Despite this, Ireland remains in a consultative process trying to encourage broadcasters to improve subtitling levels.</P>
    <P>RTE1 has made significant progress in this area, and that needs to be said. A total of 64% of peak time programming on RTE1 is subtitled. However, it does not have such good figures for off-peak times. Only 15% of peak time programming on Network 2 is subtitled. The figures for TV3 show that, apart from Coronation Street, there is no subtitling of programmes. Consultative approach or not, we are failing as legislators and policymakers to address this issue. This Bill presents us with a golden opportunity to do so. We are creating an independent broadcasting fund, separate from RTE, to be administered by the BCI, which is involved in the consultative process to increase the level of captioning-subtitling on television, yet we are not allowing the BCI to allocate funds from the &euro;8 million in 2003 &ndash; it will probably be &euro;10 million next year &ndash; to cover the cost of increasing subtitling levels on TV3, in particular, and on other stations, including RTE. I advocate that we ring-fence part of it for that purpose.</P>
    <P>The reality is &ndash; and I have spoken to an independent Irish broadcaster&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBrowne2" hpid="Mr. Browne Mr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>There is only one.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SimonCoveney" hpid="Mr. Coveney Mr. Coveney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coveney</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes. That broadcaster will not introduce significant levels of subtitling under current conditions because it cannot afford to do so. It is an expensive process. It would cost TV3 between 5% and 30% of programme costs to provide subtitling depending on whether it is a live news bulletin, which costs a great deal, or Coronation Street which costs less because the subtitles are already included by another broadcaster.</P>
      <P>We must be serious about offering subtitling services to the hard of hearing and deaf people. A significant number of people are in that category. Estimates for the number of people hard of hearing are put at 20% of the population. Most are senior citizens but some are young deaf people. They also pay the &euro;150 television licence fee. Are we saying we cannot justify putting 5% of that money into an independent fund to provide for improved public service broadcasting, that it is not good use of that money to spend some of it on significantly improving subtitling levels on television? The Bill misses a huge opportunity to deal with this issue and I hope the Minister of State will try to address it on Committee Stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I accept we have only &euro;8 million to &euro;10 million and that we cannot spread it thinly across all sectors to try to solve all problems. The Government would be making a strong statement if it ring-fenced 20% to 25% or some percentage of that fund so that TV3 or RTE could apply for funding for the provision of subtitling of television programmes. <Col N="736" />We would then be directly addressing a concern that will not be addressed through a cosy consultative process. The financial and commercial reality is that TV3 cannot currently afford to subtitle news and live programmes. It certainly cannot afford to do what I would like to force it to do through legislation, namely, meet ambitious targets over the next five to ten years. During the summer Fine Gael launched a Broadcasting (Captioning of Televised Programming) Bill 2003. I do not wish to say too much about it, except to outline its purpose, which was to set targets that could be met by broadcasters. We had estimated that, by the end of 2005, broadcasters could be asked to caption 60% of programmes, by 2006, up to 70%, by 2008, up to 80%, and so on, moving towards what they have achieved in Canada and the US and what the BBC will also achieve by 2008. The only way that such a policy can be realistic is if, on the one hand, we require broadcasters to do it by law and, on the other, we prepare a fund to which they can apply to help finance subtitling. I appeal to the Minister not to miss this opportunity. The deaf community and representatives of people who suffer from hearing loss or impairment have the right to demand it. They are entitled to access televised media if they pay their television licence fee. They are entitled to it anyway.</P>
    <P>I finish with a technical point which we might try to address. A part of people's television licence fee will go into public service broadcasting radio programming. When people pay their &euro;150, they should know what they are paying for. We should have a more transparent billing system for the television licence fee so that we explain to people on the bill that 5% of what they pay will go towards a fund which can help finance independent public service broadcasting on both radio and television. It is important always to be cognisant of people's right to know what they are paying for. That is a straightforward technical matter to address. When people get their bill or pay their licence fee, I would like them to know, for example, that &euro;143 of their &euro;150 currently goes to funding public service broadcasting through RTE but that the other &euro;7 will go into the independent fund, which can be used for both radio and television broadcasting. That is, in simple terms, a move towards a more transparent billing system, and people will support it when they know what is on offer and what they are paying for. In the Minister's speech, he said that &ldquo;audiences may begin to enjoy the new programmes on radio and television in 2005&rdquo;. Between now and then, they should certainly know how it is being financed and what section of their bill is going towards it.</P>
    <P>I also hope that audiences who are hard of hearing or deaf will also be able to enjoy the fruits of the independent fund by 2005 and into the future. The subtitling issue will not be resolved overnight, but if we do not allocate a portion of the fund to it, I certainly cannot see us introducing another fund or levy at any stage which will <Col N="737" />help fund the cost of subtitling. Let us not miss that opportunity.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TommyBroughan" hpid="Mr. Broughan Mr. Broughan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Broughan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the purposes for which the additional moneys would be spent under section 2 of the Bill, as the Minister has detailed. However, my party and I have grave reservations and concerns about the source of funding and the future operation and running of the fund. I know that the Minister has consistently advocated such a fund in the context of the greatly increased television licence fee and RTE's response to the broadcasting forum report. In the Seanad the Minister spoke several times of the fund's additionality and also about leaving broadcasting to the broadcasters. However, it seems quite clear here that there is no additionality and that it is simply part of the existing licence fee which is being diverted in this direction. It is also notable that it has been reported that at least one senior member of the Minister's staff seems to have been completely opposed to his course of action in setting aside 5%. I believe it was Fintan O'Toole who said that revenue was at the heart of independence, and independence at the heart of public sector broadcasting. He went on to say that a public broadcaster must, first and foremost, provide a service to the public as a whole and not to commercial or sectoral interests. Those include, as the broadcasting forum underlines, its political masters.</P>
      <P>Before last year's licence fee increase, the dependence of the national public broadcaster on advertising had become extremely unbalanced, and its independence could certainly have been threatened in that regard. As we read in the media, year on year there are concerns for that independence from political masters regarding indexation. The diversion of 5% of the licence fee can be seen as weakening our national broadcaster's independence. The revenue targets for this year presented to the Joint Committee on Communications, Marine and Natural Resources seemed to indicate that the station was reaching a good situation, with an almost 50-50 split between advertising and licence fee revenue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister has said that the details will be worked out later and presented to us in the form of regulations. However, it is striking that the Broadcasting Commission of Ireland, or BCI, is itself due to undergo massive change. Possibly, as RTE and others have long contended, we are to have a totally new broadcasting authority for Ireland. It is not clear from the Bill how exactly the BCI or its successor would work as the commissioning agent for this valuable new, locally-based material. My colleague has questioned the amount which the Minister stated in the Seanad would be devoted to administration. I believe that the figure was around &euro;400,000. On the basis of simple economies of scale, one would have to ask whether it might not have been better to have asked the national public service broadcaster to embrace those purposes itself in a special commissioning role, thereby being able to benefit <Col N="738" />from such economies. Neither the BCI nor its predecessor appears to have a great track record on news and public service broadcasting obligations. It has often been argued that those obligations have been watered down &ndash; or were allowed to be watered down &ndash; so that stations would become commercially viable, as we have seen. Many of those stations have now been taken over by foreign and other interests.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources, has been quoted in the newspapers shouting at the stable door after the horse has bolted, lamenting that our valuable radio spectrum, which had been allocated to local broadcasters, was sold off at an inflated value to incoming companies. The Minister has said he will introduce legislation in this regard but I wonder whether he will.</P>
    <P>There are many questions about how the fund and the commissioning of works under it will be administered. The idea of having a public service broadcasting editorial viewpoint is to be welcomed. It is often said that one of the problems with RTE was that it was oriented too much towards the eastern region when it should have been more regionally oriented. That notwithstanding, until the recent commitment from RTE, there was no Dublin correspondent for the public service broadcaster. We do not want monoliths in the public service, as was the case when, for example, Éamon de Valera was our leader and his friends sang every night on our single RTE station, there being little other choice. The Labour Party feels that this funding could have been better sourced and that we should not have interfered with the fundamental idea of the licence for the national public service broadcaster.</P>
    <P>RTE is facing into a period of massive change. The Minister has said he is considering transferring RTE to company status as the idea of the BAI evolves. There has also been a dramatic increase in competition from foreign cable and satellite stations. RTE appeared before the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Communications, Marine and Natural Resources, of which Deputy Coveney and I are members, this time last year and a couple of months ago. It must be acknowledged that the broadcaster has made impressive strides towards implementing the forum on broadcasting report and the conditions which the Minister laid down, in particular, the long-term strategy and business plan, integrated business divisions, the audience council, the broadcasting charter and the statement of commitments. The statement of commitments captured public attention this time last year and since then the six stations of the national broadcaster have delivered on those commitments.</P>
    <P>There have been some problems. At the most recent committee meeting, issues of possible conflicts of interest and codes of practice at the national broadcaster were raised. I hope lessons have been learned from the issues which arose recently. At the time of the television licence fee increase last year, it was assumed that it was the <Col N="739" />beginning of indexation. There then seemed to be a period in which the Department was unsure and was sending out mixed signals. <i>The Sunday Business Post</i> recently reported correspondence between the Department and PricewaterhouseCoopers in regard to the targets which RTE has to meet, such as monthly reviews, financial results, comparing programme outputs with plans and change management strategy. It could be said that the national broadcaster is being invigilated more closely than ever. In this context, there is concern at any attempt to water down the role of the licence.</P>
    <P>The Minister, Deputy Dermot Ahern, referred at length to the digital platform. The Minister's speech in the Seanad seemed to be defensive in that he stated he was glad RTE did not take action on it since it could have been exposed to serious implications, given the disaster of the ITV digital platform. Nevertheless, we are in an era of massive change and opportunity for public service broadcasting in the digital area and the Minister should address it as soon as possible. We have asked him repeatedly to address the issues in regard to the Astra 2D satellite and the free reception of the eight BBC channels. It is striking that the BBC has been able to strengthen its independence and remit in regard to the services it provides to the public. There are key problems associated with RTE joining such a platform but it is a challenge to the Minister and one which he should address on our behalf as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>In section 2 the Minister has set out a list of desirable aims in respect of additional programming of history, the natural environment, the rural vernacular tradition and the Irish language, for which I commend him. Like other Members, representations were made to me about aspects which we could have considered under this funding as it evolves, as I would have done had the funding evolved from a different source. The Irish association of non-governmental development organisations, Dóchas, feels there should be some reference in programmes to Ireland's role in international affairs in the increasingly globalised world, an aspect of which is referred to in the Bill. However, it could be examined more closely.</P>
    <P>I particularly welcome reference to the archiving of programme material. Some of the best work done by local and community stations has been local archiving, even from the minimal level of recording senior citizens and their valuable experiences of history, many of who know intimately the world of the 1920s, 1930s, 1940s and so on. The archiving of such material in digital and other formats for transmission to the generations is a wonderful resource. I also welcome the qualifications set down in subsection (2) in regard to peak time and the free television service.</P>
    <P>My colleague referred at length to the issue of access rights for people with disabilities. It is interesting we are debating this Bill on a day in which there are many visitors to Leinster House in groups representing citizens with disabilities. <Col N="740" />The communications committee, chaired by Deputy O'Flynn, met people who represent those who are hard of hearing, such as the Irish Deaf Society and so on. RTE must be commended for the tremendous strides it has made in achieving the 80% level in this regard. I accept the expensive nature of this provision but if one is to run a national station on a purely commercial basis or part-funded by the public, these issues must be addressed. It is pointless if a significant number of citizens cannot follow what is going on.</P>
    <P>Deputy Coveney introduced legislation, although I got the impression when I met some of the groups that a number of Opposition parties were to do this together. Nevertheless, I support what Fine Gael has done. The BCI is holding a consultation process in respect of access rules and I strongly urge the Minister to follow up on that issue in order that, as Deputy Coveney stated, rigorous targets and a timeframe are specified regarding the eventuality of all television signals being digitally captured. This will ensure that some citizens will not be left in a position where they cannot follow.</P>
    <P>We received many representations from groups in community radio and television such as the Community Media Network and others. I welcome the tremendous achievements all over this island in the area of community broadcasting. In the territory in which I live, the north side of Dublin, one of the leading stations, North-East Access Radio, is run on a shoestring and must utilise community employment and similar supports. There should always have been some sort of broadcasting fund for the public sector, but not financed in the way outlined in the Bill. It is clear that such a fund is needed to try to support local radio stations. Most of the bodies that contacted us were concerned about seed funding, capital funding and how to go about setting up a station. If these stations could get up and running, they would serve an important need in terms of local and community affairs.</P>
    <P>The national broadcaster, RTE, TV3 and other major stations such as Today FM should always have had a role of linking up with community broadcasting. One of the most valuable things the community stations have done is to train young broadcasters who are often a few years later seen in the environs of the House working for national broadcasters. That is a matter to which further consideration could be given in the context of the Bill.</P>
    <P>The Specialist Radio Association has an interesting viewpoint on the way the spectrum could develop in the future, particularly if we abandon the analogue system and go completely digital. This is another issue the Minister should address. Brandenburg state in Germany has switched off the analogue system completely and moved to digital transmission. However, Stockholm in Sweden and Salt Lake City in the US have perhaps 60 stations which all appear to be viable. Each of these is a niche station providing different types of music and services, be they <Col N="741" />community, regional or whatever. We should keep an open mind in respect of this area. We should also be careful in terms of what could happen to stations of this sort in the future. The Minister tried to shut the stable door recently by referring to the selling on of stations. Perhaps he needs to address this issue further.</P>
    <P>There was a widespread assumption in the past that some of the larger commercial stations were allowed to jettison public service requirements in the interests of commercial viability. A large number of stations in the Dublin region have strikingly similar outputs and formats. It is rare that we have the opportunity to debate broadcasting matters. In that context, I commend the Dublin news station Newstalk 106 which has played an important role in the development of political discourse in the capital. There may be an opportunity to establish such a station on a national level, both through public broadcasting and in the commercial arena.</P>
    <P>One other area in respect of which there have been debates in recent weeks, particularly when the Houses took their mid-term break, is that of parliamentary broadcasting. It seems that Ireland is significantly behind the times in this regard, particularly if one considers the achievements of C-SPAN, the not for profit, cable operator in the United States on which people can watch the proceedings of the House of Representatives and the Senate. There is also BBC Parliament, one of the stations to which I referred earlier. I commend TG4 in respect of the trail it blazed on the DIRT inquiry and in terms of covering the proceedings of the House. Our business is that of the people. It is extremely important and they should be able to watch our deliberations right now.</P>
    <P>Members of Oireachtas committees work hard. The Chairman of the Joint Committee on Communications, Marine and Natural Resources, who is present in the Chamber, and Deputy Coveney are aware that last week the committee spent six hours, without a break, debating the topic of aquaculture, an important area of our remit. Two of the newspapers carried reports of perhaps two lines each about our deliberations on that matter. Those present at the meeting, scientists, representatives of the industries, hard-working Deputies and the Chairman, had a good discussion on the matter. It is a pity that our proceedings could not have been shown live because there are at least 100,000 in Mayo, Galway, the south-west and in Howth in my constituency who would have watched because of their interest in that particular area. Either through the Bill or some other device, we should consider the issue of parliamentary broadcasting now and in the future.</P>
    <P>There are a number of areas relating to section 2 the Minister might re-examine. I welcome his bringing forward key legislation in respect of the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland. In some ways, that should have preceded the Bill before us. I understand that we are to have a further debate on TG4. We have made submissions to the BCI <Col N="742" />in respect of advertising, particularly that which relates to children. These are all matters of interest for the future.</P>
    <P>I welcome the concept of the fund. However, I am concerned about the way in which it will be put in place, namely, through appropriating a slice of the licence fee for the public sector broadcaster. I will be interested in hearing the Minister's response to the concerns I have raised.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Connolly</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Bill as a major step in the continuing evolution of quality public service broadcasting in this country. Broadcasting is one of the most important media through which the right to freedom of expression, that is, to receive and impart information and ideas freely and without interference, is realised. The Bill refers to new and innovative public service broadcasting. Approximately &euro;7 per household from the television licence fee will be allocated to the fund.</P>
      <P>Public service broadcasting is becoming increasingly relevant. Its importance in terms of developing our national identity should not be underestimated. The Bill heralds the future development of public service broadcasting in Ireland following changes in recent years which were driven by technology and an increased emphasis on the cultural and civic importance of broadcasting. Recent developments include the growth in the numbers of private and local broadcasters, satellite and cable technology, digital television and what has become known as the technological convergence.</P>
      <P>Such developments also highlight, to a greater degree than ever, the need for excellence in public service broadcasting because they have promoted ownership concentration and globalisation, with adverse implications for diversity and quality in programming. The examples of Silvio Berlusconi's domination in Italy, CNN's homogeneity in worldwide fare and Rupert Murdoch's far-flung television empire come readily to mind in that regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is to be hoped that the Bill will initiate greater debate about how broadcasters should fulfil their public service mandate and about how the needs of the public will be met by broadcasters in the future. The Bill will also serve to place the principles of public service broadcasting at the centre of the broadcasting agenda. These principles are: universality of availability; universality of appeal; provision for minorities; serving the public good; a commitment to education, independence and autonomy; competition and good performing; and a liberal and open environment for programme makers. In the 21st century, public service broadcasting should not pro<Col N="743" />vide a haven for a nostalgic view of the past in isolation.</P>

      <QRef>[28500/03]</QRef>
    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government (Mr. Cullen)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 41 and 44 together.</P>
      <P>Local authorities fund their expenditure, including expenditure on pay, from a variety of sources, including specific State grants, commercial rates, rents, fees and charges for services and general purpose grants from the local government fund. The issue of benchmarking costs in 2004, as with other current expenditure demands, will be dealt with by local authorities in the context of their annual budgetary process.</P>
      <P>The recently published Abridged Estimates Volume, AEV, indicates that &euro;1.118 billion will be available to the local government fund in 2004, an increase of approximately &euro;38 million over the amount available to the fund this year. In accordance with normal practice, I intend shortly to notify local authorities of general purpose local government fund grant allocations for 2004 in the light of this position, updated by end-November data for motor tax revenues and by other end-year expenditure reviews across my Department's programmes.</P>
      <P>I am satisfied the increases to be provided in general purpose grants from the fund will make an appropriate contribution to meeting the increased costs of local authorities in 2004 and will avoid the need for undue increases in rates, fees and other local charges in 2004.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In accordance with normal practice, I intend to notify local authorities of non-national road grant allocations for 2004 early in the new year. All the extra revenue, estimated at &euro;34 million, generated by the 5% increase in motor tax from 1 <Col N="744" />January will be assigned to the non-national roads programme.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BernardAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>Given that the increase in funding to local authorities next year is not in line with inflation and is the same as, if not less than, the amount allocated this year, does the Minister agree that telling local authorities they must meet the cost of benchmarking from their own resources is like telling a non-swimmer he must swim in a river without a lifebuoy? Does he further agree the only options open to local authorities on this issue are to increase local charges and commercial rates or reduce their payrolls by paying workers by the hour? The Minister has announced a new development levy and the Chambers of Commerce of Ireland have commented on new rates for businesses. What other options are available to local authorities? Does the Minister think they have a magic wand to pay the major benchmarking awards? This was a national deal but local authorities have been asked to pick up a bill of approximately &euro;161 million. Will the Minister outline how he expects local authorities to fund this major award without resorting to the options I have mentioned?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
      <P>The finalisation of the Estimates for local authorities is not complete and I am confident there will not be a need for an excessive increase in rates or charges other than the normal annual increase. These, rightly, are matters for the local authorities themselves. However, the local government general purpose allocation represents 19% of current income of local authorities. Other sources of income include specific State grants, 28%; charges for goods and services, 29%; and commercial rates, 24%. The allocations are 85% higher than in 1987. It is premature to pass judgment until we see the final outcomes. I do not know what they will be. I am conscious of all the issues with which local authorities must deal and the increase in the range and quality of services they deliver. I want to ensure those services continue to develop at the same pace and are enhanced as we move forward, including in the current year. Benchmarking is not the only issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister said local authorities should not increase commercial rates or charges by more than the norm. Is the Minister's guideline for local authorities in terms of such rates and charges that the increase should not exceed the rate of inflation? By how much does he estimate local authorities should increase commercial rates and charges? Given that he said local authorities should raise the balance of the money required for benchmarking and other purposes from their own resources, has the time come for local authorities to charge rates to Departments and State agencies that have offices and buildings within their areas? It is difficult to explain to a small shopkeeper, who must pay considerable rates, why a Department housed in a <Col N="745" />substantial office building in the same area should not pay rates on it. If local authorities must raise moneys from their own resources, the exemption that applies to State property in regard to rates should cease.</P>
      <P>
      </P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
      <P>I will take the last point first. I believe it was with Deputy Gilmore &ndash; perhaps it was not he &ndash; I discussed this on the Valuation Bill when I held that view very strongly. Two issues arise in that regard. First, effectively, it involves the State charging itself &ndash; that is the net effect of it. One is really creating a circular motion in money. I agree with the principle of what the Deputy has said and I made that clear in the debate on the Valuation Bill, in which I made provision for such an eventuality to be capable of falling into place without the need for further legislation. Accordingly, in a previous existence, as Minister of State at the Department of Finance, I provided that this could happen in future. Second, it does not really give an even benefit across the country, as I believe the Deputy would accept. It would have an enormous impact in Dublin and an enormous benefit to local authorities in the Dublin area in particular. Cork is probably the only other area in which it would have a big benefit.</P>
      <P>However, in the overall context of the local government system throughout the country, the benefit would be very marginal. The effect would be to greatly enrich a few local authorities, while achieving nothing across the system. Those are the two questions which need to be resolved and with which we need to grapple. I do not wish to pre-empt the entire current review of the financial base of local government. That may be one of the issues on which there will be submissions and ideas which will feed into the process. I do not have an estimate of the increases. Without wishing to be disingenuous, I have not got the final figures and do not know what they are. We are trying to get them together to see what capacity there is in terms of the final allocation I will make on an individual basis to all local authorities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BernardAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister referred to a review of local government finance which he is currently undertaking. I presume, without being disingenuous, he will not have the results of that review until after the local elections.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
      <P>To be honest, it is of no consequence to me as to when the review comes in. I want that review to be right and I believe it will have to engage all of us in this House. I sincerely hope it will be a very worthy and worthwhile look at the entire local government system. Whenever we get it, its implementation will involve a great deal of political discussion and debate in this House and input from the representative bodies of the local authorities throughout the country. It may take up to a year. My basic tenet in all this is that I want the <Col N="746" />entire picture to unfold, rather than just part of it. I want a good quality analysis internationally so that all of us know what we are talking about in the context of local government <i>vis-à-vis</i>national government, taking account of all the different funding resources. That will take some time to do. The timing is not an issue with regard to local elections.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BernardAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>When does the Minister expect to get the report?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
      <P>As I said, I believe it will take about a year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>I am finding it difficult to understand the Minister's arithmetic. As I understand the position, he is providing an extra &euro;38 million for local authorities this year. When inflation is taken into account, that is probably a net increase of about $18 million. It is my understanding that about &euro;140 million is required to meet the benchmarking costs alone. If, as the Minister said, local authorities are not going to increase commercial rates or charges, except by what the Minister described as the normal&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
      <P>It is the excess.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister used the term &ldquo;normal&rdquo;. In ballpark terms, it is at or around the level of inflation, perhaps a couple of percentage points wide of inflation, but fairly close to it. If the Minister does not expect local authorities to increase commercial rates and charges by more than approximately the rate of inflation, where will they get the additional &euro;120 million to pay the benchmarking awards?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
      <P>I will answer the question in two ways. First, as I tried to convey to the Deputy the other day, the &euro;38 million is the gross figure and shows a 3% increase. However, I intend that the &euro;38 million will go directly into the local government fund, representing, in effect, a 6% increase on the basis that I am taking out the roads portion as I have introduced a 5% increase in motor taxation. That AEV bottom line will not apply to motor tax &ndash; I am putting it into the local government general purpose area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BernardAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>The public will pay for it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is right. The motor tax increase will go directly towards non-national roads. Of the &euro;38 million for LGF general purposes, a 6% increase has been announced already. Buoyancy also has to be taken into account, having regard to new rateable properties in the system &ndash; that will be of some help to local authorities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BernardAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>A lot of old properties are being eliminated from the system, on the other hand.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
      <P>I have explained that to the Deputy. I accept the figure of &euro;140 million and I have put &euro;40 million in the AEV. There is also the extra 5%, which amounts to &euro;34 million. I am ring-fencing that for roads. However, I have not yet finished the process as to the eventual outcome. Deputy Allen, as a former Minister of State, will be aware of the situation. When the full picture is clear to the local authorities, their estimates process can be completed. I am confident that when they work through the process, within reason, across the system, we will not have to seek excessive increases.</P>

I am also aware of the ideas some of them are considering and I am very pleased with the level of inflation they might build into some of the increases, which is very reasonable.</P>
      <P>It was the chambers of commerce which came to me last year &ndash; there is a myth to be dispelled in this regard &ndash; and requested the removal of the cap I had in place on the rates system, which was done in this House.

      <Quest>the additional financial provision for housing contained in his Department's Estimate for 2004; the number of additional dwelling units he expects will be financed by this amount; the average unit cost this represents; the way in which this compares with the average price of a new house; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
      <P>The total housing provision, Exchequer and non-Exchequer, for 2004 of &euro;1.885 billion represents an increase of 5.5% on this year's allocation. This increase in the overall housing programme will allow for the needs of about 12,500 households to be met through the various social and affordable housing measures, <Col N="748" />compared to 8,500 in 1998. The 2004 provision includes capital investment of over &euro;1 billion which will allow for 5,000 starts under the main local authority programme, an increase of 500 above 2003 levels and a further 500 units to commence under area regeneration programmes. The provision will also underpin continuing progress in the voluntary and co-operative housing sector which has been increasing its contribution to the provision of social rented accommodation.</P>
      <P>I expect that the average unit cost of a local authority house in 2004, including site cost and fees, will be in the region of &euro;150,000. The unit cost of comparable voluntary housing type units is broadly similar. The cost of constructing social rented accommodation compares favourably with average house prices. The most recent published figures for house prices are contained in my Department's housing statistics bulletin for the June quarter of 2003, a copy of which is available in the Oireachtas Library.</P>
      <P>Local authorities also acquire some houses in the market to supplement their construction programmes. The prices paid would be broadly similar to new build costs. The Government is also concerned, having provided additional resources for social and affordable housing programmes, to ensure that we achieve good value for money, maximise the output of units and deliver housing in a manner which creates sustainable communities. At the same time, by focusing on measures to boost overall housing supply, the Government seeks to ensure greater availability of housing, to address issues of affordability and to meet the broad range of housing needs.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has shifted the goalposts with regard to housing figures. He is now speaking in terms of housing starts, whereas we had usually discussed housing in terms of completions. First, what is the estimated number of completions for 2003 and what will be the estimated number for 2004? Second, I note from the Minister's figures that the number of starts in 2003 is now 4,500. How has that number fallen from the level of 7,000 which we were previously given in this House as the number of starts for 2003?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
      <P>The 7,000 figure represents the number of starts that were achieved in either 2000 or 2001. That is from where that figure came. I give that answer in good faith. I do not believe that number was promised. It certainly was not promised by me and I am pretty sure it was not promised by the Minister of State with responsibility for housing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>It was promised for 2003.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is correct in that, in the overall context, we have tried to manage this budget, even though it has been increasing and has been obvious that the rate of inflation in the construction industry has been increasing. Con<Col N="749" />struction inflation increased dramatically and that had an impact on our capacity to deliver volume in terms of units.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>Can the Minister stick to the number of completions?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not have the figure for this year but I will get it for the Deputy. I am happy to put it on record. I do not have it because this year is not over yet. I do not know the number of completions, but from memory I am pretty sure it is more than 5,000 units, even though the number of starts this year was 4,500 units.</P>
      <P>In the context of the Estimates process, the bottom line in terms of the specific local authority housing programme was to bring the minimum number of starts back up to a level of 5,000 and to at least maintain that number and increase it going forward. That is what we have achieved this year. The Deputy will realise that the figure I require for starts this year is only a small proportion of the cost of delivering the extra 500 houses because the funding grows substantially thereafter. It is the second year before there are completions and a major cost is incurred in the completion of individual houses.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
      <P>I will try to facilitate the Deputy. He is asking me in November to guess the number of completions that will have been achieved by the end of the year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>What does the Minister estimate will be the number?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
      <P>If I guess that number now, the Deputy will be tell me in January that I was wrong and foolish to have guessed it in November. When the final outcome is in place, it will be a matter of public record and the Deputy will be entitled to know it. I am not prepared to guess the number. This information comes through the local authorities, of which there are many. They must file their returns to my Department. When I have all those, I will know the picture. At this point, I do not know what it is.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>I believe the Minister is in a position to know it. This is the last week of November and he is not in a position to tell us the number <Col N="750" />of local authority houses, to within a few hundred units, that will be completed by the end of December 2003. It is astonishing he is not in a position to give us that information. I think he is concealing it.</P>
      <P>This question is about the Estimates. In terms of his Estimate, how many additional houses will be produced in 2004? Will he inform the House of the number of completions for 2003? I will not haul him over a barrel if he is out by 100 or 150. I accept the number of completions can have increased a little, but at the end of November he ought to be in a position to tell us how many houses will be completed by the end of the year and how many completions his Estimate will produce in 2004. That is basic; it is the fundamental issue in housing. There is an Estimate for housing and the House and members of the public are entitled to know how many houses that Estimate will produce. This is not complicated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
      <P>I can be straightforward on that and tell the Deputy it will be 5,000 houses under that housing programme.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, and I hope that the completions will be at least 5,000.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>

      <askee>Minister for the Environment Heritage and Local Government</askee>
      <Quest>if he proposes to introduce legislation or regulations to impose limits on campaign spending in the local elections to remove the anomaly whereby there are spending limits in general elections but not in local elections.</Quest>
      <QRef>[28496/03]</QRef>
    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
      <P>The introduction of expenditure limits at local elections was considered during the passage of the Local Elections (Disclosure of Donations and Expenditure) Act 1999 through both Houses. It was decided not to introduce limits given the fundamental difference between local and other elections in terms of scale. For example, there were 3,085 candidates at the local elections in June 1999. This compares with 42 at the European elections held on the same day and 463 at the 2002 general election. Similarly for constituencies, there are 268 local electoral areas compared to 42 Dáil and four European Parliament constituencies.</P>
      <P>Experience has show that local authority candidates do not spend significant amounts of money. The introduction of limits would create additional bureaucratic procedures which are not justified in their case.</P>
      <P>The regime which operated at the 1999 local elections and will apply, with minor amendments, at the 2004 polls is a local scheme appropriate to local elections. It is less costly, less bureaucratic and simpler to operate than the scheme for general and European Parliament elections, yet it still embodies the important reporting and disclosure principles of the Electoral Act 1997 for donations and expenditure.</P>
      <P>For the reasons stated, I do not regard the differences between general elections and local elections in this regard as anomalous and I have no proposals to align the regimes involved further.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BernardAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister agree that evidence available from studies done on elections shows that the number of votes won by a candidate is proportionate to the amount of resources put into his or her campaign? Despite his reservations about introducing a limit, does he agree that a major anomaly exists because a limit on campaign spending of approximately &euro;40,000 applies to candidates in a five seat Dáil constituency while candidates in a local election could spend &euro;40,000 or &euro;400,000 on their campaign? Anybody who has the necessary resources or puts his or her mind to getting elected will get elected by spending money and entertaining constituents, as many candidates are already doing. Will the Minister reconsider introducing a limit on campaign spending in local elections despite the logistical difficulties? What is the problem in this regard concerning European elections which the Minister cannot address?</P>

    <P>I referred to the scale and figures involved in local elections. I do not want to overburden people. We are aware of the position in the Dáil and the increase in bureaucracy. All Members have stated that they want to examine this area and ensure there is transparency in this regard. People want to know from where the money <Col N="753" />spent comes, how it is spent and the volume of spending. It should be done in a more sensible way. I do not want to foist this on the local authority system as it has worked well.</P>
    <P>For the purpose of additional reporting of expenses for next year's local elections, all candidates will be given a form which breaks the legislation down into more specific terms such as where sources of funding came from and the donation limits. Candidates will now be required to open a separate bank account for election expenses similar to what Members are required to do.

      <P>On foot of the success of the environmental levy on plastic bags, which was introduced in March 2002 and has resulted in a reduction in the dispensing of plastic shopping bags at retail outlets by over 90%, An Agreed Programme for Government contained a commitment to consider the extension of the levy on plastic bags to other materials which may be problematic from a waste management and litter perspective.</P>
      <P>A recent report issued in July 2003 by the litter monitoring body, which is co-ordinated by my Department, provides valuable statistical data on litter pollution in Ireland. Chewing gum is identified in the report as the single largest litter component in the food litter category. Fast-food take-away bags and wrappers are identified as the largest litter component in the packaging litter category. ATM receipts are also identified in the report as significant elements of paper litter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="754" />The results of this report provide a significant basis for considering appropriate measures to deal with the litter problems caused by chewing gum, fast-food packaging and ATM receipts. In light of these findings, I announced in July measures to tackle litter caused by chewing gum, fast-food packaging and ATM receipts. It is my intention to bring forward detailed proposals to Cabinet at the earliest opportunity following a limited public consultation process, as well as consultation with other Departments.</P>

      <P>The question asked of the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government related to the amount of money paid to consultants in drawing up the action plans he has talked about. Can he give us information on that matter? Can he also inform us as to who some of these consultants are?</P>
      <P>The Minister has been written to by members of the public interested as to why consultants are needed to draw up such plans when civil servants are able to apply themselves to any task that a Minister may generally give them. Does the Minister think it is appropriate that a letter sent to him in this regard was sent on to the consultants' firm which then replied in an unsigned letter stating that the Minister had requested them to do the job with no proper explanation? Why are civil servants in the Minister's Department not in a position to draw up plans for the measures he wants to take &ndash; which I welcome &ndash; in dealing with littler problems? Was there any basis to the decision taken to employ consultants? How is it decided which jobs a consultant or a civil servant will do?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
      <P>I would not employ consultants at all. I did not want or need consultants on this issue when I already had the answer. However, I was persuaded in commissioning a short, sharp consultancy study to confirm the implementation of the measures and to learn how the affected groups see these economic instruments working. However, the bottom line is that I am proceeding with these measures.</P>
      <P>The study is being undertaken by McIver Consulting and Patel Tonra Environmental Consultants for a fixed price sum of &euro;70,301, inclusive of VAT. Two stage payments amounting to &euro;34,469.88, inclusive of VAT, have been paid to date. There is a short timeframe on the study. I am sceptical of consultancy studies but was persuaded that it would be beneficial in this case.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent" hpid="Mr. Sargent Mr. Sargent">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister consider it better practice that the letter be answered by the Department rather than the consultants themselves who are not the most objective people in deciding why they are employed? It seems to be becoming a habit of passing correspondence on to consultants and agencies.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
      <P>When my tenure to date is examined &ndash; and hopefully when it is finished &ndash; it will <Col N="755" />be found that I have the lowest recruitment of committees, consultants and experts. If there is enough common sense in this House, then there is enough in the Civil Service to work these plans out. However, there are issues that surround the implementation of economic instruments that need to be discussed. The approach in this case was the right one. One possible reason the letter was passed on was because such discussions were proceeding and it was seen as relevant to the consultant to engage with the individual who wrote it. The bottom line is that this is an environmental issue. I want it delivered quickly and those affected to know how it will be done.</P>

      <P>With all the talk about benchmarking, I would have thought that Department officials could be stretched a small bit to making decisions themselves.</P>
      <P>What are the guidelines under which consultants are appointed? Will the Minister agree with me that he is very fond of consultants? There are consultants studying the litter problems created by ATM receipts and fast-food packaging. We were informed last night of consultants appointed to inspect pavements and roads at the cost of &euro;375,000. We also learned that PR consultants have been appointed to publicise electronic voting at a cost of &euro;4.5 million. There is a suspicion that these consultancy jobs are for friends of Fianna Fáil when one of its former general secretaries is a member of one such company.</P>

      <P>I have already given the Deputy an answer to that tongue in cheek question. Patel Tonra are environment consultants. As Deputy McCormack is aware, the money from the plastic bag levy is ring-fenced in the environment fund and is recycled directly to all the local authorities. That is why we are seeing such an incredible improvement around the country in bring banks, recycling facilities, etc. along with the introduction of bigger facilities by some local authorities. We are transforming the situation and I am glad this is happening.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="756" />There is a difference between hiring consultants to drive matters forward and hiring them to elicit ideas. All Deputies said the electorate needed to be made aware of what was happening on electronic voting. That is what the process is about and we should not undermine it. The Deputy's colleagues on both sides of the House have said they found the public information awareness campaign during the trial period in the original constituencies to be hugely valuable.</P>

I will be seeking priority for the drafting of the legislation, once approved by the Government, to ensure the Bill is published at the earliest possible opportunity next year.</P>
      <P>In advance of the Government considering these proposals, it would be inappropriate to elaborate on their details, including details on the types of national infrastructure that might be included in the proposed legislation.

      <P>Clearly we are not talking about Vega City. We are talking about major public projects and we do not have to be geniuses to work out what they are. The future major public projects from the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government are largely centred on roads, motorways and waste management facilities. This legislation for major infrastructure projects has been publicly announced. We are entitled to be told at least in general terms what the Government is planning. While it is a matter for the Government to decide on the detail of the legislation, the proposal has been announced by the Taoiseach and has been referred to on a number of occasions in the House. In view of this, the Minister, when asked, is obliged to tell the House in general terms the types of infrastructure projects involved. I am not asking him to list individual projects.</P>

      <P>The Deputy is aware that every day, the Taoiseach is asked questions in this House that are ruled out of order as it is not possible to discuss the contents of a Bill. I am trying to be helpful to the Deputy. Given the obligations on me as a Minister, I am not in a position to discuss proposals in public before I bring them to the Government.</P>
      <P>I may have taken the view that the areas to which the Deputy refers could be termed confined areas, but having started work on this, it is interesting to discover other people's definitions of what are major and strategic projects. I am very interested in some of the ideas that have been proposed and they must be considered, regardless of their source. Many different independent bodies involved in engineering, planning, etc., have submitted interesting views unsolicited. I am happy to consider any ideas that can improve the development of the national infrastructure. I have an open mind on all these matters.</P>
      <P>The Bill in question is not far from being finalised. I hope to take it to Government before Christmas, when the situation will become clear.</P>

      <P>When the Taoiseach announced this, his stated aim was to fast-track major projects. Would the Minister agree that since his announcement, this proposal has gone into the slow lane? From the hype surrounding the announcement, I had expected to see proposals on the table within weeks. However the Minister cannot give us any idea of the specifics of the legislation. Has the Minister consulted with his Cabinet colleagues? For example has he spoken to the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy McDowell, as to whether the Ringsend incinerator should be within the ambit of the legislation? While he says he has spoken to the business sector, has he spoken to representatives of the public who might have concern about bypassing the legal process on planning?</P>

      <P>This is the most significant work in which I have been involved in recent months. The legislation is extremely complex and the Deputy has rightly identified EU directives, EISs, Irish legislation, etc. Nobody would suggest it would be possible to sunder any of that. It is clear that <Col N="759" />bringing a major project to conclusion involves many different processes that do not necessarily run in parallel or in sequence. It takes years to get from the start of a project to delivery. All of us want that to stop.</P>
      <P>We want proper practice, transparency and adherence to all the laws of the land. However the goal is to try to do this encompassing all the points the Deputy raised and in a more specific timeframe. This complex matter has greatly exercised my mind.

I presume the western rail corridor would score highly on that measurement while some others might not. Does the Minister agree that under international law that would be an obligation under the Amsterdam Treaty and the Kyoto Protocol? It is not an optional extra.</P>
      <P>Does the Minister distinguish between infrastructural projects? What is the case with regard to one which is being built ostensibly for profit, in that it will be a business, for example, an incinerator? Regardless of what it is called, thermal treatment, mass burn, waste to energy, waste of energy, it would have to be on a stand-alone profitable basis. A charge would be levied against citizens on that basis. Does the Minister see a distinction between that type of project and one which is infrastructural in terms of road, rail or some other part of civic infrastructure? Will that inform the Bill or will it be used by people who are in a rush to make money&mdash;</P>

      <P>My Department is in regular contact with the British Embassy in Dublin on matters relating to Sellafield. The embassy provided advance notification of this industrial dispute and has kept my Department up to date on developments. My prime concern is that the industrial dispute does not compromise safety at the plant. The Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland has also been maintaining contact with the UK's Nuclear Installations Inspectorate, NII, in regard to the dispute.</P>
      <P>I understand that shift workers at Sellafield took strike action on the afternoon of Friday, 14 November and Friday, 21 November 2003 and that similar action is planned for the next three Fridays. The British Embassy has informed my Department that the British Government remains satisfied that safety at Sellafield will not be compromised as a result of the industrial action. According to the embassy, the UK's NII is satisfied that BNFL's contingency arrangements are adequate to ensure the safety of the site during industrial action. I am informed that regular meetings are being held between the NII, the unions and Sellafield management to discuss safety-related issues and that emergency response teams are not affected by the industrial action.</P>
      <P>The British Government is well aware of the concerns of the Government and the Irish public about Sellafield. The Government remains fully committed to bringing about the safe closure of the Sellafield plant.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent" hpid="Mr. Sargent Mr. Sargent">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
      <P>This is along the lines of draining the Shannon and restoring the Irish language. In seriousness, the industrial action at Sellafield has interfered with the operation of the plant. Enormous security back-up would be required to avoid a potentially catastrophic event if industrial action were to be escalated at Sellafield. Does this inform the Government more clearly of the need to hold out for serious changes, for example, in the European constitution, in regard to EURATOM? This treaty needs to be dismantled and the provisions for safety put into the new treaty rather than having EURATOM as a stand-alone treaty which is effectively a proponent of the nuclear industry? Will the Government redouble its efforts to ensure that the European Union becomes engaged in the winding down of the nuclear industry in as safe a manner as possible, rather than continuing to promote it, which is the current position and to which the Irish taxpayer contributes through the EURATOM treaty?</P>
      <P>Have lessons been learnt from the episode at Sellafield other than the usual mantra that it needs to be closed down, which we all know and on which we all agree?</P>

It is a good directive that I would love to have supported but could not because it excluded nuclear energy, which I found unbelievable, as nuclear energy potentially causes the greatest damage to the environment. That is why I took the position I did on behalf of the Government, which is one we hold strongly and consistently.</P>
      <P>The Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland is in constant contact with the UK's Nuclear Installations Inspectorate in regard to the dispute. I depend on the RPII's expertise in this matter for the up-to-date position. I must accept its advice on the level of contact taking place and the issue of safety being maintained.</P>

      <P>I travelled to Sellafield with Deputy Kenny in July. We raised the issues of the denial of access for our experts to the site by BNFL as well as the increasing discharge into the Irish Sea, as a result of the run-down of some of the processing plants. Since then we have been unable to get specific information on the nature and levels of discharge taking place as a result of these changes. Does the Minister have this information from departmental or other sources? What is the <Col N="763" />position in regard to access to the plant for RPII officials?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
      <P>I am happy to inform the Deputy that the issues he raised are very much on the current agenda. They form part of the cases we are taking for some of those reasons. The Deputy may be aware that the courts accepted that there was a case to be answered in terms of communication and that the two Governments must co-operate to the fullest possible extent on information. The details are being worked out at the moment.</P>
      <P>I take the view that the Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland should have access to the entire Sellafield site. There are many different discharges taking place at Sellafield and the original MOX plant. A moratorium exists in the short-term.</P>
      <P>I take the strong view, as does every other Member, that discharges into the marine environment of the Irish Sea are unacceptable. They are not morally or economically justifiable. Once a discharge has been made into the Irish Sea, the damage remains for hundreds if not thousands of years. It is my strong view that all discharges should cease. Suitable storage facilities with retrievability characteristics should be put in place as technology develops to deal with waste. The worst option is to make discharges into the Irish Sea. There is no longer a moral justification for it.</P>

      <P>Arising from contacts between the Minister, his Department and the Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland and their UK counterparts, can the Minister tell the House the categories of employee at Sellafield who took industrial action?

    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
      <P>I will give the Deputy all the information I have to hand. On 27 October, the members of two unions representing the workforce at BNFL voted in favour of industrial action. The dispute affects about 2,400 employees or one quarter of the Sellafield work force. The industrial action began on the afternoon of Friday, 14 November with a strike by shift workers. A similar strike action took place on the afternoon of Friday, 21 November and actions are also planned over the next three Fridays. That is the extent of the information I have.</P>

The British Embassy informed my Department that the UK's nuclear watchdog, the Nuclear Installations Inspectorate, requested BNFL to provide it with contingency arrangements in the event of indus<Col N="764" />trial action at Sellafield. The arrangements were reviewed by the inspectorate which the embassy says is satisfied that they provide an adequate framework for safety cover.

      <Quest>the number of cases in which the European Commission has initiated legal action, or announced that it intends to take legal action, arising from the failure by this country to implement EU directives for which his Department has responsibility; the steps he is taking to ensure that all these directives are implemented in full; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>
      <QRef>[28456/03]</QRef>
    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
      <P>The European Commission has initiated seven legal actions in respect of the failure to implement EU directives in areas for which my Department has responsibility. The first six cases concern directives which address dangerous substances in water, the protection of water against pollution by nitrates from agriculture, the assessment of the effects of certain public and private projects on the environment, commonly known as environmental impact assessments, the keeping of wild animals in zoos, the deliberate release of genetically modified organisms into the environment and end-of-life vehicles. The seventh case concerns a number of waste issues. One such issue is the Environmental Protection Agency's progress in the licensing of municipal waste landfill and the establishment of regulatory control of waste activities by the agency and local authorities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Legislation is in place in respect of each of the above directives. The legal actions by the European Commission relate to issues of transposition and implementation. The Commission recently <Col N="765" />indicated its intention to withdraw the action on the zoos directive. A further legal action has been notified to Ireland which concerns the reporting requirements under an EU regulation on ozone depleting substances.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>In his reply, the Minister did not refer to the case which relates to the &euro;20 fee imposed where a person wishes to make a submission on a planning application. What is the status of the EU legal action in respect of the fee? I understand the Commission decided in July to proceed to the European Court with the action.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
      <P>I must admit that the Deputy is correct. We have been in contact with the Commission, but the issue remains unresolved. I regret the omission of a reference to the case in my reply. It should have been included.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>What is happening with the case? The Commission informed the Government some time ago that it considered the &euro;20 fee to constitute a breach of European law. Does the Government plan to abolish the fee now or will the Minister wait until after the country has been dragged at considerable cost and embarrassment before the European Court?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
      <P>I am taking the best advice available to me. I have no plans to abolish the &euro;20 fee, but that is not to say I am prepared to waste taxpayers' money to pursue a goal which cannot be achieved. The imposition of the fee is reasonable and fair and the Commission is incorrect in its view. Exploratory discussions of the legal approach we will take have occurred and communications have been sent to the Commission. I am waiting to see what further action I will take. The file on the matter has not come back to me recently.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister said that various Acts have been introduced to implement the directives he mentioned in his reply. I note he said the case on the zoos directive has been withdrawn. Has the Minister established why the Commission is proceeding with the other cases given that Ireland has addressed the difficulties by enacting legislation? Is it the case that the Commission has rejected the responses the Minister has made? Is the Commission of the opinion that the legislation which has been enacted is inadequate?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a good question and I will answer it. As every Member is aware, I have made regulations in recent months concerning the keeping of wild animals in zoos, the deliberate release of genetically modified organisms into the environment, the quality of petrol and diesel, end-of-life vehicles and the protection of the environment. I have provided for the transposition of directives and integrated pollution prevention control.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="766" />The simple reason for the Commission's actions is bureaucracy. The machinery involved means there is a time lapse between notification and action. I am amazed at how long it takes in some instances before the Commission writes to inform one it is no longer pursuing a case. It can be a year after one has sorted everything out before the Commission gets around to acknowledging it. This is not just an Irish perspective as legal actions are very common across Europe. In 2001, the Commission took 71 cases against member states in the European Court under environmental directives. Once the Commission has been notified that directives have been transposed and regulations put in place, there can be quite a time lag before acknowledgement is received.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent" hpid="Mr. Sargent Mr. Sargent">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister accept that there is difficulty in getting the message on both sides? The Government has been sent at least three warnings on its failure to comply with wild birds and habitats directives. Is there a need to be more effective in implementing the provisions of EU directives? Ireland's failure to transpose the ground water directive has been severely criticised and court action is pending. Does the Minister agree that not transposing these directives is an expensive game to play, given the court action taken involving Coillte that has cost the Government, or whoever has to pay it, millions in terms of grants which were misspent and which should have gone to farmers but instead went to Coillte? Are we not clear about the fact that this is, in many cases, an expensive transgression by the Government and that we need to avoid wasting taxpayers' money and transpose these directives?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no intention of wasting taxpayers' money. My objective in using taxpayers' money is to get the maximum value out of it. Question No. 77 from the Deputy's colleague specifically relates to the &euro;20 fee. I did not realise that when I answered the question. On 22 July 2003 the European Commission issued a press release in which it stated its intention to refer the case to the European Court of Justice. No official communication has been received from the Commission to date and I have no proposals to amend the relevant regulations which reflect an approach recently endorsed by the Oireachtas in the context of the Planning and Development Act 2000.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 49, 59 and 68 together.</P>
      <P>Detailed planning for the use of countrywide electronic voting and counting at the 2004 polls is proceeding, including the delivery of voting machines and ancillary hardware, ongoing software testing, training of returning officers and their staff and preparation for an extensive education and awareness programme. To date some &euro;19 million has been spent on the system which is being supplied by Nedap-Powervote which were appointed in 2001 following an international tender competition.</P>
      <P>While I am aware of concerns expressed in a number of recent reports, I am satisfied that the system is secure, that it maintains the integrity of the voting process and that it counts votes accurately and quickly. Both hardware and software have been subjected to an extensive testing regime by a range of independent Irish and international test institutes and companies and by my Department.</P>
      <P>In addition, my Department is considering measures, both technical and procedural, which will further enhance the level of security. The PCs which will be used for the election set up and the counting of votes are stand alone and will not be connected to the Internet or to any internal or external network. They will also be security hardened before delivery.</P>
      <P>As regards consultations with political parties on the system, electronic voting and counting was considered during Oireachtas debates on the Local Elections (Disclosure of Donation and Expenditure) Act 1999 and the Electoral (Amendment) Act 2001. Demonstrations of the system were given at parliamentary party meetings in 1999 and 2000 and to officials of political parties in 2001. The use of the system has been the subject of numerous parliamentary questions and an Adjournment debate. It has also featured in the print and broadcasting media. Reports on the pilot use of the system in 2002 are available on request and copies of all similar reports relating to the use of the system in June 2004 will be posted to a specific website and will be sent to the Library.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="768" />The issue of security will continue to be of paramount importance and all aspects of the system will be kept under review. However, I am satisfied that the system meets the key criteria for an electoral system in terms of ease of use, maintaining the secrecy of the ballot, accurately recording and counting votes and security. The introduction of electronic voting and counting is a desirable modernisation of the electoral system and I look forward to its successful implementation in 2004. As colleagues know, I appeared before the committee yesterday on this matter.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. J. O'Keeffe Mr. J. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>I am in favour of electronic voting but I want to see that it is secure. Is the Minister giving an absolute guarantee to the House that the system being put in place will be secure? I noted the Minister said at the committee that he would consider new legislation after next year's elections to allow for the creation of paper records at the same time votes are cast. If the Minister admits new legislation is necessary to achieve that effect, why is he waiting until after the elections next June to introduce it? Would it not be more wise to introduce the legislation before the European Parliament and the local elections?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
      <P>That might be different from what I said here. I had extensive discussions about this matter yesterday and the Deputy's colleagues were at the meeting. I am sure the Deputy was busy elsewhere and was, unfortunately, unable to be there. We had a good discussion on the security system. I have to trust, as all of us do, that the system is absolutely secure and it is my intention that it will be. We can all draw much confidence from the referenda and from the pilot phases during the general election.</P>
      <P>Issues have been raised by the Deputy's colleagues and by outside consultants on some aspects of the system. They have been looked at and if anything can be improved, it will be. I emphasise that these systems have been tested internationally by recognised European institutes and in this country. I will do anything I can to ensure confidence in the system.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>Today's edition of <i>The Irish Times</i> reported the Deputy as saying the Government would consider new legislation after next year's elections to allow for the creation of paper records at the same time votes are cast. The immediate thought which occurred to me was that if such legislation is in the offing, why wait until after the elections? Would it not be more prudent and wise to introduce it before the elections?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not recall saying that in those terms. I did not read that article today but somebody has connected two things wrongly. I said that if we were to change the system to get the maximum out of the electronic voting system &ndash; this is complex and I do not think I have time to explain it in the House &ndash; new legislation would be required to change the basis of the distribution of the votes. It has nothing to do with paper. That is a wrong connection in the article and I now recall about what I was talking. This system has the capacity to distribute every paper in the distribution of votes. As Members will know, in the case of surpluses, we only take the particular portion of those that were transferred. We are maintaining the traditional system in the election next year. If there is a view that we should go much deeper, legislation will be required to change the situation. That is what I said.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister agreed at yesterday's committee meeting that there would be an examination by respective technical or IT experts from different parties, and I thank him for that. However, he will be aware that the committee has not yet concluded its examination of this issue. Following from Deputy Jim O'Keeffe's question, can the Minister give a guarantee to the House and the public that the electronic voting system he is introducing next June is 100% secure, safe and not capable of being corrupted in any way and that the voting machines and the software in them cannot be tampered with or corrupted and that the software to be used for the count cannot be tampered with?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BernardAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister may be satisfied but I am not satisfied on a number of points. Yesterday's meeting was quite inconclusive and unsatisfactory because issues relating to the source code and the audit trail, particularly the paper audit trail, were not dealt with adequately. I still have serious reservations about the security of the system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Will the Minister allow an independent election commission to sit on this issue so that we may get the considered views of experts on these conflicting views? Will he stall the introduction of <Col N="770" />the process for the local and European elections next June until all parties are satisfied with its security? It does not just concern the Minister but also the parties and individuals who will contest the elections and, most importantly, the public. I am not satisfied with the process and I ask the Minister to put a freeze on all spending on its development until such time as we have a full and detailed investigation.</P>
    <P>The source code and paper audit trail are issues about which I am unhappy. It is wrong of the Minister to say that the introduction of a paper audit trail would be unconstitutional.</P>

To date, &euro;19 million has been spent on the process and the Minister spent a further &euro;4.5 million yesterday. The total cost will be over &euro;40 million and there has been no agreement in the House on this issue.</P>

      <P>As the Minister said, it is a difficult issue to debate on the floor. However, can he take into account that he is asking the public to accept a huge amount on trust? It is as if he is saying to people that the people counting the votes are honest and there is no reason to doubt them, but they will do the counting in another room and will not be subject to scrutiny as was the case previously. Will he agree that a paper trail would get over that difficulty?</P>

    <Title>Broadcasting (Funding) Bill 2003 [  Seanad ]  : Second Stage (Resumed).</Title>
    <P>Question again proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaudgeConnolly" hpid="Mr. Connolly Mr. Connolly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connolly</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this Bill. RTE is clearly distinguishable from State control broadcasters in other countries in that it succeeds in fulfilling its public service mandate, maintains diversity and plays an important role in ensuring the public's right to information.</P>
      <P>Freedom of expression is guaranteed by Article 19 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. This freedom includes the right not only to seek and impart information and ideas but also to receive them. It also requires states to take positive steps to ensure an environment in which a pluralistic media can flourish, providing information from a wide variety of sources to citizens. Independent, adequately funded and accountable, public service broadcasters are crucial components of this environment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the obligations of the PBS would be to endeavour to address audiences in whom advertisers have no interest, for example the over-55 year olds. It should also attempt to create programming for small or minority audiences, inno<Col N="772" />vate with programmes and talents which may fail and produce a quality of output where the market cannot afford to invest.</P>
    <P>The market is generally the moral arbiter. If an idea sells, it is deemed cool and right. In a society where choice and the right to choose are elevated to a moral principle, whatever the individual chooses in the marketplace is generally good and right and should not be denied as long as it harms nobody else.</P>
    <P>How much simpler it would be if competitive broadcasting markets could yield the plurality and diversity we seek. Even in a world where subscribers pay for their broadcasting directly, not just via advertising, there is no evidence that broadcasting market forces alone can ever produce what many in this country need from broadcasting. Hence the overriding need for what this Bill aims to provide &ndash; public funded, public service broadcasting.</P>
    <P>The 5% of the licence fee this Bill proposes to set aside for the new broadcasting funding scheme must be adequate, appropriate and secure. It must be adequate to fulfil the remit that we entrust to it. It must also ensure that the editorial independence and pluralism of programmes will not be threatened by vested interests or lobby groups. Otherwise, it will have to rely excessively on advertising commercial revenue, which would be inappropriate. The scheme must also be secure, not in the sense that it would be unchanging but in the certainty that it could be sustained and be capable of adapting to different circumstances.</P>
    <P>In recent years the face of Irish broadcasting has been transformed by the growth of local radio across the country. Prior to the birth of local radio, RTE had served the country well. However, as in any monopoly situation, the danger of complacency and self-satisfaction was setting in. The advent of 2FM and national independent stations revolutionised the radio broadcasting scene, creating new loyalties in urban and rural areas.</P>
    <P>A case in point has been the rapid and continuing success of the local Shannonside Northern Sound station in my constituency. To fulfil its news and current affairs requirement this station was obliged to devote at least 20% of its output to local news and current affairs. It has exceeded this requirement and now 45% of its output is based on current and local issues. That is an excellent achievement. The station has succeeded admirably, in the words of Shakespeare, in &ldquo;holding the mirror up&rdquo; to the local community and in reflecting the hopes, aspirations and character of the locality.</P>
    <P>The Bill's stated aim of supporting Irish culture and heritage is to be commended despite RTE's distinguished record on this down the years. It is a somewhat strange situation that all the RTE stations are unregulated while the independent stations are strictly regulated by the BCI and must adhere to the strict criteria set out in their licences. The local stations must also adhere to <Col N="773" />minimum requirements set out by the BCI in terms of Irish language broadcasting while the Irish language television station, TG4, can show freely non-Irish produced English language programmes. The Bill's proposals to support Irish language programmes are generally welcome.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonRyanGP" hpid="Mr. Eamon Ryan Mr. Eamon Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Eamon Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad of the opportunity to speak on this Bill. I give it a guarded welcome as I have a number of concerns with regard to its introduction. I hope the Minister will be able to take some of these concerns on board on Committee Stage and amend certain aspects of the Bill.</P>
      <P>Nobody would disagree with the overall purpose of the Bill. We are entering a broadcasting world where we are faced sometimes, in the words of a song, with &ldquo;52 channels and nothing on&rdquo;. We do not want to take a direction in broadcasting where we have a plethora of satellite and other television services available with nothing other than bland international programmes of no relevance to the Irish market.</P>
      <P>The market will probably sort this out. Irish people will always want a media which is relevant to them. There is a market, regardless of State intervention, for good programming which is relevant to Irish people alone. It is right and proper that the State should assist that process by means of direct funding. It is probably appropriate that some State funding will go beyond the confines of RTE to other terrestrial broadcasters. I welcome the broad purpose of the Bill in that regard.</P>
      <P>I would like to highlight some of my concerns about the Bill. I am concerned by some of the programmes that have been designated as appropriate for funding under this Bill. Having read the Bill, it seems that we are looking backward rather than forward. The Minister of State said that the purpose of such programmes will be to examine &ldquo;who we are, and why we are what we are&rdquo;. I fear, however, that the Bill's provisions are more likely to cause broadcasters to examine what we were, or why we were what we were. Section 2(1)(<i>a</i>) of the Bill states that funding will be provided for programmes about &ldquo;historical buildings&rdquo;, &ldquo;folk, rural and vernacular heritage&rdquo; and &ldquo;traditional and contemporary arts&rdquo;. I am slightly concerned that we are narrowing it down slightly too much in an attempt to preserve an Ireland that is going or has gone. If broadcasters have to produce this heritage television, they will be constrained when making editorial decisions about what is contemporary or relevant to Irish people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is important to note that the Bill mentions that programmes about &ldquo;traditional and contemporary arts&rdquo; will be supported. We had a good debate about a similar matter in the House when the Arts Bill 2002 was being discussed. I congratulate the Minister for Arts, Sport and Tourism for amending the Bill, which initially drew a distinction between traditional and contemporary arts. I give credit to the Minister, <Col N="774" />Deputy O'Donoghue, for recognising that it is nonsense to try to create such a distinction. I do not know of any living traditional arts which are not also contemporary. I am slightly concerned that the State may be too prescriptive in trying to define good public broadcasting. It may adopt a conservative vision of the good programming that is required. I enjoy programmes about traditional music or other traditional arts, but they are not different in any way to contemporary arts. I would not like programmes about traditional arts to be treated differently from programmes about contemporary arts.</P>
    <P>I have a slight concern about the fact that the Broadcasting Commission of Ireland will make decisions about schemes for the granting of funds for certain forms of programming. I have nothing against the commission <i>per se,</i> but I am concerned by the possibility of a bureaucratic Civil Service approach to decisions about fundamentally artistic matters. Such an approach may lead to a more conservative interpretation than would be the case if broadcasters, or companies whose sole remit relates to broadcasting, were directly charged with making decisions. I am slightly concerned that the BCI, which has a regulatory function in respect of licences, essentially, may not be the appropriate body to make decisions on some of the subjective artistic matters that will arise when schemes are being set up.</P>
    <P>The concerns I have outlined are minor by comparison with my greatest problem with the Bill. Under section 2(6), the Minister will be able to direct the BCI, which will be responsible for the scheme, &ldquo;to support in a scheme a television or radio programme&rdquo;. The provision that the Minister will be able to say to the commission, in effect, that he does or does not want a particular programme is a highly dangerous one. It is unfortunate that the Minister is not here to respond to me, as he may be able to say to me that there is a good reason for the provision. It may be the case that the commission will have to be directed in certain circumstances. This Bill almost gives the Minister direct control over the distribution of broadcasting funds. Regardless of the best intentions of the Minister, a highly dangerous precedent is being set because it will be possible for him, or a future Minister, to direct broadcasting funds to particular areas.</P>
    <P>It does not matter which Minister or which party is involved because a bad principle is being set. There should be a clear distinction between politicians and broadcasting policy. This Bill will bring the Minister far too close to decisions about how funding will be carried out. I fear that broadcasters will have to look over their shoulders because they will be concerned about what the Minister will think. Such a system will lead to bad programming. I hope that the Minister will facilitate amendments in this regard on Committee Stage. A reputable broadcaster with whom I discussed this matter at lunchtime said that this Bill, if it is passed in its current form, will represent the type of provision that Ray Burke would have <Col N="775" />loved during his time as Minister for Communications. This is not a good Bill.</P>
    <P>The third concern I would like to mention is that we have missed an opportunity to review the way in which broadcasting is funded. I regret that the Bill does not include a broader review of the funding of broadcasting, particularly in respect of the way in which funds are raised. I note that the Bill relates to the net licence fee receipts. Historically, 8% of the licence fee receipts have been accounted for by An Post's collection costs. It is a very expensive cost. Just 92% of the sum of over &euro;100 that we pay for a television licence will be expended on broadcasting. It is something that we have to address seriously.</P>
    <P>I propose a much simpler system of funding which is guaranteed by the State through the general taxation system on an index-linked basis. The fund would be set in stone and would not be open to political interference in the budget each year. The moneys would be provided from central Exchequer expenditure. The fundraising and allocation aspects of such a system would be more efficient. One would not have the huge cost of collecting the licence fee and the endless television advertisements would not have to be paid for. Such advertisements remind people, for example, that they have to have a licence for their fourth television in their country home. The incredibly cumbersome present licence collecting system would no longer be needed.</P>
    <P>The system I propose would be much fairer. Under the present system, an unemployed person or a person with a very low income, for example, has to pay the exact same licence fee as their next-door neighbour who might be earning &euro;500,000 per year. The licence fee is a regressive stealth tax. The Government should try to claw back some of the taxes which are applied across the board because they affect the poor and the rich in the same manner. It should try to insert a new measure into the tax threshold system so that different incomes can be recognised. At a time when legislation is addressing broadcasting funding, it is regrettable that we are not conducting a major review of how we collect funds for broadcasting.</P>
    <P>I wish the Minister well regardless of the main concerns I have outlined. I support the provisions of the Bill, in general. I hope the Minister will appreciate the strength of some of the arguments we are making. He should make the necessary amendments to ensure that this Bill is not seen as an attempt by politicians to interfere with decisions about editorial policy. We should not restrict the ability of those involved in broadcasting to decide what programmes they consider to be contemporary or relevant. We should not narrow it down excessively to historical analysis.</P>
    <P>The final concern I would like to mention follows on from the comments made earlier by Deputy Coveney. At a time when a new broadcasting levy is being introduced, it is deeply regrettable that we are not taking the opportunity <Col N="776" />to ensure that there is a much greater level of subtitling of television programmes. A huge opportunity has been lost, particularly in respect of those broadcasters that have failed to rise to the challenge. RTE has led the way on this issue. If we are to raise &euro;8 million each year to be provided for such broadcasters, it is incumbent on us to put in place conditions that will ensure that programmes are subtitled. Television stations should be compelled to have a certain percentage of subtitled programmes. We will never again have such a good opportunity to cater for those who rely on subtitled programming to be properly involved in society. I hope that the possibility of amendments in this area can be examined so that we can copperfasten the rights of people who are hard of hearing. We should recognise that we are obliged as legislators to meet such people's special needs.</P>
    <P>I will confine my contribution to the comments I have already made. I look forward to the remaining Stages of the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanCroweSF" hpid="Mr. Crowe Mr. Crowe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crowe</NameTxt>
      <P>Sinn Féin broadly welcomes the legislation before the House. It acknowledges that the Bill is a genuine attempt to improve the quantity and quality of home-produced broadcasting. As a party, it is absolutely committed to the principle of public service broadcasting. This principle is constantly under attack, however, by certain sections of the media which are obsessed with pursuing a personalised vendetta against RTE. Notwithstanding the disagreements Sinn Féin may have with the anti-republican editorial line of some of its current affairs programmes, the truth is that RTE is a quality public service broadcaster. RTE's misfortune is that it is constantly and unfairly compared to the BBC, an organisation with which it cannot compete in terms of funding and resources.</P>
      <P>Opponents of public service broadcasting argue that a market-driven approach would ensure a more open media. We have seen elsewhere in the world, however, that such an approach leads to an incredible consolidation of media power in the hands of a few companies and individuals.</P>
      <P>There may be many voices but it is the same message and, increasingly, a message devoid of any substance as we have seen from the numerous dumbed-down, one-dimensional, trashy and commercialised television programmes dominating the schedules of Murdoch's globally controlled broadcasters. To see the powers and incredible influence of private media monopolies one only has to look at the disgraceful and illegal role played by the private media moguls of Venezuela, who when they believed their financial interests were threatened by the Government's support for the poor, actively participated in organising a coup against the democratically elected President, Hugo Chavez.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill sets a number of terms and conditions under which an applicant may apply for funding. I ask the Minister to seriously consider adding the further condition that all television programming <Col N="777" />funded under this scheme be subtitled. The Minister will be aware that while the amount of subtitled programming on RTE has been steadily increasing, it is nowhere near 100%, an objective which the BBC has set itself for realisation by 2010.</P>
    <P>While recognising RTE's limited resources make it unlikely that date will be reached, I hope the Broadcasting Commission of Ireland, currently examining this issue, will recommend that RTE puts in place clear and transparent targets for increasing subtitling. I would be happier if RTE was willing to do this voluntarily. I would also like to take this opportunity to point out the contempt with which senior management at TV3 has continued to treat the deaf community by refusing to send a representative to meetings on the matter attended by RTE and TG4. I call on them to rethink their position.</P>
    <P>The legislation allows the Broadcasting Commission of Ireland to set further terms and conditions for the operation of the scheme beyond what is contained in the legislation. The Minister may be of the opinion that the commission should make the decision on this matter. I suggest, however, that to write this into legislation would be a very positive gesture to the deaf community and those hard of hearing. I hope to bring forward amendments to that effect on Committee stage.</P>
    <P>Mention was made during the debate in the Seanad of providing for a specific quota of funding for the community broadcasting sector. I understand the Minister's argument for maximum flexibility. I would be concerned, however, that the community sector, underresourced as it is, will find itself relegated to the sidelines as the bigger and better financed production companies take the lion's share of the money available. Community radio is a vital part of our communications infrastructure which relies heavily on people giving of their time voluntarily, following cuts in the community employment scheme. It should be supported and adequately resourced. Every effort should be made to enable it to realise its full potential.</P>
    <P>Sinn Féin supports a separate fund for community broadcasting to provide the stimulus needed to foster its growth. Putting into legislation a quota obliging the BCI to make every effort to ensure that a significant proportion of funding goes to this sector seems a sensible idea and a step forward. This legislation presents a golden opportunity to ensure that the thousands of men and women working in our community broadcasting sector receive the support they need.</P>
    <P>Will the Minister clarify the reason news and current affairs programming have been specifically excluded from the scheme? High-quality investigative journalism is an expensive process and an extremely valuable one in terms of the role journalism plays in a democratic state. While there is, perhaps, a case for news programming to be excluded and left to the broadcasting organis<Col N="778" />ations, independent production companies who undertake to produce current affairs documentaries should be encouraged.</P>
    <P>I would also like to note the emphasis the legislation puts on meeting the needs of those in society &ndash; regrettably there are a large number of them &ndash; with literacy problems. According to the National Adult Literacy Agency one in four adults were found to be at the lowest level of literacy since 1997. While I understand this number has improved, it is still a shocking statistic in a First World state. Programmes like &ldquo;Read Write Now&rdquo; have shown how public service broadcasting can play a positive role in reaching out to a section of society that has traditionally been ignored and marginalised.</P>
    <P>The Minister has, since his appointment, made a positive contribution to protecting public service broadcasting. I rarely get the opportunity to congratulate this Government but increased financial support for RTE, legislation to protect major sporting events and this stimulus to independent production companies to facilitate public service programming are all positive steps. My only regret is that more members of the Cabinet could not show the same understanding of the value of the public sector and State-owned companies.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelOFlynn" hpid="Mr. O'Flynn Mr. O'Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very pleased to have an opportunity to contribute to this debate on the Broadcasting (Funding) Bill 2003. The Bill is a core element in the programme of public service broadcasting reforms announced by the Minister in December 2002. It is only fair to restate the basis for the reform programme &ndash; the need to <Col N="780" />sustain a public service broadcaster and broadcasting ethos in an increasingly competitive global media marketplace. That objective has been supported by the work of the broadcasting forum, which reported to the Government last year.</P>
      <P>The Government has responded to the forum's report in a speedy and effective manner. Its reform programme incorporates a substantial increase in resources for the public service broadcaster in Ireland and the delivery of radical new measures to ensure increased transparency and accountability from organisations in receipt of licence fee revenues. Those measures include the development of a public service charter, the establishment of an audience council and the appointment of a process auditor to oversee the operation of RTE commissioning, the introduction of a licence fee adjustment process based on objective measures of performance against output and change management criteria, and promised legislation to restructure not just the regulation of broadcasting but the corporate structure of the public service broadcaster.</P>
      <P>The Bill must therefore be seen in the context of the wider reform programme, and I encourage the Minister to proceed with the remaining elements of that programme, notwithstanding the difficulties that vested interests may have with some of the more cutting-edge elements in that plan. We know that the broadcast consumer of 2003 is light years removed from that of 1993. The development of satellite technology in particular has resulted in an explosion in choice for the Irish consumer, who is now increasingly adapting to the range of choice available, and broadcasters are following that trend.</P>
      <P>Without fundamental change, RTE, our national broadcaster, is in danger of being caught in a perfect storm. Ultimately, the solution is not merely about throwing more and more licence payers' money at the problem, and any analysis that that is all is simply wrong. Change is never easy, and it is especially hard on an organisation with a track record as long and distinguished as that of RTE. However, history is littered with the wreckage of organisations that felt that the world owed them a living and which, as a result, failed to change to meet the imminent threats until it was too late. I hope that RTE will not be part of that wreckage.</P>
      <P>The Bill provides for the allocation of 5% of the net proceeds of the television licence fee &ndash; about &euro;8 million annually &ndash; to a scheme to fund new programmes on television and radio. Those funds will be available on the basis of competitive tender to all players in the Irish broadcasting sector, including those in the private sector. That initiative will increase the availability of high quality programmes on television and radio in both the private and public broadcasting sectors. It will also allow for a higher level of competition for resources in the Irish broadcasting sector generally. That will sharpen minds and performances across the sector and is a welcome development for Irish consumers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="781" />On digital television, the Bill's proposals are particularly relevant in the light not just of what is happening in the broadcast market today but of what is likely to happen as technology changes the face of broadcasting generally over the next decade. Ultimately, the development of ultra-high capacity broadband to the home could call into question the whole future of the current broadcasting model. The challenge for public policy is to ensure a future for high quality public service broadcasting in that globalised and competitive marketplace. It is important to understand that there is already a very significant level of competition in the Irish broadcasting market. Ireland today has the second highest rate of subscription to digital broadcast services in the EU. That is a function of Sky's strong position in the market.</P>
    <P>A major disappointment has been the operation of a cable sector here, which alone among European operators has failed to provide a channel for broadband to compete with the telecommunications incumbent. The lessons for policy-makers are clear &ndash; offering cable or any other companies protected monopoly positions on the basis of a promise to roll out advanced services is a highly risky proposition. In the event of a failure to perform on the part of the cable operators it leaves Ireland seriously exposed.</P>
    <P>While those issues are of consequence, it is important that we remember that television is primarily about content. In a global marketplace, it is important that public policy be to retain a high level of domestic content across private as well as public service broadcasters. It is important that people have it available to them to watch and listen to. It matters little to the viewer whether radio and television services are delivered from a satellite, over a wire or by terrestrial means. Audiences are interested in programming. The core aim of the broadcasting fund is simply to provide Irish audiences with more high quality programming.</P>
    <P>Recent experience in the development of digital television is worth considering. The most striking aspect of digital television has been the explosion in the number of channels on offer to the viewer. I agree totally with comments expressed by the Minister as well as some outside the House that, unfortunately, it has not resulted in an equivalent increase in the choice of programming available to the viewer. It is true that many new channels provide more choice. There are specialised news, sports, history and music channels, for example. Those channels meet the demand for such specialised services. However, they are generally only available on a subscription basis so that access is restricted to those who are willing to pay and can afford to do so. It is also true that many of the extra channels simply offer more of the same. There is genuine concern that the digital era will result in fragmentation. That could result in viewers being offered more channels with less real choice as broadcasters increasingly move towards a generic schedule in <Col N="782" />pursuit of the most economically advantageous audiences. In that scenario, Irish society would be the loser.</P>
    <P>Having regard to those developments, the introduction of the broadcasting fund is timely. Its aim is to encourage broadcasters to cater for Irish audiences to include in their schedule high quality additional programmes of interest and relevance to Irish audiences. The Government's decision to introduce the broadcasting fund was taken at the same time as the decision to increase significantly the public funding available to RTE through the television licence fee. Those two measures should be considered together.</P>
    <P>The decision to increase substantially the level of public funding for RTE was a clear indication of the Government's commitment to the principle of public service broadcasting. It was supported by the Committee on Communications, Marine and Natural Resources, which I chair, last November. It also clearly showed the Government's resolve that the people of Ireland should continue to be guaranteed a minimum level of high quality programming that is of interest and relevance to an Irish audience. I agree with the view that as we move increasingly to a digital era, there remains a compelling case for providing the national public service broadcaster with adequate funds to continue to deliver the type of service that Irish audiences deserve and expect. However, RTE must also work within its budgets. It must not run deficits.</P>
    <P>Last July, when RTE appeared before the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Communications, Marine and Natural Resources, I told representatives of the organisation that it must be profitable and get value for money from those it employs, including its high earners. RTE services must continue to be available to all of the population and be delivered without charge. I have no difficulty with the consumer price index increases for RTE but it must disclose all of the salaries paid to its high-earning presenters and justify them to the license-fee paying public. It must be open, transparent and sustainable as an organisation. I do not see anyone from RTE in the Visitors Gallery but I hope its executives are watching this debate and will take account of what is being said.</P>
    <P>RTE exists to serve the people and must be available to all for free. I fundamentally disagree with those who argue that with the explosion in new services there is no longer a need for intervention by the State, nor do I agree that State-funded broadcasters should be limited to delivering a restricted range of outputs. RTE's mandate requires it to provide radio and television services for all the people. I see no justification for revising this legislative mandate. RTE should not be restricted to providing niche programming for a small proportion of the population. Decisions on scheduling are complex and best left to the broadcaster, driven by a consideration of how to best serve the audience and not influenced by the commercial concerns of independent broadcasters.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="783" />The decision to establish the broadcasting fund should be seen in the context of the Government's commitment to ensure Irish audiences continue to have access to the high quality programming which is of interest and relevance to them. The Government has acted in two ways &ndash; it has increased the level of public funding available to RTE and has proposed the creation of the fund to encourage all broadcasters serving Irish audiences to include additional high quality programming in their schedules which would be of interest to Irish audiences. The emphasis on &ldquo;additionality&rdquo; is central to the fund and will be a fundamental criterion of eligibility for funding in that programmes which are funded must be in addition to any existing requirements on broadcasters in regard to their existing outputs.</P>
    <P>For public service broadcasting to thrive in Ireland, it must maintain pace with developments in the world of broadcasting. The Bill is an important element of that programme. Additional reform measures include changes in the structure of regulation and the structure of the public service broadcaster itself. This is vital if the benefits of the legislation are to be fully realised and I encourage the Minister to press ahead in this regard.</P>
    <P>We can expect a high level of demand from the public and private sectors for funding under the new arrangements being set up under the legislation. For this reason, it is critically important that the Broadcasting Commission of Ireland manages the process of disbursing funds carefully. It is important that the criteria for funding be established and made known at an early stage of the process and that the basis for results of competitions similarly ought to be made publicly available in an open and transparent manner.</P>
    <P>Deputies will be aware that transparency issues are important to other areas of the operation of the BCI, no more so than in the area of the licensing of radio stations. The Oireachtas Joint Committee on Communications, Marine and Natural Resources has already conducted an investigation into the manner of operation of the BCI and has reached the conclusion that greater transparency, accountability and appeal arrangements are necessary if it is to enjoy the confidence of the sector.</P>
    <P>The administration of the fund is an important additional area of responsibility for the BCI. However, the shape of that organisation will likely come in for careful consideration in the context of the development of proposals for a new broadcasting authority of Ireland. The new body, called the BAI, will regulate broadcasting in the public and private sectors. I encourage the Minister and Minister of State to examine whether the BCI can be retained in its current shape as part of that process or whether it would be better to merge it with another regulatory organisation in order to provide a better regulatory balance across the communications sector as a whole.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="784" />Earlier in the year, the joint committee met with RTE in regard to possible conflicts of interest, a code of ethics and corporate governance. We had an interesting four or five hour session, during which RTE committed itself to a surplus of &euro;3 million. It affirmed that it would not be in a loss-making situation and would not need substantial increases from the tax payers and license payers. I look forward with interest to RTE presenting its annual report to the Minister and our committee in due course in the new year. I also look forward to congratulating RTE on achieving the &euro;3 million surplus, as it promised it would, even though I expressed grave reservations about this aspect on the day we met. I told the representatives that, based on its financial position in July, RTE could lose &euro;20 million this year. There were only three ways in which to change that. One was by increasing revenue, which was down almost 10%, another was to cut its costs and the final way was to generate revenue from other areas. Unfortunately, cutting costs was the only course it could take.</P>
    <P>I was concerned, as were other committee members, about possible conflicts of interest. RTE assured the committee that it was introducing a new code of ethics for staff working in the organisation who might be involved in other activities which might be in conflict with the organisation's public service broadcasting ethos to be objective and impartial in its work. We await with interest the new code, which has yet to be finalised. I recently asked the clerk of the committee to inquire if it had been introduced and is now part of the procedures of corporate governance for the running of an organisation as important as RTE.</P>
    <P>It is important we pay tribute to RTE, which has served the country well in the past 40 years. We must also recognise the important role which the independent sector is contributing, in particular TV3 and the superb TG4. The independent radio stations have also contributed hugely to local communities with good programming and content. As chairman of the joint committee, I and my fellow committee members look forward to interacting with all of these organisations during the term of this Dáil.</P>

      <P>I welcome the Bill because it is such an important one to come before the House at this time. I recognise the importance of RTE and the great work it has done for Ireland in the past 40 years. However, considering the high taxes and license fee we deserve such a service. I compliment RTE on what it has done in recent years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome the Bill, which has many good points. One aspect that is extremely important is the promotion of the concept of Irishness on tele<Col N="785" />vision. In my view, RTE fails to bring major elements of this concept to the fore. The Minister of State, Deputy Browne, is aware that in my parish, Bree, there is a group called Celtic Roots which travels all over the world performing shows that are somewhat similar to Riverdance. Last summer, Celtic Roots invited similar groups from six or seven European countries to take part in a folk dance festival in my parish but this fact was not mentioned on national radio or television and garnered very little coverage in the national newspapers. An event of this nature should be highlighted. Celtic Roots received very little money from central government. The Minister of State and I worked hard to obtain such funding from Wexford County Council. Such festivals &ndash; it is brilliant that they are organised on a voluntary basis &ndash; happen throughout the country but people are not aware that this is the case.</P>
    <P>In recent years our concept of Irishness has changed and we are becoming a multicultural nation. The Minister referred to the promotion of Irish talent and culture. In that context, will he indicate if he means a traditional concept of Irishness or a multicultural one?</P>
    <P>It is great that part of the licence fee will be used to encourage the establishment and maintenance of independent stations throughout the country. As far as I am aware, there is no independent station in my constituency. I know that people in Cork and Kerry have their own television station which provides information on what is happening in the region. That is brilliant. Deputy O'Flynn referred to the track record of local radio stations. At present, Radio Kilkenny is in trouble. I hope that my local radio station in Wexford will never be in trouble because it is an important asset.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBrowne2" hpid="Mr. Browne Mr. Browne">

    <Speaker pid="PaulKehoeFG" hpid="Mr. Kehoe Mr. Kehoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kehoe</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not get enough publicity when I have the opportunity to criticise the Government. The Minister of State is well aware of the importance of the local radio station in Wexford, which has a wide-ranging listenership.</P>
      <P>Counties such as Mayo, Kerry, Wexford, Donegal and Dublin all have their own local radio stations. Deputy Broughan referred to Newstalk 106, to which I listen on a regular basis when I am in Dublin. People who live in rural areas stop listening to national stations when they have access to local stations which provide current affairs, religious, Irish music, country and western and other programmes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I hope that, particularly in the area of television, more community-based stations will come on stream. In the debate in the Seanad, Senator Finucane referred to establishing the cost involved in establishing a community-based television station. In light of the machinery, equipment, etc., necessary to run one of these stations, the costs involved are high. However, I hope that <Col N="786" />in the future many more stations will begin to appear.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to digital television. RTE must keep up with advances in this area. People who subscribe to Sky Television can gain access to 300 or 400 channels. Perhaps the provision of a wide range of channels is the way of the future. I hope that RTE 1, Network 2 and TG4 will keep up with developments in digital television.</P>
    <P>The Minister also made reference to television archives. It is great to be able to watch programmes which show what happened in the past. One such programme is &ldquo;Reeling in the Years&rdquo;. It is brilliant that a young person like me can look at &ldquo;Reeling in the Years&rdquo; and see what occurred in politics or in other walks of life 40, 50 or 60 years ago. Some excellent programmes &ndash; comedy programmes, films, etc. &ndash; were made in the past and these are not being shown enough on television. I would like RTE to show more of these archive programmes, films and documentaries.</P>
    <P>Not enough programmes such as &ldquo;Fair City&rdquo; are being made in Ireland. Since &ldquo;Glenroe&rdquo; was cancelled, people are obliged to watch &ldquo;Eastenders&rdquo;, &ldquo;Neighbours&rdquo;, &ldquo;Coronation Street&rdquo; or whatever. Not enough television programmes of this kind are being made here. In addition, I would like to see more quality children's programming of an educational nature on television, rather than having our young people look at cartoons.</P>
    <P>I hope that adequate funding will be available in the future to facilitate subtitling and captioning. I have strong opinions about subtitles. There are many people who are not as lucky as Members and who, although they may be able to read, are deaf and dumb. It is great when one comes across a programme in respect of which subtitles are provided because these allow people who are deaf to follow what is going on. I am aware that subtitling is expensive but it is something to which serious consideration must be given. On any given day, only a limited number of programmes carry subtitles. The Minister of State, other Deputies from Wexford and I met earlier with a number of people with disabilities, although none of them were deaf. It is important that progress be made in respect of the subtitling of programmes. RTE 1 is making some good progress in this area but the performance of Network 2 is poor.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill, which is good. It is great that TV3 has provided competition. The latter is extremely important because it drives us forward. Competition from TV3 will keep RTE and TG4 on their toes and ensure that they continue to develop their programming. I hope that the 5%, or &euro;8 million, will be spent wisely and that results will be achieved. The Minister and the Joint Committee on Communications, Marine and Natural Resources will be monitoring the position closely to ensure that such results come about.</P>

      <P>I apologise for spoiling the party. I am in favour of the proposals contained in the Bill but I am completely opposed to the Broadcasting Commission of Ireland having anything to do with it. I was hoping that when he introduced the Bill, the Minister would sack the commission because it is a disgrace. The BCI has made a mess of its job in respect of radio licences and I have no confidence in it. I will find it difficult to vote in favour of the Bill because, under its provisions, the commission has been given responsibility to deal with financial matters.</P>
      <P>I propose that the Minister sack the entire commission which recently took away the licence of North-West Radio, which had a listenership of over 90% and which had won national awards. On the day of the meeting to decide on the licence, half the members of the board of the commission were missing and the chairman, on a casting vote, gave it to another franchise. I have no confidence in the BCI and I was hoping that the Minister would have sacked its members by now. It is a disgrace that these people will be given more responsibility when they are not able to shoulder the responsibility they already have in terms of awarding radio licences.</P>
      <P>I am disappointed with the Bill and I will have to discuss matters with members of my party and try to encourage them to vote against it on the basis that the BCI will have responsibility for distributing the funding. I hope the members of my party will agree with my stance because if the BCI, some of the members of which do not even turn up for meetings, cannot deal with awarding licences, how can it be given responsibility for disbursing a fund? I am not here to say nice things about the BCI. All of its members should be sacked. If, at some future stage, I found myself on the benches opposite as a Minister, that would be the first job I would do. The BCI has made a mess of awarding radio licences.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Many people have been critical of RTE. I have always been a supporter of RTE, which gets a great deal of bad press, although I do not watch RTE very often. Every time RTE broadcasts a programme a Fianna Fáil Minister or Senator must be on it. Last Sunday night, I turned on RTE and, as soon as I saw Senator O'Rourke, I switched to the BBC. On Monday night I listened to Deputy Glennon on RTE radio on my way to Dublin. I am sick and tired of seeing the Taoiseach on television every time he attends the All-Ireland final or Shelbourne Park. Does RTE employ a full-time cameraman to cover the Taoiseach's attendance at sporting events in this country? Last year in the run up to the All-Ireland Hurling Final, even though Offaly was not play<Col N="788" />ing, the Minister for Foreign Affairs was interviewed on RTE.</P>

Fianna Fáil wants to be portrayed as the Government and the Opposition at the same time and RTE is falling for that trick.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ring</NameTxt>
      <P>If the BCI distributes money under the legislation, will it be given to friends of Fianna Fáil? I have no confidence in the commission and I hope my party opposes the legislation.</P>
      <P>RTE does a good job in terms of sports coverage and I do not have a problem paying the licence fee. People pay a great deal of money for Sky packages every month and they do not mind. RTE has done a good job over the years and it must be complimented. However, I have been pushing for subtitling for years. Elderly people who are hard of hearing and deaf and dumb people need subtitles to follow programmes. The funding should be put in place for subtitling because it is important. The Deaf Association of Ireland has been campaigning on this for many years and I hope the Minister of State will allocate funding under the legislation for this. Support for subtitling should be given to TG4, RTE and TV3.</P>
      <P>Previous speakers were critical of TV3 but it is a private company, which cannot compete with RTE because it receives massive money from the State. TV3 is trying to make money and it cannot do what the Government, county councils and RTE do when they run up large deficits, which is run to the taxpayer to bail them out. TV3 will be gone if it cannot make a profit. There is no point comparing TV3 with TG4 and RTE because it is not in the same category.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I met a lady who was making television programmes about festivals during the summer. She visited north Mayo to film an annual racing event on the Sandy Banks at Geesala. Thousands of people were in attendance. She sought funding from Fáilte Ireland, Ireland West and every other body but she could not get any. I hope the next time she applies for funding for a similar programme she will have an opportunity under this legislation to obtain assistance from the State. <Col N="789" />The BCI's members cannot even turn up for meetings and, therefore, I do not know how decisions on funding will be made.</P>
    <P>The intent of the legislation is good but I am worried about who will disburse the funding. Even the electronic voting contract could not be awarded yesterday without being given to a friend of Fianna Fáil. A former Fianna Fáil general secretary is involved with the company that was awarded by the contract for electronic voting by the Minister. I am totally opposed to that voting system because at some stage a computer whiz kid will decide the next Government because he will be able to hack into the computers. He will be able to decide which party he wants in Government and nine times out of ten, given what is happening in the country, he will be a Fianna Fáil supporter and he will want another Fianna Fáil Government. It is hard enough to get rid of Fianna Fáil as it is. What will we do if the party has computers backing it up?</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>Many cultural events should be covered and supported under the legislation and this footage should be kept for posterity. We are losing many of our traditions. There used to be a fair day in every town and village once but that is no more. Festivals are being wiped out because of insurance costs. The support given by volunteers to many events is dying and people are more and more dependent on television to keep their children occupied. That is not good and the influence of television contributes to the problems of society. Like everything else, television output should be controlled. People should be able to switch their televisions on and off when they want. I would prefer if children were outside <Col N="790" />playing football and other games like they did in the past.</P>
    <P>The Bill is doomed because the BCI will make sure of that. The commission made a mess of awarding licences. The Minister is permitting foreigners to enter the Irish market to buy up local radio licences. That should not happen and the Government should stop this immediately. Too few people control the media in Ireland currently and in future outside influences will control the media as they buy into local radio stations. Local radio was supposed to be run by local people to cover local events. The Government wants to destroy it now that it is successful. The Government needs to introduce the necessary legislation to prevent local radio stations being taken over by foreigners. This issue should be examined under this legislation because it is wrong and it should be addressed immediately.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Timmins</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank my good friend for sharing his time at short notice. I agree with the Deputy's comments on RTE. It is all right to praise the station but for the past few years the concept of good cop, bad cop has annoyed many people. I received a telephone call following the &ldquo;Nine O'Clock News&rdquo; last night from a man who said he had been looking at Fianna Fáil Members behaving as the Government and the Opposition at the same time. People are sick of this. RTE should analyse the time given to Fianna Fáil Ministers and backbenchers because they are trying to usurp the democratic process.</P>
      <P>I would like the money to be provided under the legislation to be used to recover archival footage of local communities, which many people do not realise exists. It should be recovered and put on display because people are interested in that.</P>
      <P>I do not want this contribution to become a full whinge session but one of my problems with RTE relates to its lack of analysis of issues on programmes such as &ldquo;Prime Time&rdquo;. A number of programmes were devoted to illegal dumping in County Wicklow. One story, which was totally untrue, was broadcast. A claim was made that Wicklow County Council had received a bill for &euro;1 million as a result of the illegal dumping but the person withdrew it subsequently. The story generated sensational headlines and was run on a few news bulletins but when the story changed, RTE did not correct its coverage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, I refer to the main reason I wanted to contribute to the debate. I am not a prude but one Saturday night a few weeks I entered a house and &ldquo;The Simpsons&rdquo; was on television. The British Prime Minister is lending his voice to the programme. However, during the programme Bart Simpson was talking about pornographic pictures. &ldquo;The Simpsons&rdquo; is a source of many subliminal messages to which I am very much opposed. A Circuit Court judge recently stated people who download pornography should serve a jail sentence. He said pornography is a scourge and leads to the abuse of women and young children. Much of the <Col N="791" />material in &ldquo;The Simpsons&rdquo; is totally unsuitable for young children, teenagers and adults. I took this issue up with a member of the censorship board and he told me not to worry because such messages go over the heads of children. However, this is unhealthy and needs to be examined.</P>

      <P>I welcome this Bill as a very positive step towards making a difference for Irish programmes and adult literacy programmes. The Broadcasting (Funding) Bill 2003 establishes a new scheme of funding for television and radio programmes, which will be administered by the Broadcasting Commission of Ireland. The Bill outlines the general objectives of the scheme and refers to details which are to be worked out by the BCI and cleared with the Minister.</P>
      <P>There are a number of reasons for welcoming the Bill. It covers key areas of Irish society which we wish to promote and assist. In particular, it refers to new programmes on Irish culture, heritage and experience, new programmes to improve adult literacy and additional Irish language programmes. The scheme will also fund the development of archiving of television and radio programmes.</P>
      <P>During recent discussions with people who are anxious that section 481 of the Finance Act should be retained and extended, I was particularly struck by examples from France, Germany and elsewhere about funding packages which included tax incentives, Government grants such as exist under the Irish Film Board and a separate support from the broadcasting industry. The Bill before the House is very helpful in earmarking the 5% fund and targeting it towards specific programmes of an Irish or literacy content, for which I commend the Minister.</P>
      <P>An example of a production about Irish life, which was funded abroad and filmed on the Isle of Man was the film &ldquo;Waking Ned&rdquo;. For the information of those who may not have seen it, the film portrayed Ned Devine, a west of Ireland bachelor farmer who was found dead in his farmhouse after he had won the Irish national lottery. It outlined subsequent attempts by his neighbours to claim the money and deal with the man from the lottery office in Dublin, who travelled through the beautiful green countryside to the west to check out the validity of the claim. What a shame such a great film about Irish society was funded and filmed abroad.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another such example, which will not be on our television screens until 2004, having been filmed and funded in Ireland, is a programme entitled &ldquo;Island of Inis Cool&rdquo;. It is currently in a format of 26 episodes of 13 minutes each. The promoters and directors gave great praise to <Col N="792" />section 481 and to the Irish Film Board for the funding which allowed this first ever animated Irish television series to be created here. They were concerned that if section 481 was not extended, they would not be able to create a second series of the programme. I ask the Minister to clarify that programmes such as this can apply for the funding being provided for under this Bill.</P>
    <P>As a matter of interest, the idea for &ldquo;Island of Inis Cool&rdquo; was created against the backdrop of the film &ldquo;Waking Ned&rdquo;. In the Inis Cool programme, three Irish bachelors live on an island of that name, off the west coast of Ireland. It provides, with animation, a wonderful insight to Irish culture and heritage on our Islands off the west coast. Although this would not be regarded as a new programme, since the first series is already made, I presume a new or second series could be created if funding was available. I ask the Minister to clarify that applications of that type will be welcome under the new fund being created by the Bill before the House.</P>
    <P>The fund will be on the basis of 5% of television licence fees, giving a fund of approximately &euro;8 million, at the current licence fee of &euro;150. In recent years, the proceeds of television licences have doubled to a figure in the region of &euro;160 million. There is an excellent opportunity to identify key areas in Irish life which can be ring-fenced in this way for funding.</P>
    <P>I congratulate the national public service broadcaster on a number of wonderful achievements already in the sectors we are discussing in this Bill. Of particular note with regard to programmes on adult literacy is the &ldquo;Read Write Now&rdquo; programme, which goes out twice weekly on RTE television. I commend that work, which has been supported by my party colleague, the Minister of State at the Department of Education and Science, Deputy de Valera, who is very supportive of initiatives on adult literacy. The programme has been of great help to many people in the privacy of their own homes in this very sensitive area of improving their reading and writing skills. It is also very positive in highlighting individuals who left school early in the 1950s and 1960s and, as adults, were able to achieve so much by upskilling themselves in reading and writing. I welcome the provisions of the Bill for funding such programmes.</P>
    <P>With regard to the existing RTE archival programme, it is wonderful to have the opportunity to look back over events of years as far back as 1981. Such archiving of programmes is an excellent facility which deserves every encouragement. The Bill will provide funding for such archival facilities, thereby keeping certain memories alive for people. I again commend the Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMcGuinness" hpid="Mr. McGuinness Mr. McGuinness">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGuinness</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to the contributions of Deputies Ring and Timmins, who have just left the Chamber, perhaps if they were doing their business as members of an Opposition party, <Col N="793" />they would secure the radio and television time they are demanding. Their criticism of the regular appearance of the Fianna Fáil Taoiseach and Ministers on television programmes highlights the fact that if they were doing their work properly, Deputies Ring and Timmins might get the coverage they desire.</P>
      <P>Deputy Ring called for the removal of the Broadcasting Commission of Ireland. I have some reservations about the BCI which I will address in the context of Deputy Ring's remarks. With regard to BCI's role in issuing licences to local radio stations, I was less than impressed by the manner in which it conducted its business. Because the BCI will now have responsibility for disbursing this fund, I believe it is necessary to introduce regulations and criteria under which the current BCI and the new body will operate. There will have to be far greater transparency and accountability to this House in the exercise of those functions and the distribution of the fund.</P>
      <P>The track record of the BCI with regard to local radio simply lacks credibility. In my constituency, the local radio station, Radio Kilkenny, lost its licence. As in Deputy Ring's area, the submission was professionally presented and had community support, as provided for in various parts of the Bill before the House with regard to local broadcasting. Radio Kilkenny had a track record and the support of the commercial sector in Kilkenny and surrounding counties. It was recognised as doing a good job by those who assess the performance of local radio. The radio content and listenership were acknowledged nationally, yet the station did not get a renewal of its licence, which was transferred to a commercial operator.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have no difficulty with the involvement of a commercial operator, but I have a difficulty with a procedure which allows the transfer to the private sector of wealth created by a community-driven co-op, in terms of the assets of listenership and commercial support. That is simply not acceptable. When challenged on the issue, the response from the BCI was less than professional and less than adequate on the part of a body with such important functions. There was a lack of understanding by the BCI as to the commercial market and listenership involved. That showed a lack of professionalism. This means that a community will be without a local radio station, without that means to advertise and the listeners, who were committed and connected to it, will not have access to it for the period the transition takes place. There has been a stop-start response to that transition. It has been a question of whether the operators currently in place will hold a licence for a month and whether they will continue to hold it for another month. There has been no acknowledgement of the fact that this is an important time of the year in terms of the Christmas market and community groups, volunteers and charitable organisations using the airwaves to get their message out to raise money and so on. There has also been no acknowledge<Col N="794" />ment of the new licence holder being willing to pick up the ball, hit the ground running and deliver to the community and the listenership. There was no understanding of that market and of the difficulty concerning the licence holder and the incoming licence operator, which is incredible.</P>
    <P>Due to the fact that the BCI is now involved in distributing this money, in the context of this Bill, I appeal to the Minister on Committee Stage to ensure that type of poor response to a public broadcaster by the replacement body for the BCI, or by the BCI, if it is to continue in its current form, will not be tolerated.</P>
    <P>The fund will raise in the region of &euro;8 million and will be disbursed on an annual basis. It is important to understand that RTE has played an amazing role in public broadcasting down through the years. With the advances in digital technology and competition in this global market, there is a need for RTE to reflect on how it produces programmes and the types of programmes it produces. While having to ensure that the programmes broadcast have a strong viewer numbers, it must also ensure that there is an Irish content in those programmes. That mix is not easily achieved. In light of the success that RTE has enjoyed to date, it will have to reflect on its market and understand the basis of the success to date of community radio.</P>
    <P>I believe local TV channels will shortly emerge. Pirate radio stations grew and prospered and quickly moved into the local community radio scene with which we are familiar. Television is fast going down that track. Members of communities who embraced local radio and the technology around it will quickly embrace local TV stations and the benefits they will bring to local communities.</P>
    <P>Robert Putnam wrote a book in which he refers to social capital. The best expression of social capital is through the broadcasting of local television or local radio. The book states that social capital is contact with people. Television and community radio are the essence of contact with people. They make contact with people who are prisoners in their homes, for one reason or another &ndash; people with a disability who cannot get out and play a role in mainstream community activities. Even the political system is part of social capital and of the need for those involved in it to express their views on local radio and television.</P>
    <P>The effecting of change within a community is fast brought about by the presence of local radio. As politicians, we see that every day. It is the one medium that will create a focus on an issue at local authority or Government level by its use by the local politicians. Local regional television will have the same effect. That development is emerging far quicker than is being acknowledged. Communities are connected to such an extent to the concept of social capital and to a sense of ownership of local radio and television, that they will quickly embrace local television.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="795" />I am surprised the Department, which is only currently assessing the options for rolling out digital television services here, is not examining, in the context of the report mentioned, the issue of national and local television. That market exists and in a commercial sense it will be supported. Everything we do in the context of social capital and community is about the local. It is about supporting and developing our local communities and part and parcel of that is television and radio.</P>
    <P>In the context of this fund, I hope the television stations that will apply for an allocation of part of this fund will be asked to examine that concept and that the new programmes they will be willing to produce will have a local community content and give expression to a local community concept, be it political or otherwise, because it is important to support the concept of the local.</P>
    <P>The inclusion of such content should be a requirement of new programming, which must be brought forward by RTE if it is to service the change that is taking place in the market. It would be beneficial for it to examine that marketplace in detail. While we are swamped with channels from all over the world, there is a major demand for what is Irish on all the RTE channels, for its programming to be updated, for it to become more modern in its approach and presentations, for it to be more inclusive of the activities taking place in society and for it to emphasise what is happening at community level. That is the line that will lead RTE to success in a new structure of its programming to enable it to tackle the competitive and evolving market in which it operates.</P>
    <P>I can understand people are reluctant to apply new technologies and concepts because they change every day, but there is no better time to start than now. There is never a good time to start. One has to enter the market, understand the market one is in, and be prepared to run with, invest in and change the technology one uses as one moves along. This fund enables us at least to focus on the type of programming that is being planned. If such money is spent well, it will mean a great difference to RTE radio and television.</P>
    <P>I dealt with the market and the need to understand it. Ireland has changed so dramatically over the years in terms of the urban centres that have developed, how people work, the times they go to and come home from work, the types of demands being made on them in the context of their work and how well informed they wish to be about economic and social developments in Ireland. There is need for RTE to address that market. While it is addressing it to a degree as it moves forward, there is a need for it to speed up in its response to that change to ensure that it becomes as competitive in the marketplace as those channels that are beamed in across Ireland. While the pay-per-view channels offer some competition, those channels would pose little competition if RTE was to understand the market, given that <Col N="796" />the great loyalty among viewers and listeners to the radio and television programmes it produces.</P>
    <P>Deputy Ring referred to political coverage. This needs to be examined. The exposure that we get in the Houses is confined to a Wednesday morning and it needs to be expanded. How young people understand politics and what we do in this House is an issue. There is a need to further publicise local and national politics because of the pace of life in society. This will give people a window on the work done in the House by making it more transparent. It will also give a greater understanding to the legislation passed in the House which has a strong Irish content. Members of the public will understand more clearly our workings and dealings and become more connected to the workings of the political system, particularly young people. I hope that the many issues raised on Second Stage will be teased out on Committee Stage.</P>

      <P>Many speakers in both Houses have complimented local radio stations and television. It is only proper that we, as Members, recognise the contribution made by other broadcasters outside of the remit of the State broadcasting service, RTE. I congratulate local radio stations, such as my local LMFM, for the revolution they have created on the airwaves.</P>
      <P>The Bill is mainly concerned with funding for television and radio programmes of a difference. However, we should also address the question of start-up and day-to-day funding for new and existing community television and radio broadcasters. Local radio now achieves more listeners than the public broadcaster. This is not surprising as listeners want to hear programmes that are relevant to their local area and which cover local issues, debates, death notices, sporting events and gossip.</P>
      <P>Unlike the national broadcaster, local radio has managed to do this while remaining profitable. While no one can question the quality of programmes on RTE, their cost base must be questioned. One factor behind the great success of local radio is that it must keep costs to a minimum. By contrast, because of its privileged position, RTE has in some cases allowed costs to run out of control.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Local radio stations have become the training ground for broadcasters, researchers and producers. RTE should also play such a role. While not discriminating against of the well-known national broadcasters, if they demand premium salaries without fear, they should be allowed to seek a similar salary in other organisations in the knowledge they can be easily replaced by capable people who have cut their broadcasting teeth in local radio. This alone would cut the cost base of <Col N="797" />the national broadcaster, which, ultimately, can only afford to pay premium salaries on the back of the licence fee and taxpayer's money.</P>
    <P>Figures of &euro;300,000 and more have been quoted as the salaries of some of the main broadcasters. That is more than the Taoiseach earns. Are we getting value for money here? If this salary bill was cut, more funding could be made available to achieve the aims of this legislation.</P>
    <P>The Bill proposes to ringfence 5% of the television licence fee to go to other broadcasters and producers in an attempt to develop high quality programmes based on Irish culture, identity and experience and to develop these programmes in the Irish language. It also aims to increase the availability of these programmes to audiences, to represent the diversity of Irish culture and heritage, including those aspects which are disappearing, are under threat, or have not been previously recorded. It also aims to develop local and community broadcasting and to produce programmes to improve adult literacy. These are welcome proposals but they will require more than the envisaged ringfence funding.</P>
    <P>The ringfence fund is to be handed over to a commission with no detailed idea of what we intend to achieve. The Bill is vague on the return we hope to achieve for the money, which could be used to subsidise what the local and national broadcasters do already. For example, for every &euro;100 expended from this scheme are we entitled to see or hear five minutes radio broadcasting or 30 seconds of television broadcasting? What criteria are to be used to ensure there is a definite return for this expenditure? Deputy Kehoe hopes to see results on this matter, but we can only see results if criteria are in place to measure them.</P>
    <P>While the amount of money involved is not to be sneezed at, if a broadcaster such as RTE was to commission a large project on, say, the Famine or life on the Blasket Islands, much of it could be spent on one or two productions. This is contrary to the idea of the Bill, yet it contains no provisions to stop this happening. There is nothing in the Bill to ensure that the money can be easily accessed both to local as well as national broadcasting organisations.</P>
    <P>When implemented, I hope the legislation will allow award-winning broadcasters from my local radio station, LMFM, such as Daire Nelson, Pat O'Shaughnessy or Micheal Reid and those who work with them to be able to access these moneys to record in their spare time our fast disappearing heritage and culture. This could be done for the experience and the love of what they do, rather than a large financial reward. I am sure there are similar broadcasters in the country. We must make it easy for them and not only the broadcasting agent to access these funds.</P>
    <P>I have met individuals involved in short film productions who have no guarantee RTE or anyone else will broadcast them. Under the terms of the Bill, they now have to be shown by RTE or broadcasters under the commission's remit. However, to ensure funding, such productions <Col N="798" />must show they have received a guarantee they will be broadcast. This is unsatisfactory and it must be addressed on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>Deputy Coveney referred to the issue of subtitling in television broadcasting. The Bill discriminates against a large sector of the community in that it makes no attempt to address the hardships suffered by the hard-of-hearing and deaf. The Bill presents an ideal opportunity to do this. For example, in my constituency I know of a 68 year old lady living alone who, as she says herself, is as &ldquo;deaf as a post&rdquo;. She has applied for a hearing loop through the physical and sensory aids and appliances scheme but was refused because as she is over the age of 65 years, she is deemed to be too old. Her application through the elderly services fund was also refused as no funding was available. During the summer, she keeps busy in the garden. However, during the winter she is. like many others, doomed to a lonely existence because, in consideration for her neighbours, she will not raise the volume on her television or radio. She simply watches the pictures.</P>
    <P>To this lady, the absence of subtitling is another indication of the blindness to the needs of the deaf. In the United Kingdom and France most programmes are subtitled. While there was some excuse for not doing it when it was an expensive and laborious procedure, there is none in this age of technology. This lady also advised me that longevity is a feature of her family. She has one aunt who is 100 years of age while the remainder are in their nineties. If she and others like her fall into depression because of the isolation in which they are doomed to live, their treatment will cost the health boards more money than the measly cost of a hearing loop or subtitles. I was advised recently that considerable funding is available for the National Association for Deaf People to supply hearing aid systems to those who need them. However, given that it is a limited fund, we should follow in the steps of our European counterparts to ensure that programmes that qualify for a grant under this ringfence fund are subtitled.</P>
    <P>The Bill needs to be more specific in the provision of funds and should contain better yardsticks in terms of measuring value for money. The subtitle issue must also be addressed.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaulConnaughton" hpid="Mr. Connaughton Mr. Connaughton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connaughton</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Bill in so far as it goes. I do not know what one can do with &euro;8 million but it is better than nothing. The concept by which it was introduced was a good one. At least there are some targets. I hope the quality of the programming will be good but I note it could be as late as 2005 when the programmes are broadcast.</P>
      <P>On the issue of political coverage, RTE should be careful the Government has not set up a plan where Government backbenchers, having voted for a measure in the House, then object to it outside. That would amount to political pantomime and I hope the producers in RTE will not fall for it.</P>

      <P>I was amazed when the franchise was taken from North West Radio. Its broadcasts almost reached the area where I live and it was doing an excellent job. A week after losing its licence it was deemed to be one of the best broadcasting stations in the country. A survey showed it had the best audience penetration in the country. I found it difficult to understand why it had lost its franchise.</P>
      <P>I have always believed in a good public service broadcasting service. It is not possible to have it otherwise in a democracy like ours. I salute RTE on the basis that most of the time it does a professional job, although sometimes this proves costly. In the past year I understand there has been an onslaught on its cost base and I presume that is one of the reasons for the Bill. We can be proud of our national broadcaster when it is judged against the giants throughout Europe and the world against which it competes. I believe its success is because it pays considerable attention to our national culture, heritage, etc. Regardless of their age, Irish people will always have an affinity towards those provided they are presented in a professional way.</P>
      <P>That is not to say I do not want to see competition &ndash; I certainly do. I take my hat off to TV3 for what it does. Much of its output is highly professional despite being in a much more hostile business environment than RTE. It is out in the big bad world and has to work for every penny. That has worked to our advantage and has been good for RTE indirectly. Although I am not a fluent Irish speaker, I also take my hat off to TG4. Deputy Michael Higgins was very much behind this. TG4's involvement in television has been hugely successful. While commentators sometimes blame it for having poor audience figures, we are not comparing like with like.</P>
      <P>I hope the &euro;8 million will help to keep all the young producers, researchers, presenters, etc. here in Ireland. All the private companies that contribute to television programmes should be given a fair crack of the whip. They have a considerable amount to offer outside of RTE or TV3 while still working closely with them.</P>
      <P>There are sectoral interests which I hope RTE will not disregard. My background is in rural Ireland. One of the best farming programmes is &ldquo;Ear to the Ground&rdquo;. I hope nobody in RTE wants to axe that type of programme. &ldquo;Seascapes&rdquo; is an excellent programme with its sea and fishing stories. Slots like &ldquo;Farm Diary&rdquo; and the business news are hugely important. While these may not command huge audiences, it is vital that we have such balanced programming.</P>
      <P>Those involved in local radio are my heroes. We are blessed with local radio, which has shown that something that is local and is professionally done for and by the people of an area will get their attention. We should do all we can to maintain that concept.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Deenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am delighted to have the opportunity to speak on the Bill, which establishes a fund, and not on the broader discussion we must have on broadcasting, which will cover such matters as digital terrestrial television and the explosion in the number of channels available to viewers. Neither does the Bill deal with broadband provision of community television. Deputy Devins and I formed part of a delegation to Australia recently which attended a major seminar in Canberra on the provision of community television through broadband.</P>
      <P>In this country we are swamped by what I call the Anglo-American media onslaught. There is a danger, especially for the younger generation, that we will lose our sense of Irishness. The distinctive culture and heritage that distinguishes us as a people could be under threat. This is why I admire the aspiration in the provision of this fund. The provisions in section 2 are praiseworthy in how they outline the qualifying criteria.</P>
      <P>The Minister emphasised that the fund is not for broadcasters but for the audience, which is also laudable. However, given that the different schemes have, since 1997, produced about 2,000 people skilled in various forms of television and audio-visual production &ndash; film, camera, scriptwriting and various aspects of producing a documentary or film, and given that 1,000 people attend colleges to learn about television and film production, etc., it is clear that the additional finance of the fund established in the legislation is needed.</P>
      <P>The RTE report for 2002 showed that the independent production unit had &euro;32 million at its disposal. More than 400 companies applied for this funding. Only 131 received commissions, which indicates the level of demand and the limited supply of finance available. I have been involved in seven productions at different levels &ndash; but for RTE and the independent production unit, which operates on a small budget, none of these documentaries on Kerry writers would have been made. I am now involved in making a documentary on Con Houlihan which will be shown shortly. Were it not for the fact that RTE could give a commitment that, if the documentary was good enough, it would be screened, which allowed me to seek finance from friends of Con Houlihan, it would never have proceeded. Now it will go ahead and RTE will contribute about &euro;20,000. Were it not for that money, it would not have gone ahead. I recognise that the independent production unit has been productive with the amount of finance available to it. Many programmes would not have been made without that unit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I agree with Deputy Connaughton's sentiments on the &ldquo;Ear to the Ground&rdquo; and &ldquo;Seascapes&rdquo; programmes. &ldquo;Island Life&rdquo;, which is about a vet's practice in County Mayo and will be screened shortly, is also a very good series. These are innovative productions about rural life and show television in the regions giving a broader view of the regions. Now that this fund is available, I <Col N="801" />hope we will see more of this type of programming. Of the commissions granted, seven went to companies in Northern Ireland, seven to companies in the United Kingdom and 45 to other companies.</P>
    <P>The &euro;8 million will be reduced to &euro;7.6 million when the administrative costs are taken out. It will be open to companies throughout Europe to apply for money from this fund and this will probably happen. There may also be joint productions involving companies in Europe in association with companies in Ireland. Because of the amount of transnational contact taking place between France, Spain and Ireland there is scope for us to go beyond the local and connect with the bigger picture in Europe. This should be encouraged. The legislation opens up the potential for funding opportunities. At the moment, if somebody wants funding for a documentary, he or she can go, for example, to the Irish Film Board, the independent production unit of RTE, TG4, TV3 and even the BBC which funds productions in Ireland. People can now look for assistance from the broadcasting fund which we are discussing.</P>
    <P>A system should be put in place to avoid duplication. There may be scope for partial funding from RTE's independent production unit and, perhaps, from this new funding provision. Will the Minister clarify this matter? In the event of funding not being secured, can a commitment for finance be given to a production company if it can come up with matching finance? Will the funding provided be full or partial? It is important that this point is clarified.</P>
    <P>Overall, I am very much in favour of the Bill. It is a welcome source of funding for independent production companies. There is a great deal of stories to be told and rich subject matter to explore, which will not happen without finance being available. Experts here are capable of translating these stories into documentaries and I hope this legislation will give them the opportunity to do so.</P>

      <P>Like previous speakers, I welcome the Bill. It is an important part of the broadcasting programme and adds to what has already been done. Radical changes have been made in the recent past and I hope we continue to deal with issues as the need arises.</P>
      <P>I welcome the fact that almost every speaker complimented RTE and expressed satisfaction with the station. In previous years they might not have been as complimentary. In the past RTE was sometimes unfavourably compared with other national broadcasters. RTE has done an excellent job and I join other speakers in complimenting it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="802" />I agree with Deputy Deenihan's concern about the danger of losing our sense of being Irish, but the opposite has happened, which may be due to competition between the three stations. Productions at RTE have improved steadily in recent times. I concur with those Members who referred to &ldquo;Seascapes&rdquo; and other programmes which deal with the environment and important topical and historical issues.</P>
    <P>Deputies English, Connaughton and others referred to the cost factor. When the Minister received the report from the forum on broadcasting and initially launched the Bill, he pointed out that RTE was in the process of delivering significant change and that it was conscious of the need to be more cost effective and financially accountable. I questioned the spending of large sums of money in the past &ndash; far more than any political party would spend &ndash; on the promotion of a few personalities who were also paid large sums of money. I would have preferred to see the money spread around more fairly rather than benefiting a small elite group. The response I got at the time was that no other talent was available, that these were the gifted few. I do not accept that was the case, as has been proven by the emergence of talent since the development of other stations and, as Deputy English said, through local radio stations, and television in the case of Cork. The talent is there and merely requires to be nurtured. There should be a more even sharing of the funds available in RTE where it seemed that people were practically allowed to write their own contracts. I do not say this out of a sense of begrudgery but this is not a policy I would support.</P>
    <P>Certain speakers commented on the commission and funding. Reference was made in a conspiratorial manner to the fact that people would buy into Fianna Fáil. Commission members both now and in future will have to act in an open and transparent fashion.</P>
    <P>The usual complaints have been aired. The Sinn Féin Party views RTE as anti-republican while the Fine Gael Party thinks RTE favours Fianna Fáil. The Fianna Fáil Party's views on some programmes are well documented. RTE must be doing a good job if it manages to upset everybody.</P>

      <P>A number of speakers referred to subtitling, which is a matter that needs to be addressed. This can legitimately be described as part of the duty of a public service broadcaster. Given the cost involved, I wonder if this is the appropriate vehicle for this matter. I look forward to hearing the Minister of State's concluding remarks.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Speakers also referred to broadcasting of the proceedings in the Oireachtas. We should have a <Col N="803" />public service channel showing the Oireachtas in operation. The BBC has one, as do various other national broadcasters. Cynics might say that nobody would be interested in this option. That is an insult to people, whom I believe are most interested in civic issues and what goes on here. It would allow people to make their own judgments rather than relying on a soundbite from whatever source or a few paragraphs of summary from a reporter after five or six hours of committee proceedings. People should be able to see what is going on in committees and elsewhere, not alone in regard to matters of local interest but to ensure that they are getting value for money in general.</P>
    <P>About eight or nine years ago I attended a conference in UCC on communications and broadcasting. It was an international conference sponsored by the then <i>Cork Examiner</i> which was attended by Irish media experts and others from around the world. A politician who was on the panel of speakers said that one of the primary difficulties faced by him and those with whom he worked was that reporters had been replaced with commentators. If I or any of my Cabinet colleagues said that, we would be denounced from on high. That remark was made by John Hume. The session was chaired by Mr. Crosbie of the then <i>Cork Examiner.</i> Nobody disagreed with the point. It is important that people have direct access to proceedings rather than depending on soundbites or on one reporter interviewing another and trying to decide what the person making the statement had in mind. I would like to see the Oireachtas opened up to the public in this way. If some of us are performing badly, members of the public should be allowed to see it. We have no difficulty with them seeing what is really happening.</P>
    <P>The focus is on diverting money deliberately to ensure certain things happen. We have all paid lip service to this idea but it is important to ensure it is put into practice. There is huge money involved with which a great deal can be done. There are specific things I would like to see done but that is an issue for later discussion.</P>
    <P>While many parts of the country do not have local television stations, we have one in Cork which is excellent. With Cork 96 FM, it broadcasts junior sports events in the county as well as larger events such as county championship matches. There is massive coverage of GAA events. We all have an interest in local sport. In this regard, I have an opportunity to watch Gerald McCarthy on television and listen to Finbar McCarthy on radio. They attend GAA games on which they have the knowledge to comment. These elements can be applied to almost any topic. One does not need to be a rocket scientist to make a good broadcast and explain to people what is happening.</P>
    <P>There is a real commitment to this philosophy on the parts of the Minister and his Minister of State, Deputy Browne. I compliment them on what they are trying to achieve. The forum on <Col N="804" />broadcasting stated clearly that RTE's role as the designated public service broadcaster should be reaffirmed. That is the end of the story. While we all accept that RTE is the organisation which fulfils this function, some additional guidelines are necessary. We are adopting this approach in respect of all public services. There has generally been a cynical approach to the public service but this is changing to a great extent. We are raising standards. People were cynical about benchmarking and the paying out of money but there is a balance being struck. People have to deliver and their performance will be measured. I work in the public service and I am proud to say our standard is of the excellence required. However, the subject under discussion is broadcasting.</P>
    <P>I am happy with our progress and commend the Bill. I wish the Minister well. It would be useful if he were to refer to what Deputy Coveney correctly pointed out is termed &ldquo;captioning&rdquo;.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimmyDevinsFF" hpid="Dr. Devins Dr. Devins">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Devins</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to speak on the very important Broadcasting (Funding) Bill 2003. The Minister promised this legislation in 2002 and its main goal is to transfer to a broadcasting funding scheme 5% of total television licensing fee receipts. In the current year 5% amounts to &euro;8 million. The funds generated will be used to make new radio and television programmes according to three sets of criteria. According to the first set, programmes will be geared toward the promotion of Irish culture, identity and experience.</P>
      <P>Since the foundation of the State, the protection of the national identity has been part and parcel of the policies of successive Governments. In the initial stages of the State's existence, these policies were pursued subconsciously as a logical development of our emerging sense of belonging in a new Ireland. With increasing globalisation and our membership of the European Union, there is a danger that many aspects of our Irishness, particularly our sense of national identity, may be diluted or lost. Many media outlets, particularly television and cinema, portray the cultures and values of other countries, especially those of the United States of America where a great many programmes originate.</P>
      <P>We are all aware of the power of the media to influence people, especially the young. It is important, therefore, to put in place a system of checks and balances. The Irish sense of identity is very strong. It is founded on a culture which is rich and diverse. Ireland is a small country and we have a powerful sense of place and strongly identify with our localities. It is fascinating that when two Irish people meet for the first time at home or abroad, the conversation invariably turns to the local origins of each. Having spoken to people from other countries, I believe consideration of our sense of locality is much more likely to occur during an interaction between Irish people than between people of other nationalities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="805" />With the increasing domination of other cultures, particularly that of the United States of America, there is a constant danger that our sense of national identity will be diminished. Our culture and traditions are rich and thrive in many aspects of contemporary life. One need only consider the huge renaissance being enjoyed by Irish literature, music and dance to appreciate how fertile contemporary conditions are. It is important to take steps to protect this rich cultural tradition. The Bill will ensure this happens by implementing measures which will encourage new audiences in Ireland and provide funding to archive material produced in the State.</P>
    <P>I warmly welcome the archiving provisions. Attempts have been made to archive material but this has generally been the preserve of distinguished individuals operating alone with few resources. Archiving should be carried out on a much more extensive basis. There is in place in the world of books and literature a system whereby a copy of every book produced in Ireland must be lodged in the library at Trinity College, Dublin. Perhaps it is time to establish a similar system whereby a copy of every programme produced for radio and television in Ireland is lodged in a central depository. A micro copy of these programmes should be stored for posterity. The National Library, a university or an institute of technology would provide a suitable venue for such a repository. Knowing the enthusiasm for Irish culture among third level students and staff, I am sure an institute of technology such as Sligo Institute of Technology would be delighted to be asked to fulfil this function.</P>
    <P>The Bill provides for the development of programmes to improve adult literacy, particularly in the Irish language. Recent research has demonstrated that there are unacceptably high levels of adult illiteracy. Adults who suffer from illiteracy and can be persuaded to attend classes generally show a remarkable ability to learn to read and write. The perceived shame in many cases prohibits them from seeking help. Listening to a radio programme or watching television in the privacy of one's home should help them to overcome any reluctance to seek help and encourage them to become more proficient readers and writers. They can subsequently be encouraged to attend classes and, gradually, fulfil their true potential.</P>
    <P>I am delighted to note that local radio stations are to be allowed to use moneys allocated to the broadcasting fund to provide the above services. One of the success stories of recent times concerns the phenomenal achievements of local radio in reaching out to a huge audience. I congratulate my local radio station, North West Radio, which has already been referred to by Deputy Connaughten. The station is based in Sligo but covers the entire north-west area. It has recently been voted the best local radio station in the country. Many, including me, listen avidly to its great mixture of national and local news, current affairs and music. Unfortunately, it has been <Col N="806" />informed by the Broadcasting Commission of Ireland that it is to lose its licence. This decision has been received with great regret and dismay among its many listeners. The fact that its only recourse of appeal is the courts is particularly galling.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Minister of State's comment that a new appeals system will be established to challenge decisions like this one without having to resort to the expensive and cumbersome legal route. In the interests of fairness and democracy, an appeals system should be established sooner rather than later. Once in place, it would provide a fair and transparent forum in which stations which had lost their licences could have their cases heard. Such an appeals mechanism is not in place and I call on the Minister to establish one as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>This Bill represents a major step forward in the development of broadcasting in Ireland. It will protect and enhance our culture while, for the first time, allowing some of the funds generated from television licence fees to go to local radio stations. I commend the Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I differ from other speakers, and do so as a former Minister with responsibility for broadcasting. The legislation is fundamentally flawed. It blurs the distinction that should exist between the national broadcaster, the national broadcasting authority, the Minister and the Government. As I listened to the previous speech about how the proposals in the Bill will advance culture, I restrained myself from remembering how the Ministry of culture was abolished by the party opposite which could not live with the word &ldquo;culture&rdquo; in a Department's title. Having removed the word &ldquo;culture&rdquo;, lest there ever be a Minister for culture again, it went on to demolish the Department.</P>
      <P>I wish to illustrate clearly what I mean by the flaws at the heart of the legislation. I addressed these in February 1997 when I produced an <i>aide-memoire</i> on broadcasting for Government. In my time, we prepared a Green Paper on broadcasting. I published heads of a Bill and sought approval from the then Government for a broadcasting Bill to be prepared. I am probably precluded by the Supreme Court from referring in detail to the documents which I brought to Cabinet, but I am glad that I retained a sufficient amount of notes and drafts to be able to say exactly what we proposed.</P>
      <P>Fundamental to my thinking was a distinction between the concept of the national broadcaster and public service broadcasting on the one hand and public service programming within a broadcasting service on the other hand. It is dishonest to suggest there is any similarity between the same. For example, as regards the latter, one could say that the announcement of death notices or the times of funerals on a radio station make it a public service broadcaster.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="807" />If one takes, for example, the criteria that have been used to define the public service broadcaster, where it exists, eight principles of public service broadcasting have been set out by Michael Treacy in his book on the BBC and the decline and fall of public service broadcasting. These criteria included: universality of availability, universality of appeal, provision for minorities, especially those disadvantaged by physical or social circumstance, servicing the public sphere &ndash; the nation speaking to itself in Lord Reith's terms, a commitment to the education of the public, and the distancing of public broadcasting from all vested interests. I pause on that sixth one to ask why these three areas of archives, culture and Irish identity will be looked after in this special way and why the Broadcasting Commission of Ireland will have to seek approval from the Minister. Does the authority of the national broadcaster not carry the burden of these responsibilities? This is satisfying the argument by firing in a reference to additionality.</P>
    <P>The seventh criterion is that broadcasting should be so structured as to encourage competition and good programming rather than competition for numbers. I cannot emphasise sufficiently that the public service broadcaster has a duty to the citizens and that public service broadcasting is an act of citizenship catering for citizens rather than for consumers of a product in a commodified market. The eighth criterion is that the rules of broadcasting should liberate rather than restrict the programme maker. Can anybody who has spoken in favour of the legislation tell me that there is not a breach of autonomy between the Minister and the broadcasting authority in the first instance? Is the specification of the different areas in sections 3 and 7 not an invasion of the programming function? Section 7 could also constitute editorial interference. If section 7 undermines autonomy, interferes with programming and constitutes editorial interference, it is unsatisfactory.</P>
    <P>I should say something else about the authority that will run the national broadcaster in any circumstance. One of the reasons I abolished the order under section 31 on proscription was that there was an incredible lack of trust involved &ndash; a lack of trust of the public to exercise discrimination, a lack of trust of the programme maker and a lack of trust of the authority to exercise functions as regards broadcasting. The Bill, irrespective of the number of people who say they are in favour of what it suggests, considerably erodes the trust which should be placed in the authority that is responsible for the national broadcaster. It interferes with autonomy and erodes trust. What it begins to make possible is quite tragic.</P>
    <P>As it happens, I have supported some initiatives taken by the Minister in the past year or two. I entirely side with him on the disgraceful attempt by Rupert Murdoch's anti-democratic and unaccountable organisation to acquire sporting rights and I repeat my view, often offered at that time, <Col N="808" />that, as president of the Council of Broadcasting Ministers dealing with this issue, there was never a legal basis for anyone to sell as a commodity rights to sporting events which citizens had a right to view or hear. That is why I supported the Minister. However, I am afraid I cannot do so in respect of this legislation which flies in the face of some fundamentals of the integrity of public service broadcasting.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State's speech made some unfortunate references to the Government's relationship to digital broadcasting. As rapporteur for the previous committee with responsibility for heritage and the Irish language, I was preparing a report on digital broadcasting when the then Minister, Deputy de Valera, made a dramatic announcement that Cabinet had decided on the digital question. As they would say down the country, &ldquo;They had gone for digital terrestrial&rdquo;. They rejected satellite, cable and all the other interactive technologies. Of course, nothing came of it.</P>
    <P>I agree with one person's speech here that if one has a ramshackle proposal, one is better to abandon it before it costs too much. The principles behind that proposal were equally interesting. It was not that they constructed a model of digital delivery that would, for example, follow the principle of universality in that one should not open a new fissure in society between the information rich and the information poor. Digital should be rolled out early. It should be an advantage to the State and it should carry other services and so on, but this did not happen.</P>
    <P>I listened earlier to well-meaning Deputies speak as if the world were changing through some kind of great cosmic effect like the ice age or something similar. What is happening in Europe in regard to broadcasting, to which reference was made, is very knowable. I remember that, during my time as Minister, the then Commissioner with responsibility for competition wanted broadcasting regarded as a commodified entity. We had an enormous battle with the United States on the issue. In 1994 some 68% of all the fiction viewed in Europe came from the United States. That was not accidental. Audio-visual media was the second most important export from the United States to the European Union. There were different measures to deal with that. What Mr. Monti wanted was for audio-visual media to be regarded as a new service, a commodity to be treated by market principles. We argued, when we had a Ministry of culture, that broadcasting was much more than a commodity. It was a cultural expression of a people and the right of people to deal with each other.</P>
    <P>We had the great advantage of living in the shadow of one of the finest broadcasting services in the world, the BBC. Whether I agree with Lord Reith or not, his principles of informing, educating and entertaining were important. However, the commodified regime reduces everything to the entertainment end. Thus, Mr. Murdoch was able to say he would use sport as the battering <Col N="809" />ram for what he intended to do with regard to broadcasting.</P>
    <P>I supported the Minister in standing up to Mr. Murdoch and I would do the same tomorrow. I cannot, however, agree with the Minister with regard to the blurring of the distinction between Government, the Department responsible and the RTE authority. Neither can I countenance the interference in sections 3 and 7 in the work of the authority where the Minister says he will take responsibility for culture, heritage and Irish identity. Has the Minister relieved the authority of that duty? He has not. Therefore, this contradicts in a curious way some of the fundamental principles at the heart of the basic broadcasting legislation.</P>
    <P>I will be charitable about the digital television issue and leave it aside for another day. I agree with Deputies raising practical issues. They are right to raise the issue of subtitling etc. I hide a reluctant hesitation to air my view that RTE has not always been excellent at delivering its public service function. If anything, RTE has lived with too much of a commercial shadow over it. It is a scandal that the market insists that we cannot put a ban on advertising directed at children as we approach Christmas. Sweden thought of doing this but was threatened by the vested interests of the European Union. Toymakers, for example, have threatened to take court cases. These are the people with whom we have to deal.</P>
    <P>People describe the changes taking place in broadcasting as if they are grasping nettles. Mr. Berlusconi is a monopolist. He abuses broadcasting. He does so because of the three tendencies of the industry towards fragmentation of audiences, convergence of technologies and concentration of ownership. It is one of the most disgraceful failures of the European Union that it never defended the principle of the diversity of broadcasting in the face of the kind of onslaught that came from those who wanted commodified entertainment as their version of broadcasting. This is a scandal.</P>
    <P>It came to a point where, for example, the European Parliament instructed the Commissioner responsible to do something about monopoly. He failed to do so and the President of the Commission said he supported the Commissioner and would leave the issue to be decided by the market. That is a case of Europe rolling over. It is not a case of something happening or evolving. It is a conscious decision to do nothing about the damage to public service broadcasting.</P>
    <P>What was the function of the European Broadcasting Union when Ireland was a much poorer place than now? Its function was to ensure that all citizens of a country which was part of the Union had the right to see something of interest to them. We paid according to our capacity to pay. That folded under the threat of the purchase of rights by German conglomerates, which in turn went broke and rolled on. Some people think it is acceptable that four or five multinationals should dominate broadcasting. Three companies are responsible for more than 80% of the world mar<Col N="810" />ket in animation. This does not happen by accident.</P>
    <P>The situation I inherited in 1993 was a time when the right had gone down the road of reducing everything, including broadcasting, to the neo-liberal version of the market. We were fighting a rearguard action for public service broadcasting. That is the reason all the little mimics here who wanted to attack me about Teilifís na Gaeilge, now TG4, were saying it was a waste of money and the reason they were asking why I was introducing a nativist station, etc. The reality is they were little less than lackeys for Murdochism, with regard to broadcasting.</P>
    <P>This is the reason I defend the principle of public service broadcasting and retaining the concept of the public service broadcaster. We are not shaking pepper on what everyone else is doing or saying that, because the deaths are reported here and the weather there, we will have a bit of &ldquo;come all ye&rdquo; here. We are not saying this is an equivalent or alternative. It is not and we should stop the nonsense of pretending it is. If the Minister is going to require under the section that people come back to him with a scheme under three or four headings, he is interfering. If he decides to specify three or four criteria above everything else or among many he could have specified, he is interfering with programme making. In turn, that leaves him open to the future possibility of being able to change the scheme altogether.</P>
    <P>The totality and philosophy of content is important. I remember well the suggestion for the principle of ministerial interference. I spoke against it in the Seanad in 1974 when Dr. Conor Cruise O'Brien spoke in its favour. I recall being heavily criticised in this House as Minister when I abolished the order under section 31. Some people in Government with me would have liked me to retain the idea so that I could use it again as a threat to make people behave. That is not the function of a Minister with responsibility for broadcasting.</P>
    <P>Broadcasting is healthy where a non-linked principle is respected and there is a distance between the Minister and the broadcaster. The role of Government policy is to lay down cultural policy while the Minister with responsibility for broadcasting must lay down broadcasting policy. There is also the broadcasting commission. I proposed a super authority, but it would have had total autonomy. The role RTE and that authority would have in what I proposed in February 1997 did not infringe any principle of autonomy.</P>
    <P>It must be asked why the taking of the 5% of the licence fee is happening. It is a condition that was extracted in return for an increase in the licence fee. I would like to explain something about the licence. When I last went to Cabinet and secured an increase for the television licence fee prior to the most recent increase, it was granted on the basis of a formula agreed between my Department and the Department of Finance. In other words, I wanted the increase indexed. <Col N="811" />Indexation was agreed by Cabinet. I asked my successor, Deputy de Valera, if the decision had been cancelled. She said it had not been cancelled but nothing would be done about it because they did not agree with it. The Government wanted to keep it as a conditional <i>lien</i> on RTE when it came to look for a television licence fee increase.</P>
    <P>This 5% is a further condition extracted from the national broadcaster and this is a dangerous road to take. I do not disagree with the people who have paid tribute to their local radio, local television, broadcasters and writers or with those who want more subtitling or more Dáil coverage. These details can be discussed another day.</P>
    <P>We are making law and that law must respect boundaries. We do not run the country's broadcasting service. If we say that we do not trust the broadcasting authority, that is a serious situation. I trust it. I have said other decisions I took related to restoring trust. This distance is incredibly important.</P>
    <P>I would like to conclude by speaking about the interesting subject of the star system in RTE. I agree with Members who have argued against the presence of such a system. We are told that there is such a system because advertisers want a name. The reality is that dozens of talented people are coming through. Why can they not all be given a chance? Why should 100 people not bloom in RTE, rather than a few nettles being allowed to thrive? Many are right to ask this question.</P>

I was amazed by his suggestion that RTE was being easy on Fianna Fáil. He singled out my colleague, Deputy Cregan, as an example of a Fianna Fáil Deputy who represented his constituents and did his job. He feels such people are rebels but Deputy Cregan is no rebel. He is doing his job for the people of Limerick, just as the rest of us are representing our local areas. Perhaps somebody will pass on my views to Deputy Ring.</P>

      <P>It is important that the House should support the Broadcasting (Funding) Bill 2003. The Minister has said it is a core element of the public service broadcasting reform programme. It provides for the allocation of 5% of net proceeds from the television licence fee &ndash; I understand this amounts to approximately &euro;8 million annually &ndash; to a scheme to fund new programmes on television and radio. I welcome the fact that the scheme will be available to benefit new programmes on Irish culture, heritage and experience. I am glad that it will help to improve adult literacy and fund additional Irish language programming.</P>
      <P>I am not ashamed to say there was no television when my generation was growing up. Radio was king at the time. I can remember listening to the radio in my grandmother's house in the inner-city area of Dublin and, later, when we had moved to Crumlin. The fact that I remember listening to the English football results every Saturday indicates something about the nature of public service broadcasting at the time. Although there was a great deal of complaining about the English &ndash; it continues to a certain extent &ndash; we listened to their football results on RTE every Saturday. I am not sure if it was a sad experience but I remember it nonetheless.</P>
      <P>I have used this example to demonstrate how well the national broadcaster has represented us and provided us with entertainment and interest over many years. It continues to compete very well in the new competitive environment. If Members want to get into my car some day &ndash; they are welcome, although not all together &ndash; they will notice that I listen to many different stations.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Connor</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, I listen to Tallaght FM. I am glad to tell the House that I was one of its founder members four years ago. It broadcasts from a first class facility at The Square in Tallaght every day other than Sunday, from 12 noon to 10 p.m. It provides a large range of programmes, including many good talk programmes. The &ldquo;Tallaght Talk&rdquo; programme at 5.30 p.m. each evening gives politicians of different persuasions an <Col N="813" />opportunity to get their message across. Tallaght FM, like other radio stations, does a superb job.</P>
      <P>When considering the service provided by the television networks, it is important that people have good programmes available to them. Audiences are interested in programming. The core aim of the Bill and the broadcasting fund is to provide Irish audiences with more high quality programming. The stated aim of the fund is to encourage broadcasters catering for Irish audiences to include in their schedules additional programming of a high quality that is of interest and relevance to Irish audiences. This is both timely and necessary.</P>
      <P>RTE's services must continue to be available to all the population without charge. As it is owned by the people and exists to serve them, it must be available to all for free. At times I wonder if the authorities at Montrose have lost sight of these central facts. I disagree with those who argue that there is no longer a need for intervention by the State because of the explosion in new services. I do not agree with those who suggest that State-funded broadcasters should be limited to delivering a restricted range of output. RTE's mandate requires it to provide radio and television services for all the people. It should not be restricted to providing niche programmes for a small sector of the population. I support its argument that it needs to react to changes in the environment in which it operates. The decisions on what to include in schedules should continue to be based on how best to serve those who pay the licence fee.</P>
      <P>The Government has acted in two ways to assist RTE. It has increased the level of public funding available to RTE and proposed the creation of a fund to encourage broadcasters serving Irish audiences to include in their schedules additional high quality programmes that are of interest to such audiences. The output from this scheme will be used to fund the development of television and radio programme archives. This will be an area of importance in the future when researchers are looking back on the deeds of today.</P>

      <P>I support the Bill which is long overdue. In many ways, we have taken public broadcasting for granted. We have grown up with fine television and radio stations. Many of us have been able since we were children to watch fine public broadcasting from the UK. RTE has been criticised many times over the years and, while that criticism has sometimes been merited, we must remember it had to compete with the BBC, the best public broadcasting station in the world. The quality of television services in parts of southern Europe is dreadful. They are entirely commercial and I do not understand how people watch them.</P>
      <P>The quality of public broadcasting services in Ireland is very high. That said, we are constantly under attack because, as Deputy Michael D. Higgins said, 60% of what we in Europe watch comes from the United States.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>It was 68% in 1994.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EoinRyan" hpid="Mr. Eoin Ryan Mr. Eoin Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Eoin Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>A total of 68% of what we watch comes from the United States. That is frightening. Who wants to survive on a diet of &ldquo;The Simpsons&rdquo; and &ldquo;Sex in the City&rdquo;, popular as such programmes are? It is important that we produce good quality television and radio programmes which highlight our history and culture, together with contemporary works which allow young playwrights and musicians access to high quality, properly funded programmes.</P>
      <P>The French do not take any prisoners in this area. They are adamant when entering international negotiations that their culture be protected. One has to admire their wonderful film industry. They are often chauvinistic but they will not take prisoners when it comes to protecting themselves from American programmes. I admire how they have gone about ensuring that. We should try to follow their example.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill, which could be rolled out over the years, could be extremely important in ensuring we broadcast high quality television and radio programmes. The Americans, who produce 68% of what we watch on television, have little interest in paying musicians and writers. I and other Members, along with the Irish Musical Rights Organisation, found it incredibly difficult to <Col N="816" />obtain money from the United States for Irish musicians and writers. I understand that continues to be the case. French, German and other musicians and writers also have difficulty getting money from them. They gobble up what they can but are slow to give back to composers and writers. We must be aware of this and fight against it. We must not only ensure that our writers and composers are paid what they are due but also that we properly fund good quality television and radio programmes.</P>
    <P>The Bill also deals with archived programmes. The Irish Film Board has wonderful film archives but badly needs funding to store them properly. I am delighted such funding is provided for in the Bill. I recently attended an AGM of the Irish Film Board &ndash; I was a board member a number of years ago &ndash; at which this issue was discussed at length. Its archives contain many wonderful clips and pictures about our history and culture. There are clips of films about which people have completely forgotten, and the Irish Film Board should highlight that to the public and Members of the House. It is important that Members of the Dáil and Seanad obtain a briefing on what is stored by the board. I am delighted it is to receive funding under the Bill.</P>
    <P>RTE also has some good archive material, some of which it often shows. Many people are interested in clippings from the 1930s. There is a huge audience for that kind of material and we should ensure it is properly stored and taken care of and that people have easy access to it.</P>
    <P>Local and community broadcasting is important for many regions. I have been interviewed on a number of local radio stations around the country and have appeared on a local television programme. Such broadcasters may come across as amateur, but it is important that local communities have access to some means to put across their point of view. I welcome the opportunities the Bill provides in this regard.</P>
    <P>There has been much criticism of digital broadcasting and the Government's lack of progress in this area. There have been many failures and many people have lost a great deal of money in the area. We must ensure our digital platform works. If it does, we will have done a good day's work. The Minister and his officials are studying the issue. I welcome the Minister of State's announcement that a report is expected by the end of the year. I hope we will be able to move on once problems have been highlighted.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill. It is a step in the right direction. There is nothing better than watching a good quality programme. Unfortunately, many such programmes are produced by the BBC. I watched one part of a two part programme on Charles II. It is a good quality programme of historical interest. There have been many such examples over the years. RTE has also made many fine programmes. There is nothing better than watching something of good quality. One really notices the inroads American culture is making when one sees something of that sort. I <Col N="817" />welcome the Bill. I hope and have no doubt that it is the start of something that will be very positive for us all in years ahead. I hope it will be the catalyst for more high quality Irish programmes on our television screens.</P>

      <P>I am thankful for the opportunity to address the House on the Broadcasting (Funding) Bill 2003. The Bill and the debate give us all an opportunity to take a deeper look at broadcasting services in this country. Broadcasters have a duty to be open and fair to all citizens, particularly taxpayers. They must be fair, objective and balanced. Many in Irish society do not trust our media. We should not be afraid to say this straight out tonight. Broadcasters and journalists with a political agenda should always be challenged, particularly by elected Members of this House. The public deserves trust and expects balance. Citizens deserve the truth on all issues. Since election to this House, I have been told by many experienced politicians and serious media people not to antagonise the media, since eventually they will get one. I do not accept this, since all elected representatives deserve respect for their mandate. That is the bottom line.</P>
      <P>Many in the media, including the broadcast services, are elitist snobs. Broadcasters, journalists and spin doctors have major power and influence in society. However, if they stood for election tomorrow morning, they would get barely 200 votes. How dare they lecture and pontificate about Deputies and Senators? How dare they decide to blacklist and boycott certain politicians because they do not agree with their views? I know of many senior political correspondents who ignore or censor elected Members of this House. In my own case, most of the so-called media correspondents have not woken up to the reality that independent Deputies have 13% support, three times the votes of one of the Government parties, yet seven nights a week on RTE we see the same people representing the 4%. This is blatant censorship and shows a complete lack of respect for democracy. This is a wake-up call for more ethics in the media to end, once and for all, the embedded journalists and broadcasters. Of course, there are the few noble and objective journalists who stay loyal to their impartial reporting. If I wished, I could name the political allegiances of 90% of the reporters in broadcasting and the print media. The good news, however, is that the public has now copped on to them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Today Ireland is known as the land of scandals and tribunals. Politics, banking, the church, business and the law have all suffered from an erosion of public confidence. I contest that our media have also lost the trust and confidence of the public. The so-called sexy story often gets in the way of the truth and objective reporting. I urge all <Col N="818" />involved to examine these concerns seriously, as they are denying the public the right to accurate information. Personal attacks and intrusions into politicians' personal and family lives have nothing to do with balanced reporting.</P>
    <P>When discussing the Bill, we must face up to the seamy, negative side of public broadcasting and the media, in general. Its purpose is to establish a new broadcasting funding scheme for television and radio programmes, to be funded by 5% of net television licence fee receipts and administered by the Broadcasting Commission of Ireland, BCI. The Bill outlines the general objectives and framework of the scheme which is to be prepared by the BCI.</P>
    <P>I agree with the Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources on section 3 and the scheme's objectives of high quality programmes based on Irish culture, heritage and experience, developing such programmes in the Irish language, increasing their availability to all interests in the State, representing the diversity of Irish culture, developing local and community broadcasting, as well as new television and radio programmes to improve adult literacy. I welcome the section, particularly the new programmes to improve adult literacy. At this stage, I pay tribute to such programmes as &ldquo;Read and Write Now&rdquo; and &ldquo;Outside the Box&rdquo; for their major, positive contribution to society. Their work is magnificent, top quality public broadcasting. We should all learn from such programmes. Adults learn, children learn and, above all, society learns. We then move towards real social inclusion.</P>
    <P>Section 5 provides for a review of the scheme every three years or at such times as may be requested by the Minister. That is positive, since we must constantly examine, assess and review our broadcasting services and all aspects of the media. A society not learning, listening or seeing will never change. To the broadcast media, I say they should open their minds and hearts to the people. They will then earn their respect and admiration.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanBoyle" hpid="Mr. Boyle Mr. Boyle">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boyle</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for ceding time and allowing me to make this final contribution to the debate. Last week, after publication of the Book of Estimates, I christened the Minister for Finance &ldquo;Mr. 2%&rdquo;, since the increase in capital and current expenditure, taking public sector pay into account, was only 2%. The Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources seems intent on going one better and wishes to be termed &ldquo;Mr. 5%&rdquo;. However, the 5% that he seeks is 5% that my party and I believe will reduce the true value of increasing the public service broadcasting element. Even in simple economic terms, taking 5% from a television licence fee receipt which cost far too much to administer in the first place and having 5% subsequently as an administration cost to distribute it to independent broadcasters means that we are already losing out on those resources being provided for high quality public service broadcasting.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="819" />More worrying is the fact that this legislation is a toe-in-the-door exercise. Many of us fear that further legislation down the road will provide for a figure of 10%, 20%, 30% or 50% since we already hear the screams for true competition from many in the Government. There will be no difference between our national public service broadcaster and those in the commercial sector. Each will be supported equally by the public purse. Even the principle of using television licence fee receipts for such a purpose must be questioned. I would have thought that the whole purpose of a licensing regime was to put in place measures by which companies would be obliged to provide for public service broadcasting. If the Government says that is a failing system, there might be acceptance of part of that argument. However, the system must be made to work.</P>
    <P>I refer specifically to the decisions being made on local radio and the fact that licences have been changed for local radio stations which seem to have committed only the crime of speaking with a local voice. Licences now seem to be issued on the basis of fitting a formulaic response to broadcasting with an American model of &ldquo;pap music&rdquo;, a term which is not pejorative of the music, since it is meant to be mindless, thoughtless and as inoffensive as possible. The whole point of broadcasting is that it challenges the listener and the viewer. This type of legislation does nothing but dumb down the whole idea of how we are supposed to interact with our broadcast media as citizens. On those grounds, it must be opposed.</P>
    <P>The only analogous legislation of which I can think, though the figures might be different, is the Broadcasting Act introduced by our friend who has more difficulty with today's news, the former Minister for Communications, Mr. Ray Burke, when he introduced a 50% advertising cap on RTE. This is the same principle in reverse regarding public money. It is putting a toe in the water on behalf of unseen beneficiaries at the expense of public service broadcasting. On these grounds, the Green Party believes the Bill should not be adopted. We will end up not by improving quality in the commercial broadcasting sector but with a ghetto of 5% sponsored by the public purse. As a result, the obligation of those involved in the commercial broadcasting sector to provide high quality broadcasts will be diminished.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBrowne2" hpid="Mr. Browne Mr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources (Mr. Browne)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputies for their contributions during the course of today's proceedings. We have had a wide-ranging debate from local radio, local television and the BCI to RTE, TG4 and TV3, as well as many other issues which, although they are not relevant to the Bill, are nonetheless important and give Deputies an opportunity to discuss broadcasting. I appreciate the support of the majority of Deputies. I respect the views of Deputy Michael D. Higgins and others who have questioned a number of aspects <Col N="820" />of the Bill. I am sure we can tease out some of the issues further on Committee Stage.</P>
      <P>It is not true to say that RTE will be down 5% on funding for public sector broadcasting. The fund was announced in the context of the recent increase in the license fee which would not have been as much as to &euro;150 if the fund had not been in mind. Rather, it was taken into account at that stage. The figure of &euro;400,000 for administration and expenses is an estimate which works out at about 5% of the &euro;8 million. It covers the cost of some additional staff for the BCI and other costs which will arise such as the publication of the scheme and the cost of expertise for the assessment of applications and reports. It is not the intention that the &euro;400,000 will be paid to the BCI as a fixed amount. Only reasonable costs incurred will be paid from the fund.</P>
      <P>The categories of programmes will remain focused on the subjects indicated, namely, Irish culture, heritage and experience and adult literacy. That is not to deny that there are many other interesting subjects for programmes, rather it underlines that the fund is limited and best focused on a specific category of programmes and the funding should not overlap with existing requirements on broadcasters in regard to provision of news and current affairs programmes.</P>
      <P>The ring-fencing of the funding, the details of which include grant rates and the allocation of costs between the various categories, are best left to the scheme itself. The focus of the scheme is on audiences and we cannot anticipate from where the best programmes will come. The Bill already provides that the BCI may decide that funding in a particular year will be directed towards particular classes of programmes and on programmes broadcast on particular media such as radio or community television. This is a more flexible approach which will allow the scheme to develop effectively.</P>
      <P>During the debate, it was suggested that the fund could be used to provide for the cost of subtitling the existing output of broadcasters. Deputy Coveney and others made a strong and passionate case for subtitling and it is an area which the Minister is anxious to deal with quickly. However, this fund is for new programmes. The BCI is considering separately what regulations should apply to subtitling and we hope that in the early part of next year, some recommendations will be made in that area. The question of subtitling programmes financed from the fund is a different matter and I am of the view that, if we are to fund particular programmes, we should also consider subtitling. We can tease this out on Committee Stage and it can be addressed in the detail of the scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Michael D. Higgins raised a number of issues. As a former Minister, he is passionate about issues around broadcasting and has been supportive of the Minister in a number of areas, particularly in regard to sports event pay-per-view issues and funding for RTE. The Government has shown its support for having a strong <Col N="821" />national public service broadcaster by accepting the fundamental recommendations of the Forum on Broadcasting that RTE's role should be confirmed. The Government has also approved a substantial increase in funding for RTE to make sure it has the necessary funds to enable it to provide the type of service which the people expect and deserve. This fund is about &ldquo;additionality&rdquo;. It will build on what is already available to the audience, which is why there has been widespread support for the Bill.</P>
    <P>This debate has been worthwhile and welcome and I thank all those who have contributed in this session. As outlined earlier, the Bill is designed to provide the framework for the scheme which will be focused and will balance flexibility and <Col N="822" />accountability. It is important to ensure that public money is well spent and that the scheme can be relevant and effective in the long-term.</P>
    <P>The legislation is not complex and the main detail of this initiative will be the scheme itself. We have set reasonable parameters for the scheme, given it a specific annual allocation and we have set out clear parameters for accounts, reporting and regular reviews. I thank Deputies from all sides of the House for their contributions and I look forward to further debate and possible amendments on Committee Stage, when Deputies will again have an opportunity to have an input. I commend the Bill to the House.</P>

    <Title>Private Members' Business. - Local Government Funding: Motion (Resumed).</Title>
    <P>The following motion was moved by Deputy Allen on Tuesday, 25 November 2003:</P>
    <P Just="Center">That Dáil Eireann:</P>
    <P Just="Center">&ndash;&nbsp;noting that, since it took office, the Government has:</P>
    <P Just="Center">&ndash;&nbsp;abolished the first-time buyer's grant;</P>
    <P Just="Center">&ndash;&nbsp;raised VAT on house purchases;</P>
    <P Just="Center">&ndash;&nbsp;presided over a tripling in the price of houses; and</P>
    <P Just="Center">&ndash;&nbsp;allowed the numbers awaiting local authority housing to rise to 52,000 households, comprising over 100,000 individuals;</P>
    <P Just="Center">&ndash;&nbsp;condemns the failure of the Government to adequately fund local government which will force local authorities to set punitively high development levies which will result in higher prices for new homes, hinder the development of new business and damage the competitiveness of the economy.</P>
    <P Just="Center">Debate resumed on amendment No. 1:</P>
    <P Just="Center">To delete all words after &ldquo;Dáil Éireann&rdquo; and substitute the following:</P>
    <P Just="Center">&ldquo;&ndash;acknowledges the achievements of the Government in:</P>
    <P Just="Center">&ndash;&nbsp;increasing the resources provided to local authorities through the local government fund and through the buoyancy in their income from local sources due to the success of this Government's policies;</P>
    <P Just="Center">&ndash;&nbsp;ensuring that local authorities have adequate resources to service the land necessary for development, including industrial, commercial and housing developments;</P>
    <P Just="Center">&ndash;&nbsp;ensuring that the cost to the public purse of servicing land for private development is recouped in part from the persons developing that land;</P>
    <P Just="Center">&ndash;&nbsp;revising the long-standing system of levying development contributions to help fund local authority infrastructure to ensure it is implemented in a more transparent and consistent way across the country with a new role for the elected members of authorities in overseeing the system;</P>
    <P Just="Center">&ndash;&nbsp;focusing on increasing housing supply as the key response to the broad range of housing needs and demand;</P>
    <P Just="Center">&ndash;&nbsp;supporting record levels of housing output since 1997 with the prospect of a further record level of housing output being achieved in 2003;</P>
    <P Just="Center">&ndash;&nbsp;moderating the rate of house price increases;</P>

    <Speaker pid="MJNolan" hpid="Mr. Nolan Mr. Nolan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Nolan</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to share time with Deputies O'Connor, Batt O'Keeffe and Sean Power.</P>
      <P>Last year was the eighth year of record housing output with almost 57,700 completions nationally, an increase of almost 10% on the figure for 2001, during which 52,600 units were completed, also a record. Housing output in Dublin also reached record levels last year, with more than 12,500 units built, an increase of 30% on the 2001 figure. More than 29,600 houses were completed nationally in the first six months of this year and all the indicators are there will be record housing output again in 2003.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government has consistently stated supply is the key to addressing the high cost of housing and its focus has been on investing in infrastructure, that is, the provision of water and sewerage facilities, and to ensure the effective use of more serviced land through residential density guidelines. These policies are having positive effects. Since 1997, more than 280,000 houses have been built nationally. House prices were increasing at <Col N="825" />up to 40% annually until 1998 but, thankfully, the rate of increase has reduced substantially in recent years. The Government's focus will be on maintaining a strong supply of houses to meet the high demand and moderating the rate of increase in house prices to bring the housing market back to normal.</P>
    <P>The greatest problem facing young people is securing a mortgage to purchase a house. Four years ago it was estimated 500,000 new units would need to be completed to meet housing demand between then and 2010. The Government enacted Part 5 of the Planning and Development Bill 2000 which was later amended by the Planning and Development (Amendment) Act 2002 to assist in the provision of social and affordable housing. The effects are only now coming on stream and many local authorities will, over the coming months, reap the benefits of the provision which developers lobbied to have removed from the legislation but I am pleased the Minister at the time insisted on its inclusion. While we must wait to witness its merits, many local authorities will reap the benefits. My local authority, Carlow County Council, will open two major developments next month under Part 5, which is welcome.</P>
    <P>The number of households whose needs are met though the various social and affordable housing measures has increased by almost 50% since 1998. Local authority housing output is at its highest level in 15 years and record output is expected by the voluntary and co-operative housing sectors this year. The Government is addressing the needs of existing tenants in run-down estates through regeneration and remedial schemes. It is important that we do not make the mistakes of the 1960s and 1970s when thousands of low costs houses were constructed and costly remedial works had be carried out on the schemes in the mid-1980s. Some remedial works were more costly than the original housing.</P>
    <P>Much criticism was foisted on the Government when the first-time buyer's grant was abolished more than a year ago but it is generally accepted the abolition of the grant was a positive move because, if it had been index-linked from its inception, it would be worth between &euro;12,000 and &euro;15,000 per house today. The Government is to be commended for making major tracts of State land available in counties Dublin, Kildare and Meath for affordable housing and I hope more will be made available in other counties where suitable land is identified among the State's resources.</P>
    <P>Since the homeless strategy was launched in 2000, the quality and range of services provided for homeless persons has improved. Funding to local authorities for the provision of accommodation and related services for homeless persons increased by &euro;12.5 million in 1999 and was increased to &euro;50 million in 2003.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieOConnorFF" hpid="Mr. O'Connor Mr. O'Connor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Connor</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad to have the opportunity to contribute to this Private Members' <Col N="826" />debate. I have availed of Private Members' Business on a number of occasions to make a contribution as it is important that Members should take the opportunity to discuss the issues of the day. I thank Fine Gael for tabling this motion, although that is as much support as the party will get. Deputy English has been sent to the House to mark the rest of us and I do not want him to draw me out because I want to be kind to him.</P>
      <P>The public thinks criticism of the Government's policy on housing is hypocritical. Our job is to represent the needs of our constituents. I could refer to the contribution made by Deputy Timmins on the first-time buyer's grant but I would like to be positive, particularly about my constituency. I live in Tallaght and, until recently, was a member of South Dublin County Council. I was first elected to Dublin City Council in 1991 and, under the legislation to reorganise local government in 1994, became a member of the SDCC.</P>
      <P>Local authority housing will never be perfect. I conduct seven clinics a week in Tallaght, Firhouse, Templeogue and Greenhills and receive many inquiries regarding housing. These involve people seeking local authority housing or help to address anti-social behaviour on housing estates or other matters under the housing remit. It is important that the people concerned should be supported.</P>
      <P>I refer to the achievements of the SDCC and the efforts it is making in respect of the housing programme. I applaud the progressive refurbishment programme in which it is engaged with the assistance of the Department. It involves three estates in south Dublin, including Cushlawn, which is part of the Killinarden Estate in Tallaght. The local community welcomes such programmes. I was raised on a local authority estate in Crumlin and over the years, even before I became interested in politics, I was aware of the need for Dublin Corporation to look after the houses and tenants. I am glad the Department is funding this programme in Tallaght. The more funding that can be provided for such programmes the better. A great deal of housing stock in Dublin county and Tallaght needs to be refurbished for which as much funding as possible should be sought. In Tallaght, we have a multi-annual construction which I believe is delivering first-class housing across a range of options. It is very important to support programmes at local authority level to deal with housing issues. The skyline of Tallaght is dominated by cranes, as is also the case in other areas around the country, indicating the delivery of quality housing programmes.</P>

      <P>I appreciate the protection of the Chair. On the housing programme, I welcome the recent opening of the exchange building in Tallaght. That is a very progressive and innovative development, whereby accommodation is being provided by the St. John of God service for people with disabilities in conjunction with normal housing. A new project which is about to open at The Square has a mix of apartments, shops and leisure facilities. I am glad there are so many significant developments taking place in my constituency, with further projects coming on stream.</P>
      <P>In the Jobstown area, the county council is in partnership with a number of agencies in the Russell Square development. In that regard, I wish to make an appeal to the Minister, to whom I ask the Minister of State, Deputy Tim O'Malley, to convey my views. We need to progress that particular project and to give final approval to the voluntary housing agencies who wish to develop their facilities.</P>
      <P>I applaud the Government's efforts with regard to social and affordable housing, which I hope will be supported by everybody. Many families looking to such programmes for quality housing deserve our support. I support the Government amendment which is before the House.</P>

      <P>Those from the Fine Gael side who question what this Fianna Fáil-led Government has done and compare it with what Fine Gael did during its time in Government will find there is no comparison. They are really in the ha'penny place. Since 1997, Fianna Fáil has succeeded in having 287,000 houses built. We have supported regularly increasing levels of output every year since 1997. The Royal Institute of <Col N="828" />Chartered Surveyors, which would not be regarded as great friends of Fianna Fáil, said:</P>
      <P>The strength and extent of the property boom since the mid-1990s in Ireland can be seen in the fact that, between 1994 and 2001, around 320,000 houses were built &ndash; an absolutely astonishing level of housing. . . . This continued growth so far confounded all the arguments put forward by the construction industry, which argued that private house construction would decline by up to 20% with the introduction of the requirement that developers set aside land for social and affordable housing. The actuality is that there has been absolute buoyancy in new housing, which has grown, in 2001, by 15%.</P>
      <P>All of us accept that housing is a vital concern for our people. From the very beginning, this Government recognised that as one of the issues which mattered most. This year's output of 62,000 houses was the highest <i>per capita</i>in Europe. Because a rented house should also be a real home, we have strengthened tenants' rights and ensured security of tenure. We have a strong social housing programme as part of our policy. Under the laws we introduced, developers can be required to provide, or contribute in kind, 20% of all new housing for social and affordable housing. We have broken new ground and made major tracts of land available in Dublin, Kildare and Deputy English's royal County Meath.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DamienEnglishFG" hpid="Mr. English Mr. English">
      <NameTxt>Mr. English</NameTxt>
      <P>Who is paying for that?</P>

    <Speaker pid="BattOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. B. O'Keeffe Mr. B. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>All that land is available for affordable housing and the Taoiseach has pledged that even more State land will be made available. Although the supply of housing is closer than ever to demand, I know that, for some, the dream of owning a house is difficult to achieve. We have delivered a very simple message that exorbitant prices for new houses are not sustainable and exorbitant profits are not acceptable. Developers who hoard land banks or slow development to increase prices will be dealt with decisively. Through laws requiring development to meet housing needs, or by other means, we will intervene when required to ensure there is a fair market.</P>
      <P>We accept that housing is an essential need. Land is a finite resource and the land of Ireland is for the people of Ireland &ndash; all the people of Ireland. That might be difficult for some people in Fine Gael, having regard to some of their statements in the past. This Government's tough stand on land speculation has already freed up thousands of sites and helped to increase the rate of new planning applications in Dublin by 40% this year alone. Since 1997, the Government has spent a great deal of time examining the housing market, although economists generally advise governments not to get involved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The normal economic solution to a shortage is to create supply, as we have done. Our initiatives <Col N="829" />have been hugely successful. In a good year, we build approximately 25,000 houses.</P>
    <P>The belated concern shown by the Fine Gael Party with regard to housing is, unfortunately, not credible. It is noteworthy that the proposed action plan by the outgoing rainbow Government in 1997 did not even mention housing. Between 1995 and 1997, when Fine Gael was the main player in Government, local authority housing output fell by 11%. The number of new local authority houses built or acquired annually during its term in office fell from 2,916 to 2,632.</P>
    <P>Alongside current positive developments in Dublin, there are still pockets of poverty and deprivation. A thriving capital city should not be a place where people are marginalised or denied an opportunity. That is the reason this Government has made a firm commitment to radical urban regeneration programmes in the inner city, which improves facilities for the general community. We have spent a huge amount of money in the inner city flat complexes under the remedial works programme. These include the Oliver Bond flats, Nicholas Street, Ross Road, Liberty House and Mary Aikenhead House.</P>
    <P>Major regeneration schemes have been ongoing, such as the redevelopment of Ballymun where 2,900 new low rise houses will be provided over the next six years. There has been the start of demolition there, which is a milestone for that area. It marks the beginning of a new era, which will include private and public housing. Ballyfermot has also developed. The same type of regeneration has begun in all other cities, be it Cork or Limerick.</P>
    <P>I want Members to take stock of the increase of 32.5% for the first quarter of 2003 and the same percentage increase in 2002 in the level of local authority housing output, including completions, acquisitions and regeneration projects. The housing sector continues to perform well with the number of completions continuing to increase. The overall priority of Government in this area is supply. That objective is being continually achieved with the result of moderation in the rate of house price increases. With the State land that is now becoming available, further supply will be possible. This is excellent news for affordable housing as it removes from house prices the high cost of land. Fianna Fáil has provided that political vision&mdash;</P>

      <P>I am sure the members of that party who were re-elected were devastated to lose so many of their colleagues. For the first few weeks and months they spent most of their time deliberating on how the electorate had been so cruel to them. They decided to elect a new leader and make a new beginning. However, it is obvious that party has not learnt the lessons the last general election should have taught it. After any election a party would set about developing new policies. It is obvious that the policies the Fine Gael Party had prior to the last election did not go down too well. Its members spent the first 12 months immediately after the election trying to re-run it but, as we all know, that cannot happen.</P>
      <P>Private Members' time is a wonderful opportunity for Opposition parties. A former member, Deputy Shatter, used it in a positive way on many occasions. It is unfortunate the Fine Gael Party has not taken a leaf out of his book. This motion specifically cites as a criticism of the Government the abolition of the first-time buyer's grant. It is signed by all members of the Fine Gael Party, the last name being that of Deputy Timmins.</P>
      <P>I will refer to two contributions that gentleman made. During debate on the Finance Bill on 28 February 2001 Deputy Timmins stated:</P>
      <P>My colleague called for the extension of the first-time buyers' grant which should be abolished. The grant was introduced in 1987 as a boost to the building trade, not house buyers. The grant was increased to £2,000 in 1993 and it could be in the region of £10,000 to £15,000 now if it had been index linked. The grant does not benefit anyone. Two thirds of first-time buyers buy second hand houses. We should target all first-time buyers, not one third.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeymourCrawford" hpid="Mr. Crawford Mr. Crawford">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crawford</NameTxt>
      <P>I remind the Deputy of what was said about zero tolerance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanPower" hpid="Mr. S. Power Mr. S. Power">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Power</NameTxt>
      <P>To be consistent, a little over 18 months ago, the Deputy stated that if he was the Minister responsible for housing he would abolish the housing grant. He stated it is clear that the grant which is for first-time buyers goes straight to builders. He further stated that only about one third of first-time buyers are assisted in this way as about two thirds of them buy second-hand houses.</P>
      <P>That Deputy has the cheek to put his name to this motion. Does he stand over the words he stated here on two previous occasions in the recent past or will he do as he did in 2001 when he did not take part in the vote on the Finance Bill? We will know soon enough.</P>
      <P>For any party to have credibility it must have some consistency in the policies it puts forward. There is no point in singing one song now and a different one next week.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Power</NameTxt>
      <P>Housing is a vital concern for all of us. Few issues have been given as much attention by any Government as the current one. I will not stand here and pretend that our handling of the issue has been perfect but we have made an honest effort to deal with it. On the one hand there has been a major increase in prices and the difficulty many couples face in trying to buy their first house and, on the other, there has been an increase in the numbers looking for local authority housing.</P>
      <P>The Government took a number of measures to deal with this situation. One step, which was reluctantly taken, was to try to interfere with supply and demand in the market, and it certainly paid dividends, but our record is a good one. As Deputy Batt O'Keeffe said, this year we will have built more than 62,000 houses, the highest output <i>per capita</i> in Europe. Over the past number of years we have been building, on average, more than 50,000 per year and we have reached the stage where supply and demand will be more or less the same. That is something any Government would hope to achieve.</P>
      <P>There has also been the introduction of the Residential Tenancies Bill which will strengthen the rights of tenants. For too long many landlords were only interested in what they could get from their tenants rather than providing them with proper accommodation.</P>
      <P>As a public representatives, we all deal with people who are desperately in need of local authority housing. I appeal to the Minister to examine a situation that currently exists. I refer to the length of time it takes for a house to be re-allocated, from the time the keys are handed back until a new tenant takes occupancy of the house. The Minister should conduct a survey of local authorities to determine the difference between the best and the worst in this regard. I believe the difference would be substantial. It is important that the system used by local authorities which are doing the job should become the policy of all other local authorities. It is heartbreaking to see so many houses unoccupied, with little or no work to be done to bring them up to an acceptable standard for reallocation. I am aware there can be a difficulty in getting carpenters or electricians to carry out certain works but the length of time some local authorities take in reallocating houses leaves a lot to be desired. It would be to the benefit of all if the matter could be examined and a proper policy put in place and implemented in every local authority, not only in some.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Local authorities throughout the country are reviewing levies. I ask county councils to examine those not only in terms of a source of income. It is vital that we encourage activity in rural Ireland. Too many areas throughout the country, which <Col N="832" />were once vibrant, have died and it would take very little to reactivate those areas. It is important that we learn that lesson and not allow a similar fate befall villages that are currently vibrant. There is an ignorance of the will of people and the love they have for living in rural areas. Recently, the committee on the environment invited seven different groups to make presentations on rural housing. The huge difference in opinion on this issue between the organisations was obvious at those meetings. However, I was heartened that the committee easily put together a report with recommendations.</P>
    <P>I understand the Minister has agreed to publish new guidelines on one-off rural housing. The environment committee wrote to each of the local authorities inquiring about plans for dealing with one-off housing under the county development plan. Only half the local authorities bothered to reply.</P>

      <P>I support this motion on the inadequacy of local government funding and the housing crisis. The inadequate funding of local government forced a majority of the members of Dublin City Council &ndash; although I resisted it &ndash; into introducing a bin tax. The Dublin Anti-Bin Tax Campaign recently obtained information through a FOI request&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gregory</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Power should listen to this interesting information. I am sick to death of listening to the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Cullen, and Dublin City Manager, Mr. Fitzgerald, on the airwaves where they cannot be challenged, stating that 80% of households in the Dublin City Council area are compliant with the bin charges and <Col N="833" />that the majority of people welcome the opportunity to pay this new stealth tax.</P>
      <P>The Dublin Anti-Bin Tax Campaign recently obtained information through a FOI request when even I could not as a member of the city council. The information states that of 164,136 households in the Dublin City Council area, so far only 48,927 have paid the charges in full. While my maths were never good at school, even I can work out that this comes to 30% of households. It does not correspond to the Minister's or Dublin City Manager's figure of in excess of 80%.</P>
      <P>Of the remainder, 30,000 households have paid nothing. That is what people think of the Government's inadequate funding of local authorities. In addition, a further 45,709 have only paid a small amount of the overall three year charges. This means that of the 164,136 households, 75,709 have paid nothing in bin charges for this year. This House, as well as those who watch RTE, have been misled time and again by the Minister, Deputy Cullen.</P>
      <P>I support the motion put forward by Fine Gael. I do not care who puts it forward because it is the content that counts. If members of Fianna Fáil want to ignore the outrage of the people at the appalling price of houses and the inaccessible costs to the vast majority of people, they do so at their peril. They will find that out at the local elections next year. Time and again on Private Members' Business, the Opposition has drawn attention to this crisis, yet the Government will not take the radical action necessary to deal with the problem.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Healy</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the motion and I wish to draw attention to recent cutbacks in the rent supplement scheme. It appears that the Minister for Social and Family Affairs, Deputy Coughlan, has drawn her red biro through this scheme without any reflection on what the results may be for the individuals concerned. How are those who availed of this scheme to obtain housing accommodation in the future? It appears that the Minister, Deputy Coughlan, was simply instructed by the Minister for Finance to cut &euro;58 million from the social welfare budget and this was the most convenient scheme to abolish to achieve this.</P>
      <P>I work with the Cuan Saor group which supports women who have suffered domestic violence. The effect of the abolition of the rent supplement scheme will be astonishing for them. In future, women abused by their partners who leave the family home with their children will now find they cannot avail of the rent subsidy unless they have been renting for the previous six months. They now find themselves condemned to stay with the violent partner or in refuges. The whole support system for women and children in these violent situations has been undermined by the Minister. Has the Minister even thought of the consequences of the decision she has made?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Can the Minister inform us what proposals are in place for those who become homeless? The <Col N="834" />Government accepts that 5,500 people are homeless. Will they be dealt with? What instructions have been given to local authorities? Local authorities normally provided temporary accommodation to homeless persons, while private rented accommodation was subsidised by the rent supplement payable by the health board. What will happen to those who have not rented for the previous six months? Will they remain on the streets in doorways? Has the Minister fully thought out the consequences of abolishing this scheme? I ask the Minister to reverse the abolition of the scheme which supports poor people in difficult circumstances.</P>

      <P>Reform of local government has been promoted by the Government for some time. However, the only legacy of this programme is more layers of bureaucracy at local level government level, with not one iota of improved efficiency or an attempt to bring about an equitable system of financing local authorities. The Government amendment to the Fine Gael motion refers to the fact that, among other things, this new system gives a new role for the elected members of authorities in overseeing the system. This is rubbish. The only role local authority members have in the area of development levies is to rubber stamp the proposals put forward by officials or at best make some small face-saving adjustments at the edges. Any local authority, which does not put a levy scheme in place, will be rapped on the knuckles by the Minister and will be penalised financially.</P>
      <P>The only new role for councillors under the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government is to become accustomed to being continually undermined and overruled if they do not do the bidding of the Government, as can be witnessed by the action of the Minister by including in the Protection of the Environment Act a provision to give precedence to that Act over county development plans in a direct action to frustrate the wishes of Galway County Council, which had sought to protect the public from the hazards associated with landfills. The same fate awaits local authorities that fail to implement a development levy scheme. Their funding from central Government will be reduced in a display of might by the Government.</P>
      <P>If the expanded and increased development levies were to be funded solely by the developer, I would support the Government wholeheartedly. However this is not the case. Those levies will hit and hurt the young people throughout this country who are starting to put the money together to buy a house or have a house built on their own sites. The levies will put the ambition of owning a home of their own beyond the reach of many young couples.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There seems to be an agenda to create the false impression that those development levies are a tax on developers only or at least that the burden of the levies will be borne by the developer. How innocent can those politicians be who peddle this <Col N="835" />line? Do they think the electorate is stupid and will accept that line?</P>
    <P>How can people be so naive to believe that a developer whose main aim is to make profit will carry the burden of the charges? The levies will hit young couples, not the developer. Based on his speech of last night, the Minister of State, Deputy Noel Ahem, pretends he expects the developer to carry the charges. If they hand on the costs to the purchasers the Minister of State has a remedy &ndash; I quote from his speech last night: &ldquo;Hard questions will have to be asked of the industry about its willingness to pass on costs.&rdquo;  I am sure today many multi-millionaire developers throughout the country are quaking in their boots because the Minister of State is threatening to ask them hard questions. If this were not so serious for young people it would be a good joke.</P>

      <P>I was barely out of short trousers when the Fianna Fáil Government abolished domestic rates in 1977. Ever since then, local government has been plagued by not having an adequate source of revenue, which has stifled the growth of local government. It has caused significant problems for local government in addressing the tumultuous changes that have swept Ireland in the intervening years. In particular it made it difficult for local government to adapt to the very rapid changes in the past ten years.</P>
      <P>In travelling around Europe I am often asked how local government operates in Ireland and what powers does it have. Sadly, the reply has to be that it has grossly inadequate powers compared to the rest of Europe and is grossly underfunded when compared to the systems in place elsewhere. We should not simply tinker at the edges of the problem, but should address the wider issues of local government finance. I do not see evidence of that in the recently proposed levy system.</P>
      <P>It is inequitable to fund local government projects that benefit all by simply levying a significant tax on new developments, just as I believe it is inequitable to provide social housing by taxing those who propose to build new developments. In so far as I find there is significant inequity in Part V of the Planning and Development Act 2000, it is also inequitable to grossly inflate the local government levies proposed for new developments. While we have had levies going back to 1 October 1964, the very dramatic increase in those levies as proposed in local authorities around the country represent a gross distortion of charges on a select few rather than on all in society.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="836" />We should consider more general changes in local government taxation. The Green Party believes we should consider site value taxation. In other words we should put a charge on lands that are zoned for development but remain undeveloped. We should particularly focus on large tracts of land that have been zoned for development in successive development plans but remain undeveloped. The Government should put up or shut up. If lands are zoned for development we should make sure they are used for development or else ensure the owner passes them on to somebody who will develop them. A significant tax on those lands would ensure that housing is brought on stream in local authority areas.</P>
    <P>Although we abolished domestic rates, we should reconsider introducing some form of taxation on private rented dwellings, second homes and zoned lands that are not being developed. Such taxation would be considerably more equitable than simply hammering the developers of new homes. We must widen the remit of taxation in this regard. Local authority taxation needs a significant rethink rather than just tinkering with the development levy system. The current changes do not go far enough. We should also consider local authority housing and I intend to expand on that at a future date.</P>

      <P>I support the motion in the name of the Fine Gael Deputies. Two weeks ago the Sinn Féin Members also used their Private Members' time for a debate on housing. In replying on that occasion and attempting to defend the disastrous housing record of the Government, the Minister of State, Deputy Noel Ahern, cited a range of measures, including the following in the course of his speech: &ldquo;Those unable to do so from their own resources would have access to social housing or income support to rent private housing.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Two days later the Minister for Social and Family Affairs introduced the now infamous attack on rent supplement, the very measure of which the Minister of State, Deputy Noel Ahern, had boasted 48 hours earlier. She said it was &ldquo;not a housing measure.&rdquo;  I make no apology for again putting on the record of the House the clear contradiction of the two Ministers' positions. I do so because when I asked the Taoiseach last week which of his Ministers was correct he refused to answer, and I still await that answer.</P>
      <P>In preparation for tonight's debate I read the Official Report of last night's debates. I could not believe my eyes when I saw yet another remarkable statement from the Minister of State, Deputy Noel Ahern. When speaking about the local authority development levies he said:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The main plank of the Opposition argument is that house prices will suffer a direct increase as a consequence of the new development contribution schemes. That is incorrect. . . If builders do hand on these costs, hard questions will have to be asked of the industry about its will<Col N="837" />ingness to pass on costs while maintaining its profits.</P>
    <P>These assertions are quite incredible.</P>
    <P>Everyone knows that all kinds of costs and charges are not only passed on to new home buyers by developers but are multiplied to ensure bloated profits. The Government has encouraged this massive inflation in the housing market which puts homes beyond the reach of even people on average income. The Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Noel Ahern, will now take on the builders. He said he would ask them hard questions and, as Deputy McHugh said, I am sure they are quaking in their boots.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State's assertion was even more remarkable than that. I looked at the Committee Stage debate on the Planning and Development Bill on 10 May 2000. The then Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Noel Dempsey, stated the following in regard to the development levies:</P>
    <P>The one thing we should not forget when speaking about development levies and so on and developers paying these levies is that it is those who buy the houses who pay these levies because they are passed on by the builders.</P>
    <P>Which Minister is right? Here is a second example of two Ministers giving totally contradictory positions on the vexed question of the failure of the Government to meet social housing needs.</P>
    <P>Local authorities throughout the Twenty-six counties are in the process of imposing those development levies in a manner which will hit new homeowners hard. These levies, when provided for in the Planning and Development Act 2000, were intended for the development of infrastructure such as roads, water services, public transport, open spaces and community facilities. The idea was that developers would share the burden of providing infrastructure with local authorities.</P>
    <P>The Fianna Fáil-Progressive Democrats Government has failed to supply sufficient social and affordable housing, failed to control house prices, abolished the first-time buyer's grant and it is now permitting this further fleecing of new home owners. The levies, as they are now being applied, represent an abuse of the planning laws. The levies, as provided for in the Planning and Development Act 2000, were never intended to be a tax on new housing and their application must be stringently opposed.</P>

      <P>Ireland is now the third most expensive country in the world after Japan and the Netherlands in terms of house purchase. Dub<Col N="838" />lin is the seventh most costly capital city for a two bedroom city centre flat after London, New York, Tokyo, Milan, Paris and Sydney. According to the <i>Irish Examiner,</i> the price of a home in the United States is 25% less than in Ireland. Local authorities are preparing to increase development levies, in some cases by up to 300%. This will increase the cost of new houses by up to 5%, that is, from &euro;5,000 to &euro;20,000, depending on where one buys a house.</P>
      <P>In a press release on 30 October, Deputy Allen said that the really crazy aspect of the levies was that there would be a huge difference between counties. For a new house in the Cork County Council area this would result in a charge of &euro;4,800 while in the south Tipperary County Council area it would be &euro;12,200. A similar press release by Deputy Timmins in November confirmed that under draft proposals put forward by the Wicklow county manager, a service levy of &euro;28,000 would apply for a house of 200 square metres.</P>
      <P>The levy will vary from place to place. In County Kerry, for example, levies which were non-existent some years ago have been substantially increased. The water levy has been increased to &euro;1,500 and the sewage levy has been increased to &euro;3,000. New levies have been added &ndash;&euro;1,200 for roads, and an amenity levy of &euro;750. While this is not as expensive as in some other counties, it is still a major imposition in a county that has the highest local authority rate in the country as well as the highest waste disposal charges.</P>
      <P>The Irish Home Builders Association placed an advertisement in today's paper pointing out that at present the Government's tax take from the average home is 41%. This is made up from taxes such as stamp duty at 9%, capital gains tax which is now 20%, income tax and PRSI, corporation tax of 12.5%, between 15% and 20% in lands transferable under Part 5 provisions and a VAT rate of 13.5%, which I understand is one of the highest in Europe.</P>
      <P>Last week, a councillor from the same party as the Minister introduced an emergency motion in Kerry County Council appealing to the Minister for Finance to reduce the VAT rate, which he claimed was the highest in Europe. The sale of a house with a value of &euro;250,000 will result in a gain of &euro;105,000 in tax returns for the Government. On the one hand the Exchequer gains &euro;6 billion from the housing market and on the other hand the Government is placing a further imposition on people to pay extra charges.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A major difficulty exists in the housing market. Some years ago people had to wait for a year to get a local authority house in Listowel but the waiting period is now six or seven years. Despite the recent substantial housing allocation there are now 350 people on the housing list in this small town. A crisis is looming and it will take a major effort from the Minister, with the support of the Government, to resolve it. Various Deputies were wheeled out to spin a story that everything is rosy <Col N="839" />but they cannot really feel confident because the exact opposite is the case.</P>

      <P>I support the Fine Gael motion. I give credit to the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Cullen, for one thing, namely, the funding he provided for Swan's Cross in County Monaghan, the source of many bad accidents and one serious fatality. The example of Swan's Cross proves that if a county council gets the funds it can use them efficiently, properly and on time. I thank the Minister for that funding and the management and staff of Monaghan County Council for doing a good job. I am afraid that is where my good wishes to the Minister end.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Crawford</NameTxt>
      <P>I believe in giving credit where it is due. House prices have increased dramatically in recent years. I heard of a house that was built seven years ago in Monaghan town for £87,000 which changed hands a few years later for £140,000 and again two years ago for £260,000. No doubt, it is worth more today. When referring to the large sums of money given to housing, one has to take into account inflation in the housing market during the same period. In Monaghan there are between 700 and 750 people on the local authority housing list.</P>
      <P>While the production of the Bacon reports cost the Government a great deal of money, their results cost the nation a great deal more. When the Government took Dr. Bacon's advice, people spent their money in Spain, France and elsewhere. The Taoiseach promised one-off housing when he was at a function in Sligo, but nothing has been done. He insisted to Deputy Cullen that local authorities which are strapped for money must produce better local government, benchmarking and accept further responsibilities. The only way they can pay for all this is to introduce new levies and other charges.</P>

It also said the new scheme provided for the levying of contributions on a wide range of items and outlined the costs involved. The levy will be &euro;3,250 for a small house.

      <P>Throughout the debate, Opposition Deputies have attempted to portray development contributions as a stealth tax which affects home purchasers, especially first-time buyers. Fine Gael has said the contribution will be used to replace Exchequer funding of local authorities. This is incorrect. The Minister of State with responsibility for housing, Deputy Noel Ahern, recorded the facts. Despite this, the Opposition continues to ignore them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My focus is on local government funding and the impact on house purchasers, which are two areas in which the Opposition has made allegations against the Government. The Opposition says it believes central government support for the local government sector has been in some way deficient in recent years. Deputies opposite have argued that this has had the effect of putting pressure on local authorities to increase develop<Col N="841" />ment contributions. If this is the best it can do in the face of the facts which have been recorded, the Opposition must have run out of steam.</P>
    <P>The facts are as follows. This country has seen a rapid and sustained rise in capital investment by central government in local authority services since Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats took office in 1997. In that year, the Estimate for capital investment in non-national roads was &euro;172 million. By 2003, the figure had risen to &euro;434 million. The extra funds from motor tax of &euro;43 million will be ring-fenced in this area next year. In fact, in 1997 the Exchequer contribution on the capital side was &euro;980 million whereas today it is &euro;3.15 billion.</P>

      <P>Charging development contributions allows local authorities to recoup a fraction of the cost to public funds of servicing land for private development. Without levies, servicing new land would become more difficult and an even greater burden would fall on the Exchequer. It would also mean even greater profits for builders.</P>
      <P>The development contribution scheme introduced in the 2000 Act is a new, better and more transparent way to determine development contributions. It is the job of elected members of local authorities to adopt schemes and to set the level of contributions. They will do so having regard to all the views and comments brought to their attention. Developers and builders are a powerful, well-resourced lobby and they have been to the fore on this issue. We should ask where their interests lie. Is it in the provision of proper infrastructure and community facilities in new residential areas or is it in their profit margins? Developers and builders talk about a levy on new home buyers, but this is a misrepresentation. Development levies have been in place since 1964 on all types of developments and they are charged to developers to make a small contribution to the servicing of new land for development.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We all know development contributions are necessary and have always been part of the system. This is why the Houses of the Oireachtas enacted the provisions of the Planning and Development Act 2000. We should not accept a one-sided and oppressive attempt to challenge the authority of the Legislature in this matter. I do not refer to my colleagues opposite in this regard. There is a place for legitimate and democratic debate around the quantum of development levies. That debate is taking place in council chambers. What we require from this process are balanced outcomes and conclusions which are in the public interest. We do not need one-sided <Col N="842" />positions supported by expensive propaganda and which favour only a small section of the community. I thank Deputies for the few minutes I had to speak. I have more to say.</P>

      <P>I must correct something Deputy Seán Power said when he spoke previously. I have little time for Deputies who come to the House to read prepared scripts and then leave without participating fully in the debate. I welcome the fact that the Minister has remained in the House. Deputy Seán Power castigated my colleague, Deputy Timmins, for a statement he made about first-time buyer's grants. The reason for that was because Deputy Timmins had exposed a proposal in Wicklow to impose charges of up to &euro;28,000 on planning permission sought after 11 March. Deputy Timmins's statement stung many on the Government benches.</P>
      <P>Deputy Seán Power failed to acknowledge that Deputy Timmins proposed an advance mortgage relief to replace the first-time buyer's grant. This measure would be more advantageous to first-time buyers, especially those purchasing second hand houses which were never covered in the previous grant scheme. That is the point Deputy Timmins made, but Deputy Power is not present to find that out.</P>

      <P>Our motion addresses the manner in which the Government is penalising young people. These are our sons and daughters who are trying to step onto the first rung of the housing ladder. The elderly, people living alone and people who seek the disabled person's grant constitute the most vulnerable section of our population and are also being penalised by the Government's action.</P>
      <P>The Minister of State, Deputy Noel Ahern, made great play of his contention that plenty of money was available. In reply I quote from a short letter dated 12 November 2003 from Galway City Council to a client in my constituency: &ldquo;I wish to advise you that due to the volume of applications and current financial constraints, your application cannot be processed at this time&rdquo;. The writer could not say when the applicant would hear from the council again. I deal with people who have spent two to three years on the waiting list for an essential repairs grant.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister of State, Deputy Noel Ahern, said many strange things which have been quoted in the debate. His contention about the availability of money is not true.

It contained substantial weaknesses. I do not know who writes his contributions, but I am sorry that an upright public representative like the Minister of State, Deputy Noel Ahern, must read speeches which are contrary to the facts. He said his Department had received a number of calls from distressed people who wondered if they would now have to pay a new charge. He said these people were amazed to hear that what they had read in the newspapers was distorted.</P>
      <P>What they have been reading about in the newspapers is right. New house purchasers or anybody who gets planning permission in my local authority area of Galway City from 11 March 2004 will pay a &euro;10,000 levy on their planning application, whether it is for an apartment, house or otherwise.

      <P>On 11 November, the Minister of State, Deputy Noel Ahern, said something which is worth quoting. Deputy Ó Caoláin cited some of it. The Minister of State said:</P>
      <P>Housing remains at the top of the Government's agenda. We have taken a wide range of measures over the course of our two terms in office to reduce house price inflation, increase housing output to match demand, remove infrastructural and planning constraints on residential developments.</P>
      <P>He went on to say the Government is doing everything to control inflation in regard to housing.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PadraicMcCormack" hpid="Mr. McCormack Mr. McCormack">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCormack</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government is doing the exact opposite and is doing everything to drive up the price of houses for hard-pressed people. Is that fair or justifiable?</P>
      <P>In Galway City, we are raising &euro;18 million to cover the Galway main sewerage and drainage scheme. It has been paid for long ago by the taxpayer out of central funds. The manager has said we must raise &euro;34 million over the next five years, that there will be 3,400 planning applications and that if we multiple them by &euro;10,000, we will get &euro;34 million. They are lovely sums.</P>

Is it fair that every new householder in Galway City over the next five years will pay for a sewerage scheme which I <Col N="846" />and the 25,000 householders in Galway City are already enjoying? It is absolutely ridiculous and the Minister does not have a leg on which to stand.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TomHayes" hpid="Mr. Hayes Mr. Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy McCormack for sharing his time. There are several aspects to this motion which are of major importance to the many young people anxious to build and live in their own houses. Indeed, many emigrants who were forced to emigrate in the late 1960s and 1970s would like to return home and build houses. Not since the foundation of the State has it been so difficult for a person to set up their own home. Average house prices are in excess of &euro;220,000. Since this Government came to power house prices have tripled. Because of the high price of houses, 42,000 people over 30 years of age still live with their parents and over 5,500 people are homeless. Surely that is a major embarrassment to every member of the Government.</P>
      <P>The abolition of the first-time buyer's grant was openly opposed by many of the Fianna Fáil backbenchers. The reality is that people building smaller houses will find this levy extremely difficult. In a survey of a local authority, only 7% of the applications before the planning authority were grant sized. Little will be saved in this regard. The levies are the most draconian ever introduced. It is the most unfair taxation ever levied on young people.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>This is an attack on young people. We are trying to get people homes. Every day young couples on &euro;40,000 or &euro;50,000 per annum come to my constituency office. They are trying to buy a site on which to build a house. How can the Minister let local authorities bring in more charges? A young business man in my constituency applied to Mayo County Council for planning permission. Six weeks after submitting the planning application, he got a telephone call to say the planners did not like the plan and that if he did not withdraw it, they would refuse it. He had spent thousands of euro getting the plan. He went back to the council with a new plan and was granted planning permission after a number of months negotiation. There are water service charges of &euro;16,109.50 and a charge of &euro;9,000 for amenities. That is &euro;25,000 before he puts a brick on his new house, plus the planning fees which he had to pay twice. There are already charges in <Col N="847" />place and what the Minister is doing is wrong. It is wrong to attack the young people of this country.</P>

      <P>Is foráil chaighdeánach é an fhoráil léiritheach seo, ina leagtar amach na sainmhinínithe atá in úsáid sa reachtaíocht, mar shampla an sainmhíniú ar &ldquo;feidhm&rdquo; atá faoi chaibidil ag an leasú seo. Dúirt an Teachta ar Chéim an Choiste go mbaineann an leasú seo le chursaí teangeolaíochta go bunúsach ós rud é go gcreideann sé nach féidir dualgas a chomhlíonadh. Tá an Teachta den tuairim gur féidir feidhm a chomhlíonadh, ach go mbaineann briathra eile le dualgas ar nós &ldquo;fulfilment&rdquo;, &ldquo;dischargement&rdquo; nó &ldquo;performance&rdquo;. Ar an lámh eile de, táim den tuairim go bhfuil &ldquo;carrying out&rdquo; níos oiriúnaí ná &ldquo;fulfilment&rdquo;, mar go bhfuil brí leanúnach á bhaint leis. Ní fiú dúinn dul go domhain isteach sa scéal seo má tá an lucht dlí á rá go bhfuil an sainmhíniú feiliúnach.</P>
      <P>Tá mise sásta de réir na comhairle atá agam gurb é an bealach caighdeánach an bealach lena dhéanamh. Mar eolas breise, is é an sainmhíniú céanna atá molta san Interpretations Bill 2000 atá ag dul fríd an Oireachtas i láthair na huaire. This is an argument about the meaning of words in law. I am advised that the Bill follows the Interpretation Bill 2000 and contains the proper legal formulation. I would not argue with good legal advice. Unfortunately, I am unable to accept the amendment.</P>

      <P>Bhí ceist againn tamaillín ó shin, agus ba mhaith liom an freagra a chloisint aríst. Níl daoine ag maireachtaint ar chuid de na hoileáin faoi láthair. Más rud é go dtarlaíonn athrú ansin, cad a tharlóidh, muna bhfuil sé luaite go háirithe?</P>

An gclúdaíonn sé an rud atá i gceist? An rud a deirtear linn ná go bhfuil brí ag an sainmhíniú seo san aimsir láithreach agus san aimsir fháistineach freisin &ndash; san am atá le teacht. Mar sin, ní féidir liom deimhniú don Teachta nach mbeidh an reachtaíocht teoranta do na hoileáin atá áirithe i láthair na huaire. Dá bhrí sin, níl gá leis an leasú.</P>
      <P> I fully accept the spirit of the Deputy's amendment. I have double-checked that I am not in any way, for the purposes of this Bill, constraining an island from becoming an island &ndash; for example, where there are no people living on the island at the moment. I am reassured that the Bill as it stands adequately provides for the future. Again, I am unable to accept the amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Éamon Ó Cuív</NameTxt>
      <P>I am reasonably satisfied that if land was cut off as a result of global warming we would build a bridge or find some other method of getting to the island. Traditionally, we have defined islands as tidal islands. While I would not like to give the Deputy an absolute assurance on that, it is my understanding that an island is as defined for the purposes of this Bill.</P>

      <P>Bhí díospóireacht againn mar gheall ar leasú Uimh. 4 ar Chéim an Choiste. I ndeireadh na dála, níl gá leis na focail &ldquo;dá rogha féin agus&rdquo;, mar tá an focal &ldquo;féadfaidh&rdquo; ann. Is é an chomhairle a fuair mé ná, dá mba rud é go bhfágaimid an t-alt seo mar atá, gur cheart beagnach gach Acht ó 1922 a leasú chun na focail &ldquo;dá rogha féin&rdquo; a chur isteach. Glacaim leis an méid a dúirt an tAire faoi obair na ndlíodóirí, ach mar a dúirt mé ar Chéim an Choiste, sin an chomhairle a fuair mise. Ba mhaith liom fáil amach anois an bhfuair an tAire aon chomhairle nua idir an dá linn.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonOCuiv" hpid="Éamon Ó Cuív Éamon Ó Cuív">
      <NameTxt>Éamon Ó Cuív</NameTxt>
      <P>Tá muid ag tógaint na dtrí alt le chéile. Baineann na leasuithe uilig le halt 2, áit a mbronntar cumhachtaí ar an Aire le haghaidh seirbhísí iompair a sholáthar le haghaidh oileán. Mar a miníodh go minic, bhí na cumhachtaí ginearálta seo ag an Aire cheana féin faoin Aran Islands Transport Act 1946 agus an Minister for Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands (Powers and Functions) Act 1998. An t-aon rud nua anseo ná an chumhacht chun foirdheontas a íoc le seirbhísí paisinéirí bus mar chuid de chonradh farantóireachta nó aeir. Caithfear cead an Aire Airgeadais a fháil agus i gcás de sheirbhísí bus, cead an Aire Iompair, mar a shonraítear faoi fho-alt (2). Maidir leis na leasuithe féin, baineann leasú Uimh. 4 leis an gcumhacht a tógadh ó alt 4 den Aran Islands Transport Act 1946. Mar a mhínigh mé cheana féin, tá an t-alt seo á aisghairm agus an chumhacht sin sa reachtaíocht atá idir lámhaibh. Gheall mé don Teachta go bpléifinn an leasú seo leis na saineolaithe dlí i gcomhthéacs na téarmaíochta is fearr do 2003 agus na blianta amach romhainn. Rinne mé amhlaidh, agus tá mé sásta cur in iúl go bhfuil mé ag glacadh leis an leasú ón Teachta sa gcás áirithe seo. Tá mé ag glacadh le leasú Uimh. 4.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Maidir le leasú Uimh. 5, creidim go bhfuil an reachtaíocht atá faoi chaibidil ag castáil rudaí seachas an pointe a threisiú maidir leis an ngá ceadú an Aire Airgeadais a fháil leis na seirbhísí iompair go dtí na hoileáin. Is éard atá i gceist anseo ná gur féidir leis an Aire, le cead an Aire Airgeadais, na feidhmeanna ag (<i>a</i>) agus (<i>b</i>) a dhéanamh foirdheontais a íoc agus maoiniú a dhéanamh. Cuirfidh an tAire na feidhmeanna sin i gcrích faoi réir téarmaí agus coinníollacha a <Col N="854" />chinnigh sé féin, aríst le toiliú an Aire Airgeadais. Tá mé sásta go dtugann an reachtaíocht mar atá sé dréachtaithe an léargas is soiléire den bhrí atá i gceist san fhoráil. Caithfidh mé a rá gur cineál ficsin a bheadh ann dá mbainfinn amach &ldquo;le toilú an Aire Airgeadais&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Taking out those words would be a kind of fiction because one cannot spend money without the permission of the Minister for Finance. I would also like to put on the record that I must seek sanction from the Minister for Finance at all times, but Deputies have not seen me stymied on too many occasions. This is not as big an issue as people try to make out. The Minister for Finance has a job to do and he does it well. There is a very quick turnaround regarding decisions on sensible proposals.</P>
    <P>Leagtar amach faoi leasú Uimh. 6, faoi fho-alt 2(2), nach féidir foirdheontas a íoc le seirbhís paisinéirí bus mar chuid de chonradh farantóireachta nó aeir gan ceadú an Aire Iompair dá leithéid agus do na téarmaí agus na coinníollacha a bhaineann leis. Mar a mhínigh mé ar Chéim an Choiste, titeann an phríomhfhreagracht maidir le cúrsaí iompair bus ar mo chomhleacaí, an tAire Iompair. Mar sin, ar mhaithe le comhsheasmhacht agus dea-chleachtas, níl sé ceart agus cóir go mbeadh ionchur aige sna téarmaí agus coinníollacha a bhaineann leis na seirbhísí bus mar atá mar chuid de chonradh farantóireachta nó aeir. Bheinn ar aon dul leis an Aire Iompair faoin riachtanas seirbhísí an Stáit a riarú ar an mbealach is éifeachtaí agus de réir polasaí atá comhordaithe gan aon codarsnacht i gceist. Is é an rud a theastaigh uainn ná joined-up Government.</P>
    <P>I am very keen, as we develop these services &ndash; we are speaking here about buses &ndash; that buses form part of a bigger bus service by operating piggy-back services in low population areas. A bus travelling from Magheroarty would join up with a bus carrying mainlanders and people from Tory Island, Inishbofin Island or Bunbeg. It would be foolish for a Minister not to try to fit such buses into the main transport framework of the State. All we are doing is enshrining that in law. When the Member reflects on that, he will see that it is not an unreasonable provision to force the Minister to consider it in the broader context. If a Minister could not secure agreement from his colleagues, it would be a bad day for good joined-up Government.</P>

Dá nglacfainn le leasuithe Uimh. 7 agus 9 ón Teachta O'Dowd, ní bheadh aon fheidhm ag an Aire san am seo amach romhainn, ach bheadh an gné siarghabhálach den fheidhm clúdaithe go maith. If I accepted amendments Nos. 7 and 9, it would not be good for the future, but it would be very good for the past. Mar a chéile leasú Uimh. 8 ón Teachta O'Shea. Is leagan caighdeánach agus dlíthiúil é an fhoirm leis seo chun feidhm reatha agus shiarghabhálach a bhronnadh, agus tá sé thar a bheith so-fheicthe. I am advised that it covers the past, present and future. After being given that legal advice, I went back and checked it thoroughly. Having done that, I must go with the advice. As Members can see, had it gone the other way when we checked it, we would be more than happy to accept the amendment. I will be opposing the three amendments.</P>

Tá mé sásta gur seo an bealach is oscailte agus is trédhearcaí chun a leithéid de chinneadh a thógáil in ionad ráta a cheangal síos ag gné amháin. Seo é an rud tábhachtach. Ceal aontaithe maidir leis an gcúiteamh cuí, déanfar é a chinntiú trí eadráin faoi réim agus de réir an Acquisititions of Land (Assessment of Compensation) Act 1919. D'ardaigh an Teachta ceist ar Chéim an Choiste maidir leis na costais a bhféadfadh titim ar dhuine a lorgaíonn eadráin faoin Acquisititions of Land (Assessment of Compensation) Act 1919. Tá forálacha cuimsitheacha maidir leis na costais seo leagtha amach in alt 5 den Acht sin. Leagtar amach cásanna difriúla agus na nósanna imeachta a bhfeadfadh a bheith i gceist, ach go bunúsach, tá discréid ag an eadránaí. Essentially the position is that the appeal is to the arbitrator, who has a very complicated and comprehensive set of rules under the Acquisititions of Land (Assessment of Compensation) Act 1919.</P>

      <P>While the Interpretation Act 1937 states that oaths include affirmation, it adds the rider that this is only for persons entitled, for the time being, to affirm. Therefore, there must be a pre-existing entitlement in regard to affirmation. The major such entitlement is the Oaths Act 1888, which allows affirmation in proceedings in certain cases. This presumably means legal proceedings. Therefore, there is ambiguity as to whether this covers something such as a public inquiry and my legal advice is that this amendment is appropriate to make certain that affirmation is allowed at the public inquiries which may arise under this Act.</P>

Tá seo clúdaithe faoin sainmhíniú ar mhionn san Acht Léiriúcháin 1937: &ldquo;The word &ldquo;oath&rdquo; in the case of persons, for the time being, being allowed by law to affirm instead of swearing includes affirmation&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Anuas ar sin tá foráil san Oaths Act 188 a rinne an Teachta tagairt di:</P>
      <P>Every person, upon objecting to be sworn and stating as a ground for such objection, either that he has no religious belief or that the taking of an oath is contrary to his religious belief, shall be permitted to make his solemn affirmation instead of taking an oath in all places and for all purposes where an oath is or shall be required by law.</P>

I have checked again and I am told that what the Deputy seeks is in the Act. All one needs to say is that the oath is against one's religious belief, or that one has no religious belief, and one can affirm. I agree with the Deputy that such a provision should be contained in the Act. I am told it is there.</P>

      <P>I understand the Deputy seeks a consolidation of the legislation which has gone before.

    <Speaker pid="SeamusHealy" hpid="Mr. Healy Mr. Healy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Healy</NameTxt>
      <P>The question of decentralisation is extremely vexed and has become a festering sore. While l am disappointed that the Minister is not present to respond to this debate, I have some sense of satisfaction that the Minister of State, Deputy Brian Lenihan, is present. The Minister of State promised the delivery of decentralisation during the course of a by-election in south Tipperary in June 2001.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan" hpid="Mr. B. Lenihan Mr. B. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not correct. I never did that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusHealy" hpid="Mr. Healy Mr. Healy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Healy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister of State made that promise. Since the Government came to power in 1997, various promises have been made, including during the 2000 and 2001 by-elections in south Tipperary and again last year. Announcements have been made for the past six years but each delivery date has been allowed to pass. The issue of decentralisation appears to have been forgotten, deliberately I imagine.</P>
      <P>The case for decentralisation, not just for towns in south Tipperary but also for other towns and in terms of the benefits it would have for Dublin, has long since been made. South Tipperary has not benefited from decentralisation, despite that 5,000 jobs have already been decentralised and that it is proposed to decentralise a further 10,000. South Tipperary is the only area in Munster without a decentralised Department.</P>
      <P>There are two towns in south Tipperary, Tipperary town and Carrick-on-Suir, which are crying out for decentralisation. Both have RAPID status due to the fact that they are two of the most deprived towns in the country. There have been successive company closures in both towns. In Carrick-on-Suir, Irish Leathers and, more recently, Schiesser International have closed, while in Tipperary town, Tambrands, Kiely's, 7-Up and, more recently, Pall Ireland Limited have closed. Both towns have done trojan work on a voluntary basis, and major financial contributions have been collected for local projects to raise their profiles and make them attractive in terms of decentralisation. There are full educational facilities in both towns and there is easy access to third level education, sporting facilities, etc.</P>
      <P>Decentralisation of Departments out of Dublin would be of benefit because the city is already overdeveloped. It would also ease the position <i>vis-à-vis</i> the high price of houses, traffic congestion and the difficulties people experience in travelling to work.</P>
      <P>As already stated, the case for decentralisation has been well made. I hope that the Minister of State will have something tangible to say and will not merely repeat the reply to a parliamentary question I tabled on 6 November, which went as follows:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="862" />The Government remains firmly committed to moving forward the progressive decentralisation of Government offices and agencies. As I have said on many occasions, the process of reaching a decision on such a major initiative requires careful consideration of a wide range of important issues. This deliberative process is ongoing and I am not able to state at this time when the Government will be in a position to take a final decision on the matter. The Deputy will appreciate that pending such a decision, I am not in a position to say when the decentralisation programme will start or how long it will take to implement. However, the Deputy may be assured that the submissions and representations which have been made will be taken into account as part of the deliberative process</P>
    <P>I hope the reply to this debate will not be a rehash of that supplied on 6 November and that we will be given some definite answers in respect of decentralisation. If the Government has abandoned decentralisation, perhaps the Minister of State will indicate that fact.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. B. Lenihan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I make this reply on behalf of the Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, and I fear that the reply may disappoint the Deputy. However, I assure him that the Government is fully committed to decentralisation and that it remains an element of settled policy. I appreciate the keen interest in decentralisation, both inside and outside the Houses of the Oireachtas.</P>
      <P>The Government's commitment to introducing a new programme of decentralisation has been copper-fastened by its inclusion in An Agreed Programme for Government. The matter of decentralisation is identified and agreed upon in the programme for Government&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;and, therefore, is a priority of the Government which, as the Deputy is well aware, has a term of office within which to fulfil its mandate and complete its undertakings.</P>
      <P>We have undertaken to move forward the progressive decentralisation of Government offices and agencies. The commitment in the programme for Government requires us to take into account the national spatial strategy, which is aimed at ensuring that all regions develop to their potential.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It has been clear from the outset, and something that I know the Minister for Finance has reiterated in this House on many occasions in reply to parliamentary questions, that there is a wide range of important issues which must be taken into consideration before arriving at a decision. As the Minister has frequently made clear, it cannot be as simple as identifying a set of criteria on the basis of which all decisions relat<Col N="863" />ing to a new programme of decentralisation can be taken.</P>
    <P>As with the previous programme of decentralisation, which made such a significant contribution to so many communities throughout the country, a new programme of decentralisation has the potential to act as a tremendous economic catalyst, with the Government leading the way and proving the capability of delivering public services effectively from locations outside Dublin. One would hope that the private sector would follow the public sector as it reduces its dependence on locating in the capital city. We would then begin to see increased evidence of balanced regional development, something which is not only desirable but essential.</P>
    <P>I agree with the Deputy that it would have been preferable if a decision on a new programme could have been made sooner but, given the level of interest in the issue and the many and varied matters involved, it has taken longer than had been originally anticipated. In light of its importance, complexity and great significance, I trust the Deputy will agree that it has been appropriate for the Government to afford this matter a high level of consideration before reaching a final decision.</P>
    <P>As Deputies will be aware, more than 130 urban centres have expressed interest in being part of the new programme. In that regard, the case for the inclusion of south Tipperary has been well articulated. I again assure the Deputy and other Members that all the submissions and representations on behalf of all towns received by the Department of Finance will be given full consideration as part of the decision-making process.</P>
    <P>The Government is determined that, as with the previous programme, a new programme should have regard to the desire to promote regional development, economic growth and the creation of a more even spread of public service jobs. It is equally concerned to ensure that decentralisation should not compromise the efficient delivery of public services.</P>
    <P>Decentralisation is, as much as anything else, a quality of life issue. People are increasingly undertaking longer commutes to get to and from work. In the longer term, this is not sustainable. Decentralisation offers the opportunity to do something about this by bringing work and home closer together.</P>
    <P>I reiterate that the Government is seriously committed to developing a coherent and comprehensive programme. I thank Deputy Healy for raising this important issue, thereby giving me the opportunity to restate the Government's position.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dowd</NameTxt>
      <P>I call on the Minister for Health and Children to institute an immediate public sworn inquiry into all aspects of the Dr. Neary affair and the serious implications that has for the delivery of health services in Ireland. I have lived <Col N="864" />in Drogheda most of my life and know many people who have worked at Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital. The women who were operated on by Dr. Neary, in particular, experienced major trauma. The staff of the hospital have done a fantastic job, despite the appalling events which took place in the midst of all the good work.</P>
      <P>It took four and a half years for the Medical Council to report on what happened. That is unacceptable and should not be tolerated in future inquiries. There is a need for the Minister to address that issue. The women involved need closure on this affair, which has gone on for many years. Their lives have been shattered by what has happened. The Minister must reflect on whether the inquiry should be sworn and held in public. I refer to the comments of Mr. Justice Finnegan in the High Court when the matter came before him. He stated:</P>
      <P>The evidence that the Medical Council presented disclosed a series of profound errors of judgment on Dr. Neary's part with serious consequences for each of his patients. . . It is found that a regrettable absence of insight and objectivity and non-existence of any mechanism either within the hospital or elsewhere to ensure that such errors as occurred might be corrected or that a pattern of adverse or unusual outcomes should be properly monitored.</P>
      <P>I welcome the Minister's announcement that Ms Justice Harding Clark has been appointed to chair the inquiry. These issues must be addressed for the greater good. The traditional hierarchical power of the surgeon to supersede all the important mechanisms and checks and balances in the administration of the health system must be addressed. That is the kernel of what I seek.</P>
      <P>Tribunals and other investigations have been a great failure, including shattering cases which were taken to the inquiry into sexual abuse recently. Last weekend the Minister for Health and Children was attacked by a judge in regard to another tribunal with which people were deeply unhappy. It is important that the Minister and the Government should get this inquiry right. The State cannot afford to mess this up. There must be total clarity about what the Minister is doing and total transparency in the investigation process. The public should have the right to know what is going on at every stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The women who were affected would like to tell their stories in public so that the truth can come out. They do not wish to pillory individuals in the hospital nor do they have a vendetta against them. That issue was addressed in the judgment of the Medical Council. However, they feel doctors, nurses and other staff should give evidence in public without the disclosure of their identities. These women want transparency, they want to get at the truth and, above all, they want to make sure this never happens again. The Minister and the Government have a duty of care, given their knowledge of what went wrong and <Col N="865" />the horrors involved. The inquiry must be totally transparent and open. The bottom line is the women involved must have closure and this must never happen again.</P>

      <P>I thank the Deputy for raising this most important issue. As he represents the Louth constituency, this issue affects him but it also has far-reaching implications for the nation generally. I am replying on behalf of my colleague, the Minister for Health and Children. I am glad to clarify the latest position regarding the forthcoming inquiry into the issues raised by the report of the Medical Council into the practice of Dr. Michael Neary. The need for a further inquiry is accepted in light of the findings of the council. The Minister received a copy of the council's report following a fitness to practise inquiry into the professional conduct of Dr. Neary on 29 July 2003.</P>
      <P>The Medical Council found Dr. Neary guilty of professional misconduct in regard to his treatment of ten patients and erased his name from the register of medical practitioners. The Minister met the council on 2 September 2003 to discuss the implications of its report. On 23 September 2003 the Minister met representatives from the Patient Focus group and listened carefully to the case histories of a number of the patients concerned. He stated publicly at the time that the Medical Council report was a dreadful indictment of the treatment of the women concerned. He reiterated his shock and concern at the findings of the council's investigation.</P>
      <P>The Minister again met Patient Focus on 23 October 2003. He advised the group about progress in establishing the inquiry. The Deputy will be aware that the Minister had a further meeting with Patient Focus yesterday, during which he informed the group that Ms Justice Maureen Harding Clark had been selected to chair an inquiry into the issues raised by the Medical Council's report. We are grateful to Ms Justice Harding Clark for undertaking this difficult task. She had a most distinguished career as a senior counsel with an extensive criminal practice at the Bar and she currently serves as a judge at the International Criminal Court. She brings impeccable credentials to her task of inquiring into these difficult issues.</P>
      <P>The format of the inquiry and its terms of reference are the subject of discussions between the Department and the Office of the Attorney General. The Minister expects to bring detailed recommendations before Cabinet shortly. He has outlined his concerns about this matter to his colleagues in Government. He will continue to liaise with Patient Focus on progress in this regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Since December 1998 a significant number of service and care and quality initiatives have been introduced by the North Eastern Health Board in the maternity unit at Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital. These initiatives were drawn up in consultation with eternal risk management advisers. In addition, in September 2003, the board's exter<Col N="866" />nal risk advisers were asked to undertake an independent assessment of the current measures in place at the unit. This is designed to ensure the service provided at the unit conforms to the highest international standards. The report of the board's advisers was published on 25 October 2003.</P>
    <P>The review team found considerable progress has been made by the department of obstetrics and gynaecology and, in particular, genuine efforts have been made by the consultant, midwifery, nursing and management staff to improve the quality and safety of patient care. It also found that much work is in progress to comply fully with the previous recommendations made by the risk advisers to achieve the levels of quality and patient safety required.</P>
    <P>I would like to update the House on the progress made in preparing new medical practitioners legislation. The Department has undertaken a thorough review over the past two years of the Medical Practitioners Act 1978. This review has involved widespread consultation with key stakeholders in the public health service. The views of patients, doctors, the Medical Council, health service agencies, training bodies and medical representative organisations have been obtained. The information contained in these submissions has contributed to the draft proposals that will be contained in a new medical practitioners (amendment) Bill. Preparation of the draft heads is at an advanced stage. I intend that they will be brought before Cabinet shortly.</P>
    <P>The findings of the recent fitness to practise inquiry by the Medical Council will be taken fully into account in the proposals that will be put to Cabinet. Relevant issues regarding this case that will be incorporated in the preparation of the new amendment Bill include greater public interest representation to improve transparency and accountability, various enhanced fitness to practise measures and the urgent introduction and development of competence assurance.</P>
    <P>The Minister has accepted the need for an inquiry into the wider issues arising from the Medical Council's report and I assure the House that the final details in this regard are being progressed as a matter of priority. The Minister will meet Patient Focus again in the coming weeks and will keep the group apprised of progress.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnMcGuinness" hpid="Mr. McGuinness Mr. McGuinness">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGuinness</NameTxt>
      <P>The issue of missing persons is one in which I have taken an interest since 1996, based on the disappearance of Jo Jo Dollard from the Callan, County Kilkenny, area of my constituency. It is not an issue which is confined to a small number of people. Naturally, the families concerned are the ones dealing with this situation on a day-to-day basis, suffering endless trauma and sadness because they have not found the missing persons or their bodies. It also affects the extended families and there is huge public interest in this issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="867" />I draw the attention of the Minister of State to the recent launch of a new crime magazine which has proven to be a huge success. Its first issue focused on the issue of missing persons. At a recent book launch of a publication entitled Searching, written by Valerie Cox, which outlined all of the issues concerning this matter and dealt with the number of people who have gone missing, 5,000 copies of that book were recorded as sold at or before the launch. That confirms the huge public interest in the matter. In my constituency, a monument has been erected in Kilkenny Castle to remind people of this issue. The attendants at the castle will confirm that there is great interest in that monument, as borne out by the number of messages and other tokens which are left in the vicinity to highlight the issue and support the families affected.</P>
    <P>By comparison, the inaction of the State is a matter of concern. It took a visit by the family of Jo Jo Dollard to New York and Washington to highlight what is best practice there as a basis for a request to the Garda Commissioner and the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to take an active interest in this issue by initiating a training programme in this regard for some of the younger members of the Garda. It is possible to avail of the Jerry McCabe Foundation in New York or the National Centre for Missing and Exploited Children, located near Washington, which are more than willing to help with computer software and training at little or no cost.</P>
    <P>I understand the Garda has recently decided to participate in this &ndash; but only because Mary Phelan and the Dollard family brought this to its attention. It took 18 months to get agreement from the Garda to participate in a website covering 13 other countries. I pose the question as to whether the authorities will learn from what happened in Soham and what is best practice in the UK. Will they take on board the excellent work undertaken by Hillary Clinton in the United States and begin to discuss with all of those agencies and individuals a possible model of best practice for this country?</P>
    <P>I appreciate that not every system used abroad can be applied here. However, it should be possible to take the case of Jo Jo Dollard as a starting point for developing new concepts, technology and training for a young police force. That model should be used with a view to establishing what can be achieved in this country. In many other jurisdictions, there is an ongoing system in place to remind the public of what a person who went missing some years ago might look like at present. That is not being done in this country. No effort is being made through organisations, schools, or Garda stations throughout the country as a reminder of the 35 to 45 people currently listed as missing in Ireland. Little or no effort is being made in that regard.</P>
    <P>A campaign is currently under way to have the helpline kept in place and funded. It costs approximately &euro;40,000 to &euro;50,000 per year and <Col N="868" />even that is under threat &ndash; I understand it is being reviewed. I ask the Minister of State and the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to take on board the concerns which have been expressed, taking account of what is on offer from America and the UK and begin negotiations to establish to what extent it can be applied throughout the police force. I do not believe it would cost a huge amount of money.</P>
    <P>In America, there is a public private partnership in place, whereby public companies, such as those in the computer industry, will fund the required hardware and software to record details of missing persons, access websites and publicise that information. There are separate organisations, also funded through public private partnerships, which offer ongoing information by way of milk cartons or postal handouts to local communities in various states, highlighting detailed profiles of missing persons and how they would now look. That approach has had huge success.</P>
    <P>The request now being made requires a simple step forward. Although it may be a difficult task, I ask for a further review of the situation and the funding which can be put in place so that we can begin to help families which experience trauma and sadness every day of their lives. Little or nothing has been done. I make a special appeal for this case to be heard.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan" hpid="Mr. B. Lenihan Mr. B. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Deputy for raising this matter on the Adjournment. The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform is well aware of his interest in this important subject. I am deputising this evening for the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform who is attending a meeting of EU Justice and Home Affairs Ministers in Brussels. The Minister has asked me to assure the Deputy that he shares his concern and that of the public in general with regard to missing persons.</P>
      <P>The establishment of a national missing persons unit has been suggested from time to time and the matter is kept under continuous review by the Garda authorities. There are substantial arguments for and against such a proposal. At present, local Garda management takes direct responsibility for missing person cases and special investigation teams are appointed as necessary. When a person is reported missing, the local Garda superintendent takes direct responsibility for the investigation and appoints an investigation team which includes any specialised unit deemed necessary, such as, for example, the National Bureau of Criminal Investigation or the Garda Technical Bureau.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Garda authorities have assured the Minister that every effort is made to locate all missing persons and that they consider the current procedures for dealing with missing persons to be adequate. As I have said, the procedures are kept under constant review. Their view, as has been proved through experience, is that while specialist units prove very useful in investigating certain types of crime, missing persons cases, by their <Col N="869" />nature, require specific local knowledge about the area where they occur and the circumstances of the person who is missing. Local Garda officers also have available to them, as required, the services of all the specialist units and manpower which are part of the overall Garda organisation structure.</P>
    <P>The Garda Síochána participates fully with all of the media outlets in highlighting cases involving missing persons. All cases of persons reported missing in suspicious circumstances are subject to ongoing review and investigation. The services of other agencies such as Interpol and Europol are also available to assist in the investigation. In addition, every Garda district has a specially trained search team which is familiar with the locality. The missing persons bureau at Garda headquarters is responsible for maintaining data relating to missing persons.</P>
    <P>All files on missing persons remain open and under continuous review until the person is located, or, in the case of a missing person who is presumed drowned, a verdict to that effect is issued by the coroner. The Garda authorities are continually monitoring international developments with regard to investigations of missing persons in order to ensure that best practice is followed. If it is their professional judgment that some change in the existing legislation or protocols would be of assistance in improving investigations, the Minister will of course carefully consider any constructive proposals from them.</P>
    <P>The Minister is aware of the research conducted by the Deputy. The Garda authorities maintain close links with the John Jay College of Criminal Justice in New York, and Deputy Commissioner Peter Fitzgerald is chair of the Jerry McCabe Foundation which operates an exchange programme with the Garda Síochána and the NYPD, in conjunction with the college. The foundation is partly funded by the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform. The Garda authorities have entered into discussions with the John Jay authorities with a view to exploring the possibility of exchanges of personnel with missing persons expertise.</P>
    <P>In the area of legislation, the House will be aware that last summer the Minister published the general scheme of a criminal justice Bill with reference to new Garda powers of investigation which, when enacted, will improve the effectiveness of the criminal justice system in a number of specified areas. These provisions are of particular interest in missing persons cases. The proposals provide for longer powers of detention in Garda custody, the strengthening of Garda powers regarding the preservation of the scene of a crime, the introduction of new powers on the issuing of search warrants in certain circumstances and the strengthening of the law on DNA sampling. The issue of the establishment of a DNA databank is under examination by the Law Reform Commission and its report is awaited. The commission's recommendations will be care<Col N="870" />fully considered by the Minister with a view to possible incorporation in the Bill.</P>
    <P>The disappearance of any person can be traumatic for their family and friends. For this reason, the Minister is anxious to assist them in any way he can. The Deputy referred to the missing persons helpline, which has been operating since October 2002. This is a dedicated helpline operated by Victim Support as a counselling and referral service and it serves as a primary point of contact for the families of missing persons.</P>
    <P>The helpline provides advice and psychological support for families of missing persons as well as structured liaison with the Garda Síochána. A total of &euro;65,000 was made available to it by the Minister in 2002 and a further &euro;45,000 in 2003. An evaluation of the project is currently under way and is being carried out by the department of social science at the Dublin Institute of Technology. The Minister expects to receive this report early in the new year.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I apologise for being late and appreciate that the Minister of State is taking this matter. It relates to one of the more dilapidated schools in my constituency, St. Peter's national school in Phibsboro, which was founded almost 200 years ago in 1812. One can imagine a school founded that long ago is quite Dickensian in its structure with long breezy corridors, rotting windows, steep stone stairs and poor lighting. It would be well placed in a Dickens novel. The boys and girls attending the school share the same toilets. Therefore, the times they can be used have to be carefully scheduled and it is difficult to maintain sanitation and so on.</P>
      <P>The boys' and the girls' schools were amalgamated in 1999, the incentive being that a new purpose-built school would be provided. That was the carrot extended to all and sundry to come together to amalgamate. The design was put together that year but, unfortunately, we are still awaiting the commencement of the construction nearly four years later. The promise of a new building is very much awaited by everybody concerned.</P>
      <P>I got a letter from an eight year old pupil last week which did not give too many details but outlined how difficult it is to manage in the circumstances. The staff, parents and pupils have been extraordinarily patient on this issue, considering they had great expectations that by now they would have a brand new school.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to highlight the inadequacy of conditions in the school. There is no hot running water, every time any safety regulations have been examined they have failed, there are draughty windows, high ceilings, the school is expensive to heat, radiators are leaking, the lighting is poor, there are no sinks in the classrooms for art and the toilets are shared by boys and girls. The conditions are Dickensian. It is high time <Col N="871" />those concerned got a new building. I hope the Minister of State will have good news for them.</P>

      <P>The 2003 school building programme is on the Department of Education and Science's website. It is designed to give the maximum amount of information concerning the schools capital investment programme to managers, boards of management, principals, parents, students, Deputies, Senators and all other interested parties. The criteria used for selecting projects was published for the first time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The large-scale building project for St. Peter's national school, Phibsboro, Dublin 7, is listed in <Col N="872" />section 7 of the 2003 school building programme. This project is at stage 3, the developed sketch scheme stage of architectural planning. It has been assigned a band 1 rating by his Department in accordance with the published criteria for prioritising large-scale projects.</P>
    <P>The Department of Education and Science intends to publish details of the 2004 school building programme by early January at the latest. The programme will clarify what progress is planned for projects such as St. Peter's national school during 2004.</P>
    <P>The management authorities of individual schools should continue to use funds from their developed grant to deal with urgent health and safety matters. I thank the Deputy for giving me the opportunity to outline the current position to the House.</P>

      <P>The primary objective of current registration and voting arrangements is to provide for an efficient, modern and secure electoral system. Monitoring and reviewing, as necessary, the legal provisions and the practical arrangements for voter registration and voting are central to this goal and a range of measures introduced in recent years have improved the system. Registration arrangements have been streamlined; some supplement application deadlines have been extended; provision has been made for the use of photographs; and party emblems on all ballot papers and large print ballot papers will now be displayed in polling stations.</P>
      <P>Electronic voting and counting has also been successfully introduced and will be used countrywide at the European and local elections in 2004. The Electoral (Amendment) Act 2002 strengthened the provisions for access to the register supplement and the range of acceptable identification documents which can be requested by a presiding officer at a polling station have been more closely defined. Electoral arrangements will continue to be monitored with a view to possible improvements, while remaining conscious of the need to maintain a proper balance between accessibility to the system and its security and integrity.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 52 and 143 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A grant of up to 85% of the approved cost, subject to a maximum cost of &euro;7,618 per house, is available for the provision of a new group water scheme or for the upgrading of an existing <Col N="875" />scheme. A 100% grant is available for the installation of essential water treatment and disinfection equipment in an existing group scheme that is dependent on a quality deficient private source. Additional funding may be available from the Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs for the provision or upgrading of group water schemes in CLÁR areas to compensate for the effects of low housing density and to improve the economic viability of such schemes.</P>
    <P>I have no proposals to increase the level of group water scheme grants, nor is there any such recommendation from the national rural water monitoring committee which advises my Department on rural water policy matters. Group sewerage scheme grants of up to 75% of cost, subject to a maximum grant of &euro;2,031 per house, are available for the provision of common or shared wastewater disposal systems. The national rural water monitoring committee is overseeing the implementation of a pilot programme by local authorities to test a range of new, small scale wastewater collection and treatment systems. Twelve villages in six counties have been selected as locations for the pilot programme. Earlier this year, proposals were invited from suitably qualified contractors to design and build these village schemes and to operate and maintain the infrastructure over a 20 year period. Contractors have now been shortlisted and construction is expected to commence early in 2004.</P>
    <P>Subject to a satisfactory outcome to the pilot testing, the national rural water monitoring committee envisages a potential role for group sewerage schemes in the collection of domestic wastewater from households outside the immediate catchment of the new treatment systems. Confirmation of such a role for group sewerage schemes and any review of the associated grants must await the outcome of the pilot programme.</P>

      <Quest>if wild hares will cease to be taken from the wild for the purpose of live hare coursing in view of the concern expressed by the Northern Ireland Office regarding the low numbers of wild hares and the bringing of wild hares across the Border for the purpose of live hare coursing.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government (Mr. Cullen)</NameTxt>
      <P>The regulation of live hare coursing, including conditions governing the use of hares for that activity, is carried out under the Greyhound Industry Acts, which are the responsibility of the Minister for Arts, Sports and Tourism. The controls exercisable by the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government under the Wildlife Acts 1976 and 2000 relate more generally to the protection and conservation of wildlife species, including hares, and licences embody conditions designed to support these objectives. There is no demonstrated species conservation requirement at present which would justify ceasing the issue of hare netting licences.</P>
      <P>Under section 34 of the Wildlife Act 1976 my Department is responsible for the issue of an annual licence to the Irish Coursing Club, ICC, and its affiliated clubs to capture live hares. Only clubs which are named by the ICC in their licence application request are lawfully permitted to catch hares. No clubs in Northern Ireland are included in the current licence.</P>
      <P>Concern has been expressed to me by the Parliamentary Under Secretary of State at the Northern Ireland Office, Ms Angela Smith, MP, regarding the possible capture of hares here for the purposes of coursing in Northern Ireland. In response, I have undertaken to consider whether it would be feasible to include conditions prohibiting the removal of hares from the State in future annual licences. In addition, I have informed my Northern Ireland colleague that prosecutions are currently being taken by my Department for alleged unlawful capture of hares in the Border area.</P>
      <P>A steering group comprising members of staff from my Department and the environment and heritage service of the Department of the Environment in Northern Ireland has been set up to draft an all-Ireland species action plan for the Irish hare. Work on drafting this plan commenced in June 2003 and is expected to be finalised by March 2004. A survey to estimate hare numbers in Ireland is expected to be one of the strategies proposed in the action plan. Once the plan has been finalised implementation of identified strategies will commence.</P>

      <P>On 19 August 2003 I announced a review of the retail planning guidelines regarding the floor space cap on retail warehouses contained in them. The guidelines currently prescribe a maximum floor area of 6,000 square metres gross retail floor space for large-scale single retail warehouse developments. That cap is now being reviewed, taking account of the need to ensure effective competition in the retailing sector and ongoing developments in retail formats, while also having regard to issues of proper planning and sustainable development. Central to the review will be the potential impact of the national spatial strategy on the guidelines and the need to ensure that cities and towns have a range of retail facilities that supports their attractiveness and competitiveness for investment and population growth.</P>
      <P>To assist in carrying out the review, I invited interested parties to make submissions to my Department. The closing date for receipt of submissions was 3 October 2003, by which time 64 submissions had been received by my Department. All of those submissions are now being assessed and will be fully taken into account in considering further whether any changes are needed in the guidelines. I intend that the process will be completed as quickly as possible.</P>

      <P>The Minister for Social and Family Affairs has informed the House regarding changes in the SWA rent supplement scheme recently announced by her that there will be provision for exceptions regarding the homeless, people at risk of becoming homeless and other vulnerable people. She has also specifically assured the House that people who have particular problems and difficulties will be cared for and that nobody will be made homeless because of the measure. Accordingly, the question of additional provision in that context does not arise.</P>
      <P>Lone parents and persons on low incomes who are unable to provide housing for themselves from their own resources are entitled to apply for social housing, which is provided by either a local authority or a voluntary housing body. The Government's positive commitment to the social housing programme is shown in the increased provision for social and affordable housing in 2004. The total housing provision, Exchequer and non-Exchequer, in 2004 of &euro;1.885 billion represents an increase of 5.5% on the 2003 provision. The increase in the housing provision in 2004 will allow for 5,000 starts in 2004 under the main local authority housing programme and a further 500 under regeneration programmes. In addition, the voluntary housing sector will provide over 2,000 units of accommodation in 2004. Many of the housing units being provided by local authorities and voluntary bodies in 2004 will be let to lone parents and persons on low incomes.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 64 and 76 together.</P>
      <P>Local authorities were notified of a combined allocation for the payment of disabled person's and essential repairs grants in June 2003. They were requested to contact my Department if their allocation was either inadequate or surplus to their requirements to facilitate the possible re-allocation of funds and to obtain optimum effectiveness from the funding available. Allocations which were surplus to the requirements of local authorities have now been re-allocated. In addition, some shortfall anticipated due to a fall in demand for shared ownership is being used to meet commitments for disabled person's grants in 2003.</P>
      <P>Having regard to activity under the schemes, the number of disabled person's grants paid, for example, has increased from 2,455 grants in 1998 to 5,932 in 2002. The Exchequer commitment increased from &euro;13 million to &euro;52.6 million over the period.</P>
      <P>The administration of the disabled person's and essential repairs grant schemes, including the processing of individual applications, is a matter for individual local authorities. My Department recoups to local authorities two thirds of their expenditure on the payment of grants. It is the responsibility of the authorities to fund the remaining one third from their own resources from amounts provided for that purpose in their annual estimates of expenditure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Regarding 2004, details of the capital funding <Col N="881" />being provided for the payment of disabled person's and essential repairs grants will be made available in the revised Estimates for public services 2004 which will be published early in 2004.</P>
    <P>The review of the disabled person's grants scheme, which commenced in March, is currently being finalised in my Department and, in that context, the relationship of the scheme with the essential repairs grants and the special housing aid for the elderly schemes is also being considered. On completion of the review, I will be able to determine the changes, if any, required to the regulations governing the schemes.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government (Mr. Cullen)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government's strategy is to increase housing supply to meet demand and to improve affordability, particularly for first-time buyers.</P>
      <P>The measures introduced by this Government to boost supply, including significant investment in infrastructure, improving planning capacity and promoting increased residential densities, are having effect. 2002 was the eighth successive year of record house completions, with 57,695 units completed, an increase in output of 9.7% on 2001 and a more than 30% increase in the housing output in the Dublin area. This positive trend in supply has continued into this year, with statistics showing that overall house completions for the first six months were up 16.5% on the same period last year. Indicative data available to the Department shows that first-time buyers continue to have a significant presence in the housing market.</P>
      <P>The Government will continue to focus on measures to maintain a high level of housing supply. The investment in the servicing of land has led to a strong stock of land available for residential development. This combined with the growth in registration of new construction with the house guarantee companies this year augurs well for future supply.</P>
      <P>At the same time, Government interventions have boosted the supply of affordable housing under targeted schemes for low and middle-income purchasers. I anticipate that the numbers benefiting from affordable housing will further increase next year as more affordable housing comes on stream as a result of agreements under Part V of the Planning and Development Act 2000, as amended. In overall terms, the housing needs of over 12,000 households on average will be met over the period 2002 to 2004, compared to almost 8,500 in 1998.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 70 and 89 together.</P>
      <P>As indicated in reply to Priority Questions Nos. 41 and 44 on today's Order Paper, local authorities fund their expenditure, including expenditure on pay, from a variety of sources including specific State grants, commercial rates, rents, fees and charges for services and general purpose grants from the local government fund. The issue of benchmarking costs in 2004, as with other current expenditure demands will fall to be dealt with by local authorities in the context of their annual budgetary process.</P>
      <P>The recently published Abridged Estimates volume, (AEV), indicates that an amount of &euro;1.118 billion will be available to the local government fund in 2004 &ndash; an increase of approximately &euro;38 million over the amount of expenditure being made available from the fund this year. As I also indicated, these are not the full extent of the resources which I anticipate will be available to me for the local government fund. I am satisfied that the increases to be provided in general purpose grants from the fund will make an appropriate contribution to meeting the increased costs of local authorities in 2004 and will obviate the need for any undue increases in rates, fees and other local charges in 2004.</P>
      <P>I expect to notify authorities of these allocations within the next week or so.</P>

      <P>An overall country-wide package of measures involving the re-organisation of the National Parks and Wildlife Service &ndash; NPWS &ndash; of my Department was agreed with the main trade union involved in June of this year. These measures include an improvement in the regional structures of the NPWS, involving an increase in the number of operational divisions from three to four, in the number of regions from six to eight and a consequent re-organisation of individual staff responsibilities and area boundaries.</P>
      <P>To give effect to these arrangements new appointments are required in all NPWS conservation management grades. Competitions have already been held and appointments made at divisional manager and regional manager level, with the latter requiring a supplementary competition which is currently under way. A new divisional ecologist has been appointed and a further such appointment will be made in the near future.</P>
      <P>Applications have also been invited for a competition for deputy regional managers and interviews will take place shortly. The next stage of the process will be the holding of a competition early in the new year for posts at district conservation officer level. Consequential requirements, such as new staff accommodation, are being simultaneously addressed.</P>
      <P>Arrangements are also in hands for the recruitment of additional conservation rangers through the Civil Service and Local Appointments Commissioners. Provision for specific conservation ranger coverage of the north County Dublin area will be made within the revised overall organisational arrangements. In the meantime, coverage of this area is being provided from within the present complement of personnel.</P>
      <P>These arrangements will significantly improve the conservation management of our natural heritage for the future.</P>

      <P>The management and maintenance of their rented dwellings, including the control of vacant dwellings, is the responsibility of the housing authority concerned. The most recent figures available to my Department from local authorities indicate that at the end of December 2002 there were 4,330 local authority dwellings vacant nationwide, of which 2,013 were de-tenanted for planned refurbishment or major regeneration programmes in run-down estates. While my Department does not have details of the particular reasons for the balance of the dwellings being vacant, short-term vacancies do occur on an ongoing basis where dwellings require renovations or improvements to bring them up to an acceptable standard before re-letting. However, I encourage local authorities to ensure that once a dwelling becomes vacant, it is re-let as quickly as possible to a household on the waiting list.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government (Mr. Cullen)</NameTxt>
      <P>Composite beverage cartons are the most commonly used containers in Ireland and Europe for milk, packed fruit juices and other liquid foods. The recycling of post-consumer composite beverage cartons is generally more problematic than for other packaging materials, due to the light weight to volume ratio, sorting and pre-treatment requirements, high-end market specifications and the associated costs involved. Accordingly, the recycling rate for composite beverage cartons is generally lower than for other packaging materials.</P>
      <P>A pilot beverage carton recycling initiative part-funded by Repak, the voluntary compliance scheme established by Irish industry to co-ordinate and finance the collection and recovery of packaging waste, was launched in July 2003, involving Dublin City Council and Cavan and Wicklow County Councils. The pilot initiative also involves some private waste collectors in a number of other counties. Under the initiative, households in the relevant areas which have a segregated household collection service can deposit used beverage cartons in their segregated bins for recycling. The collected used beverage cartons are subsequently baled for onward delivery to a paper mill in Scotland for reprocessing. Arising from the pilot scheme, it is proposed to extend the initiative nationwide to all households with a segregated collection service. Approximately 500,000 households, almost one third of all households nationally, already have these services, which are being progressively extended under the local and regional waste management plans.</P>
      <P>This expanded beverage carton recycling initiative will be assisted by the development of additional material recovery facilities, at which dry recyclables can be sorted and baled for onward transfer to reprocessing outlets. Since November 2002, I have announced the allocation of over &euro;22 million in grant assistance from the environment fund, financed from the proceeds of the landfill and plastic bag levies, towards the provision of waste recovery infrastructure under the waste recovery capital grants scheme announced last year. This is supporting the development, <i>inter alia,</i> of bring banks, civic amenity sites and two material recovery facilities, facilitating increased collection and recovery of used beverage containers and other recyclables in the years ahead. Further allocations will be announced shortly. In addition, I announced the allocation of &euro;5 million to local authorities from the environment fund earlier this year to assist towards the operational costs of their recycling services.</P>

      <P>I refer to the reply to Questions Nos. 9, 17 and 64 of 16 October 2003.</P>
      <P>Kyoto obligations arise in the commitment period 2008-12. Ireland has embarked on a challenging programme to limit the growth in greenhouse gas emissions through vigorous implementation of the Government's national climate change strategy, published in November 2000. This comprises a systematic programme towards meeting these obligations, and sets a ten-year policy framework for achieving the necessary emissions reductions. This strategic approach across all sectors is in line with that adopted in other EU member states for ensuring that Kyoto obligations are met.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="889" />A progress report on the implementation of the strategy was published in May 2002. While this shows that measures in place or in progress are capable of achieving approximately 20% of the reductions required to meet our Kyoto Protocol obligations, continuing emissions increases due to volume growth in the economy mean that implementation of the strategy must be intensified.</P>
    <P>I have, therefore, initiated a review of implementation of the strategy to ensure more focused and intensive implementation. This process will incorporate an update on greenhouse gas emissions projections, together with a particular emphasis on cross-cutting economic instruments to achieve Ireland's Kyoto target. These include taxation and emissions trading and other flexible mechanisms which have been and are being developed at EU-international level since the national strategy was formulated. I intend to publish the outcome of this review as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that full implementation over the remainder of the decade, together with any additional measures which may be identified in the review, will ensure that our Kyoto obligations will be fully met.</P>

The announcement in July this year of the immediate release of two sites in Dublin, and agreement to a proposal relating to two further sites in Meath and Kildare was a critical step in ensuring early delivery of affordable housing under this initiative.

      <P>Direct user charges for household waste collection services are widely applied throughout Europe, particularly in the context of increasing awareness of the financial and environmental cost of waste generation and of encouraging waste reduction and recycling. They give effect to the polluter pays principle, which is reflected in both EU legislation and the Waste Management Act 1996.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Government waste policy recognises that, as a matter of equity, and to directly incentivise waste prevention-minimisation and recycling, the level of waste charges imposed on households and businesses, either directly or through gate fees, should be based on usage. Accordingly, the Government expects that all local authorities will move towards introducing weight-volume related charging to the fullest extent possible within the three-year target period up to 2005. My Department recently wrote to local authorities to establish the extent to which such charging approaches are already in operation, in both local authority <Col N="891" />and private collection systems, and, where necessary, the plans in place in order to meet the 2005 policy objective. I will be considering what further action may be necessary following the completion of my Department's examination of the responses received.</P>

      <P>The results of the statutory assessment of local authority housing need, which was undertaken by local authorities in March 2002, indicated that a total of 48,413 households were in need of housing, compared with 39,176 households in March 1999. Detailed information on the results of the 2002 assessment was published in my Department's September 2002 quarterly edition of the housing statistics bulletin, copies of which are available in the Oireachtas Library.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Sustaining Progress special initiative on housing and accommodation reflected the Government's expectation that the resources available in 2003 would allow for the needs of about 12,000 households to be met through the various social and affordable housing measures. I am confident the provision this year will be above that level. This includes an estimated 5,000 local <Col N="892" />authority house completions-acquisitions, including output from new house completions in Ballymun and under other regeneration programmes. Local authorities completed-acquired 5,074 housing units in 2002.</P>
    <P>The housing needs of more than 12,000 households on average will be met each year over the period 2002 to 2004, compared to almost 8,500 in 1998.</P>

      <P>On behalf of my Department, the Economic and Social Research Institute has completed the Irish National Survey of Housing Quality 2001-2002 and this will be published shortly. The survey obtained detailed information from a representative sample of more than 40,000 householders on various issues such as key characteristics of households and dwellings, dwelling size and rooms available, services and utilities, affordability problems, repairs and upgrades, energy efficiency and overall quality.</P>
      <P>Information on the numbers and types of housing units in urban and rural areas at the time of the 2002 census, together with an analysis of the housing stock by period of construction, changes in the occupancy status of dwellings, the numbers of private rented dwellings and the proportion of individual houses in rural areas are available in the principal socio-economic results of the 2002 census, volume 4.</P>
      <P>My Department and its associated bodies commission research as necessary and appropriate on matters relating to the natural and built environment, proper planning and sustainable development of urban and rural areas and the conservation of the natural and cultural heritage. Some of these research projects have been completed, while others are ongoing. Relevant research includes the extensive analysis of the spatial structure and functioning of Ireland carried out in preparing the national spatial strategy; a study by the Environmental Protection Agency on sustainability and future settlement patterns in Ireland; studies by my Department to monitor the quality of sources for the abstraction of water for group water schemes; a pilot programme to assess innovative and cost effective ways of providing wastewater collection and treatment systems for small rural villages; a national pilot source protection scheme to devise workable and sustainable measures for preventing pollution of group water scheme sources; and a study by the Heritage Council of the relationship between housing and the protection of the natural and cultural heritage.</P>
      <P>The findings from research such as that mentioned are taken into account in policy development on matters, for example, such as the national spatial strategy, groundwater protection as set out in a comprehensive circular issued by my Department and in the forthcoming guidelines on the implementation of Government policy in relation to rural housing. I anticipate that additional research will be commissioned as necessary to inform future policy development in relation to urban and rural settlement.</P>

      <P>In reply to Question No. 27 of 16 October 2003, I indicated that I had written to Minister Timms in July and August 2003. I sought a report from him on the storage facility in question, and he informed me that the UK Health and Safety Executive's nuclear installations inspectorate is content that it is currently safe to continue using the building where the radioactive waste stream known as medium active concentrate, MAC, is stored. However, Minister Timms also informed me that the inspectorate has concerns about the acceptability of using the building for the storage of significant quantities of MAC beyond 2006. This information raises significant questions and I will pursue this matter with Minister Timms at next week's meeting.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 91 and 92 together.</P>
      <P>I am satisfied with the progress being made in implementing NDP infrastructure programmes for which my Department is responsible. In particular, water services, housing and non-national roads programmes have been meeting or surpassing targets. However, I acknowledge that increased effort is needed to advance programmes in some areas, such as waste management and urban and village renewal, in which mobilisation has been slower. I look forward to accelerated delivery of programmes over the remainder of the NDP.</P>
      <P>In general, I am pleased the review of the NDP demonstrates the macro-economic benefits to the economy as a result of sustained investment under the plan and supports the continued prioritisation of investment in public infrastructure. The Government is committed to providing the investment needed to carry out the improvements in public infrastructure envisaged under the NDP which are necessary to sustain Ireland's competitiveness and future growth prospects and which support jobs, communities and quality of life. The Government's objectives in this regard are being maintained and we will continue to prioritise investment in capital infrastructure over the remaining years of the NDP.</P>
      <P>I do not accept all aspects of the ESRI analysis. For example, present Government policies that provide land for affordable housing at reasonable cost are soundly based and are not calculated to distort the housing market. I also question the view that the priority should be to address institutional arrangements around waste management rather than to move forward quickly to implement existing plans. Notwithstanding these reservations, the publication of the ESRI review marks a significant milestone in the progress of the NDP and the review will assist further decisions around the implementation of NDP programmes.</P>

      <P>Wetlands include a variety of habitat types. Inventory and survey to date has focused on those considered to be most at risk, notably turloughs, lagoons and raised and blanket bogs. Fens are a remaining priority for survey. An inventory of blanket bogs suitable for designation as natural heritage areas, NHAs, under the Wildlife (Amendment) Act 2000 is being carried out this year and similar consideration will be given to other wetland habitat types in subsequent years. The water framework directive will provide a context for further inventory and research on wetlands.</P>
      <P>Under class 11, Part 3 of the Planning and Development Regulations 2001, the reclamation of estuarine marsh land or of callows on land that is used only for the purpose of agriculture or forestry is exempt from the requirement to seek planning permission, but only where the preservation of the land or callows is not an objective of the development plan for the area. Where a wetland is valuable in ecological terms or is designated as a European site and has been included in the development plan, planning permission must be sought before any drainage or other development can be carried out. There are no proposals to amend this exemption.</P>
      <P>In circumstances where a wetland is designated as a European site but planning permission is not required for drainage of the site, a person who is seeking to undertake such drainage must seek the consent of the Minister under the habitats regulations.</P>

      <P>Specific steps are being taken to identify lands that would be suitable for use as part of the new affordable housing initiative under the Sustaining Progress partnership agreement. In July 2003, the Taoiseach announced the immediate release of two State sites in Dublin and agreement to a proposal relating to two further State sites in Counties Meath and Kildare. This was a critical step in ensuring early delivery of affordable housing under this initiative. With regard to the release of further State land for this initiative, a series of meetings have been held with other Departments and a review of local authority land is under way to allow a further report to Government on this matter in the near future. The use of under utilised State land for purposes other than housing is a matter for the Minister for Finance and the relevant Minister.</P>

      <P>The analysis and assessment of taxation measures is overseen by the Tax Strategy Group &ndash; TSG &ndash; chaired by the Department of Finance, while preparatory work is undertaken by the Green Tax Group, a sub-group of the TSG and also chaired by the Department of Finance. In so far as my Department is concerned, proposals for a carbon energy tax have been presented to both groups in advance of past budgets.</P>
      <P>Following the announcement by the Minister for Finance in Budget 2003, the Department of Finance undertook a consultation process in regard to the design of a carbon energy tax. My Department submitted views to the consultation process. I understand the Department of Finance is examining in detail the submissions received, and I am liaising closely with the Minister for Finance on the next steps in the process.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 98 and 103 together.</P>
      <P>Overall Government policy on rural housing is set out in the national spatial strategy, NSS, published in November 2003. The rural settlement policy framework contained in the NSS aims to sustain and renew established rural communities, while strengthening the structure of villages and smaller settlements to support local economies, ensuring that key assets in rural areas are protected to support quality of life and ensuring also that rural settlement policies are responsive to the differing local circumstances in different areas. It is of particular importance, as the Taoiseach and I have made clear, that we cater for those who have roots in an area and make an economic contribution to that area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is vitally important that there is certainty and consistency in the implementation by planning authorities of Government policy in this matter through their own development plans and in the <Col N="899" />operation of the development control system under planning legislation. This is the purpose of the guidelines under the Planning and Development Act which I intend to bring forward to deal with this issue. These are at an advanced stage of preparation and I hope to publish them before the end of the year.</P>
    <P>The guidelines will also be aimed, through the operation of the planning system, at securing greater public awareness of the issues involved in rural settlement policies and greater consensus on the practical implementation of those policies.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government (Mr. Cullen)</NameTxt>
      <P>In including housing as a major area of activity under the National Development Plan 2000-2006, the Government has demonstrated its commitment to increasing support for social and affordable housing programmes. Despite the pressure on the public finances, the Government has again increased the total housing provision by 5.5% to &euro;1.885 billion in 2004.</P>
      <P>Over the three years 2000 to 2002, &euro;3.8 billion or 109% of the NDP forecast on the social and affordable housing measures has been spent. This financial progress was acknowledged in the recent independent mid-term evaluations of the NDP. These reports also highlighted the positive contribution of social housing measures to addressing poverty and social inclusion. While physical progress is somewhat behind targets due mainly to construction inflation and increased land prices, NDP investment to date has led to the highest levels of social housing output in 15 years by local authorities and record output by the voluntary and co-operative housing sector.</P>
      <P>I am pleased that the resources available for 2004 will allow this progress to be consolidated, with the voluntary and co-operative housing sector continuing to make a very valuable contribution in this area and additional housing starts anticipated by local authorities. Equally, I share with the Irish Council for Social Housing the view that we must ensure value for money in social housing and that resources are targeted and used effectively. To this end, we are committed under the Sustaining Progress special initiative on housing and accommodation to a review of all programmes so as to ensure that they contribute optimally to present and evolving needs.</P>

      <P>On 24 June last, the tribunal established under Annex VII of the UN Convention on Law of the Sea delivered its Order No. 3, on the Suspension of Proceedings on Jurisdiction and Merits, and Request for further Provisional Measures.</P>
      <P>The order directed the suspension of the substantive hearings in the case until questions of Community competence were resolved with the European Commission and, in any event, until not later than 1 December 2003.</P>
      <P>The European Commission subsequently decided to institute legal proceedings against Ireland, requesting the European Court of Justice to declare that Ireland has failed to fulfil its obligations under Article 10 and 292 EC, and Article 192 and 193 Euratom. On 30 October 2003, the Commission lodged an application with the court in this matter. Given the complex and fundamental legal issues involved, the referral of the case to the ECJ was expected, and Ireland will respond in accordance with normal procedures. It is not known at this when the case will come to hearing at the ECJ.</P>
      <P>On 14 November 2003, the UNCLOS tribunal delivered its Order No. 4, confirming that the proceedings would be suspended until the European Court of Justice has delivered its judgment. The Tribunal further ordered that the terms of its previous Order remained in effect. These terms included the affirmation of the operation of the provisional measures prescribed by ITLOS and the recommendation to the parties to enter into discussions with a view to establishing secure arrangements, at a suitable intergovernmental level, for co-ordination of all the various agencies and bodies involved and to review the whole system of intergovernmental notification and co-operation.</P>
      <P>As the tribunal remains suspended, it is not now necessary for the parties to meet the tribunal to make submissions in respect of the resumption of the substantive proceedings. A further report to the tribunal setting out progress on discussions towards progressing the tribunal's recommendation will be made on 28 November 2003. Subsequent reports will be made every six months thereafter based on continuing exchanges between officials of both Governments. The tribunal remains seized of the dispute.</P>

      <P>The past few years have seen a major local government modernisation programme with constitutional recognition and guaranteed local elections; record levels of funding; strengthened political and management structures; an updated legal framework and an efficiency agenda focused on improved financial management, IT, human resources, corporate planning and customer service. Earlier this year legislation was enacted to end the dual mandate and a major independent study to identify future funding options for local government is also being commissioned.</P>
      <P>A key element of the modernisation process going forward is the continued development of the county/city development board system, already providing a wider role for local government. Through these development boards local authorities have a central role in bringing together at local level the various public agencies, social partners and local development bodies and in developing, overseeing and monitoring an integrated strategy for the economic, social and cultural development of their areas.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government (Mr. Cullen)</NameTxt>
      <P>Since the introduction of the plastic bag levy, receipts remitted to my Department by the Revenue Commissioners have been at a consistent level and amount to almost &euro;16.7 million. Introduction of the levy has led to a dramatic reduction in the number of disposable plastic bags provided to consumers with a consequent positive environmental benefit. Revenues from the levy are paid into the environment fund, which may be used to support a wide range of waste management, litter and other environmental initiatives as provided for in the legislation.</P>
      <P>The Waste Management (Environmental Levy) (Plastic Bag) Regulations 2001 designate the Revenue Commissioners as the responsible authority for enforcing the collection of the plastic shopping bag levy. In addition, the regulations impose a supplementary requirement on retailers to pass on the full amount of the levy to customers, and this regulatory provision is being enforced by local authorities. The relevant enforcement officers have extensive powers to enter any retail premises, conduct any searches or investigations considered necessary and inspect or remove any records, books and documents for the purposes of any proceedings in relation to the levy.</P>
      <P>My Department has had few complaints about non-compliance. However, I recognise the need to ensure that the efforts and commitment of the vast majority of retailers are not undermined by the non-compliance of a few. My Department wrote to local authorities in regard to the regulations and also met representatives of all local authorities to discuss enforcement and other aspects of the levy, prior to its introduction.</P>
      <P>A further detailed circular on enforcement was issued to local authorities asking them to pay particular attention to the identification and follow up of any non-compliance with the law. All complaints received in my Department concerning non-compliance are forwarded to the relevant local authority and the Revenue Commissioners. The operation of the levy is also subject to the normal Revenue Commissioners auditing arrangements.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government (Mr. Cullen)</NameTxt>
      <P>Government policy on waste management is set out in the policy documents Changing our Ways and Preventing and Recycling Waste: Delivering Change. The Government's approach is based on <Col N="903" />the internationally recognised waste management hierarchy of prevention-minimisation, significantly increased levels of recycling, energy recovery and utilising landfill as the last resort for residual waste that cannot otherwise be recovered.</P>
      <P>Local authorities were asked to identify and fully assess the various issues involved with a view to identifying the nature, scale and mix of facilities which, at a regional level, appear to offer the best balance between maximised recovery of materials or energy and minimised environmental emissions, at reasonable cost. Local authorities then prepared and adopted waste management plans which require a major reduction in reliance on landfill in favour of an integrated waste management approach which utilises a range of treatment options to deliver ambitious recycling and recovery targets. Implementation of these plans is now well under way. A comprehensive legislative framework has been put in place to provide the necessary environmental regulation to underpin the process of modernising our approach to waste management.</P>
      <P>The manner in which wastes in Ireland are managed is reported on periodically by the Environmental Protection Agency through its national waste database reports. The most recent report, published in July 2003, relates to the year 2001; a copy is available in the Oireachtas Library.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that the rules relating to the payment of VAT by a company or branch of a company supplying services in or into Ireland are quite complex. For example, they can depend on whether the company concerned is located in Ireland, another member state of the EU or outside the EU. Moreover, the type and circumstances of the services being supplied can also have an influence on the VAT due. Nevertheless, the same VAT rate and result should arise in all circumstances, whether a service is supplied from inside or outside the State.</P>
      <P>There should therefore be no VAT advantage to non-Irish companies when tendering for projects since the same VAT treatment should apply to Irish and non-Irish companies. If the Deputy is aware of any anomalies, he might make such concerns known to the Revenue Commissioners as appropriate.</P>

      <P>The school in question is a special school for pupils with a moderate general learning disability. Such schools generally operate at a ratio of one special needs assistant &ndash; SNA &ndash; per two class groups of eight pupils each. The school currently has 18 SNAs caring for 86 pupils. It is considered that the staffing complement is adequate for the number of pupils attending the school. My Department will make contact with the school regarding the matter.</P>

      <P>My Department allocates resource teaching support and special needs assistant support to second level schools and vocational education committees to cater for students with special educational needs. Applications for such support are made to my Department by the relevant school authorities. Each application is considered on the basis of the assessed needs of the pupil or pupils involved and the nature and level of the support provided is determined on the advice of the psychological service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="907" />To date, my Department has allocated a total of 7.40 wholetime teacher equivalent posts and 1.61 wholetime equivalent special needs assistant posts to County Louth VEC to cater for students with special needs. There is one application outstanding for this committee. This application was received on 14 November and has since been referred to the psychological service for a report and recommendation. As soon as this report and recommendation is received a decision will be taken and the outcome will be relayed to County Louth VEC.</P>

The board will employ educational welfare officers to provide welfare focused services to children, families and schools throughout the country.</P>
      <P>The new services will be phased in and my Department allocated a budget of &euro;5.4 million to the board for 2003 to begin developing the services involved. A management team was put in place earlier this year. Thirty-six new staff are being recruited which will bring the total number of staff delivering educational welfare services nationally to 73. Under the board's work plan for 2003, five regional teams will be established and the educational welfare staff will be deployed in areas of greatest disadvantage and areas designated under the Government RAPID programme.</P>

This information was conveyed to the school authorities on 28 April 2003.</P>
      <P>I advise the Deputy that pupils with specific learning disability are generally catered for on an integrated basis in ordinary primary schools by the learning support teacher service.

      <P>Free-to-air services in Ireland are provided by RTE and by independent broadcasters which have entered into contractual arrangements with the Broadcasting Commission of Ireland, BCI. The spectrum used by RTE is licensed to the authority in accordance with the Broadcasting Act 1960, while that used by the independent sector is licensed to the BCI in accordance with the Radio and Television Act 1988.</P>
      <P>Under the new EU electronic communications regulatory framework, which was transposed into Irish law on 21 July 2003, ComReg may impose charges on all providers of electronic communications services and networks to meet expenses properly incurred by the commission in the discharge of its functions with regard to electronic communications. I have no function in this matter.</P>
      <P>The Communications Regulation Act 2003 provides that the commission is independent in the exercise of its functions. The new framework also entitles ComReg to impose licence fees for users of spectrum or rights of use charges. However, any such charges, in requiring an amendment of regulations made under the Wireless Telegraphy Act 1926, would be subject to ministerial consent.</P>
      <P>In February this year I issued a set of policy directions to ComReg one of which related to the cost of managing the frequency spectrum. The direction instructed that the costs incurred by it in effectively carrying out its functions with regard to the electronic communications market and the management of the radio frequency spectrum are minimised, consistent with best practice in other member states of the European Community and, subject to any different conditions which may exist, should not be out of line with the cost of regulation in such member states. I have no proposals to introduce further legislation requiring the imposition of spectrum charges on terrestrial free-to-air broadcasters.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children (Mr. T. O'Malley)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Food Safety Authority of Ireland, FSAI, is the competent authority for the enforcement of European Union legislation regarding genetic modification of foodstuffs. Under EU rules, only authorised GM foods or foods containing ingredients thereof can be imported and placed on the market. At present, products from 16 GMOs can legally be marketed in the EU, including soya, maize, processed foods derived from oilseed rape and maize and oil from cottonseeds. These products are normally used as food ingredients and the following are the food types in which the FSAI has identified GM ingredients: vegetable casserole, gluten-free reduced sugar rusks, soya protein mince, soya protein chunks, soya biscuits and cakes, soya bran, soya flour, infant formula, soya cream, soya yoghurt, soya drink, soya dessert, lecithin granules derived from soya bean and maize meal, tortilla chips, taco shells, breadcrumbs for chicken <Col N="911" />and burger and corn snacks derived from maize. This list does not mean, however, that there are not other food types on the market with GM maize or soya ingredients.</P>
      <P>In addition, trace levels of GM ingredients in food can and do occur in non-GM food due to mixing during cultivation, harvest, transport and processing. This phenomenon is not particular to GM foods. Against this background, the EU objective is to ensure legal certainty and establish certain thresholds above which conventional foods have to be labelled as consisting of, containing or being produced from a GMO.</P>
      <P>With regard to future implications for the domestic food chain and the food industry in general, it must be noted that any further authorisations of GM foods will only occur following full independent safety assessment by the European Food Safety Authority and will also be subject to the latest European regulations with regard to traceability and labelling. Currently, apart from products of a GM sugar beet, only similar foods to those already authorised for the EU market are in the authorisation process and consequently any newly approved GMOs should not result in any new GM ingredients. There are, however, other GM crops in use in other parts of the world such as GM potatoes which may require authorisation for the EU market in the future.</P>

      <P>The home help scheme was introduced in 1972 under a provision of the 1970 Health Act. At that time, the chief executive officers of the health boards took a collective decision not to engage family members and relatives as paid home helps. This was in recognition of the fact that the initiative was not intended to replace the existing informal arrangements whereby family members and relatives provided assistance in the tasks of daily living to many old people living at home. While family members are not legally debarred from acting as home helps, the practice has been that they provided support to older relatives, without payment. There have, I understand, been some instances where a relative has been employed as a home help.</P>
      <P>I am happy that matters have improved for informal family carers in recent years. The carer's allowance is available from the Department of Social and Family Affairs to qualified applicants and the health boards have received specific funding to provide support and assistance to family carers. This funding now amounts to just over &euro;6 million per annum.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Transport (Mr. Brennan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 136 and 137 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There have been a number of consultancy or expert reports in recent years on Aer Rianta and the State airports, including the Warburg Dillon Read report of 1999 which reviewed the strategic options for the future of Aer Rianta, the Doganis report of January 2002 on aviation-tourism issues, and the Mullarkey report of February 2003 on the <Col N="917" />independent terminal concept for Dublin Airport. In addition, in May this year, Aer Rianta submitted to me a copy of a report which the company commissioned from NERA Economic Consulting on competition in the context of Irish airports. The Warburg Dillon Read report of 1999, while offering some general observations on the issue of separating the three State airports, did not analyse this issue, draw any conclusions or make any recommendations in respect of it.</P>
    <P>There has been a broad level of support for the Government's decision to restructure Aer Rianta, a strategic decision taken on foot of a programme for Government commitment to continue to transform Aer Rianta and, as part of that process, to ensure that Shannon and Cork airports have greater autonomy and independence. The new arrangements are designed to strengthen and expand each of the three airports and give both Shannon and Cork airports a fresh start under strong and visionary leadership. All three airports can perform even better than they have to date and, through more focused commercial operation, each can play a greater role in stimulating and supporting regional economic activity to the benefit of its customers, both airlines and passengers, and tourism, trade and industry.</P>
    <P>It is proposed that the two new independent airport authorities for Shannon and Cork will both commence business free of debt and that the debts associated with these airports, including the debt associated with the major new investment programme under way at Cork Airport, will remain with Dublin Airport. The desirability of these debt arrangements emerged from my Department's consideration of the financial position of the three State airports within the current Aer Rianta structure which was provided to my Department by Aer Rianta. My Department was assisted in its analysis of the Aer Rianta data by PricewaterhouseCoopers which completed its work in March this year. These debt arrangements will ensure that both Shannon and Cork airports will have sound balance sheets, giving both a fresh start to develop and grow their business.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. McDowell Mr. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. McDowell)</NameTxt>
      <P>Garda youth diversion projects are a community-based, multi-agency crime prevention initiative which seek to divert young persons from becoming involved &ndash; or further involved &ndash; in anti-social and/or criminal behaviour by providing suitable activities to facilitate personal development, promote civic responsibility and improve long-term employability prospects. By doing so, the projects also contribute to improving the quality of life within communities and enhancing Garda/community relations. I am committed to their continuing development and, as resources permit, their expansion.</P>
      <P>Recent years have seen a dramatic expansion in project numbers from 12 in 1997 to 64 at present, a process made possible, in part, by funding under the National Development Plan 2000 &ndash; 2006. The locations of the new projects were decided upon according to local needs, prioritised by the Garda authorities in conjunction with my Department.</P>
      <P>I am informed by the Garda authorities that an application for the St. Aengus Youth Project was received at Garda community relations section on 2 October 2002 and that the proposal is in respect of young people between ten and 18 years of age in the disadvantaged area of St. Aengus Parish.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are three Garda youth diversion projects currently operating in the Tallaght district, namely, YEW Project &ndash; Youth Enhancement in Whitechurch; KEY Project &ndash; Key to Engaging Youth, Killinarden, Fettercairn and Glenshane; and JAY Project &ndash; Jobstown Action for Youth. Funding of &euro;5.577 million has been allocated to <Col N="919" />Garda youth diversion projects in the current year of which &euro;296,420 has been allocated to the three projects in the Tallaght District.</P>
    <P>While I have secured an overall increase of 9.5% in the Estimates for the Vote for the Garda Síochána in 2004, the continuing need to maintain discipline in the public finances means that I must prioritise expenditure and so cannot increase the funding for all items of expenditure in the Vote. As a result, the Abridged Estimates Volume for 2004 provides for funding of &euro;5.318 million for the youth diversion projects. However, in view of the fact that most of the more recently established projects incurred start up expenses in the last two years which are not expected to be a feature in the coming years, I am confident that all of the projects can be maintained on the proposed funding allocation.</P>
    <P>It is not envisaged that additional Garda youth diversion projects will be established in the short term. However, the possibility of establishing further projects in the future in light of budgetary conditions will remain. In this context, the application for St. Aengus Youth Project will be kept under review.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>I am also informed that approximately 18 months ago, during a similar meeting in the estate management office in Kiltalawn, an old car was set on fire near where the meeting was taking place. The gardaí have informed me that, on investigation, it would appear that neither incident was in any way connected with the meetings. The Garda authorities consider that these were two isolated incidents which do not reflect on the general situation in Jobstown. I understand that <Col N="920" />the most recent meeting expressed clear satisfaction with patrolling in the area by gardaí and their efforts to tackle anti-social behaviour and criminal activity.</P>
    <P>As the Deputy will be aware, the detailed allocation of Garda resources is an operational matter for the Garda authorities, who have informed me that two full-time community gardaí are assigned to the Jobstown/Kiltalawn area. These gardaí carry out daily patrols assisted by other uniform and plain clothes patrols.

      <P>Earlier this year, my Department sought applications for funding under the 2004 EU co-financed specific improvements grant scheme.

      <P>The results of the statutory assessment of local authority housing need, which was undertaken by local authorities in March 2002, indicated that a total of 48,413 households were in need of housing, of which 32,891 were households consisting of two or more persons.

    <P>Detailed information on the results of the 2002 assessment was published in my Department's September 2002 quarterly edition of the housing statistics bulletin, copies of which are available in the Oireachtas Library.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="923" />It is estimated that 5,000 houses will be completed or acquired by local authorities in 2003, including output from new house completions in Ballymun and under other regeneration programmes. Detailed information on the number of completions for each local authority for 2003 will be available in my Department's annual housing statistics bulletin to be published in early 2004.</P>
    <P>The Sustaining Progress special initiative on housing and accommodation reflected the Government's expectation that the resources available in 2003 would allow for the needs of about 12,000 households to be met through the various social and affordable housing measures. I am confident that the actual provision this year will be above that level. The 2003 provision will meet the needs of over 12,000 households and this will be further boosted by affordable housing coming on-stream through Part V agreements, bringing the total provision close to 13,000. This compares to almost 8,500 in 1998. This will have a positive impact on the numbers on the waiting lists.</P>
    <P>Local authorities are currently implementing their housing construction programmes on the basis of a multi-annual programme over the period 2000-2003. The Department will be contacting local authorities in the near future to obtain details of proposed house building programmes for 2004 and subsequent years. This will enable the Department to make house start allocations for each local authority.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 148 and 151 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Air quality assessment is a matter for the Environmental Protection Agency, EPA, and air quality management is a matter for local authorities informed by air quality measurement data. The resourcing of these activities, including relevant air quality monitoring, are matters for the EPA and local authorities, as appropriate, within their annual budgetary processes. Funding comes <Col N="924" />from a variety of sources including, in the case of local authorities, commercial rates, fees and charges for services and general purpose grants from the local government fund, and in the case of the EPA, from Exchequer funding, income associated with relevant EPA licensing activities and from the environment fund.</P>
    <P>The reporting and making available of information on ambient concentrations of pollutants within the scope of the Air Quality Standards Regulations 2002 is the responsibility of the EPA. The Air Quality Monitoring Report 2001, published by the EPA on 6 March 2003, contains details of the monitoring and assessment of national air quality; a copy is available in the Oireachtas Library. This report indicates that NO2 emissions at one site in Dublin city, Wood Quay, exceeded the limit value applicable during 2001. The report discusses the anomalous nature of the readings at the site compared to similar sites in the city and recommends further monitoring of concentrations in order to resolve the anomalous findings and develop an adequate time series of emissions on which to base any decision for action that may be necessary.</P>

      <P>Fire and emergency services are provided primarily by the local authorities acting, as appropriate, in conjunction with the other emergency services locally. Fire authorities are responsible for providing and updating their equipment, including breathing apparatus and other protective equipment, as well as ensuring appropriate training for full time and retained fire services personnel in their areas. My Department supports these services through a range of functions, including sponsoring the legislation underpinning the fire service; capital funding, which has been substantially increased in the period since 1998, for the replacement/refurbishment of fire stations and the purchase of appliances and equipment; the development and updating of the fire and emergency planning framework and guidance; the promotion of training, assisted by the Fire Services Council, and other initiatives.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government (Mr. N. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government's overall housing strategy is to increase housing supply to meet demand and to improve affordability, particularly for first-time buyers. Arising from this strategy, 2002 was the eighth successive year of record house completions with 57,695 units completed, an increase in output of 9.7% on 2001. A further substantial increase in housing output is anticipated for 2003.</P>
      <P>Under the Planning and Development Act 2000, each planning authority was required to prepare a housing strategy which would form an integral part of the development plan and provide the cornerstone for future housing policy within the functional area of the authority. All planning authorities have drawn up housing strategies and some are in the process of reviewing them in the context of preparing new development plans. Others may be reviewed in the context of the requirement to review existing development plans after two years.</P>
      <P>Housing strategies are required to address the housing needs of all sectors of the existing and future population in the area of the development plan including first-time buyers, the elderly, people with disabilities, students etc. The strategies should provide for an appropriate mix of dwelling types and size to cater for the range of housing needs, and must also encourage mixed and balanced communities in order to counteract undue social segregation.</P>
      <P>These housing strategies form a part of the development plan. It is open to the Minister, under the Planning and Development Acts, to issue policy directives to planning authorities regarding their functions under the Act and, specifically, development plans and planning authorities must comply with any such directives.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Apart from these powers, there is ongoing contact at ministerial and official level with local authorities to ensure that Government policies are implemented at local level. In this regard, it <Col N="926" />is clear that local authorities have made great strides in terms of dealing with the unprecedented demand for housing. Investment in servicing land resulted in a six year supply of serviced residential land nationally, with the potential to deliver 328,000 units stock nationally, and overall output has risen by 48.5% since 1997. Furthermore, local authorities have both facilitated and been directly involved in increased provision of social and affordable programmes targeted at low income groups. Through these ongoing contacts, I will continue to encourage local authorities in the vital role they play in underpinning housing development.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 155 and 156 together.</P>
      <P>The term &ldquo;medieval&rdquo; is now generally understood to mean the period from the mid-fifth century AD to the mid-sixteenth century AD. It is not possible at this time to estimate the total number of known archaeological monuments and sites of all categories falling within that period in the records of the Archaeological Survey of Ireland. However, it would be a substantial percentage of the approximately 120,000 monuments and sites entered in the record of monuments and places established under section 12 of the National Monuments (Amendment) Act 1994. All such sites are protected under the National Monuments Acts 1930-1994.</P>
      <P>The archaeological excavation of medieval sites, other than in mitigation of development impacts, is carried out under either programmes of conservation works at monuments or research projects. To date an estimated 250 archaeological excavations have been carried out on this basis by my Department and its predecessors or by other authorised archaeological teams at medieval sites of all categories. Similar excavations in the future will take place in accordance with the deployment of proposed conservation or research projects.</P>

      <P>My Department continues to assist a wide range of capital projects at heritage sites throughout the country under the relevant sub-measure of the national development plan. Most benefiting properties would form part of my Department's portfolio of some 740 properties in State care and ownership. Examples of these are the refurbishment of the Palm House in the National Botanic Gardens and restoration works at Castletown House. In addition, my Department continues to undertake minor conservation, maintenance and improvement works at heritage sites as the need arises and resources permit.</P>
      <P>Generally, heritage sites and houses are protected through a variety of legal mechanisms. Statutory protection of the architectural heritage is afforded through the provisions of the Planning and Development Act 2000. This legislation places a duty of care on the owners of protected structures and also gives enhanced powers of enforcement to planning authorities. My Department provides advice to planning authorities in the exercise of their functions.</P>
      <P>Under the provisions of the Act, each planning authority is required, for the purpose of protecting structures or parts of structures which are of special architectural, historical, archaeological, artistic, cultural, scientific, social or technical interest, to include in its development plan a record of protected structures within its functional area.</P>
      <P>This use of the Planning and Development Acts and the completion of surveys such as my Department's national inventory of architectural heritage are important methods of assisting in the protection of the architectural heritage in private ownership.</P>
      <P>My Department also operates a number of measures which provide assistance towards the cost of conserving our architectural heritage and the Heritage Council, which is funded by my Department, also provides grant aid for architectural conservation projects. Under section 482 of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997, the Revenue Commissioners allow owners/occupiers to avail of tax relief in respect of expenditure incurred in the repair, maintenance or restoration of an approved building.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Significant further extension of the existing State-owned portfolio of over 740 national monuments and historic properties that are in the care of my Department cannot realistically be contem<Col N="928" />plated because of the financial implications. The costs of maintaining this portfolio are already very significant and therefore innovative alternatives to further State acquisition to ensure the protection of landmark heritage properties under threat need to be explored. In light of this, I recently initiated the first steps of an examination into the issue of facilitating the emergence of trust-type organisations which might, independently of Government and with minimal State aid, acquire and manage such heritage properties.</P>

She has income which is not consistent with her declared means and she has failed to explain the discrepancy to date. The information to hand does not address this issue.</P>
      <P>Under social welfare legislation decisions in relation to claims must be made by deciding officers and appeals officers. These officers are statutorily appointed and I have no role in regard to making such decisions.</P>

      <P>Social welfare legislation provides for the assessment of benefit and privilege where a person is living with a parent or step-parent in the family home and is aged 29 years or under. In assessing an applicant's means for unemployment assistance purposes, account is taken of the value of any benefit and privilege enjoyed, such as that of free board and lodging in the family home. The value of the free board and lodging enjoyed by an applicant is determined by reference to the <Col N="930" />parental income. Parents' income from all sources is taken into consideration for this purpose with the exception of payments made by this Department and the health boards.</P>
      <P>Parental income is calculated as gross income less tax, PRSI, health insurance contributions, superannuation and union dues. Rent or mortgage repayments and reasonable travelling expenses are disregarded, where appropriate, and a parental allowance is also deducted. The balance is then divided by the number of non-earning members of the household and the figure arrived at is applied as means to the unemployment assistance applicant.</P>
      <P>The maximum assessment that can be applied to any applicant in respect of the value of free board and lodging is limited to 17% of net parental income. In addition, where a person returns to the parental home having had an independent lifestyle for at least three years, the assessment is limited to &euro;7 per week irrespective of parental income. Where a person's means are derived solely from the value of free board and lodging in the family home and where he or she is entitled to a minimum payment, that payment is increased to &euro;31.80 per week.</P>
      <P>Social welfare legislation also provides for the assessment of income from spouse/partner's earnings for unemployment assistance purposes. In assessing the means, account is taken of the spouse/partner's gross earnings from insurable employment, less income tax, PRSI, health insurance contributions, superannuation and union dues. A certain amount of the spouse/partner's earnings from employment is also disregarded depending on the level of employment. The balance is then halved and assessed as means. Where the spouse/partner is self-employed, earnings are assessed as gross income less expenses necessarily incurred. The minimum unemployment assistance payment is 10% per week where a person's means are derived from any source other than the value of free board and lodging in the family home.</P>

      <Quest>if the Government's stated objective to increase child benefit to a higher level still stands; if the value has been indexed up to take account of inflation; and the target level in this regard.</Quest>

      <P>The Deputy is no doubt aware that it has been a priority of this Government to invest significant resources in the child benefit, CB, scheme. This approach was demonstrated by the announcement in budget 2001 of an investment package which, on completion, will see Government investment in the scheme rise by an additional &euro;1.27 billion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="931" />The National Action Plan against Poverty and Social Exclusion 2003-2005 confirms the Government's commitment to increase the minimum social welfare adult payment rate to &euro;150 per <Col N="932" />week by 2007, with the combined level of child benefit and child dependant allowance indexed to 33%-35% of this rate. The question of increases in child benefit in 2004 is a matter for consideration in the context of the forthcoming budget.</P>
