      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 1 to 6, inclusive, together.</P>
      <P>As Deputies will recall, I reported to the House on 1 October 2003 that I attended the inaugural meeting on Sustaining Progress on 18 July 2003, together with the Tánaiste and the Minister for Finance. In addition to my annual attendance at the July plenary meeting, I meet representatives of individual partner organisations on a regular basis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As Deputies will also be aware, the second Sustaining Progress plenary meeting took place on 24 October 2003 in Dublin Castle. I did not attend this meeting but was represented by officials from my Department. Presentations were made by the Department of Finance on the medium-term economic outlook and the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, in conjunction with the Department of Education and Science, on lifelong learning. A presentation was also made by the ESRI on the mid-term eval<Col N="3" />uation of the national development plan and a detailed progress report on the implementation of Sustaining Progress was presented to the social partners. A copy of the report and relevant PowerPoint presentations have been laid in the Oireachtas Library.</P>
    <P>As Deputies are aware, the membership of the community and voluntary pillar of social partnership was expanded following on from ratification of Sustaining Progress. The pillar now has 15 member organisations which have endorsed Sustaining Progress, six on an individual basis and nine in the strands of older people, disability, housing, children, rural, local-voluntary and care. The membership of the pillar changed as a result of a review of participation in social partnership, which included an examination of ways in which to maximise the potential contribution of the community and voluntary pillar, and the decision of two organisations not to accept Sustaining Progress.</P>
    <P>In regard to those community and voluntary organisations which have not ratified Sustaining Progress, Departments have been advised that there may be areas in which the expertise of these organisations or their constituent members will be relevant to the policymaking and implementation process. These organisations may be invited to participate on particular committees or working groups in light of their particular expertise. This will be determined by the nature of the task or issue in question and is primarily a matter for each Department.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeHiggins" hpid="Mr. J. Higgins Mr. J. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Taoiseach agree that the latest report from the National Competitiveness Council showing this State as the most expensive country, along with Finland, in the eurozone for goods and services, makes a mockery of the idea that there is any real sense of social partnership between workers, employers who supply the services and the Government, and against a background in which the council noted that of 16 states, this State has the second worst rate of consumer price rises, the fourth most expensive insurance premiums and so forth?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Is it not the case that what are called partnership deals are little more than devices to hold workers' wage increases to a minimum, while allowing unrestrained profiteering in key parts of the services sector, housing and other areas? Does the Taoiseach agree that against this background the initials ROI, which usually refer to the Republic of Ireland, could just as easily stand for &ldquo;Rip-off Ireland&rdquo;, over which his Government presides? Will he take responsibility for this situation, given that his Government has taken no effective action to reduce massive inflation and has been responsible for much of it through its regime of stealth taxes? What does he propose to do to give <Col N="4" />meaning to his claim that there is social partnership?</P>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>In Sustaining Progress, pay is a small part of the initiatives agreed by the social partners. I do not accept that they are minimalist rates of pay. They are higher than those in almost any of the other 12 or 15 EU countries. I am afraid that contention falls at the start.</P>
      <P>As regards employment, competitiveness and reducing unemployment, the Deputy mentioned a few issues, such as insurance costs. The Government has introduced legislation and a range of initiatives which we hope will deal with that issue. One of the problems is that we need more competition. While we can deal with some of the legislative and legal mechanisms in the two Bills, we need competition to try to get a broader range in the market. As regards other issues, such as public expenditure, the national development plan, infrastructure and development, taxation and affordable housing, progress is being made on all the special initiatives associated with social partnership. The latest reports show that there has been substantial ongoing progress in these areas in this calendar year, the first year out of three. The Government must continue to work with the social partners and the organisations to implement the programmes.</P>
      <P>Although this has been a difficult year, following a three year international economic downturn, we have still had great success in terms of low unemployment rates, an increase in employment and a reduction in inflation. I readily admitted at the start of the year that inflation was a major issue. However, our efforts are bearing fruit. We must continue in every way we can to work with the social partners and others to reduce inflation. The figure is encouraging compared to that at the start of the year when it was in excess of 5%. The figure is now closer to the EU average.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny" hpid="Mr. Kenny Mr. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>Was the Taoiseach concerned about the comment by IBEC's director general, Mr. Brendan Butler, during the negotiations on Sustaining Progress that IBEC would not support development levies? There is a disparity between various areas of the country which will give rise to regional imbalance. The charge levied by Fingal County Council for a 10,000 square meter industrial development, for example, is &euro;1 million. However, south Tipperary County Council charges &euro;750,000, while Sligo County Council charges &euro;155,000. Has the Taoiseach discussed the development levies with the unions in view of the comments by the director general of IBEC?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The development levies were not part of the discussions on Sustaining Progress. Many of these issues are market led and market driven. The development charges in this city were unanimously fixed last night by the city council. They are bound to be different across the country, depending on the market. As regards what <Col N="5" />the market achieves and how it operates, regardless of the price the market fixes, it is a case of what price can be achieved. It is good that some of the developers' profits are drawn back in development levies.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>As regards the provision for a joint consultative committee on social issues, was that committee used for the purpose of consultation on 24 October or on any date about the cuts of &euro;58 million in social welfare which were subsequently imposed in the Book of Estimates?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The increases or tightening of the subheads were not discussed in any year with the social partners.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not ask the Taoiseach if many of the increases, which are properly a budgetary matter, were discussed, but whether there is any point having such a joint consultative committee if prospective cuts were not discussed with it. What is the meaning of partnership if the partners which are party to the joint consultative committee were not consulted? Does the Taoiseach not agree this matter has serious implications?</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>I asked the Taoiseach if he agrees this matter has serious implications. That is the best I can do as regards a question.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>With the utmost respect, a Cheann Comhairle, I suggest you do the same.</P>
      <P>Does the Taoiseach not agree that for the people most adversely impacted upon by these cuts, the joint consultative committee would have been an appropriate place for them to be discussed?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>What I stated to the Deputy, and he obviously did not hear the first part of my response, was that any tightening up or increases in any of the subheads or schemes, are not discussed. I dealt with the point he raised.</P>
      <P>Within Sustaining Progress, or any of the programmes, discussions always take place around social welfare issues and the anti-poverty strategy, on the challenges we have to face and the targets we have to reach. They are issues that are discussed every year and taken into account. Individual areas in the Book of Estimates are not the subject of those discussions and never have been.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent" hpid="Mr. Sargent Mr. Sargent">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
      <P>Sustaining Progress seems to be in increasing difficulty. Would the Taoiseach agree that Ireland has the lowest expenditure on social provision in the EU, in both GDP and GNP terms, and that 300,000 children are living in pov<Col N="6" />erty, according to the Society of St. Vincent de Paul? In view of this, what is the prognosis for the ten key economic and social policy issues, the special initiatives, dealing with housing, accommodation, ending child poverty, etc.? What promises did the Taoiseach give to the social partners on these issues in October? Is there a clear difficulty for the Government which has to resort to non-payment of increases if there is any sign of industrial action? Does that not indicate the need to sit down again with the social partners to avoid the likelihood of serious industrial unrest, whether involving teachers, junior doctors, nurses, Land Registry workers, binmen, Defence Force personnel, Aer Rianta staff, Cork CSO workers, the list goes on?</P>
      <P>Is there not a need for the Taoiseach to look at this again and resolve much of this industrial unrest before it affects us all?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Thankfully, this year has seen some of the lowest levels of industrial unrest across the public and private sectors. The Deputy asked about the special initiatives, all of which are being worked on. There are regular meetings of the social partners on the subject, there is close liaison on the issue and a complete exchange of views. The recent report gives an update on those issues. There will be another report next month, at the next meeting of the social partners in January, which will take the year as a whole into account. There has been substantial progress in a number of these areas, taking into account that it is the first year of three. In the housing area, and all of the other areas, there has been a large amount of progress.</P>
      <P>There is no need for me to go through the updated report with a blow by blow account, all the issues have been documented in every area. I hope we can continue with the aims of the report. Some involve resources, some are system issues, but we have made considerable progress on all of them.</P>

      <NameTxt>Caoimhghín Ó Caoláin</NameTxt>
      <P>Has the Taoiseach taken the opportunity, in his most recent meeting with IBEC, or at any time previously, to raise the quite excessive increases in pay to Irish company executives? In its most recent report the Irish Management Institute states that Irish company executives have secured pay increases of the order of 50%. In contrast, under Sustaining Progress ordinary workers have been restricted over a two year period to a 7% pay rise. There is a stark contrast between these two realities. How does the Taoiseach view partnership in terms of those figures?</P>
      <P>A key component of partnership agreements has been the addressing of poverty. It has been reported that some 300,000 children are living in poverty.</P>

      <NameTxt>Caoimhghín Ó Caoláin</NameTxt>
      <P>Their families are earning less than &euro;147 per week. Does the Taoiseach accept those figures? He has rejected them in the past. The figures were presented by the Combat Poverty Agency and supported by the Society of St. Vincent de Paul. They are provided by the people who are at the coalface, trying to address poverty in our communities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is talking about private sector companies and executives. Only a small number of people receive the increases he mentioned &ndash; most do not. The private sector would argue that this year the public sector has done better than it has. It must be admitted there are highly paid people &ndash; one is sometimes staggered at the salaries they receive. However, this is in the private sector market and if an executive does not get it right he or she &ndash; and possibly the company &ndash; is out the door. That has happened many times this year. Company boards must take this into account. In many cases people are receiving bonuses and working under other arrangements. There is not much we can do about it. Not many people have received increases such as these, although some have. It is not possible to regulate this.</P>
      <P>Many of the companies whose executives have received large salary increases also have good share options and so on for the staff. These arrangements often drive each other. I will not mention any names but one can see that some of the companies that give large increases to their executives also pay their staff the highest amounts. One can see these figures in the IR news any week. There is always a similarity between salaries of the executives and those of the staff. However, I am surprised at the figures &ndash; it is nice work if one can get it.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Kenny asked me that question last week and I answered it. I know what the figures are based on, as does the Minister for Social and Family Affairs. The Government is continuing to deal with this issue. Eight of the ten initiatives under Sustaining Progress have a clear focus on social inclusion, ending child poverty, tackling disadvantage and long-term unemployment and helping vulnerable workers and those who have been made redundant. We remain committed to the implementation of all these initiatives, which have received substantial resources. Most of our resources go into this area in one form or another, going towards education, social welfare and health. We have an enormous welfare budget and there are many initiatives in the area of disadvantaged education which were not <Col N="8" />there five years ago. All these initiatives are linked into the national anti-poverty strategy and are designed to assist in areas of need.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny" hpid="Mr. Kenny Mr. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>Did the Taoiseach take note of the recent comment by Dr. Rory O'Donnell, director of the National Economic and Social Council, that the public wanted solutions rather than an ideological impasse? I am sure that the Taoiseach, as Head of Government, cannot be too pleased with many elements of society. A typical example was given in yesterday's &ldquo;Prime Time&rdquo; programme about very young people being involved in crime.</P>
      <P>Does the Taoiseach not feel the need for a redirection of social partnership? Everyone makes his or her own case and that is fair enough. The voluntary sector has pulled out of social partnership and yet it is obvious that, whereas investment that leads to ghettos breeds criminality and investment that leads to sprawling urban estates results in vandalism and opportunities for delinquency, investment in people deals with the issues of poverty and educational disadvantage. These issues will remain critical for the next 20 years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle An Ceann Comhairle">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>What is the Deputy's question?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny" hpid="Mr. Kenny Mr. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Taoiseach believe that the social partnership model has been successful in attempting to grapple or cope with the problems of society which have the potential to give rise to huge costs?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a broad question. I remind the Deputy that, while social partnership covers many of the issues, it does not cover everything in society. It covers a broad agenda of employers, employees, farmers, and small and big business people. The community pillar is still involved. Some groups have pulled out but others have come in. In many ways it is stronger now than it was. A broader range of groups is included. There is a greater balance between older people, disability and equality than heretofore. The outside groups are accessible when they wish to have a say and when it is felt they should be communicated with.</P>
      <P>Some of the other issues remain within Departments. I recall many of the challenges with which the Deputy and I would have had to deal 20 years ago, for example, in the mid-1980s when the drugs issue began to take hold and escalate and there was 20% unemployment and enormous social problems. Today, with 4% unemployment, half the European average, a huge amount of money is being invested to tackle educational disadvantage. That should be compared with the state of disadvantaged communities a decade ago. All parties in the House who were in Government during that period can take credit for tackling disadvantage in the meantime and making a success of it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="9" />Formerly, it was just school teachers at the coalface. Now there are teachers involved in home liaison and dealing with disadvantage. There are breakfast and lunch clubs, enormous inputs into classroom assistance, and a huge resource input allied to low unemployment. The underlying reasons linking unemployment to deprivation are not present anymore. There still is crime, and drug-related crime, in some communities and that is what has to be tackled.</P>
    <P>In my constituency in the heart of inner city Dublin the type of criminality that remains does not encompass the masses of poorer people, but there are certainly elements of crime that are drug-related. That remains and must be dealt with. However, the major rejuvenation of places such as Cherry Orchard, Ballymun and other difficult areas may be seen, where vast amounts of money and resources have been invested which could not have been before. That is why we must deal with our criminal problems, but we should acknowledge the vast amount of resources being invested, not least in education. Significantly more educational schemes are available now than were on offer a decade ago.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>Was the question of housing discussed at the meeting of 24 October, specifically the provision of an additional 10,000 social houses? Has an assessment been made of how many will be provided at the end of this calendar year? Is the Taoiseach still optimistic that they will be delivered within the lifetime of the programme?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The housing issue is raised at all meetings because it is one of the key areas. The Government was committed under Sustaining Progress to an ambitious scale of delivery of affordable housing. The affordable housing initiative has been announced. The announcement of sites in Dublin, Meath and Kildare was made in the summer. The availability of other sites has been discussed since. Implementation meetings have been held with all the relevant local authorities on the form of the scheme, which the social partners favour. It will endeavour to help people who traditionally would have been able to afford their own home but who cannot now do so.</P>
      <P>The Government is working with the parties to agree the precise terms of the initiative and to obtain more sites. The aim is to obtain approximately 10,000 sites. I am not sure if the full range of sites will be available, but a considerable number of areas in the greater Dublin region and around other cities are being considered. The implementation of the initiative is a priority for the Government. I am not sure what the figures are for this year but the aim is to try to make available approximately 10,000 sites during the course of the programme.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
      <P>On the discussions that have taken place regarding concerns among civil servants, particularly lower paid civil servants, is the Taoiseach aware of some of these concerns which relate not just to pay rises, small as this may be compared to some of their higher paid colleagues, but also to the Civil Service Regulation (Amendment) Bill, which puts the responsibility on Secretaries General to hire and fire civil servants? Given that lower paid civil servants may wish to stand for election, for example, the pressure and work-related stress on such people give rise to concern about the Government's intention to introduce legislation to penalise civil servants based on performance and extend the scope of the Unfair Dismissals Act. Has the issue been discussed not just with higher paid civil servants but with representatives of lower paid civil servants who sometimes feel under the cosh of their Civil Service colleagues in upper grades?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>All civil servants are represented in Sustaining Progress, including large numbers of civil servants in the lower grades. I do not think the issue the Deputy raised has been discussed but clear guidelines are laid down in the Civil Service which have long since been tested and found to be workable. If he is referring to individuals, the procedures are in place which have been tested. People have a right to the protections which exist.</P>
      <P>On the changes to which the Deputy referred, as part of the overall benchmarking process it was agreed that the old centrally regulated system would be amended. Under the new system Departments will have more autonomy. They will be able to discipline and recruit staff and deal with other matters on a local basis, which makes more sense. It will also allow for more flexibility. Obviously on rare occasions it will mean that people can be disciplined or dismissed by the Secretary General rather than by way of the centralised basis. The same rules will apply but there will be more flexibility for dealing with issues more speedily. Up to now we have been operating under the 1924 Act, which has been amended and updated. Many of these issues have been negotiated under the benchmarking process and the Civil Service, by and large, is in favour of the changes.</P>

      <P>The National Competitive Council has found that average price levels in this State are 12% above the EU average. Does the Taoiseach agree that after six and a half years in Government, his solution to this rip-off which calls for more competition, sounds hollow to ordinary working people and poor people who are suffering the impact of these rip-off prices? Is he aware that many of us suspect that informal, if not formal, cartels among key service providers ensure prices are kept high? Will he agree that in his reply he reflected the admonition of the Tánaiste, who is supposed to be responsible for this area, that we should all shop around, as if to <Col N="11" />say we should all become shopaholics and somehow prices might drop dramatically? If we put into effect the Tánaiste's admonition&mdash;</P>

Will the Taoiseach agree that if we tried to put into effect the Tánaiste's admonition in Dublin city centre in looking for a reasonably priced drink, we would all become alcoholics not shopaholics before reaching our goal?

      <P>I mentioned competition in the area of insurance, which was the particular area I was thinking of when replying to Deputy Rabbitte. One can deal with the legal, legislative and administrative areas of the insurance issue, and surveys have shown that prices have come down during the past three or four months by approximately 3% but to make a huge impact it is necessary to get more companies into the market. The Government is very focused on that issue and is endeavouring to attract other companies into the market. That is necessary in other areas as well. I have read the report on the catering area. Why is it that the south of Spain and some other parts of Europe are cheaper? The adult rates are &euro;3.50 while our minimum rate is &euro;7.

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>In the areas of the private sector where people fix and receive large increases, the Government cannot dictate those prices or rates and people in many areas of the private sector receive them. A few chief executives receive very high salaries which are much higher than those paid in political life or the public sector. That is the reality. These companies would not recruit responsible or dynamic people for their industries if they did not pay these rates. The rates are fixed by the market and there is no legislation to control them. If people price themselves out of the market with these rates, they will create difficulties for themselves, but it is not an issue the Government can or should control.</P>
      <P>On welfare, through the NAPS the social partners have the opportunity to give their views on payment rates, and groups dealing with older people give their views to the Minister through the Irish Senior Citizens Parliament. The Minister for Social and Family Affairs, while preparing for the publication of the Book of Estimates, meets all groups dealing with poverty, deprivation, social disadvantage and carers. That happened this year as it does every year.</P>
      <P>Deputy Stanton asked about the youth sector. It has always been involved in the social partnership process and the funding generated in that sector in the past 15 years is as a result of this interaction. It is still evolving and the sum outlined in the Book of Estimates for the sector is sizeable.</P>
      <P>Deputy Rabbitte asked if any of the houses I announced at the ICTU conference at the end of July had been built yet. They have not been built because the land was the property of the State and it is now handing over the land for the construction of houses. The work is ongoing and building will take place but it is unreasonable to think that the houses would be built only four months later.</P>
      <P>Deputy Finian McGrath asked about the discussion of issues of social inclusion. Discussion of these issues has been one of the major successes of social partnership, with a focus on areas of disadvantage, especially in education where vast amounts of resources, mainly additional teachers, have been provided in areas of social exclusion. There is no doubt this work has been a success. Deputy Finian McGrath took an interest in this throughout his professional career before entering the House. There has been enormous success in the area and we have all seen its benefits. The long-term benefit is already being seen in many communities and we will continue with our efforts.</P>
      <P>Disability issues are regularly discussed and that helped in the formulation of the Education for Persons with Disabilities Bill. An enormous range of services are being improved for those with disabilities and that work will continue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="15" />Deputy Durkan asked about Ballymun, Ballybough, Neilstown and similar areas. In almost all those areas, not only through social partnership but also through the national development plan, we have seen substantial progress in rejuvenation and improving the quality of houses and facilities. Many of these areas were built without schools, community facilities or health centres. The benefits of the Celtic tiger were seen in these areas with the construction of the arts centre in Ballymun and the rejuvenation of sporting facilities. It has been a good thing but it must continue because it will not all be done in four or five years. There have been dramatic improvements in Tallaght and Blanchardstown and other similar areas.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan" hpid="Mary Coughlan Mary Coughlan">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Social and Family Affairs (Mary Coughlan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 57 and 61 together.</P>
      <P>Under the terms of the supplementary welfare allowance scheme administered on behalf of my Department by the health boards, payment of a weekly or monthly supplement maybe made in respect of rent to eligible people in the State whose means are insufficient to meet their needs after they pay their rent.</P>
      <P>The purpose of the supplementary welfare allowance scheme is to deal with emergencies and short-term needs that arise when a person suffers a change in circumstances, for example, when a tenant becomes unemployed and can no longer afford his or her rent. Rent supplements were never intended to meet a person's long-term housing needs. The scheme is not a housing programme, but over the years it has in practice become such. It does not make sense to have two parallel but entirely separate programmes, one operated by the housing authorities and the other by the health boards.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="16" />The rent supplement scheme does not give a good long-term outcome to the individual. Such people have limited security of tenure, their accommodation standards can sometimes be poor and they must remain on social welfare in order to retain their accommodation. Neither does the scheme give a good outcome to the State, as it provides poor long-term value for money and in effect by-passes the priorities set by the local authorities in their housing programmes. This is why I have taken a number of initiatives in this area.</P>
    <P>First, rent supplement will be payable only where, at the time of application, the person has been in rented accommodation for a period of six months. Provision will, however, be made for cases where a housing authority designates that a person is homeless or a person has been identified by a housing authority as having a housing need which cannot be met by the housing authority, by a voluntary housing organisation or by the person concerned. This will help re-focus the rent supplement scheme on its original objective of short-term support.</P>
    <P>Second, rent supplement claimants will be referred to a housing authority for an assessment of their housing needs in a more systematic manner. This will provide the housing authority with a more accurate picture of the long-term housing needs of those living in its area.</P>
    <P>Following a meeting I had with the chief executive officers of the health boards earlier this year, four pilot projects were set up in Donegal, Fingal, Cork and Offaly to address this issue. The relevant officials from the health board, the local authority and my own Department's local office met to make practical progress in meeting the needs of people relying on rent supplement on a long-term basis.</P>
    <P>Discussions between my Department and the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government on the future of rent assistance are well advanced, and I expect that concrete, positive proposals will be agreed shortly to determine the appropriate roles of local authorities and my Department in relation to people on rent supplement with long-term housing needs. In the meantime, I recognise that there will be situations where rent supplement is the only viable solution available to meet the needs of some people who have not been renting for six months. Rent supplement will continue to be available to people with housing needs whose safety or well-being is at risk, such as people with disabilities, the elderly or those experiencing severe social problems. With the involvement of the housing authorities, full and sympathetic consideration will be given to the needs of these people in implementing the new rent arrangements.</P>
    <P>I know that Deputies on all sides of the House agree with me that having unconnected housing programmes is inappropriate, unfair and unsustainable. I am determined to make progress in <Col N="17" />tackling this, to achieve a better outcome for all concerned.</P>
    <P>With regard to the maximum rent levels that will apply in 2004 for the purpose of the rent supplement scheme, I will be drawing up regulations this month. Deputies can be assured that the limits will be realistic, as were the limits I set last year.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelRing" hpid="Mr. Ring Mr. Ring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ring</NameTxt>
      <P>How does the Minister expect someone who is on social welfare and in need of housing to have six months' rent along with a deposit for a landlord? Where does she expect such people to get the money? If they borrow it from a family member, a friend, from the Society of St. Vincent de Paul or someone else, will the Department say after six months that the person had the money for the last six months and can therefore be expected to get it for the next six months? This cuts aid to the poor. It is an attack on the most vulnerable in our society. Government, in particular this Government, has failed to provide housing for the most needy in society.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mary Coughlan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is unviable on the basis that it can often be to the detriment of the person in need of housing. In many county council areas one will often find that people determined by the housing authority as being in adequate accommodation and in receipt of rent supplement are not given priority on the housing list. They often remain on the housing list, and that is unfair and untenable for those people.</P>
      <P>What I have decided to do is for the first time to reform SWA. Expenditure on SWA has increased up to more than &euro;500 million this year. One of the issues adverted to by Deputy Ring is controls. There are controls within the health regulations and the legislation. The Deputy and I know that there are abuses of the system.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mary Coughlan</NameTxt>
      <P>I will be dealing wholeheartedly with them. The Deputy is also aware of the lack of interaction between my Department &ndash; because it is not a housing authority &ndash; and the housing authority itself. I alluded in my response to the pilot projects which are given very practical and tangible solutions to dealing with the issues that are to the fore regarding SWA.</P>
      <P>SWA was started in 1971 for single men. That is what it was introduced for. It has now expanded into complete and wholehearted housing support. The Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Cullen, is providing more than &euro;1.9 billion this year to address housing needs. One can jump up and down and say that is not enough, and that might be a fair point, but equated to that, it is wrong to approve of an expansion of a scheme which is not a housing scheme but a short-term emergency measure. Having been set up for single men, it was directed as an emergency measure for someone who had lost a job and could not afford rent or mortgage payments until regaining employment.</P>

In balancing the scheme, those in most need, those determined by the housing authority as being in an emergency situation, those in violent homes and the disabled will be cared for within the regulations I will be signing.

      <NameTxt>Ms Harkin</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister said during the Estimates debate and in the House again today that the purpose of rent supplement is to meet income maintenance needs, not long-term housing needs. Is the Minister not fully aware that since the introduction of this scheme it has changed totally and radically? It is no longer a safety net. The rent supplement is replacing, or has itself become, a form of social housing. While I have no doubt that there is inter-Departmental bickering and infighting, the Minister is surely aware that the people who will suffer from this are those who need housing. Is the Minister aware that there are more than 700 people on the Sligo Borough Council waiting list for housing, and more than 800 on the Sligo County Council list?</P>
      <P>The Minister says the rent supplement is poor value for money and is detrimental to those looking for housing. Since there is no housing available for these people, how can the Minister say it is to their detriment? The Minister has today said there are abuses in the system. If that is so, why does she not deal with abuses as they occur, instead of making everyone suffer?</P>
      <P>Relating to the second part of my question, the cap on rent supplements, I have asked the Minister this question on many occasions in this House. The buck stops with the Minister. Why has she not made an effort during 2003 to increase the cap on rent supplement levels in the North-Western Health Board area? The Minister said this is the result of local democracy in action but it is her responsibility to see that people in the North-Western Health Board area do not have to live in sheds rather than in proper housing.</P>

      <P>I remember having a barrage of questions directed at me by apoplectic Labour Party Members who spoke about a draconian measure of rent capping. They claimed that 90% of the nation would be on the street the following morning. Not one person was made homeless by that measure because I introduced safety nets for particular people.

      <Quest>if her attention has been drawn to the serious concern expressed by a wide range of organisations that deal on a daily basis with persons on low income regarding the impact of the cuts in 16 schemes announced by her on 13 November 2003; if, in view of the potential hardship these cuts will cause to people on low incomes, she will now consider these proposals; and if she will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Mary Coughlan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Abridged Estimates published on 13 November provided a total allocation for social welfare spending in 2004 of &euro;10.65 billion. This represents an increase of &euro;358 million on the 2003 allocation. It might be remembered that the Abridged Estimates do not include the additional expenditure for social welfare payments and programmes which will be announced in the budget tomorrow.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="21" />In the interests of prudent management of the public finances and so as to remain within guidelines for spending growth agreed by the Government, my Department reviews spending programmes on an ongoing basis to ensure that programme objectives are still valid and are still being met in the most efficient and effective way.</P>
    <P>Following this review, a number of measures to control spending are included in the 2004 Abridged Estimates. The details of all of these measures were set out in a press statement on the day of the publication of the Estimates. The combined saving from these measures is estimated at &euro;55.8 million or 0.5% of the total value of social welfare spending. This must be compared with the fact that spending is rising by 3.5% compared with the 2003 allocation even before provision is made for budget changes.</P>
    <P>Leaving aside the predictable reaction from Deputies who see in the measures which have been taken an opportunity to make political points, the concerns of groups dealing with people on low incomes have focused on a small number of the measures which have been taken. When the purpose and precise nature of those measures have been explained it is clear there is an objective justification for them and the impact of them will not be as some people have claimed.</P>
    <P>The measures I am putting in place represent a necessary and reasonable response in light of the experience of the operation of the schemes in question and of the need for proper management of the finances available for social welfare expenditure. The Government has increased the overall level of expenditure on social welfare payments in the last four years far beyond anything that was achieved by previous Governments and we are committed to further significantly improving the rates of payment in the years ahead. The adjustments which I am now making, by ensuring that expenditure is better targeted and in accordance with the original Estimates when various increases were put in place, will enable the provision of the necessary resources to improve the basic system for claimants generally.</P>
    <P>Some of the measures now being taken will only have an impact on payments where family income is relatively significant. Some are being undertaken so as to refocus a scheme more effectively on a group for which it was originally intended. Others are being introduced simply to increase income thresholds or limits in line with increases in payments generally. I do not anticipate that the measures will lead to hardship among social welfare recipients.</P>
    <P>Where legislation needs to be amended or regulations enacted such as is the case with supplementary welfare allowance, I will ensure in the context of preparing such legislation that any cases of genuine difficulty are avoided.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamPenrose" hpid="Mr. Penrose Mr. Penrose">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Penrose</NameTxt>
      <P>It is incredible that someone could design such a mean-spirited set of cuts to impact most disproportionately on the poor and those least able to bear them. A drop of &euro;58 mill<Col N="22" />ion is relatively small but for individual recipients, of the dietary allowance for example, the amounts are critical. A loaf of gluten-free bread, for example, costs &euro;4.90 compared with &euro;1.30 for ordinary bread. Other programmes were designed to give people a better quality of life. How can the Minister ignore the voices of the 26 voluntary organisations on the community platform, who have registered a protest?</P>

      <askee>Minister for Social and Family Affairs</askee>
      <Quest>her views on the figures put forward by the Society of St. Vincent de Paul that 300,000 children now live in poverty in the State; and her views on the effect on these children of the social welfare cuts announced in the Estimates.</Quest>

    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan" hpid="Mary Coughlan Mary Coughlan">
      <NameTxt>Mary Coughlan</NameTxt>
      <P>The figures quoted by the Society of St. Vincent de Paul are primarily based on an analysis undertaken by the Economic and Social Research Institute of the results of the Living in Ireland surveys. They relate to the risk of poverty indicator used at EU level for comparison purposes which is defined by reference to an income threshold set at 60% of median income, adjusted for family size and composition using equivalence scales. The analysis undertaken by the ESRI indicates that, in 2001, some 21.9% of persons had incomes which fell below that threshold while for children the percentage was 23.4%. This equates to 280,000 children.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="24" />However, the indicator which underpins the national anti-poverty strategy, NAPS, is the consistent poverty indicator, independently formulated by the ESRI. This establishes the proportion of those below 50% to 60% of average disposable income and experiencing enforced basic deprivation. Basic deprivation refers to a set of eight indicators which were regarded as necessities and possessed by a majority of those in the Living in Ireland survey. Consistent poverty has been chosen as the global target under NAPS, because the inclusion of deprivation as well as income gives a better guide to those who experience poverty and are a priority for income and other supports.</P>
    <P>One of the more significant achievements of recent years has been the reduction in the level of consistent poverty among children from 24.8% in 1987 to 6.5% or approximately 74,000 children in 2001. This is due to major increases in employment participation, better jobs, significant real increases in social welfare payments, especially child income support, and improvements in education and other services. Given the further improvements made since 2001, especially in child income support, it is likely that this proportion is now even lower. The target under the national anti-poverty strategy is to reduce the percentage of children in consistent poverty to 2% and, if possible, eliminate it by 2007.</P>
    <P>The increase in the numbers at risk of poverty relates to the fact that many household incomes have risen rapidly during the recent economic boom for reasons which included more and better jobs, increased female participation in the workforce, tax reform and high earnings growth. While significant increases in real terms have been made in the incomes of those on lower earnings, including the introduction of the minimum wage, and in social welfare payments, including child income support, these improvements have lagged behind the rapid increases in incomes generally. As a result, the proportion below the rapidly increasing income threshold for this indicator has risen from 15.6% in 1994 to 21.9% in 2001, despite the substantial improvements made in the incomes of those on lower earnings and social welfare and the resulting significant improvement in their circumstances.</P>
    <P>The challenge of reducing the numbers of children at risk of poverty, as defined by the EU indicator, will best be addressed for most families by increased employment participation and the creation of better jobs. The Government's economic policy is primarily geared towards achieving that objective. At the same time, the obstacles to employment for lone parents and for parents of larger families which are at most risk of poverty must be removed.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanCroweSF" hpid="Mr. Crowe Mr. Crowe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crowe</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for her reply. Does she agree with the figure of 300,000 people living in poverty? There seems to be some confusion. In a recent address to the Society of St. Vincent de Paul, the Taoiseach also had difficult<Col N="25" />ies with these figures, yet the Combat Poverty Agency quotes similar figures and it is a statutory agency. The CPA quoted from the national action plan against poverty and social exclusion which stated the figure of 300,000 people.</P>
      <P>The Minister said that we are playing politics with these statistics but we are speaking up for people from disadvantaged areas who are the new poor. She speaks in terms of the way forward being through employment and that clearly is the case.</P>
      <P>What is the Minister's view of the Society of St. Vincent de Paul's report which states that the new poor are people on low salaries who are no longer eligible for medical cards and who are being hit by stealth taxes such as bin charges or hospital charges, for example? Is she aware of the statement by Threshold that up to 4,000 people a year will face the threat of homelessness because of the effective abolition of the supplementary welfare allowance? She is living in cloud cuckoo land if she believes her cuts will not affect the most vulnerable in society. These are the people who come to the clinics of every Deputy and who are being forced out of their homes.</P>
      <P>The Minister stated that community welfare officers will solve the problems. The reality is that it is difficult to obtain rent supplements for people. I recently dealt with a case in Galway where there was a major problem contacting the community welfare officer because the applicant could not prove that she was applying on a temporary basis. She had no alternative; it was either that or hostel accommodation. Unfortunately many families would not survive in hostel accommodation. We deal in our clinics with vulnerable young people and it is obvious that they would not survive in hostel accommodation. These cuts increasingly affect the most disadvantaged and the gap between rich and poor is widening.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mary Coughlan</NameTxt>
      <P>I re-emphasise that the issue of determinations and flexibility within the scheme will remain. People will be considered on the basis of flexibility. No one will be made homeless because of the changes within rent supplement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the poverty indicators, the Society of St. Vincent de Paul used a poverty indicator of &euro;175 per week, known as the &ldquo;at risk of poverty line&rdquo;, which only applies to single people. It is adjusted upwards for families. One third of that amount is added for each child. That is an example of the indicators given. We are not comparing like with like. While I do not suggest that, if poverty were eliminated in this country, all the Members of the House would not have <Col N="26" />done a good job, it is very easy to use terms such as &ldquo;consistent poverty&rdquo;, &ldquo;relative poverty&rdquo; and the EU indicator of &ldquo;at risk of poverty&rdquo;. The NAPS represents the targets set by the Government and is based on the definition of consistent poverty and deprivation.</P>
    <P>Relative poverty changes and increases on the basis of the gap between those who are employed and unemployed. It can often be an unfair indicator because relative poverty can be very different between those who are employed and unemployed. As the Deputy indicated, there can be relative poverty within a working population because it is relative to someone else. We can discuss indicators until the cows come home.</P>
    <P>The Deputy expressed a view that the Taoiseach did not agree with the Society of St. Vincent de Paul. The Taoiseach was correct because he was referring to the sum of &euro;175 per week as being the income for a single person. One must make additions to that in the case of family income. When one does not compare like with like, one arrives at different figures. My view is that the Government's policy of using the NAPS indicators, which are based on consistent poverty, is the best way forward.</P>
    <P>The Deputy is correct that employment is the best way of addressing the issue. The Government has made great strides in supporting people within deprived areas to re-enter education and in providing special programmes for mentoring and progressing them into work.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan" hpid="Mary Coughlan Mary Coughlan">
      <NameTxt>Mary Coughlan</NameTxt>
      <P>The back to education allowance is a second chance education opportunities programme designed to encourage and facilitate people on certain social welfare payments to improve their skills and qualifications and, therefore, their prospects of returning to the active work force.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At present, to qualify for participation an applicant must be, among other things, in receipt of a relevant social welfare payment for at least six months. The qualifying period will be increased from six months to 15 months for new applicants intending to commence third level <Col N="27" />courses of study, with effect from September 2004.</P>
    <P>The scheme was always intended for the benefit of people who had difficulty finding employment. For them, the scheme provided an opportunity which might enable them to improve their qualifications and thus their prospects of obtaining work. It was never intended to be an alternative form of support for people entering the third level education system.</P>
    <P>One of the factors that influenced me in changing the qualification conditions is the fact that, in practice, some people go on the live register for six months or so specifically to qualify for the back to education allowance. The scheme is intended to assist people with a history of long-term dependence on social welfare. It is not intended to be a parallel third level grant scheme for people who were already planning to study at third level.</P>
    <P>The same arguments do not apply at second level. The qualifying condition will remain at 6 months for people who wish to pursue a second level qualification. Time spent pursuing a second level course with the assistance of the back to education scheme will count towards meeting the 15-months qualification condition for the third level option.</P>
    <P>Participants already pursuing third level courses of study with the assistance of the scheme will not be affected by this change. In summary the change affects people who have been unemployed for less than 15 months and who wish to commence claiming the allowance in order to pursue a third level qualification.</P>
    <P>I have decided to restructure the back to education allowance in this way to ensure that this support retains its focus on the more vulnerable groups in our community, particularly people who do not have a second level education qualification and who are at risk of becoming dependent on social welfare payments on a long-term basis. I want to ensure that available resources are aimed at those in greatest need of an intervention to prevent them from drifting into long-term unemployment. This change recognises the more urgent need for intervention in the case of people who have not completed formal second level education.</P>
    <P>I believe I have ensured, in a situation where priorities had to be set and choices made, that those in the greatest need of assistance under the BTEA scheme have been protected.</P>

      <P>Are we not better off having people on social welfare in education to get them out of that trap? These people will go on to education, obtain jobs and so come out of the social welfare system.</P>
      <P>Last week, the Minister's colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy O'Dea, spoke at a committee of this House. He said that when the White Paper on Adult Education was available for consultation, everyone in the education sector said that if people could be dealt with within the first six months of unemployment, one would have a better chance of getting them into full-time education and qualifying. The Minister of State, Deputy O'Dea, said at the committee last week that the changes the Minister is making now are wrong and they will destroy the scheme. Why is the Minister doing that? We should be encouraging people who want to re-enter the education sector to do so.</P>
      <P>We saw the report on crime on the &ldquo;Prime Time&rdquo; programme on which one of the Minister's colleagues appeared. It would be better, however, to get people on social welfare into the education system so they can qualify from college and will never be on social welfare again. In that way they will be of benefit to the State.</P>
      <P>The back to education allowance scheme is affecting only 1,200 people and costs a mere &euro;2.2 million. Tomorrow, if the Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, wanted to tax the bloodstock industry he would take in one hundred times that figure. It is wrong to give tax relief to people like Alex Ferguson and other millionaires, while money is being taken from people who need education to re-enter the workforce. The Minister should ask her colleague, Deputy McCreevy, to go back to the old arrangement whereby the period of eligibility for the back to education allowance was six months. If such people re-enter full-time education, they will not have to rely on social welfare in future.</P>

      <P>The level of long-term unemployment has been reduced considerably. I will not comment on what the Minister of State, Deputy O'Dea, said because I do not know what he said. Deputy O'Dea and I have been working together with local social welfare offices to support those involved in the literacy and second chance education programmes. There are huge opportunities to get back into education. The most vulnerable people in second level who have absolutely no qualifications are being supported totally. Third level is not an option for everyone in receipt of unemployment or disability benefit. As the Deputy knows, there are abuses in the system. Let us refocus the scheme for those in most need of it.</P>
      <P>The Deputy asked what I was doing about the social welfare allowance scheme. It has been brought to my attention that we are paying for people from other EU countries, who are more than entitled to this scheme because they are from the EU. They make themselves unemployed and come over to Ireland for six months' craic. They apply for the back to education scheme, to which they are naturally entitled because they are EU citizens, but that is not what the scheme is for.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan" hpid="Mary Coughlan Mary Coughlan">
      <NameTxt>Mary Coughlan</NameTxt>
      <P>Subject to certain conditions, any person in the State whose means are insufficient to meet their needs may be entitled to assistance under the supplementary welfare allowance scheme. The SWA scheme is administered on behalf of my Department by the health boards.</P>
      <P>The objective of the scheme is to meet immediate, short-term income maintenance needs. The scheme is not intended to be a long-term ongoing solution in any individual case. My Department has overall responsibility for the money advice and budgeting service, MABS, which provides assistance to people experiencing indebtedness. There are 52 independent companies nationwide operating the service. The key feature of the MABS programme is the provision of money advice, including the publication of information on money management and debt counselling.</P>
      <P>The service is targeted primarily at individuals and families who have problems with debt or moneylending and who are on low income or in receipt of social welfare payments. The service places an emphasis on practical, budget-based measures that succeed in removing people permanently from dependence on moneylenders and open up alternative sources of low cost credit.</P>
      <P>In 2003, I have provided &euro;9.9 million for the operation of the MABS service. The latest information available from the companies providing the service shows that some 12,000 people are currently availing of the service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Separate from these arrangements, ongoing weekly payments known as MABS supplements <Col N="31" />have been paid under the SWA scheme. A total of 371 people currently receive these payments. Payments have been made in these cases because the people concerned have entered into repayment arrangements that are so onerous that they do not have enough income left to meet their basic needs.</P>
    <P>This is unrealistic, it is not sustainable and providing a weekly SWA payment is not the solution. Creditors will have to accept a more realistic repayment arrangement that does not impoverish the debtor.</P>
    <P>I am aware that concerns have been expressed over the withdrawal of this supplement. As I have previously stated, the objective of the supplementary welfare allowance scheme is to meet immediate, short-term income maintenance needs. The scheme is not intended to be a long-term solution in any individual case.</P>
    <P>Over 50% of MABS recipients have been in receipt of the supplement for more than a year and nearly 25% of recipients have been in receipt of the supplement for more than two years. The duration of these payments confirm that the supplement has in effect become a long-term arrangement which is effectively a subsidy for creditors.</P>
    <P>It is with the support and expertise of the MABS companies throughout the country that people can be best assisted in sorting out their debts and these companies will continue to provide their services after the withdrawal of the MABS supplement under the supplementary welfare allowance scheme.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamPenrose" hpid="Mr. Penrose Mr. Penrose">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Penrose</NameTxt>
      <P>I suggest to the Minister that the figures she has given are an indictment in terms of the difficulties people are experiencing. Those are the people who will be hit directly, regardless of what the Minister says. I suggest this is a cruel cut. What about the people who have negotiated deals with creditors to try to keep their homes and meet their various debts? Where will they go? Will those creditors extend credit for a period or will these people end up in the hands of moneylenders? We have to be concerned about that because that could be a consequence of the Minister's action, although I know she would not like to see that happen. A large array of people have benefited from this service. Approximately 10,000 or 12,000 people use the money advice and budgeting service, which is worthwhile and we should support it. I acknowledge the Minister has supported it with a provision of &euro;10 million&mdash;</P>

Has she since received representations from MABS offices throughout the country on the effect of this decision or on any of the other cuts she is proposing? I received a letter today, which I believe has been forwarded to her Department, from the Cork MABS, which was the area where MABS was first piloted and where it has been hugely successful. I would like the Minister to comment on the critical comments from people on the ground within the MABS system who are not happy with the proposals she is making.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelRing" hpid="Mr. Ring Mr. Ring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ring</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister not believe that we are pushing these people to moneylenders? The point of setting up the MABS was to keep people away from moneylenders. We are approaching Christmas and temptations are everywhere for people. Advertisements are being put into letterboxes offering them this, that and the other, but MABS worked with those who had difficulty controlling their finances. I would be concerned that this measure will push people towards moneylenders and we do not want to give them any more business. They should be taken out of existence if at all possible.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan" hpid="Mary Coughlan Mary Coughlan">

      <P>I would not indulge myself in anything, but I had the opportunity to speak with my officials in the Department who have responsibility for MABS. It should be remembered that I provide all the money for MABS but they are voluntary organisations and they are totally independent. I received representations, which I am examining, from the south and I will be taking those into consideration before I finalise my decision on a number of these <Col N="33" />schemes. As I indicated, however, where particular hardship is experienced, people will be facilitated through exceptional needs payments, but I do not want to see people in such huge indebtedness that they cannot manage. Our support for the scheme has included the provision of additional funding and, since I became Minister, there a MABS service has been set up in every part of the country. The last place to be looked after was my own town.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mary Coughlan</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 63 and 109 together.</P>
      <P>Subject to certain conditions, any person in the State whose means are insufficient to meet his or her basic needs may be entitled to assistance under the terms of the supplementary welfare allowance scheme. The scheme is administered on behalf of my Department by the community welfare officers in the health boards, and neither I nor my Department have any function in deciding entitlements in individual cases.</P>
      <P>The legislation that underpins the SWA scheme provides that it shall be administered under my general direction and control, which is exercised through primary legislation, regulations and instructions issued to health boards. There is specific provision in the legislation for the use of discretion on the part of the boards. This flexibility is a very important aspect of the SWA scheme and I have not amended that in any way. I can confirm to the House that I have not instructed health boards to be less flexible in the payment of supplementary welfare allowance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As the Deputies are aware, I announced a number of policy measures on the SWA scheme when the Estimates for 2004 were announced. I am well aware of the concern expressed by the trade unions representing community welfare officers about these measures. My Department holds quarterly meetings with both SIPTU and IMPACT trade unions which represent superintendent CWOs. The most recent meeting took place last Thursday at which the union representatives expressed their views on the changes being <Col N="34" />made and discussed those changes with officials of my Department. Ultimately, however, it is a matter for the Government to bring forward changes to the scheme where we consider they are necessary. My officials will discuss further with the staff involved the details of how the various measures will be implemented.</P>
    <P>My Department has regular contacts at various levels with the community welfare service. These contacts range from daily telephone and e-mail exchanges to informal meetings as well as more formal structured meetings. Monthly meetings take place between officials of my Department and managers of the community welfare service.</P>
    <P>All the measures I have introduced have been carefully considered and evaluated. The measures are designed to ensure that supplementary welfare allowance is paid in appropriate circumstances, in accordance with established policy, and takes into account the objectives of the scheme, which is to focus on meeting immediate, short-term income maintenance needs. In the implementation of these measures, particular care will be taken to ensure that the interests of vulnerable groups such as the homeless, the elderly and people with disabilities are fully protected.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanBoyle" hpid="Mr. Boyle Mr. Boyle">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boyle</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister confirm that a letter has been issued by the principal officer in her Department responsible for the supplementary welfare section to the chief executive officers of all health boards requesting them to ask community welfare officers to be less flexible in the payment of supplementary welfare allowance, citing specific examples where her Department did not want payments to be made and stating that, where possible, such payments could be transferred to other Departments, for instance, if money was needed for emergency payments for the repair of roofs, housing repairs in general or transport to and from hospital in cases where no other direct payment was made? Does this not confirm the real concern community welfare officers would have if they were to operate directly within her Department because it is placing a restriction on their activities, which they do not operate under currently and which they do not wish to operate under in the future?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan" hpid="Mary Coughlan Mary Coughlan">
      <NameTxt>Mary Coughlan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know what letters my principal officer sent to people but when I was appointed I examined the SWA scheme and I met the chief executives of the health boards for the first time. Their views were that it was not their money and they would continue to spend. I examined the areas where exceptional needs payments were made and I said that there were certain instances where exceptional needs payments should not have been paid because they did not reflect the scheme. What I am saying is that exceptional needs payments and flexibility will continue. They are part of the regulations and there has been no change in the way the scheme is to be implemented.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="35" />With regard to housing policy, sometimes that happens but the Deputy knows there are particular circumstances where somebody who is getting a grant may not be able to get a top-up or a loan from the credit union etc. I have no problem with people being facilitated, nor would anyone in the House have a problem with that. The regulations are in place. Directions are given on the implementation of the scheme. It is true to say that if other Departments pay, why should this Department pay, but in circumstances where people cannot be facilitated, there is no problem with an exceptional needs payment being made. I cannot answer the Deputy's question on a letter issued by a principal officer because I have not seen it, but I will speak to him.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamPenrose" hpid="Mr. Penrose Mr. Penrose">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Penrose</NameTxt>
      <P>Is this an example of lack of co-ordination in Government more than anything else? The Minister is saying the problems arise in other areas and she has to fill the void. Before announcing these measures there should have been co-ordination between the Departments and agencies in this matter.</P>
      <P>The Department is drafting directions to define and constrain to a straitjacket the discretion of community welfare officers. Does this not mean in practice that they will no longer act on a discretionary basis? What will be the extent of the review? Will community welfare officers operate on the basis of generalised directions or instructions from the Department? Will they be so hamstrung that they have no power? Effectively, it will be game over for community welfare officers who will be put off the pitch as regards operating a number of schemes which, as the Minister stated, have become established or structured over the years. What will happen to those who wish to avail of such schemes?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan" hpid="Mary Coughlan Mary Coughlan">
      <NameTxt>Mary Coughlan</NameTxt>
      <P>The flexibilities will remain. They are in primary legislation and will be exemplified in the regulations. Implementation is a matter for community welfare officers as I am not in a position, nor am I entitled, to instruct community welfare officers on how they may administer the scheme on an individual basis. This is the flexibility of the system and it will continue, a point which is made at our monthly meetings with superintendents.</P>
      <P>I will not put a straitjacket on community welfare officers because they are among the only people in the public service available on weekends when people are most in need. They have been exemplary in the administration of many schemes and have taken a pragmatic and practical approach to dealing with issues. While the flexibility in the system will remain, abuses cannot be tolerated and I will address them.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 64, 80, 88, 349 and 361 together.</P>
      <P>Support of carers in our society has been a priority of the Government since 1997. Payments to carers have been greatly improved in the period since, while qualifying conditions for carer's allowance have been significantly eased and coverage of the scheme has been extended and new schemes such as carer's benefit and respite grants introduced. The further development of supports for carers continues to be a priority for the Government.</P>
      <P>Any change in provisions for carers in 2004 is a matter to be provided for in the budget. As regards the issue of payment of other social welfare payments concurrently with carer's allowance, the general rule is that only one social welfare payment is payable to an individual on the basis that the primary objective of the system is to provide an adequate level of income support to individuals and their families. Persons qualifying for two social welfare payments always receive the higher payment to which they are entitled.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Earlier this year, I launched a comprehensive study on the future financing of long-term care carried out on behalf of my Department. To make further progress in the area of policy on long-term care, my Department is preparing a consultation document which will aim to focus all interested parties on the specific issues we need to address. The production of this document is a challenging task due to the complexity of the <Col N="37" />issues involved and the need to ensure that these are communicated clearly to the various target audiences in the consultation process. These issues, which include benefit design, cost and financing, are discussed at length in the report.</P>
    <P>I intend to have the consultation document distributed to all interested parties as early as possible in the new year, after which a consultation process on the financing of long-term care will take place. I envisage that the feedback from this process will be the starting point for meeting the commitment in Sustaining Progress on examining the strategic policy, cost and service delivery issues associated with the care of the elderly. I hope the working group to conduct this examination will be established in the first quarter of 2004.</P>
    <P>With regard to a scheme of parental leave for the purpose of providing care, carer's benefit was introduced in October 2000. The associated Carer's Leave Act, which protects the employment rights of the carer, was introduced by my colleague, the Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, in July 2001. These arrangements provide financial support and allow carers to avail of job-protected leave of absence for a period of up to 15 months. Any further expansion of this type of leave for the purpose of providing care is primarily a matter for consideration by that Department.</P>
    <P>I understand the proposed carers charter sets out carers' rights, including recognition of the role they play in society, the right to support in that role and, specifically, the right to support services from Departments. The rights provided for carers in social welfare legislation provide a solid foundation of support for them. The Government will continue to develop the type of services which provide real support and practical assistance to the people who carry out this essential service on behalf of people who need full-time care and attention and, in developing such supports, will have regard to the experience gained from the operation of services already in place, the views of public representatives and organisations working in this field and information on the arrangements operating elsewhere.</P>

      <P>While I thank the Minister for her long reply, with all due respect, it does not answer my question. The Minister stated that carers have been a priority for the Government since 1997. I have been raising the same question since 1997 and have not yet received a response. I have also made representations to three working groups established by the Government, wrote to the Minister's predecessor on several occasions and raised the matter during every budget.</P>

Will this be rectified in the budget tomorrow? Having asked this question for six years, I demand action. I was ignored by the predecessor of the Minister, who is compassionate. What will be done in the budget tomorrow to address this serious anomaly?</P>

      <P>Does the Taoiseach intend to take account of the advice of the National Competitiveness Council that the Government should avoid fuelling inflation? As he will be aware, yesterday's report highlighted that Ireland is now the joint most expensive country in the eurozone for consumer goods and ranks fourth most expensive of 16 countries for insurance premia <i>per capita</i> while our industrial electricity costs rank third most expensive of nine countries. This will come as no surprise to consumers.</P>
      <P>A website launched by my party ten days ago to deal with this matter has been inundated with complaints from people throughout the country, including, for example, a man in Dublin who was charged &euro;2.50 for a pint of tap water with a splash of blackcurrant juice, a man who paid &euro;3,200 for a cooker, whose equivalent price in Britain was &euro;1,700, and a young man quoted &euro;4,000 for insurance for his van, who paid the equivalent of &euro;90 when he lived in Australia. Has the Taoiseach taken cognisance of this report and will this be reflected in attempts to control inflation, keep down stealth charges and limit increases in charges on hard-pressed consumers tomorrow?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I regularly engage in discussions with the Competition Authority and take account of its views in many areas. In its reports over the years, it has highlighted many issues which we have not only taken account of but implemented. The major example is the provision of resources and staffing to set up the Competition Authority and the legal powers to deal with areas. It has commenced studies across the professions, examining how it can deal with these issues. I know this has taken some time. They have engaged in discussions across all the major professions in an attempt to seek control of costs and price inflation. This is one of the major areas. They have also recommended many other initiatives for the country going forward. The social partners anti-inflation group has also helped since it was set up. I know international positions have helped us, but we have reduced the rate of inflation from more than 5% to less than 2.5% and it is continuing to decline.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy is aware of what we have been doing in terms of insurance costs. That is helping, but as I said during Question Time, competition is ultimately required. We have seen concerted action in terms of the introduction of penalty <Col N="40" />points, changing the legal framework and the introduction of tougher legislation both in the legal area and in the area relating to the Tánaiste which will have a successful part to play. A big part of the inflation problem in recent years was imported through a weaker euro and higher energy costs. We are an open economy and we cannot get away from those issues.</P>
    <P>As regards charges, we cannot look for better services one day and then complain about the cost the next day. I do not accept that argument. If we want better services, we must ensure they are efficiently delivered. When inflation was at its worst at 5.3% or 5.4%, less than one quarter was related to Government charges. Those charges will ensure better services. We cannot have it both ways. I discount that argument.</P>
    <P>As regards competition, the groceries order and the retail planning guidelines are big factors in terms of competition. However, as soon as that is mentioned, the lobby groups, such as IBEC, become involved. Mr. Burgess used to be a regular presenter of the case when he wore his other hat and was totally opposed to it. He understands all the arguments about why we cannot do that. There is not any doubt that if the groceries order were removed, it would have a good impact on inflation and the demand price. The same applies to the retail guidelines. However, the entire food sector joined together and made a good argument that employment in the indigenous food sector would be reduced. It accepts that prices coming in would be lower.</P>
    <P>I know it is easy to talk about competition. However, in any discussion I have had on the retail prices order, the entire food sector and the private sector, such as IBEC, the Chambers of Commerce of Ireland and RGDATA, have said we should not do that. They are usually supported by all parties in this House. We like to challenge some of the issues. If we dealt with them, we would bring down prices. However, people do not want to do that.</P>

      <P>There is a strong understanding that people are being ripped off. It is fine for the Taoiseach to refer to studies, discussions and controlling costs. However, studies are not required to determine that last year VAT increased by 8%, motor tax by 12%, hospital charges by 26%, the drugs refund scheme increased by 31%, VHI payments by 18%, cigarettes and alcohol by 15%, bank and card charges by 108%, bin charges by 29%, ESB bills by 13%, college fees by 9%, parking rates by 25%, bus fares by 9% and the television licence fee by 40%.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Estimates for 2003 show that the threshold for the drugs refund scheme will be increased by &euro;8, accident and emergency charges will be increased from &euro;40 to &euro;45, the cost of a private bed in a public hospital will be increased by <Col N="41" />15%, the cost of an overnight stay will rise by &euro;5 to &euro;45 per night with a cap of ten nights per year.</P>

      <P>Does the Taoiseach accept that while the outcome of the Assembly elections represents the democratic wishes of the people of Northern Ireland and, therefore, must be respected, the permutation thrown up is likely to make more difficult the restoration of the Executive and the institutions? Does he accept that majority support among the Unionist community for the Agreement is no longer there and does he have any proposals on how that majority support within the Unionist community might be restored? Does he believe the failure of the republican movement to live up to its obligations under the Agreement in respect of decommissioning has played into the hands of the DUP and that the outcome is likely to be the exclusion of Sinn Féin and other parties from devolved Government in Northern Ireland? Does he believe the exclusion of the SDLP in the run-up to the elections and for a prolonged period before that has contributed to the circumstances in which it now finds itself? Does he have any regrets about the manner in which the SDLP was excluded?</P>
      <P>As regards the review, I know the Taoiseach made some public remarks about this at the weekend. When does he envisage the review being initiated? What form will it take and does he have any idea of how long it might take? Does he have any confidence that it will lead to the restoration of the institutions in Northern Ireland?</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I will try to answer the Deputy's questions as quickly and as fully as I can. The outcome of the election makes matters more difficult. It is not easy, given the combinations that now exist, to form an inclusive, working Executive. We must deal with the democratic wishes of the people in Northern Ireland and try to achieve one, but it will certainly not be as straightforward as it would have been had it involved the UUP, SDLP, Sinn Féin and the pro-Agreement parties in general. A number of changes in the position since the election will make it difficult and not just the one factor that has been focused on, namely, the DUP.</P>
      <P>More than 70% of the next Executive, if we can establish it, will comprise pro-Agreement candidates, which is a high percentage. All the opinion polls on the election, including RTE's extensive poll last week, show two thirds of the people in favour of devolution. All the parties are in favour of devolution, even if they differ on how it can be achieved.</P>
      <P>The Government will attempt to engage in dialogue with all the parties. I hope that is possible. I have stated publicly that we will be glad to meet them as soon as possible. I have already been contacted by the SDLP and Sinn Féin with the aim of meeting as soon as possible, which we will do.</P>
      <P>On this day four years ago, 2 December 1999, the institutions of the Agreement were signed. There was an agreement that there would be a review after four years, and this falls due today. Letters will be issued tomorrow or the next day to the parties. The review was for parties to reflect on the past four years and to give their views on the institutions and their workings. Even though it is coincidental, it will be useful. It is broad enough for people to be able to say almost anything. We will have to study their views and proceed to dialogue and discussion.</P>
      <P>I hope some of that will begin before Christmas, but realistically, other than preliminary meetings, it is unlikely that the detailed work will begin before the new year. That is the realistic position. I look forward to a review because we will make progress if people take their business seriously and positively. The early indications suggest all the parties will.</P>
      <P>I was asked about the positions of both the SDLP and Sinn Féin. I will deal with Sinn Féin first. It is a pity that some of the issues with which we have dealt for the past year or so could not have been brought forward more quickly. It has been more than a year since the act of completions paper, which both the Prime Minister, Mr. Blair and I supported, was produced. That is a long time ago.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The institutions collapsed because of alleged spying by Sinn Féin in Stormont. We were not able to make progress despite considered efforts in the spring and autumn. We achieved an act of decommissioning in the autumn but, unfortunately, the regulations surrounding that did not allow us to make the necessary progress. <Col N="44" />Although these regulations were known and the IRA representative and General John de Chastelain adhered to them, they were prohibitive and did not allow us to make the necessary progress. Much has been made of the allegation that I knew that and did not do anything about it. Unfortunately, I could not change the rules, nor was I engaged in the discussions with the IRA representative to enable them to be changed. I tried to get General John De Chastelain to change them, which he attempted to do last summer but for which he was not able to get agreement. This created a difficulty.</P>
    <P>The SDLP has played an enormously constructive role in everything we have done over the years and especially since the spring of 1998. I am grateful for the work of Mark Durkan and his colleagues. They did not do as well as they would have liked, but they certainly did not do so badly, as neither did the UUP which increased its vote.</P>
    <P>I do not accept the SDLP's position on being marginalised. I would like to be able to agree with it for the sake of agreeing but I cannot. I do not accept the argument. I do not want to get into an argument about this in the aftermath of the election, but for Deputy Rabbitte's information, the week before, representatives of the SDLP had an exclusive meeting with the British Prime Minister, Mr. Blair, the following week they met the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Cowen, and a few days later they met me. The party's argument does not stand up. The two hour meeting with the UUP and Sinn Féin at which I had recommended the SDLP's attendance was on a specific issue in which the SDLP had no part. I have already expressed the view that too much was made of it and it does not hold up.</P>
    <P>I look forward to proceeding with the review. I hope the Democratic Unionist Party adopts an enabling, not a disabling, role. I will be as constructive as I possibly can and look forward to trying to deal with the party. I know its position has tended towards not meeting the Irish Government. However, it put forward four issues in the election. It said it wants an arrangement that would ensure stability, something with which I have no argument given the collapse of the institutions on four occasions during the lifetime of the agreement. It wants an accountable arrangement, something with which I have no difficulty, and also an efficient and effective arrangement. It left out the word &ldquo;inclusive&rdquo;. If it adds that to its agenda, we can all work towards finding a solution.</P>
    <P>To go back to the old days of ignoring other people's mandate and the fact of their election and denying that they have a role to play in an inclusive Assembly and Executive will cause major difficulties. I will not cause them but there will be no agreement from Sinn Féin, the SDLP, or the northern Nationalist and republican community. However, Mr. Robinson has said that he is prepared to work towards a resolution that would satisfy all communities &ndash; republican, Nationalist, loyalist and Unionist. On that basis <Col N="45" />we can all work to try to achieve it, and the quicker the better.</P>

      <P>Does the Taoiseach not agree that the SDLP is justified in feeling that it was too little too late, notwithstanding the meetings to which he referred, and that in the substantial period leading up to the elections, the exclusion of the SDLP permitted Mr. Adams and his colleagues to depict themselves as the only champions of the Good Friday Agreement? Has the Taoiseach invited the DUP to talks, and if he has, what has been the response?</P>
      <P>When the Taoiseach says that the review is wide enough to allow a discussion on anything, is he saying that there is a narrow dividing line between review and renegotiation? Does he accept that, if there were to be textual changes to either the British-Irish Agreement or the multi-party agreement, it would involve a Constitutional referendum at least in this jurisdiction? Assuming broad support for that, would he be well disposed towards it?</P>
      <P>Does the Taoiseach accept that the impasse created by the outcome of the elections means in all probability that we now face a prolonged period of direct rule while the review is under way. I understood the Taoiseach to say that the review is likely to commence early in the new year. Does he hope that the review as envisaged can encompass a sufficiently wide approach to the impasse to facilitate the involvement of the DUP?</P>

      <P>The review is provided for in paragraph 8 of the Good Friday Agreement and, as I have said, was scheduled to take place when the Government signed the British-Irish Agreement, which came into effect when the constitutional changes were made. The review allows the parties represented in the last Assembly to put forward their opinions on how the institutions operated and to give a broad account, in writing, of how they see the operation of the Agreement. It gives people a chance to provide a narrative of how they see the position. It will be different when we get down to discussions. The Governments will need to assess the results of the review, pinpoint areas of disagreement and initiate discussions and meaningful dialogue on these. I am not saying the review will allow for everything but people's response to what has happened in the past four years cannot be restricted and there is no point in doing so. If people say they will not talk to representatives of another party or take extreme positions. the discussions will not get anywhere. They will be able to put forward a presentation, however.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I publicly stated that we would meet any party and the SDLP and Sinn Féin have indicated that they will meet us. The DUP has not yet communicated an intention to meet but we will do everything we can to ensure this happens. I think it is possible to have a meeting but I do not want to press the issue until there has been some <Col N="46" />exchange on how best to arrange it. It is not necessary to rush matters. The DUP and other parties will want to work out their own tactics, particularly the DUP, which has never engaged in meetings with the Irish Government. Mr. Robinson has said he will meet us, however, and I assume that will happen.</P>
    <P>Direct rule will continue, as will the suspension of the institutions. The latter will continue for some time, but if the suspension is lifted the law indicates that an Assembly and an Executive should be formed within six weeks. If that is not done there can be a further suspension or another election &ndash; I assume there would be a further suspension. It is unlikely the British Government will lift the suspension, at least until we have had talks. The position will remain the same as it has been for most of the past 14 months. The key issues are how we can re-establish devolution and examine the submissions to the review to get workable solutions from them.</P>
    <P>In regard to the SDLP I will not repeat what I have said except that the Government had more meetings with the SDLP than with Sinn Féin. There was a lot of dialogue around Sinn Féin and the UUP and, as I said many times, the reason is that Sinn Féin was still associated with a paramilitary organisation and the SDLP was not. The aim was to separate the organisations and drive paramilitarism out of Irish politics, but we have not yet succeeded in doing that. We must continue to work on this in the future.</P>

      <P>Last night I was invited to a meeting of parents who organise a wide range of clubs and activities for children and youths in their communities, from playschools and Irish dancing to services for disabled youth. These people are facing a massive crisis which is threatening the very existence of this huge community network that provides vital facilities for youth in the area, the only facilities which many can access, that is, the imminent closure of Hartstown community centre, the base of those activities. This arose because of the cuts of thousands of places on the community employment scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Is the Taoiseach aware that this crisis is replicated all over the State, from Cork to Cavan and from Sligo to Dublin? Will he allow the extreme right-wing ideology of the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Harney, to dictate that this scheme, which has become a crucial pillar of support in communities of working people, be wound down? Does he understand that what started out years ago as a way of dealing with long-term unemployment is now part of the social fabric of communities and a basic support for community services that would not otherwise be there? To wind down the scheme would be to rip out part of the social fabric, inadequate as it is in some cases. I put it to the Taoiseach that he knows this well because his normally silent backbenchers have been attempting to roar about it. Tomorrow morning the Labour Party will provide them with an <Col N="47" />occasion to prove whether they are a parade of tear-shedding crocodiles or are genuinely upset about this issue.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I am well aware of the benefits of all employment schemes, including the community employment scheme, the job initiative and the social economy schemes. The Government has decided to support the retention of 25,000 places this year, which is the same as the number of places on the scheme last year. In addition, we have mainstreamed several thousand of the positions in the education sector, including secretaries and caretakers. This adds to a high proportion of places on the scheme. The Deputy is correct in saying that when long-term unemployment was high &ndash; about 10.4%, if I remember correctly &ndash; there were 40,000 people on the schemes. Now, taking in those in the education sector, there are probably more than 30,000 places, although long-term unemployment is at 1.4%. The rate of unemployment was 17.4%, now it is 4.4% and declining.</P>
      <P>This year &euro;350 million is being put into the schemes in addition to the amount going into the mainstreamed positions. This means that a proportionally higher amount is going into the scheme than was the case previously. This contributes to the benefits pointed out by the Deputy. The schemes have become part of the communities in which they are based and are working successfully. While there have been difficulties in certain areas, FÁS has endeavoured to manage them and the Government continues to investigate these areas. As I said earlier in the year, there was a need to make sure we were making the best use of the schemes in many areas and that has been successful. We now have a baseline of 25,000 places and the secretaries and caretakers have moved into full-time employment in education. With much lower unemployment and only one tenth of the previous level of long-term unemployment, the number of places continues to approach the maximum of 40,000 &ndash; it is currently between 30,000 and 35,000. The Deputy can see the benefit of this.</P>

      <P>I put it to the Taoiseach that the question of long-term unemployment should no longer be the criterion for continuing the community employment schemes, which now have complete validity and are necessary in communities where a whole series of critical services are built around them. In terms of costs, the cut of 5,000 places in community employment schemes which the Government has envisaged is equiv<Col N="48" />alent to the amount of tax legally avoided by one tax exile, Mr. O'Brien, on the profit made on one business deal. It is not a huge amount to provide for. Will the Taoiseach come back to the figures he has just mentioned? Is he saying that the number of people on community employment schemes at the beginning of this year is to be maintained in full next year and, therefore, the reports and notification from FÁS advising community fora they are to cut CE jobs are entirely unnecessary?</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not different. The level of places in 2004 is being funded at the same level. The only thing different is at the educational end. I do not know the exact figures, but when unemployment was at its height, at 17.4%, and there was long-term unemployment of 10.4%, there were 40,000 people on this scheme. Now some 25,000 people are on the three schemes that make up this area plus what is in the mainstream area. Given that these are full-time jobs there is some<Col N="49" />where in the order of 30,000 to 35,000. While the Deputy might say it does not matter&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;the issue is that it does matter because when people are wanted for community employment schemes, in many parts of the country where difficulty is being experienced in this regard, they must be recruited from among the unemployed. It therefore has a direct bearing. When Deputy Joe Higgins maintains that in some areas people are needed for essential services, that is why the area of education has been mainstreamed, which is forgotten in this debate&mdash;</P>

    <Title>Aer Lingus Bill 2003: Second Stage (Resumed).</Title>
    <P>Question again proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanBoyle" hpid="Mr. Boyle Mr. Boyle">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boyle</NameTxt>
      <P>When I made my previous contribution I pointed out that given the way Aer Lingus is restructuring and presenting itself as a company, it is losing the right to be considered a national airline due to its decision to remove itself from the Cork-Dublin route, to practices that call into question its corporate acceptability and its <Col N="58" />decision to take on airlines that have opened up routes before it did so. I cite the example from Cork Airport where Jet Magic has had a direct challenge from Aer Lingus having opened a number of routes from Cork Airport with Aer Lingus preceding it. The ultimate question about the nature of Aer Lingus as a company and the type of structure which the Bill will buy into in terms of future employee participation, is the extent to which those who have suffered most in the company will have the least gain. The ongoing industrial disquiet within the company is a signal that the Minister and the new lean mean hungry management in Aer Lingus have been getting it wrong. All of these grounds &ndash; decisions to absent itself from Irish airports, decisions to take on Irish companies in terms of the routes it is supplying and the unhappiness with the Aer Lingus company as to what workers gained for the decisions they have made as a workforce &ndash; call into question the reason the Minister is introducing the Bill in this way at this time.</P>
      <P>The future for the airline is in doubt as to the type of airline it will become. We must consider the other decisions being made regarding the US-EU agreement that Aer Lingus will not be an international airline but will only be a cog in the wheel as part of its global alliance arrangement whereby it will go to regional centres. There is a real danger in the near future that this country will not have an Irish airline on which it can depend to get to major international centres without the need to use other airlines which are part of the arrangement in which Aer Lingus finds itself or without the need to change frequently to other airlines and from other airports. The Minister will have to say there is a policy in place as regards the future arrangements for airline management here.</P>
      <P>Another issue that has to be tackled is the internal use of airlines and the fact that there are now new, and seemingly more favoured, companies that have not lived up to their promises. In regard to the internal airlines, there is reluctance on the part of the Department to apply stringent standards that may have been applied to Aer Lingus in the past and may have brought about the difficulty in which Aer Lingus found itself and out of which it needs to bring itself. I hope the Minister will address many of these questions.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill gives effect to the employee share ownership plan agreed between the Government and the unions and provides the legal framework to facilitate an investment process in the company. The Bill provides for Aer Lingus to establish superannuation schemes for general employees and pensioners. It also provides for amendments to the process by which directors, including worker directors, are <Col N="59" />appointed. The ESOP provisions will be brought into effect as soon as the legislation is enacted which will increase the staff shareholding to 14.9%, as agreed in the October 2001 survival plan.</P>
      <P>I last spoke in detail here about Aer Lingus in October 2001 when the company was experiencing a serious financial crisis that threatened its existence. I said that Aer Lingus was a vital semi-State organisation, namely, the State airline in which the Government was and is the major shareholder. I said it was of strategic importance to an island nation, especially for trade and tourism, and provided a crucial transatlantic service. It was also a major employer with, at that time, approximately 6,500 employees and was therefore a focal point for the economy of north Dublin. These observations remain valid in December 2003 and set in context any debate on the future of Aer Lingus.</P>
      <P>The company had many difficulties in October 2001. The attack on the World Trade Centre on 11 September 2001 was followed by a dramatic slump in air travel and future bookings. There were industrial disputes, an outbreak of foot and mouth disease, the downturn in the US economy, and a problem with increasing fuel costs, all of which caused problems for Sabena, Swissair, KLM and Aer Lingus among others.</P>
      <P>The survival plan which was adopted involved a 25% reduction in capacity, a staff reduction of 2,000 employees, a pay freeze, extensive work practice and other changes, and the sale of non-essential assets. The staff contribution to this must be recognised. At that time the Government promised to facilitate private sector interests and staff in an investment in Aer Lingus to provide a source of funding to support the plan. Aer Lingus has made a remarkable recovery. In 2001 it had a loss of &euro;52.1 million. In 2002 it had an operating profit of &euro;63.8 million and is on track to exceed its full year capacity profit forecast of &euro;75 million for 2003 notwithstanding the Iraq war and the SARS outbreak.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Sections 3 and 5 provide for the sale of Aer Lingus and the privatisation of the company. In effect this allows for the sale of some or all of the State's shareholding and for the issuing of new shares. In his speech on the Bill on 9 October 2003, the Minister said: &ldquo;It is now over six years since the Government first decided to explore the ownership issue which led to the decision in 1999 to embark on an IPO of the airline&rdquo;. He went on to say that he asked the chairman in July of that year to examine and report back to him on future options for the company. The chairman recently gave the Minister that report. The company's view is that a private sector investment process should be initiated without delay. The Minister added that he is carefully considering the report and will bring his own view and that of Aer Lingus to Cabinet in the coming weeks. Members of the House need more information about this. <Col N="60" />We need a major debate on the future of the national airline soon.</P>
    <P>The Minister also said in his speech that: &ldquo;The board, management and staff have transformed the airline into a lower cost, flexible, efficient business model offering low fares with a quality service&rdquo;. This is true and the chief executive of the board, Mr. Willie Walsh, and the staff are to be congratulated on this achievement. Aer Lingus should not try to become a carbon copy of Ryanair. Its arrival did much to increase competition and decrease fares, but Aer Lingus is a different type of airline with a different role and history which must form the backdrop to any debate on its future.</P>
    <P>Why is privatisation being considered now? Things have changed since October 2001 in that the company is now profitable. Who is the likely buyer? Is only a partial sale being examined? What is the economic case for the sale at this time? What proposals is the Minister bringing to Cabinet in this regard? He needs to make the case and spell out his plans for us to debate them. What will be done with proceeds arising from the sale? I hope a broader debate on aviation in Ireland and the role of the national airline can take place as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>The Minister is confronted with several major issues, including problems with Luas at the Red Cow roundabout, the height of the Dublin Port tunnel, the new terminal at Dublin Airport, the extension of the penalty points system, the break-up of Aer Rianta and CIE, and the privatisation of 25% of bus routes. All are of great interest but my chief concern is for the break-up of Aer Rianta and CIE. Action is needed on these issues. However, the ideology of competition and deregulation is not an instant solution to these transport matters. I hope for all our sakes that the Minister has got it right. He is a brave man but I would like him to assure us that each case is being examined on its merits and that all pragmatic solutions are being comprehensively examined in respect of these issues. We also need a progress report on the proposed break-up of Aer Rianta and the Minister's discussions with the trade unions if that is possible.</P>
    <P>The Retired Aviation Staff Association has been lobbying for some time about its pension concerns, which we should take seriously. According to the Bill the company will establish pension schemes but the association is not happy with the wording of this section. It suggests that a pension scheme should be set up in consultation with members and social partners and that the wording of the Bill should be changed accordingly. It is also anxious to ensure that the schemes continue to be of defined benefit and would like employees to continue to have trustees to the scheme. There are suggestions that the establishment of separate schemes for catering staff, cabin crew and general employees is in the pipeline. If all this comes to pass, existing pensioners will remain in the old scheme which will be closed, with no growth or future protection. The retired <Col N="61" />staff want an active scheme and I hope discussions can take place with them to ensure that happens.</P>
    <P>The pilots have highlighted an issue in the context of an EU regulation on the harmonisation of technical requirements and administrative procedures in the field of civil aviation which was partially adopted on 3 September 2002. It contains an amendment to include a section covering flight and duty time limitations and the rest requirement for airline crew which has been sent to Council for consideration by the member states. The Irish Airline Pilots Association has serious concerns about this because it deals with the question of airline and passenger safety. I will not go into the detail of it as I am sure the Minister and Minister of State are familiar with these concerns which I hope can be addressed satisfactorily in consultation with the Irish Aviation Authority.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimmyDevinsFF" hpid="Dr. Devins Dr. Devins">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Devins</NameTxt>
      <P>I am delighted to have the opportunity to speak on this important Bill, the Aer Lingus Bill 2003. Air travel has seen many advances since that day many years when the Wright brothers took to the skies. Many of these advances have focused on the technological aspects of flying, especially the fantastic developments that have occurred in the design and manufacture of aeroplanes. In the past decade, however, a revolution has taken place in air travel that may have a more lasting effect than the changes and improvements in aeroplane technology.</P>
      <P>I refer, of course, to the concept of low cost air travel. One of the pioneers of this concept in Europe is Ryanair, an Irish company of which we can all be justifiably proud. The undoubted success of Ryanair led to a shake up in the air travel business with significant implications for Aer Lingus, a company with a long and proud tradition. It went from a position where there was virtually no competition on most of its routes due to bilateral agreements, to an open market that was competition driven. If we consider the situation less than 20 years ago, when a short flight to London from Dublin cost hundreds of pounds to the situation today, where flights can be booked for between &euro;10 and &euro;20, we can see how far things have moved in the aviation field.</P>
      <P>During that time there have been many crises and much turbulence but Aer Lingus has not only survived but thrived. For a State company to respond so well to competition has been a remarkable occurrence and management and employees are to be congratulated for this achievement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In addition to the increased competition and opening up of the air travel market, the downturn in international air travel resulting from the atrocity of 11 September 2001 impacted on the survival of many airlines. This was particularly severe in the case of Aer Lingus, which had a large segment of its business based on the transatlantic routes. Since that fateful day, however, Aer <Col N="62" />Lingus has doubled its network, opening up 28 new routes. This expansion supports the airline's growing European operation to and from Ireland. New routes to Berlin, Venice, Valencia, Lyon, Dubrovnik, Copenhagen and Warsaw will be operational by June 2004. These new routes will result in greater efficiencies in the utilisation of planes and staff resources. This will in turn translate into greater choice for the travelling public and lower fares. We know that Aer Lingus is now committed to the provision of low fares across the range of customers. Not only does this offer more choice to Irish travellers, it facilitates new opportunities for growth in tourism into Ireland.</P>
    <P>If one compares the situation today to that of 15 years ago, the turnaround has been remarkable. It was the norm then to have very few destinations, serviced by aeroplanes that were a quarter or a half full. The fares charged were often exorbitant. The accounts of the last three years illustrate this point. In the first half of 2001, there was an operating loss of &euro;38 million. In the first half of 2002, that loss was reduced to &euro;12 million and in the first half of 2003, there was an operating profit of &euro;14 million. At the same time, the dramatic reduction in its cost base contributed to its turnaround. The cost base in the first half of 2001 was &euro;570 million and was reduced by the first half of this year to &euro;400 million. Likewise, there has been a huge increase in passenger numbers. In the first half of 2001 there was a 69% passenger load factor but in the first half of 2003 that had increased to 80%.</P>
    <P>There will be more challenges ahead but the staff and management of Aer Lingus have shown that they are more than able to meet those challenges. All of them deserve our congratulations. Much pain and sacrifice was involved in the action that was needed to ensure the survival of Aer Lingus as it sought to reverse spiralling losses. Not long ago the very existence of the airline was in doubt. The employee share ownership plan resulted from the survival plan initiated and carried out to ensure the continued existence of Aer Lingus.</P>
    <P>This Bill gives effect to the employee share ownership plan that was agreed between the Government and the unions. The involvement of the employees in the ownership of the airline is very welcome. In any business, a sense of belonging to the business heightens workers' awareness of it and the highest sense of belonging is where the workers own a share of the business. Staff feel they are a real part of the airline and it is a powerful motivation for increasing productivity. Out of this situation flow new ideas and a drive to succeed.</P>
    <P>The presence of worker directors on the board is the logical development of employee share ownership. Existing legislation only allows for 5% of the share capital of Aer Lingus to be owned by staff. This legislation is needed to allow for full implementation of the employee share ownership plan, the issue of an additional 9.9% stakeholding to staff and the appointment of an employee <Col N="63" />share ownership director. A further director can be appointed by the Minister for Transport from nominations submitted by the unions. Staff will then have an important stake in the company and if recent years are an example, all efforts will be focused on building up the company so that its value can be enhanced. This is fair to the workers who have contributed so much to the remarkable turnaround in the fortunes of Aer Lingus.</P>
    <P>There is a provision in the Bill to establish a framework to facilitate outside investment if the Government decides it is necessary. I have no problem with such a move and, in the ever changing environment in which we live, such a process may be undertaken in the future. The aviation world changes rapidly, as we have seen in the past few years, but we are an island country. Business and commerce with the rest of Europe and the world are vital to our well-being as a nation. Any short-term gain that might accrue from a diminution of the State's interest in Aer Lingus must be balanced by consideration of what is best for Ireland in the long-term. Private sector investment is necessary, as has been indicated by Aer Lingus itself. It should be pursued as quickly as possible but a mechanism should be available to the State so the strategic long-term role of Aer Lingus for the State can be an integral part of that process.</P>
    <P>I can think of no Minister better able to handle the complexities of this important question than the current Minister for Transport. He has already shown a wonderful grasp of the intricacies of the transport problems that beset our country and, more importantly, a willingness to solve them. This Bill is a forward thinking solution to some of the difficulties surrounding air travel and I commend it to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelRing" hpid="Mr. Ring Mr. Ring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ring</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad someone has confidence in the Minister. I welcome the opportunity to speak on this Bill and I hope to mention Knock Airport.</P>
      <P>I compliment the management and staff of Aer Lingus for the way they have turned the company around. In recent years everyone thought it was doomed and that it would never be profitable again. However, the management and staff of this public sector company made major sacrifices and displayed great commitment. When the company is restructured, the staff should be rewarded for the effort they made to ensure the airline's survival. I hope too that they will not forget the staff in the past who made major sacrifices for this company. I hope their pension rights will be protected and that this company will go on from strength to strength.</P>
      <P>When the Minister appoints the board, I hope we do not have the usual political appointees. I trust he will pick the people who can do the job best, and not pick people because they are Fianna Fáil members or supporters.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not sure about privatisation. I would prefer that this company should carry on as it is and that the taxpayers funding it should get from it <Col N="64" />some of the money they have invested over the years. If Knock, Shannon, Cork and Sligo airports had got the same investment as Aer Lingus, I am sure they would be thriving today.</P>
    <P>Regarding the west, in particular what is happening at Shannon and Knock, there was a proposal a number of years ago that Galway should be given consideration as the regional airport. We have made enough political mistakes in this country. We have the airports in place. Galway is part of the western region, with its university, colleges and much State infrastructure. Let us spread the goods around. Let us have Knock as the regional airport. Aer Lingus was not at all helpful to Knock and did everything in its power to ensure Knock airport would not succeed. I am sure the Minister has met the board of Knock airport and will meet it again. Its members have been looking for subsidies and grants. I hope Knock airport will find favour. There is a new management in place, and I congratulate them. They have done very well.</P>
    <P>I was in Knock airport recently meeting a family member and the place was buzzing. It was great to see the planes coming in and out and to see so many people around. The management is making a major effort on a small budget, and I hope the Government will do whatever can be done for that airport within the law. It needs support. It is important for the west and its infrastructure that Knock should succeed because people use it, support it and want it there. There is no point in the Minister and his Department supporting Galway as the regional airport. There is no need for that. If I see that happening, I will bring the issue to Europe and say that decision is wrong, because we already have a regional airport, namely Knock.</P>
    <P>I hope that Shannon can be protected. There is talk of the market being further opened and that the Shannon stopovers may not continue. It is important that the Shannon infrastructure be supported and that what is there is left there. It is important too that the staff would be protected.</P>
    <P>Shannon has contributed to opening up the west. I know people will argue that they want to fly into Dublin, but the transfer of the Shannon stopover to Dublin had a negative effect on tourism and on Shannon airport. The people there have fought back and done their best to keep the airport up and running. I hope the Government sees fit to support it, particularly now, with the break-up of Aer Rianta.</P>
    <P>I was disappointed over the years when Aer Rianta did not take over Knock airport. I hope the Minister is making the right decision on Aer Rianta, because its existence has been important. In particular it supported Shannon and Cork airports. The Minister says Aer Rianta will take to Dublin whatever debts are involved at Shannon and Cork. I disagree with EU policy in this regard. It is fine for Europeans, but we are a small island country. It is fine for Britain and for the other European countries. We are one of the few island countries in the world and must have <Col N="65" />air travel infrastructure. People must be able to get in and out of this country. If we have to subsidise it, so be it. We must tell Europe it cannot always dictate, telling us what we can and cannot do. It is important that we keep that infrastructure in place.</P>
    <P>In 1986, when the then Minister for Transport, the late Deputy Jim Mitchell, on whom the Lord have mercy, opened up the airways and Ryanair came on the scene, everyone said it would not last six or nine months and would never work. Ryanair is now the number one carrier in the world. It has worked, and has put manners on every other airline. Ryanair has brought down the cost of air travel to a reasonable level so that people can travel all over the world. The company must be complimented on its success under Mr. O'Leary.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelOFlynn" hpid="Mr. O'Flynn Mr. O'Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>He is very arrogant.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelRing" hpid="Mr. Ring Mr. Ring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ring</NameTxt>
      <P>The Fianna Fáil Party has no time for anyone who is not a Fianna Fáil supporter, or who is not loading money into its coffers. That is the Government's problem. Mr. O'Leary speaks his mind and has done well. He may be arrogant but he is a great and successful businessman. He has put this country on the map and shown what an Irishman can do. He has broken the monopoly.</P>
      <P>Not too many years ago there were not too many flights out of this country. If one rang Aer Lingus it would merely think of a figure to charge as a fare. Thanks be to God, those days are gone. The local agent would say that Aer Lingus might be able to provide a seat in one week or another, but the price was set and one had to take it or leave it. In all fairness to Ryanair, it broke that monopoly all over the world, and it must be complimented. Success must be complimented.</P>
      <P>Whatever decision the Minister and the Government make on privatising Aer Lingus, I hope it is the right one for the taxpayer, as well as for the staff and management of Aer Lingus. It is important that we have a national carrier. Aer Lingus has done well over recent years, when one considers the consequences of the war in Iraq and the SARS epidemic. The company survived and made profits of &euro;80 million. It must be complimented on that. I hope Aer Lingus can keep that success going. It had a cabin crew dispute a few months ago. I hope such disputes can be resolved because it is important that Aer Lingus should do well and should not be a drag on the taxpayer.</P>
      <P>I ask the Minister to support the board of Knock airport when he meets the members. They have some projects and ideas, and some funding is needed to promote the airport and put further infrastructure in place. The management board is doing an excellent job. Now that the airport is up and running and going well, this is the time to give it the investment and support needed, in whatever way that can be done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is important for the west that we have that infrastructure. It is important for our emigrants <Col N="66" />that they know they can hop on a plane and land in their own country at any time. There was a problem in Knock recently when a chartered flight due to land late at night encountered some difficulty related to fog and lighting. I hope the Minister can deal with such issues in the future and that the necessary infrastructure will be put in place.</P>
    <P>The Knock airport management has done an excellent job. I was there one evening a few weeks ago when three or four flights were coming in and out. There was a great buzz in the place. There were three funerals coming in from abroad, one from Scotland and two from England. There is not a day now when one will not hear of a funeral coming in to Knock, and continuing on to Sligo or perhaps Galway. It is important that the Knock airport management board gets the support it needs.</P>
    <P>The Minister should not be afraid to give State aid to the regional airports. The airports at Cork, Sligo and Knock deserve it. It is important to have the infrastructure in these counties and that the regional airports work.</P>
    <P>I will give an example of where infrastructure is needed. A constituent of mine, who has not been in Dublin for a while, was rushing to get into the city today. He was planning to fly out from Dublin Airport this morning, and rang me just before he got to Heuston Station. The arrangements at that station have been changed again, with only one lane of traffic heading towards the city centre. The bus lane was not being used, and it took this man an hour and a half to get from Heuston Station to the city centre. He was due to meet me but could not do so because he had to get to the airport.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to look at Heuston Station. I cannot understand why there is now only a single lane. Three or four lanes of traffic converge into a single lane. My constituent told me there was a dreadful traffic bottleneck this morning. There is no point in having bus lanes if they are not being used. He told me that only the occasional taxi driver was using the bus lane this morning while a tailback had built up for miles. I presume he was in time for his flight because if he was not I would have heard from him.</P>
    <P>Aer Arann is doing an excellent job and it is important we have cheap flights from Dublin to Knock, Galway, Cork and Sligo so as to take cars off the roads and minimise the traffic coming in and out of Dublin. I am delighted to see local airports working and I hope we will continue to see them doing so. If Aer Lingus is sold I urge the Minister to ensure that the necessary finance is put into regional airports.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister is doing the right thing in introducing this Bill and that Aer Lingus goes from strength to strength. It is important that the national carrier does well. However, the taxpayer must not be expected to subsidise Aer Lingus, as we did for many years. Aer Lingus came back to the Exchequer and to the taxpayer on many occasions in the past when the company experi<Col N="67" />enced crises. Now that the company is showing a profit I hope it will continue to do so. The company has been streamlined and is now being run as it ought to be. Major sacrifices have been made by the staff. The profits which the company is making should be divided among the staff and used to pay back the Exchequer, which rescued the company so many times in the past.</P>
    <P>I hope Aer Lingus will go from strength to strength. I wish many days of success to Ryanair, which broke the monopolies in this country and throughout the world.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelOFlynn" hpid="Mr. O'Flynn Mr. O'Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Bill. Aer Lingus continues to thrive. No other State company has responded so well to competition and this has benefited the company's employees and customers alike.</P>
      <P>When we consider that less than 20 years ago the short flight to London cost hundreds of pounds we can see how far we have come in the area of aviation. The arrival of Ryanair in the 1980s forced Aer Lingus to confront a new reality. The airline has experienced many crises and much turbulence in the intervening years and it has not only survived but actively thrived. The company's turnaround since the terrible atrocities of September 2001 has been remarkable when we consider what happened to other international airlines in the immediate aftermath of those appalling events. Aer Lingus's network has doubled in two years, with 28 new routes since September 2001 while many national airlines, such as Swissair, Sabena and British Airways, have either gone out of business or reduced their passenger numbers.</P>
      <P>Aer Lingus has served Cork Airport well in the 42 years since the airport opened. I acknowledge that service and I thank Aer Lingus for its support of Cork Airport. I accept that Aer Lingus, like all airlines, must compete in an aggressive and changing aviation business, but recent developments in Cork give cause for concern. The dropping of the Cork to Dublin route last month, after 42 years, leaves a great void. No longer can the public travel by our national airline between the two cities. The route is left to Aer Arann, whose fare from Cork to Dublin is &euro;138 return. This is far in excess of what it should be. Aer Arann can offer fares of &euro;49 to Edinburgh, which is twice or three times the distance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Is Aer Lingus abandoning us in Cork? I hope not, although the signs are not good. I would like to be assured by Aer Lingus that the company is committed to Cork. I understand that next summer Aer Lingus will reduce its London service from five flights per day to four services per day, as per the company's current Internet timetable. This is not a good sign for Cork. Cork Airport is booming, with passenger traffic expected to grow by 15% this year, or 300,000 more passengers than last year, to 1.7 million passengers. Will Aer Lingus, Cork Airport's largest customer, continue <Col N="68" />to be part of that growth? I hope so. Will other airlines have to take its place?</P>
    <P>We saw huge growth in Cork Airport this year with the arrival of Czech Airlines which flies from Cork to Prague. The local airline, Jet Magic, has opened 11 new routes to the United Kingdom and Europe and in a short space of time has carved out a nice niche for itself. The airline is targeting people who want a little extra friendliness, courtesy and helpfulness from staff. Jet Magic flies into London City Airport, a small airport in the east end of London. I have not tried the route yet but I know of numerous people who have. Passengers not only receive in-flight hospitality but when they arrive in London they find their luggage waiting for them in the terminal and they do not have to queue up and wait for it. I do not know how long this will last as the airport gets busier but it is nice to have a friendly airline taking such an interest in its passengers. I have recommended Jet Magic to many people although I have no vested interest in seeing the company succeed.</P>
    <P>Aer Lingus recently announced three new European destinations, Alicante, Milan and Barcelona, the most successful of the three new routes launched by Jet Magic earlier this year. I question Aer Lingus's motive in this? Is it trying to put a new airline, which is Irish-based and has a number of Cork directors, out of business? Aer Lingus has served us well in the past but I hope it will make it easier for people in Cork to do business in the future and not take predatory action against small airlines based in Cork. Last week, Cork International Airport passed the 2 million passenger mark. The airport has enjoyed phenomenal growth this year and will shortly become the second largest airport in Ireland, in terms of passengers going through the terminal. Transatlantic services will shortly be arriving in Cork International Airport. I commend the management of the airport on its success. I particularly commend the airport director, Mr. Joe O'Connor, and his staff on their total commitment to serving the south-west region and the public of that region. It is a small but hugely successful and personal airport.</P>
    <P>Aer Rianta has commenced the building of the new &euro;70 million terminal to cater for growth, and a further &euro;70 million will be invested in a new road structure, car park, fire station and air traffic control tower to facilitate the growth of Cork Airport serving the tourism needs of the south-west. Today, Cork is one of the fastest growing regional airports in Europe and I hope Aer Lingus will continue to be a strong component of any future growth at the airport.</P>
    <P>I commend the Minister for Transport, Deputy Brennan, for coming to Cork to announce that the terminal would go ahead despite the huffs and puffs we heard prior to the announcement. I thank the Minister for coming to Cork, touring the airport and telling the management and staff how things are and how they are going to be. It was a pleasure for me to see him and the Taoi<Col N="69" />seach turning the sod for the new development some months ago.</P>
    <P>I would like to see Ryanair doing more for the regions. Mr. Michael O'Leary has been huffing and puffing and trying to blow the house down. He thinks he is running the country and that he can get what he wants when he cries like a child and puts full-page advertisements in the newspapers criticising the Taoiseach and Ministers. He thinks they will click their heels when he snaps his fingers. That is not the case. Mr. O'Leary is not running the country. My advice to him is to belt up and care for his customers. He should respect his customers. Ryanair is not the only low fares airline in the country. Aer Lingus has responded very well and has introduced a number of new routes with low fares. An Aer Lingus flight to Malaga, booked last week, costs &euro;69 each way, plus taxes. The same flight would have cost between &euro;300 and &euro;400 a couple of months ago. Aer Lingus is rising to the low fares challenge.</P>
    <P>Ryanair's days as the low fare airline are numbered. People will not put up with the arrogance of the airline. Mr. O'Leary's policy is not to cater for those who are late for or miss their flight, not to allow those who forget their passports or other identification to board their flight, and to charge more where baggage weighs more than 15 kgs. The airline charges the customer an arm and a leg in extra charges. Ryanair is a low fares airline if a customer abides by Mr. O'Leary's rules, books his or her ticket three to four weeks or months in advance and arrives at the airport on time.</P>
    <P>I am aware of the case of a 79 year old man who travelled from Stanstead Airport recently. He and 40 other passengers were delayed by road works. Were Mr. O'Leary and his airline concerned? No. These people were charged for a second ticket because they had missed their flight.</P>
    <P>Mr. O'Leary appeared before the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Transport and I saw nothing but arrogance from him. He stated to the committee that it was none of his business and he did not care how people travelled to the airport. He used different words and was very disrespectful to the committee when he suggested that passengers could travel to the airport on their backsides if they wished because it was not his concern.</P>
    <P>As my colleague, the Minister for Arts, Sport and Tourism, Deputy O'Donoghue, observed, Mr. O'Leary would be better off providing wheelchairs for his customers and ensure they arrive at the departure gate on time instead of block booking full page advertisements aimed at the Taoiseach, the Minister, Deputy Brennan, other Ministers and the former Minister, Senator O'Rourke. He would be better employed concentrating and improving his services for the fee-paying passenger. Aer Lingus offers low fares and, therefore, I believe Mr. O'Leary's days are numbered and he will change his attitude. His spoilt boy attitude will get him nowhere in future.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="70" />My record on Cork Airport is well known. I have fought tooth and nail for its expansion. Investment in Cork's local airport was always minimal in contrast with the massive sums allocated at all times to Dublin Airport. The protected status and the subsidisation of Shannon Airport ensured its viability. Cork Airport was always the poor relation in the eyes of Aer Rianta. I actively supported workers at the airport when their jobs were threatened or they needed support on specific issues.</P>
    <P>At one time there was a demand from certain business interests that Cork Airport be privatised. I supported the stand made against this proposal in 2001 by Cork Airport Against Break-up. The CAAB demanded significant Government intervention as an alternative to such a move. It stated that this investment was crucial to the survival of this important local facility. The CAAB believed that the airport's best interests would be served by remaining under the wing of Aer Rianta. That was the correct stance in the climate that prevailed, but times have changed.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Government's decision to establish a fully independent and autonomous airport authority for Cork, Dublin and Shannon. This will allow the three airports the freedom to compete fairly on a level playing field.</P>
    <P>Cork Airport is about to embark on an exciting new era which will be of benefit to Cork and will bring a new dynamism and significant growth in business and jobs. The Government has invested almost &euro;200 million to clear the airport's outstanding debts and to cover the current losses associated with the works for its upgrading. This will enable the airport to make a fresh start free of all debt.</P>
    <P>The new &euro;140 million terminal extension is under construction. The new infrastructure will allow Cork Airport to cater for a rapid expansion in business. Under strong, new leadership, free from restrictive Dublin-based central control, Cork Airport will be in a position to aggressively seek new business and offer airlines and passengers a wide range of choice.</P>
    <P>Employees at the airport have nothing to fear from the proposed change. It is an opportunity that should be enthusiastically embraced and fully supported. If it is not grasped, there is no guarantee that such a chance for growth and expansion for Cork Airport will come around again. The Minister for Transport, Deputy Brennan, intends to put in place a structure that will be a launching pad for a new era of expansion.</P>
    <P>The chairman of the new Cork Airport authority, Mr. Joe Gantly, is a businessman who is held in the highest regard in Cork and abroad. He is managing director of Apple Computers in Europe. In Cork, where Apple employs 1,200 people, he is respected as a person of the highest calibre, a man who has clearly proven that he can deliver in a highly competitive business arena. Under his leadership, Cork Airport will finally be allowed to show its true potential. It will benefit <Col N="71" />from the experience, enthusiasm and energy of the progressive director of Cork Airport, Mr. Joe O'Connor.</P>
    <P>I know that workers at Cork and other airports are concerned about how the change will affect their positions. I understand their fears and concerns. The Minister, Deputy Brennan, has had meetings with the Aer Rianta unions on several occasions and has assured them repeatedly that there will be no compulsory job losses and that there will be no change in the terms of employment and conditions the workers enjoy. He has stated clearly that the concerns of the unions will be fully addressed on an ongoing basis between now and the intended date of the establishment of the new airport authorities next year. He is fully convinced that all airports will benefit under the new proposals, if they rise to the challenge.</P>
    <P>The Government has taken a brave step in giving the three airports their independence. I am fully convinced that the new, independent Cork Airport will have the drive and expertise to expand business on a scale that could never be attained under the old regime. The move will result in a boom in business for Cork Airport. It will bring more, not fewer, jobs to the region.</P>
    <P>When the proposals for the break-up of Aer Rianta were announced, I was delighted to hear that Cork Chamber of Commerce and all the business interests in Cork fully supported the Minister. I do not understand how one single union body in Dublin Airport, the dominant body, holds such sway over the workers in the other two airports. It is trying to convince them that the breaking away of Cork Airport would be bad for the workers and the region. That is not the case.</P>
    <P>It is important to note the key points. The Government has decided to establish Cork Airport as an autonomous State-owned airport independent of Aer Rianta. The airport will remain in full State ownership. The target is to establish a new airport authority to manage and operate it on a commercial basis within the next 12 months. The new board will be composed of persons of the highest calibre, including trade union representatives. It will bring together international, national and regional expertise, strong leadership and a focused commitment to the growth and development of Cork Airport. The chairperson designate and deputy chairperson designate will also be members of the Aer Rianta board to be dissolved in 12 months and which will assist the Minister for Transport in implementing the decision on full autonomy for Cork Airport.</P>
    <P>The major development programme under way will proceed on schedule. It is heartening to see the new road network being built and the footprint for the new car park and terminal. The debt associated with this investment programme, together with the existing debt of &euro;40 million and interest payments of more than &euro;6 million, will be removed from Cork Airport. This decision heralds the beginning of a challenging and excit<Col N="72" />ing new era for Cork Airport which will be free to compete with other airports and vigorously pursue new business, free from central control. European traffic grew by 16% in 2002.</P>
    <P>Given this new debt-free beginning and under strong and visionary leadership, Cork Airport will have the opportunity to expand and develop on a scale never before envisaged. The reforms involve bringing in more airlines to Ireland. No privatisation is proposed. No job losses will result. There will be no change in the terms and conditions of workers in Cork Airport.</P>
    <P>In summary, these changes are about a new beginning for Cork Airport, more choice for the people of Cork and surrounding areas, growth in jobs and business and an opportunity for the airport to embrace enthusiastically the challenges that lie ahead. While I do not want him to get a swelled head, we are fortunate to have a Minister for Transport with vision to see the future potential for Cork, Shannon and Dublin airports. I commend him for giving us an opportunity in the Cork area to have our own autonomous airport structure within State control so as to allow us to develop our regional business, as we have been doing in recent years. I have had many informal meetings with those working in Cork Airport to reassure them that they have nothing to fear and that, due to their track record of hard work, they will go from success to success.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JanOSullivan" hpid="Ms O'Sullivan Ms O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to speak on the Bill. Our spokesperson on transport, Deputy Shortall, has outlined the Labour Party's deep concern that the Minister is using this legislation to prepare Aer Lingus for privatisation. In effect, the Minister has used the employee share ownership plan as a screen behind which to hide the intention to privatise the airline. My concerns about this matter were heightened when reading the report of the debate on transport questions two weeks ago. When the Minister was asked what his intentions were with regard to Aer Lingus, he said:</P>
      <P>I take the view that change is probably inevitable . . .  I take a very pragmatic view of the future of Aer Lingus and I will come to a conclusion on that question shortly.</P>
      <P>The Minister also indicated that the chairman of Aer Lingus had expressed the view that a private sector investment process should be initiated without delay. The interchange in the oral questions to the Minister clearly indicates that Aer Lingus wants to take the route of privatisation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Two weeks ago, the Minister said he had still not made up his mind on this issue, and it would be interesting to know if he can tell us now whether he has done so. The Minister's position leaves an uncertain atmosphere and he should tell us his views. Unfortunately, he is leaving many issues hanging in the air without telling us what he wants or intends to achieve. As a result we are getting a haphazard movement in certain directions, which then becomes reality. There does not <Col N="73" />seem to be any leadership in the process. I do not yet know what the Minister's view is on privatising Aer Lingus. However, the Labour Party does not support the privatisation of the airline and does not want to see more and more State companies being sold off for no good reason and with no public information, plan, financial examination or reference to the spatial strategy. That strategy, which is just a year old, set out a detailed and complex network of hubs, gateways, interconnections and links throughout the country.</P>
    <P>If the Minister pursues his plans for Aer Lingus and Aer Rianta, we will have an even greater development of the eastern seaboard, with everybody either living there or commuting to work there. People are already commuting to Dublin from halfway across the country but in future they will be travelling even further if there is no link-up between the Minister's transport system plans and the spatial strategy of his colleague, the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government.</P>
    <P>I appeal to the Minister to provide more information and to spend more time thinking through the consequences of his proposals. He should pay attention in particular to whatever reports are on the table concerning these issues. Some very good reports have been published concerning the importance of Shannon Airport and I will refer to them later.</P>
    <P>It is important to pay tribute to Aer Lingus for the way in which the company has turned around its affairs. The process has been painful but the company has managed to achieve profitability in the hugely competitive climate of the international aviation industry. Aer Lingus operates with other partners and provides a good service, which is surely what we want from our national airline. The company has gone through a difficult period which affected its employees but in the current situation there seems to be no good reason to sell it off. The Government should think through all these issues because there is no reason Aer Lingus should be sold off to the private sector under EU competition rules. The Minister says he has not yet made up his mind so he should take these points into account.</P>
    <P>Business people in the Shannon region have problems with Aer Lingus given that there is no comprehensive air service from Shannon to Dublin and other European capitals, which would enable them to do their business and return within a reasonable time. This is particularly the case with early morning and late evening flights which are insufficient. Many of the decisions concerning the airline are taken by decision-makers in Dublin, rather than in the interests of Shannon or Cork. Aer Lingus should address these issues and ensure that the interests of its customers in Shannon and Cork airports are catered for.</P>
    <P>In 1997, the Tucker study was undertaken for the Mid-West Regional Authority. It indicated that 36,000 jobs on the western seaboard were underpinned by Shannon International Airport. If that study was updated it would certainly bring <Col N="74" />the number of jobs to 40,000 of more. Shannon Airport is hugely important to the mid-west region for industry and tourism as well as for the region's general economic infrastructure and interdependence. The Minister should not do anything that would affect the economy of the region.</P>
    <P>It has been suggested that the 50-50 status between Shannon and Dublin with regard to transatlantic routes will inevitably have to be changed as a result of the negotiations concerning the EU open skies directive. It has also been suggested that, while the Government does not wish to do so, it will have to implement such change as a result of the EU's competition rules. This, however, is not the case. Information from Mr. van Hassell in the European Commission indicated that in the context of the open skies directive, it is not necessary to change the current equal proportion of transatlantic flights coming to Shannon and Dublin because that applies to all airlines. In other words, there is no competitive advantage for one airline over another and, therefore, what applies to Aer Lingus also applies to Delta and other transatlantic carriers. In effect, the equal status does not have to be changed under the open skies negotiations.</P>
    <P>The Minister should have some concern for the serious fears being expressed in the Shannon region about the possible change in the existing rules. Transatlantic traffic represents over 40% of Shannon's entire turnover. It represents approximately 7% of Dublin's entire business. It is of huge importance to Shannon, therefore, whereas it is of relatively minor importance to Dublin. It is one of the few instruments of balance in terms of regional development and giving a leg up to a region as opposed to the capital city. I urge the Minister to maintain that balance because serious concerns have been expressed in the Shannon region from all sectors &ndash; business, tourism, trade unions, ordinary citizens and people who use the airport &ndash; about the consequences of losing transatlantic business which is inevitable if the current status changes.</P>
    <P>A deputation appeared before the Oireachtas transport committee in Leinster House and it pointed out clearly that in other European countries where there was an opportunity to fly to any airport, in nearly all cases the airlines fly only to the capital. They do not fly to other cities because it suits airlines to fly to one destination if they are travelling that distance across the Atlantic. If they get the opportunity to fly to one place and that place is the capital city, experience appears to indicate that they will gradually drop routes to other destinations. We have very good reason to fear that if the Minister removes the 50:50 status that currently exists, Shannon will lose routes to Dublin and that will add to the problems of the east coast as well as those of the mid-west. It will add to the east coast problems in terms of an already very congested airport in Dublin and the problems will be immeasurable in terms of the mid-west region. People are already travelling to <Col N="75" />Dublin Airport from wide distances around the eastern seaboard and the Minister should be encouraging people to use the other airports and not put measures in place that will discourage the use of the other airports by airlines and passengers.</P>
    <P>That is the main point I want to make. It is vitally important that the Minister reviews that issue before he makes a decision. I understand he will be making a decision on it fairly quickly but it is vital that he takes into account the serious concerns expressed in the mid-west region. That one measure gives us the opportunity to benefit from transatlantic numbers, and that benefit is considerable in terms of the money that transatlantic passengers bring in. These figures are somewhat out of date but one study stated that every 3,000 leisure travellers arriving via Shannon for a week in the west of Ireland spent over £1 million on accommodation, food and drink, gift shopping, activities, entertainment and internal transports. We are talking about the loss of a very large amount of money to the region.</P>
    <P>On the question of regionalism and the importance of having a balance in the country &ndash; an issue which does not come directly under the Minister's Department &ndash; but it is crucially important that the spatial strategy issue is addressed. Some aspects of the strategy come under this Minister's Department and I particularly refer to the rail aspect and the importance of having the western corridor and the proposed link to Shannon Airport. The Shannon group which appeared before the transport committee, led by a member of the Minister's party, Councillor Seán Hillary from Shannon, made a proposal which has been endorsed by the committee that a study should be funded on a rail link between Shannon and Limerick, along the west coast, through Limerick, along the south-east to Dublin and other parts of the country.</P>
    <P>I urge the Minister to take on board the seriousness of the issue of rail and road connectivity to Shannon Airport. I realise the issue of road connectivity should be addressed to the other Minister but many of those projects are now behind schedule, particularly the tunnel in Limerick &ndash; the fourth crossing which will facilitate access to Shannon Airport from other areas. Those areas are nearer to Shannon but very often people choose to fly through Dublin because it takes so long to get to Shannon by road from certain parts of the country. All of these issues are crucially important in terms of Shannon and access to the airport, which is vitally important to people in the region and in terms of its potential. The people who use Shannon probably do not travel within a very wide radius of the airport but the potential exists for it to be wider and for Shannon to be a hub of activity for the mid-west, parts of the midlands and the upper part of the south-eastern and southern regions.</P>
    <P>I want to address the proposed break-up of Aer Rianta and express the concerns already <Col N="76" />expressed by my colleague, Deputy Shortall, and my party leader, Deputy Rabbitte. The Minister appears to be going ahead with the break-up despite the PricewaterhouseCoopers report, other internal reports carried out by unions, management and others within Aer Rianta, and without any kind of transparency in terms of the information the Minister has on the viability of the three airports as separate entities. Of particular concern, and Deputy Shortall referred to this aspect, is the fact that there is no business plan or any coherent reason given for breaking up a successful company into three separate components.</P>
    <P>There has been a continuous lobby in the Shannon region to have some independence; some people wanted full independence. I am aware the Minister has some support in the region but many people would have settled for limited independence, and that is the position my party has consistently taken with regard to Aer Rianta. We would have settled for a level of independence because there was a belief that operations were being driven by Dublin and that we needed to be able to take strategic decisions in the mid-west region &ndash; I am sure the Cork people felt the same about Cork &ndash; with regard to marketing and extending the routes that come through Shannon. A large sector in the region, however, was not pushing for full independence and I suggest to the Minister that the sector pushing for full independence had not done its homework either, because it did not have any more information than the Minister on the way this would work. Mr. Pat Shanahan, whom the Minister has appointed as the chairperson of the interim board, is a very good person. The Minister has put some very good people on the board and I believe they will do their utmost to make this work. However, I am concerned that they do not have the satisfaction of knowing that this is a viable proposition. They will work as hard as they can to make it work if the Minister persists but I put it to him that he has information from the PricewaterhouseCoopers report and other information at his disposal which would indicate that it does not make sense to ask those companies to operate separately. It will be a double albatross around the neck of the Shannon company if the Minister also changes the 50:50 gateway status between Shannon and Dublin, if the rail link is not provided and the other infrastructural projects are delayed in the way they have been up to now. There is a whole series of interconnected issues in this debate. I appreciate that today we are addressing the Aer Lingus Bill but all of these issues are very much connected to each other.</P>
    <P>The Minister is someone who likes to make announcements and is busy trying to get things done. However, some of these decisions are crucial to the lives and the livelihoods of a large number of people and to the economic and social welfare of an entire region in our case and, to a lesser extent, the Cork region also. I ask the Minister not to rush into decisions that will not be easy <Col N="77" />or even possible to reverse. Before he makes any decisions on these areas I ask him to allow for proper debate and present the facts and the information that is available in a public way. In that way, decisions will be made on the basis of sound economic information, following proper debate where people have the information and in the best interests of the country as a whole. The country will not thrive if a growing number of people believe they have to live and work within commuting distance of Dublin, villages continue to decrease in size and rural areas continue to lose schools, post offices and other support services.</P>
    <P>It is not good enough for the Government to announce a major spatial strategy featuring an interesting collection of terms, including hubs and gateways, leave it untouched for a year and then introduce an alternative transport strategy, which ignores the spatial strategy, forces people to leave the designated hubs and gateways and weakens the regions while strengthening the greater Dublin area. It must rethink its approach.</P>
    <P>While I appreciate the Minister is trying to make decisions in his Department, they are inextricably linked with other Departments, including the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment. It is vital we maintain jobs in the Shannon region, which has experienced a series of job losses in the past year, including the loss of more than 100 jobs less than two weeks ago caused by the closure of NETg, part of the Thomson Corporation.</P>
    <P>My colleague, Deputy Shortall, has already indicated that the Labour Party is seriously concerned about and opposes the hidden agenda in the legislation, the sell-off of Aer Lingus. I hope the Minister will take on board some of the points I have made. While I appreciate that several of them have a wider dimension, it is crucial he listens to the voices of those who are concerned about the decisions he appears to be about to make.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaddyMcHughIND" hpid="Mr. McHugh Mr. McHugh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McHugh</NameTxt>
      <P>The Aer Lingus Bill 2003 gives effect to the employee share option plan and makes provision to facilitate a private sector investment process if that option is pursued in the future. One must acknowledge the remarkable recovery Aer Lingus has made from the problems it faced several years ago. On the brink of bankruptcy in 2001 when it made a loss of &euro;52.1 million, the company made a remarkable turnaround in 2002 when it recorded an operating profit of &euro;63.8 million. Management and workers were responsible for and can take pride in this turnaround which has been so successful that the company expects to make profits of around &euro;75 million this year. As part of the agreements arrived at to achieve this transformation, an employee share option plan was agreed. The Bill gives effect to the plan and, as such, is to be welcomed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In effect, the provisions of the Bill are about setting part of the scene for the future of aviation. It would be impossible, therefore, to contribute <Col N="78" />to this debate without considering the PricewaterhouseCoopers report on the future of aviation and Dublin, Cork and Shannon airports, the contents of which we became aware of in recent weeks. I do not agree with the wave of condemnation that greeted the Minister's proposal to break up Aer Lingus, which arose as a result of the contents of the PWC report. The future of our airports must be governed by a strategic plan, geared towards the management of the airports, which has at its core the notion of service, viability and profitability. The great need for balanced regional development requires the application of a regional focus and, if necessary, awarding compensation to address the disparity in terms of aviation between Dublin and the regions.</P>
    <P>The forecast in the PWC report that Shannon and Dublin airports would continue to be loss-making in the initial years after the break-up of Aer Rianta does not mean our first reaction should be to retreat to the bunkers and cry, &ldquo;No change&rdquo;. This option is never credible in a changing world, particularly in a progressive society such as this. One of the main reasons for the proposed break-up of Aer Rianta is to create competition between the airports. I subscribe to the notion that increased competition is good because it leads to improved performance and efficiency and should in theory lead to increased profits.</P>
    <P>The PWC report is based on the premise that nothing else will change after the break-up of Aer Rianta, which is not a sustainable scenario. Where the cost base in any of the airports is too high, an examination will need to be carried out to establish the reason and adjustments will have to be made to correct the position.</P>
    <P>The report contains comparisons between Shannon and Bristol airports, which carry similar numbers of passengers. In 2001, Shannon Airport carried 2.4 million passengers and incurred an operating loss of &euro;1.1 million, whereas Bristol Airport carried 2.1 million passengers and made an operating profit of &euro;16.9 million. Surely it is appropriate to ask the reason for this startling difference in financial fortunes of &euro;18 million.</P>
    <P>Similarly, a comparison between Cork and Cardiff airports reveals that the former carried 1.7 million passengers and incurred an operating loss of &euro;3.2 million in 2001 as compared to the latter, which carried 1.5 million passengers and made a profit of &euro;15.7 million, a difference of &euro;18.9 million. The main message here is of inefficiency in the running of our airports. There should be an outcry demanding greater efficiencies as opposed to taking a dog in the manger attitude, burying our heads in the sand or crying, &ldquo;No change, no surrender&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>It has been suggested that autonomy for Cork and Shannon airports would endanger funding for the smaller regional airports such as Galway. Although I do not envisage that this will be the case, I call on the Minister to address this concern. Deputy Ring appeared to warn the Minister <Col N="79" />not to support Galway Airport at the expense of Knock International Airport. While I do not want the Minister to support Galway Airport at the expense of any other airport, he should, nevertheless, support it in whatever way possible because Galway has been designated a gateway city under the national spatial strategy and is the dominant city and gateway to the region. If the national spatial strategy is to have any prospect of survival, it must be given Government support. It must support the gateways and hubs designated under the strategy if its policy of promoting balanced regional development is to have any chance of survival.</P>

      <P>Ba mhaith liom buíochas a ghabháil leis an Teachta McHugh as a chuid ama a roinnt liom. The Aer Lingus Bill is important for the country and my constituents in Dublin North, many of whom rely on Aer Lingus directly or indirectly. For this reason, it is important the Minister's comments are clearly understood as the soft words in his speech may hide a more brutal meaning in the legislation. In referring to a framework for external investment, he stated it would be used in the event that the Government embarks on such a process, as if there is any doubt about the Government's determination to do so. This has been the consistent view of commentators.</P>
      <P>Aer Lingus has undergone considerable pain and we all recall that the company let go 2,000 staff in 2001. At the time it wanted 2,500 staff let go out of a total of 6,300 permanent staff. There were also other issues, such as the sale of assets, the pay freeze, the 5.5% PPF pay increase which was foregone and the changes in work practices. There was much trauma within Aer Lingus and it is still a recent memory for many people.</P>
      <P>The Minister said that the legislation includes new pension provisions. That is a matter of great concern not only to people in Aer Lingus, but also to many members of the retired airline staff association, which includes former staff members of Aer Rianta and Aer Lingus as well as some members from FLS. They have already experienced the cold winds of change, particularly as regards Christmas, in that they do not expect their traditional Christmas dinner. It is claimed that because the pension scheme has failed to keep pace with wage increases, all members of the scheme have been seriously disadvantaged. They believe it is important that the airline pension is immediately brought into line with other State and semi-State pensions, as highlighted in comparative studies, and that it does not fall below average industrial wage increases.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The pensioners from Aer Lingus are being further disadvantaged. The Government could, without incurring initial expenditure, involve the retired airline staff association in discussions about the future, given that its members are part of that future and that they rely on the pension scheme. When the Minister speaks about introd<Col N="80" />ucing new pension provisions, he should include the people directly involved, namely, the pensioners who built up the company over the years, who have given huge returns to the State and who are entitled to be part of the discussions if change is envisaged.</P>
    <P>The Minister exaggerated the situation when he spoke about Aer Lingus serving 42 routes and nine new European routes in 2004. As Deputy Boyle said, he did not mention the loss of routes. Cork is close to Deputy Boyle's heart and I understand why people in Cork are sore that the Minister seems to have overlooked that matter. There is doubt among workers in Aer Rianta and Aer Lingus about the future and about what the Government has in store for them, if it is thinking about them at all. The threatened break-up of Aer Rianta, despite not having a business plan, is also strange to understand, given that the Government has been advised that it would be better not to break it up. I ask the Minister to take that advice on board. Aer Lingus is facing privatisation incrementally, but as quickly as the Government can manage it.</P>
    <P>It is not often that the airlines are united, but that is the case in this regard. They are united in the way they are looking at the plans for the building programme for a new runway at Dublin Airport, at a cost of between &euro;100 million and &euro;200 million, depending on which report one reads. Deputy O'Sullivan mentioned the mid-west. It is strange to hear the Government talking about Aer Rianta's plans to cause more congestion at Dublin Airport by building another runway when Cork and Shannon are badly in need of additional business. How serious is the Government about the national spatial strategy when it is flagrantly disregarding its principles of balanced regional development in favour of more congestion in the eastern region?</P>
    <P>The Government also seems reluctant to grasp the nettle of providing a metro to Dublin Airport which would also serve Swords. Aer Rianta and all the airlines agree that even at its current level of congestion Dublin Airport needs a metro. I understand that the Government was strongly advised that it was not an option not to have a metro. I urge the Minister to take that advice seriously and to grasp the nettle. He must ensure that Aer Lingus, the other airlines, Aer Rianta and the people in Swords, many of whom work at Dublin Airport, get a metro to avoid increased levels of congestion. Operation Freeflow notwithstanding, we know the situation is getting steadily worse. The metro must be built.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Morgan</NameTxt>
      <P>For almost 70 years Aer Lingus has represented the people in cities and countries around the world. It has made and continues to make a large contribution to our image abroad as an extremely valuable brand associated with Ireland. The contribution of the company to the development of tourism has been enormous. For decades the economic conditions created by many of the other parties in this House forced <Col N="81" />hundreds of thousands of young people to leave Ireland, thereby creating a diaspora which stretches across the world. Every Christmas one can expect to see at least one or two RTE reporters at Dublin Airport interviewing people coming home for the festive season from such places as England, America, Australia and elsewhere. It is worth noting that Aer Lingus recently celebrated 45 years of service to Boston.</P>
      <P>Aer Lingus has faithfully served the people through good and bad times and during times when airplanes were full of people escaping the economic chaos or full of investors and returning emigrants. Sadly, however, that contribution to Ireland seems to have been lost on some of the Deputies who have spoken in this debate. They seem too eager to support the privatisation of Aer Lingus, which has been facilitated through the back door by the Minister, who has needlessly tied the employee share ownership plan to the privatisation of the airline. The deal on employee share ownership, which was hammered out with the trade unions at Aer Lingus, is not dependent on facilitating privatisation. The legislation should not make that connection. The Minister is duplicitous in his actions. Unless he separates the two distinct and separate issues in the legislation and implements the share ownership plan, Sinn Féin will oppose the Bill and support the amendment tabled by the Labour Party.</P>
      <P>I want to comment on the attitude of the junior partner in Government to the Bill. The members of the Progressive Democrats seem to have been muzzled on the issue of privatising our national airline. Perhaps Fianna Fáil is keeping its watchdogs quiet on this issue. One hardly wonders at the attitude of the Progressive Democrats to selling off our national asset to their friends in big business. As a party waging an ideological campaign against working class people and public sector workers, we cannot be in any doubt about their intense dislike of Aer Lingus. The success of our State airline undermines their absolute devotion to the greed based Thatcherite ideology. The Progressive Democrats typically characterise our public sector workers in State companies as lazy, inefficient, bureaucratic and incompetent. They believe that private sector companies, which were not to be found when the country needed to build vital strategic infrastructure, can do anything and everything better. In one year the workers of Aer Lingus turned a loss of &euro;139.9 million into a profit of &euro;35.3 million. The company is on track for increased profits this year and is expanding its services and purchasing new airplanes. A successful State owned company is the type of thing which keeps the Progressive Democrats awake at night. They would prefer privatisation. The Minister should not fall for that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome the comments of Deputy Glennon who spoke at length about his serious personal and political difficulty with the sale of what he refers to as a major national resource. I agree with him. As he said, we, the people, own Aer <Col N="82" />Lingus. I understand Deputy Glennon's beliefs are widely shared throughout his party, despite the comments of party members, such as Deputy Killeen who does not understand why a State airline is a strategic asset for an island nation. His view seems to be shared by no less a person than his party leader, whose statement of opposition to privatisation last July was commented on earlier in this debate. Despite the opposition of the Taoiseach and Deputy Glennon to privatisation, the right-wing extremists in the Progressive Democrats and their allies in Fianna Fáil are determined to forge ahead with policies destined to enrich the few rather than benefit the many.</P>
    <P>The Government wants to flog Aer Lingus to raise money because it has no desire to raise it in the normal way by putting in place a banded tax system that would remove the crushing burden of funding from the ordinary PAYE worker and place it on the companies and those who for decades have profited on the backs of the workers. I call on Fianna Fáil Members who are opposed to the privatisation of the State airline to stand up and be counted. They should try and reclaim their party so that it stops functioning as a surrogate for the Progressive Democrats and their friends in IBEC.</P>
    <P>Aer Lingus does not need to be privatised, it is in profit and making money. It does not need third party involvement. Sinn Féin's message to any Government planning to sell the company, whether through an IPO, a trade sale or some other method, is simple &ndash; hands off. Aer Lingus belongs to the people of Ireland. The Government should think long and hard before betraying the people and selling off a vital national asset as it will be fought every step of the way, both in this Parliament and outside it by the workers of Aer Lingus and their supporters. I am proud to count Sinn Féin among those supporters.</P>
    <P>However, I call on Aer Lingus to deliver on its commitments to paying cabin crew. The Labour Court has recommended that the 4% pay increase due under the PPF and the 3% due under Sustaining Progress be paid from the dates claimed by the union. Workers in Aer Lingus made huge sacrifices to keep the company afloat, including pay freezes and redundancies. Their contribution should be recognised by the payment of the wage increases they are due.</P>
    <P>We have seen in the past how Irish Shipping was sold. In our situation, as an island nation, it would be a scandal if Aer Lingus was to follow suit. It is a vital piece of national infrastructure that should be retained. We are counting on the Minister to keep it for future generations.</P>

      <P>This Bill is one that every Member of the House needs to take great care and time in studying, because it sets the scene for the proposed privatisation of some, if not all, of our public companies. Fianna Fáil backbenchers, especially, should not just blindly take the word of their own party on this, but research the proposals properly. As Deputy O'Sullivan said, they <Col N="83" />should study the hidden agenda in this. I note that Deputy Haughey seems to have seen the hidden agenda and has spoken openly about it. I hope the Minister takes account of his comments, and those of the rest of, us regarding privatisation and the ramifications of the Bill.</P>
      <P>I wonder do those Tory Members of the British House of Commons, who blindly followed Margaret Thatcher and supported her privatisation programme, consider that it was this area in which they went wrong politically. In light of what they know today, I wonder do they consider that their actions, or at the very least, some of the consequences, were foolish? That privatisation programme, along with the poll tax, was the making of the British Labour Party in its search for power. It is worth thinking about when considering the Government's furtherance of undiluted PD policy that does not suit the whole country.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Transport, Deputy Brennan, went to great lengths to convince us the primary reason for the Bill is his and the Government's concern for the welfare of the Aer Lingus workers. On hearing this I almost wept because the Leas-Cheann Comhairle and I both know that only for the strong unions present in the company there would not be a word about it. If the Minister, or any of his colleagues, had any interest in the workers of this company their primary concern would be for them, and all other workers and taxpayers, to ensure they get value for the tax they are paying to the Exchequer. These workers should not be left in the dark on any issue, they should be properly involved in all decisions regarding their future and their work environment. We must get the best out of their talents through a proper promotion system from top to bottom.</P>
      <P>Let us have a look at this company under the heading of the tax that workers pay. Will all Aer Lingus workers and taxpayers have free admission to the glorified leisure centre in Punchestown? They should have, as their money partly paid for it. Are they getting free access to the Luas light rail system if it is ever completed? They and all other tax payers should do so as their money paid for the ripping up of Dublin's streets and the closure of some Dublin businesses. It allowed the Government to let construction companies line their own pockets with overspends of millions of tax euro.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Where is the health strategy that the Air Lingus workers and others paid for? I could continue in this vein because the Government's commitment to workers is a lame joke. In a recent survey, over 80% of the people who were asked said they resent paying tax as they feel the Government wastes the money. It is not a nice state of affairs for a Government that is not trusted by 80% of the population to do what it is paid to do &ndash; collect and spend tax wisely. A company performing like this would have gone out of business long ago, and if the Government or even the Department of Finance were subject <Col N="84" />to the Government sponsored Companies (Auditing and Accounting) Bill 2003, which is slowly proceeding through the House, they would be the biggest offenders and law breakers.</P>
    <P>The Government got the people to vote for it at the last general election on a platform of lies and false promises, which it now thinks gives it the right to build leisure centres and other pet projects at whim while refusing to answer questions posed by the taxpayers or even by the Members of this House who elected it to office. It is a national scandal. It is not concerned with looking after the interests of the workers of Aer Lingus.</P>
    <P>Any company is only as good as its work force, and, as the old saying goes, &ldquo;there is no such thing as bad workers only bad managers.&rdquo; If this is true, and I have no reason to believe it is not, were the problems in Aer Lingus prior to 11 September 2001 not a problem of management rather than staff? Unless I am mistaken, to get a job at any level in Aer Lingus, one is required to have a basic education with at least a leaving certificate qualification. Yet it seems that over the years, one need only be a friend of a Minister or the Taoiseach to be appointed to the board of the company. I would like to apply to be interviewed for membership of the board, which has unlimited access to taxpayers' money, yet has little or no accountability. However, interviews for board membership are not held.</P>
    <P>If the Members of this House can see nothing wrong with this system I worry for the future of us all. Were Aer Lingus and Aer Rianta used by the Government to reduce the unemployment figures in the north Dublin and Meath areas in the run up to previous general elections? I do not imply anything against any Member of this House, but if that was the case then the real story behind losses in these public companies is one of political involvement with no accountability, again paid for by the poor taxpayer. Perhaps it is not true, but it is time the record was put straight. It is also time that all appointments to the boards of State companies were advertised in the national media and vetted by Oireachtas committees. Perhaps State companies would then more accurately reflect their counterparts in the private sector. The era of jobs for the boys is gone, or at least it should be. It is about perception. I have repeatedly asked the Government to introduce a system whereby anyone appointed to new or existing boards must be approved and interviewed by the Members of the House in committee hearings. Accountability and perception are the values that matter. In this regard our job in this House is to instil trust.</P>
    <P>It is amazing that the events of 11 September 2001, involving the tragic loss of lives 3,000 miles away, turned Aer Lingus into a profitable company. Nobody has bothered to ask why. Before that date, a great many more people were flying, so why is it that the company could not make money then? Was anybody in management sacked over this? Did anyone in high authority <Col N="85" />lose their pension rights over it? Or are the Members of this House supposed to put it down to an act of God?</P>
    <P>The company now congratulates itself on its new-found good fortune, even though I thank the workers and their sacrifices over the years for this. The Minister was quick to praise the role of the workers in the financial turn around of the company, and rightly so.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>This motion deals with community employment schemes. There have been many questions, debates and motions in the House on the issue for a good reason. There is widespread acknowledgement of the value of these schemes to communities throughout Ireland. Every Deputy in the House knows from first-hand experience that terrible damage has been done to vulnerable groups by the savage cuts in the schemes which have taken place over the last two years.</P>
      <P>After months of attempting to defend the indefensible, the Minister of State with responsibility for labour affairs, Deputy Fahey, has finally broken ranks and admitted the truth. In his own words, these cuts are wrong. They were forced on him, according to himself, by the Minister for Finance. When a member of Government reaches the point of publicly declaring that a policy of Government is wrong, under the doctrine of collective responsibility he must either accept responsibility for these actions or remove himself from the responsibility. Deputy Fahey seems to want to do neither. Instead he is leading his backbenchers in a revolt against his own policy. This Alice in Wonderland situation saw 33 Fianna Fáil Deputies demand a change of policy last Tuesday &ndash; they are probably not here tonight because they are still demanding it &ndash; and a full restoration of the 10,000 places that have been cut in the last two years on the CE schemes. Of course the Minister for Finance was in Brussels last Tuesday &ndash; when the cat is away the bravery of Fianna Fáil backbenchers is increased.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This week it is time for those Government Deputies who agree with the Minister of State to make their minds up. They must either vote with this side of the House to restore vital community employment or give up their pretence at concern. I am talking about Government Deputies because the Progressive Democrats are also publicly disagreeing with one another over CE cuts, despite the fact that the political head of the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment is the leader of the Progressive Democrats and the Tánaiste. Deputy Sexton criticised Deputy Fiona O'Malley for her attack on the Minister of State, Deputy Fahey. Deputy O'Malley accused her colleague Minister of giving politics a bad name &ndash; that is what the Minister of State is doing, according to his own &ndash; and playing to the public gallery. Deputy Sexton rounded on Deputy O'Malley and promised on RTE television to make her views on community <Col N="87" />employment cutbacks known during this debate. We wait with bated breath.</P>
    <P>The issue of community employment should not be dealt with through posturing or phoney wars. When Deputies come to vote on this motion tomorrow, Dáil Éireann may vote to acknowledge the value of the thousands of schemes up and down the country, of the 20,000 people who are serving their communities doing essential and vital work and of the thousands of community and voluntary bodies which sponsor CE schemes. Alternatively, it may vote to reduce all their efforts to a mere labour market strategy of limited intrinsic value and therefore open to be cut or ended when labour market conditions improve. Few issues give a clearer insight into the difference between a conservative understanding of how communities work and the progressive view of development at local level. The issue cannot be fudged. Deputies must either vote to restore these schemes because they are worth the investment &ndash; because they have intrinsic value &ndash; or vote to register their satisfaction with the cuts of the last two years.</P>
    <P>When CE was introduced by the former Minister for Finance, Deputy Quinn, few expected it to become the success story it subsequently did. It has supported sports organisations, the elderly, the disabled, arts groups, environmental protection and community development. Over the years it has become the glue that holds together quality of life in communities. The Government has lost the plot. Whatever CE was originally intended to do, it has become much more. When the Minister of State &ndash; or as we saw earlier, the Taoiseach &ndash; quotes the reduction in numbers of the long-term unemployed as justification for cutting CE, of which we will hear more tonight, he misses the point. He fails to understand that these schemes do essential work. Without the schemes the work will not be done and we will all become impoverished.</P>
    <P>It is interesting that the first sentence of the Government's proposed amendment to tonight's motion says that Dáil Éireann, &ldquo;reaffirms that the primary role of community employment is that of an active labour market programme&rdquo;. The Government has no concept of how it is much more than a labour market programme &ndash; it is the value added that sustains community activity and community groups and provides support and a better quality of life for thousands of our citizens. Another falsehood began to be peddled today when Government representatives compared the numbers on one scheme, community employment, with the numbers on three schemes, the community employment scheme, the jobs initiative and the social economy programme. The criteria for participation in each scheme are different. It is nothing more than a patent attempt at deception to roll three schemes together and pretend they can be compared to the numbers on one scheme. The people are not to be taken as fools.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="88" />A third falsehood is the empty promise made again and again on Question Time by the Minister of State, Deputy Fahey, and others that the disabled would be unaffected by these cuts &ndash; that they would, in the phrase of the Minister of State, be ring-fenced. Last week every Member of this House was lobbied by campaigners on behalf of the Centres for Independent Living &ndash; disabled people seeking a measure of independence for themselves. They brought to each of us first-hand testimony of how their quality of life had been adversely affected by the CE squeeze. Not only are the numbers being cut, but the terms of qualification for CE participation have also been changed. No longer can the long-term unemployed return to CE after a period away from it. The Minister has introduced three-year term limits which is having a hugely negative impact. This is deliberate policy &ndash; it is not by accident. The leaked Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment report of senior officials to the Cabinet committee on social inclusion states that while places may be ring-fenced, individual personnel are not. They are being squeezed out one way or another.</P>
    <P>Another famous promise was based on mainstreaming. Although it was mentioned this afternoon by the Taoiseach, this is also being abandoned. There is no hope left for people who are losing their personal assistants or who depend on any of the vital work being done in the health area by those in community employment. If they lose out under one of the mechanisms of squeeze that the Minister and the Minister of State have introduced, there is no prospect of replacement with mainstream money. I quote from the report of senior officials to the Cabinet committee on social inclusion which states: &ldquo;In the light of the experience of mainstreaming in the education sector, it has been decided not to pursue mainstreaming in the health related areas of community employment.&rdquo; All of this havoc is being wreaked on communities and individuals and on the prospect of people getting back to a decent standard of living. For what purpose? That is the question I repeatedly put to the Minister of State. Why is it being done? Surely it is not to save the miserable few bob.</P>
    <P>The core cost of community employment is the difference between what a person would receive on social welfare and what he or she gets on community employment. The basic personal rate for those on community employment schemes is &euro;149.20 per week. Persons with a qualifying dependent get &euro;232 per week while the child dependent allowance is &euro;16.80. By comparison, a person on unemployment assistance gets &euro;124.80 per week, or &euro;207.80 per week with a qualified dependent. The child dependent allowance is again &euro;16.80. The core cost per participant of maintaining somebody in community employment is &euro;24 per week. That is what this is about. In a budget of billions of euro are we going to rob communities of vital participation and vital work? Are we going to rob people of the dignity <Col N="89" />of labour and put them back on unemployment assistance to save a lousy &euro;24 per week?</P>
    <P>We have heard the published figures tonight. Miraculously, like last year, they are much better than we were led to believe when the Estimate process was going through. There can be no justification for the savagery that has been unleashed on communities and individuals by the reduction of 10,000 places on community employment schemes over the last two years. Since there is no logic from the financial perspective in throwing somebody off a community employment scheme for &euro;24 per week, it can only be explained by the Government embracing an ideology which is foreign to this country &ndash; an ideological view of community and of people. It is a view which places value only on what can be deemed to be economically productive. It has no wish to understand what adds value to lives among ordinary communities &ndash; among those who want to play sport, who want to live independently, who want to enjoy or be exposed to the arts for the first time. If one is not an economically productive unit in this new economy one has no place and must be crushed. This is a view of Ireland that is alien to our traditions.</P>
    <P>This House will have the opportunity tomorrow to decide whether this is a vision of our tomorrows that we want. Those who are currently wrestling with their consciences on the far side of the House can decide to reject this narrow economic vision of Ireland and show that they place value on the people in communities and the work done by participants in community employment schemes and the voluntary and community organisations who sponsor them through their efforts to give a leg up to vulnerable people throughout the country.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>The community employment scheme cut that has been proposed and accepted by Fianna Fáil is the ultimate attack on the old, the weak and the ill. It Is something that Fianna Fáil in the past would have stood steadfastly against. However, the new Fianna Fáil can only raise a hypocritical voice, in some kind of residual memory of what it stood for in the past as the dog now being wagged by the PD tail.</P>
      <P>Community employment schemes are a valuable contribution to the quality of Irish life. They provide services which would not otherwise be available. They give employment to people who would otherwise not have it. The Government has embarked on a huge attack on those services and on the lives of those involved &ndash; the long-term unemployed, lone parents, those involved in the meals on wheels service, in assistance for the aged and in caring, indeed all of the elements that provide quality of life in society.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A couple of years ago a commitment was made to the RAPID programme by which funding of &euro;2 billion was to have been provided for structured programmes and projects that would target the most disadvantaged communities. That has gone by the board. Approximately &euro;5 million has been <Col N="90" />spent in deceiving communities into thinking much would be delivered towards eliminating levels of deprivation in up to 37 of the most disadvantaged areas. Little hope is left if what is currently in place, the community employment schemes, is eliminated. They have been drastically reduced already during the six years this and the previous Government has been in office. The Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Harney, is determined to get rid of them, as is the Minister of State, Deputy Fahey, despite his fine words behind closed doors, when the cat was away in Brussels. It will be interesting to see what he now has to say and to note the position taken by the 40 staunch supporters who apparently signed their name in support of his views when the votes are counted tomorrow.</P>

      <P>They will hardly be in the House or if they are they will not be supporting the Minister of State. It will be interesting to see whether he will stand over what he said.</P>
      <P>In my constituency of Dublin Central, the Taoiseach's constituency, traditionally one of the most deprived and under-developed areas in the country, the community employment schemes have been a tremendous advantage to local communities in the services they have provided. In the summer when the rumours started and FÁS was indicating the schemes were going to be cut again, a number of people on the schemes and on the jobs initiative programmes went on hunger strike outside the GPO for 24 hours to highlight the good work being done and the loss of services being threatened. That happened in the Taoiseach's constituency, so perhaps he might look into his heart and decide that some continued support is required.</P>
      <P>The cutbacks do not only affect this area. The Estimate for the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform proposes to slash funding for awareness in education programmes for asylum seekers and refugees by 76%. Across the board, the Government is prepared to slash funding which is necessary to improve the quality of life and assist communities that might be under threat. This is a disgrace. We hope that the Minister of State will stand by his fine words and stand up and be counted when the opportunity arises.</P>

      <P>The dual success of the community employment schemes is highly visible. It has taken people out of long-term unemployment and given them work cleaning and beautifying villages. The physical and social benefits are there for all to see. That is what the editorial in today's <i>Irish Independent</i> has to say. While it sums up the value of the community employment schemes, I wish to expand on what it had to say. The CE schemes restored the dignity of regular work to the marginalised in our society. It restored a pride <Col N="91" />of place to communities that had lost that pride. It provided essential basic training for those who were long out of the work ethic or who had never been in the workforce. The scheme organisers were also highly successful in placing participants in full-time jobs. The CE schemes also catered for a number of special people, those with low self-esteem and those with low or no employment prospects. These special people were transformed by their participation. They are particularly and harshly dumped on the scrap heap with no prospects, by the cruel decision to introduce these cuts.</P>
      <P>What has been the effect of the decision of the Fianna Fáil revolutionaries, those on the Front Bench and the Progressive Democrats to slash the community employment schemes? Let us take Celbridge as a typical example. That scheme began in 1993 and was chopped at the beginning of 2003. It employed 12 trainees and one supervisor. They transformed the village of Celbridge and brought pride of place to its new citizens, and dignity and self-worth to the participants in the scheme. New trees were planted, walls were built, flowers were sown and street furniture was put in place. The GAA grounds were maintained, as were the grounds of the Church of Ireland. The old graveyard at Donacomper was restored to a level that afforded dignity to those who lie there. It meant much more. A sense of community and a sense of pride of place was created in Celbridge by the scheme. In January this year, the PD-Fianna Fáil axe fell. The local Progressive Democrats Senator, Kate Walsh, never lifted a finger or opened her mouth in support of the scheme. When I challenged her publicly on the matter she sent me a solicitor's letter. As a result, 13 people are back on the dole without hope. The weeds are again in evidence. The flowers are neglected. All the good work has been set to naught. There is now nothing to be proud of, there is just shame.</P>
      <P>I want to address a few remarks directly to the Fianna Fáil and Progressive Democrats backbenchers. We saw them vote in the Dáil repeatedly over the last two years to cut 15,000 community employment scheme places. We saw them vote for the Estimates on Wednesday, 19 November, for the last round of cuts in community employment schemes. This will mean 5,000 less places than in January 2003 &ndash; no doubt, no mirrors, no magic. We witnessed their crocodile tears and well publicised tantrums against the decision they made on 19 November when their parliamentary party met on 25 November, less than a week after they voted for the cuts. Their crass, brass-necked hypocrisy, bare-faced lies and treatment of the public as fools&mdash;</P>

      <P>The cutting back of community employment schemes throughout Ireland is a calculated attack on the living standards and needs of urban and rural communities. Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats have effectively dismantled much of the vital work carried out throughout the country under these schemes. A deal between the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment and the Department of Finance &ndash; two Departments driven by right-wing ideology and as close to Thatcherism as possible &ndash; has seen the budget for community employment schemes slashed and many local initiatives go to the wall.</P>
      <P>I salute my colleague, Deputy Quinn, and the Labour Party Ministers of 1985 for what they did in regard to the Royal Canal, which runs through Deputy Sexton's constituency. Westmeath and Wexford county councils adopted the social employment scheme model. They released a skilled carpenter. When many fools were talking about blocking in the canal and putting a road through it, they encouraged the Royal Canal amenity groups, voluntary groups and those involved in inland waterways to re-open this vital infrastructural and tourist facility. Westmeath County Council participated by providing a carpenter, young apprentices and community employment type people. They set about manufacturing lock gates for the Royal Canal to ensure it would become navigable right through to the Shannon, provided for by national development plan funding. However, I doubt if sufficient money is provided.</P>
      <P>This is just one project in the recreational and tourism area which will bring people to an area which depends for the most part on agri-tourism and agriculture. It will embrace and widen recreational projects in the area, beginning in Dublin and travelling through Kildare, Meath, Westmeath and down to Longford and the Shannon. This is the type of scheme the Government is cutting.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let us get down to brass tacks in regard to another scheme in Mullingar. MSCO was founded in 1995 to provide facilities for nine clubs and organisations. As a result of the cutbacks it was amalgamated with eight clubs which meant it was catering for 17 organisations. Some 20 people were employed, including a supervisor and assistant supervisor. These people had to travel a 60 mile round trip. The news is now coming through that the numbers employed will be slashed from 20 to 13. As the assistant supervisor will no longer be needed, the scheme will become inoperable. <Col N="93" />The Government parties cannot say they do not know what is happening. They know well what is happening. The Progressive Democrats dread the community employment schemes. I am surprised at the Fianna Fáil backbenchers. I salute Deputy O'Connor for coming here but where are the missing 39 Deputies?</P>
    <P>The savage cuts have had a devastating impact on communities throughout the country, particularly on the community and voluntary sector. Under the cuts, many vital areas such as adult education classes, youth and employment services, day centres and health services for the elderly must be either jettisoned or reduced as local communities suffer from the Government's lousy economics. The changes introduced by the Tánaiste on behalf of the Government have already begun to reduce the numbers of participants in the schemes, with the consequent knock-on effect on the provision of essential services.</P>
    <P>Confidence among communities has been undermined as the progress that was being made to regenerate certain areas and give people access to vital services has come to a sudden halt. Years of valuable work throughout the country will be lost if the Government imposes further CE cuts. Community employment schemes are central to the confidence and morale of many people in urban and rural communities. Are the windows blackened in State cars travelling throughout the country so that Ministers do not know what is happening? One should look at villages throughout the country, the Tidy Towns awards and the marks villages have obtained. The Government does not support the council workers by providing sufficient money. As Deputy Howlin said, councils must set up jobs initiatives to try to clean up graveyards as people searched for the graves of their ancestors. The jobs initiative schemes were put in place because the CE schemes did not cover this type of work. This has now been discontinued. If the Government is in office for much longer it will wipe out rural Ireland.</P>
    <P>This type of ideologically-driven penny-pinching is foolhardy economics. It undermines the ethos of the schemes and people's confidence. People give up when their morale hits the floor. Participants who have carried out extremely important and valuable work in their communities must now go on the live register. Is anyone able to count? I recently heard Deputy Ring ask if anyone in the Department of Social and Family Affairs is able to count because they made such a cock-up regarding the pre-1983 estimate. They have now made another cock-up because they could not count how many children would qualify for child benefit and a Supplementary Estimate had to be introduced. Can anyone anywhere count?</P>
    <P>There are no savings involved for the Exchequer. The proposal is just ideologically driven. When schemes are reduced and amalgamated the people who suffer are the disadvantaged. These people are being asked to foot the bill for the economic problems that have been <Col N="94" />created by Government mismanagement and incompetence. When given a choice, it is always the same as the poor have to carry the cudgel but the financiers and the well-heeled stallion owners never have to carry any trouble while the Government perpetuates its right-wing views across the country.</P>

      <P>My colleague, Deputy Howlin, made the point well when he said this was more than an active labour market programme. That is the point the Ministers in the Government appear to have missed. This is much more than a labour market programme, it is about human lives. The wrecking of the community employment schemes will cause a huge level of disturbance and loss within our communities and for the most vulnerable in society. My colleagues have rightly said this is driven by ideology and that it is about an ideology that ignores the human element of what is being decided. It is no accident that the lone ranger, Deputy O'Connor, has left the House. There is not a single Fianna Fáil backbencher in the Chamber. That is an indication of how ashamed they are of what is being done in Government and the fact that Ministers appear to have lost touch with reality. They are so arrogant and divorced from reality that they have not been able to take on board what the backbenchers have said. Obviously the backbenchers will not have the guts to come in and stand up for what they have said either. Unfortunately the most disadvantaged communities have to suffer because of the breakdown in communications in Government, the alienation of Ministers from what is going on in communities around them and the effects of the cuts.</P>
      <P>Recently the Minister of State at the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy O'Dea, the Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children, Deputy Tim O'Malley, and I attended a meeting in Limerick at which we met the PAUL Partnership in Limerick city. Also present were representatives from four communities which, unfortunately, Members have heard of even if they have never stepped into them &ndash; Moyross, Southill, St. Mary's and St. Munchin's, who argued vehemently against the cutting of the schemes. They referred to the loss of care workers in the home, the loss of crèche workers, the loss of those who man security cameras in Moyross where I would have thought the Government would have wanted to encourage community effort in the prevention of crime, and the loss of a wide variety of other workers doing essential work in their communities. The Minister of State, Deputy O'Dea, told the meeting that the Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Fahey, had a proposal that would solve the problem and not to worry. The Minister of State, Deputy Tim O'Malley, agreed.</P>

      <P>Everybody went away thinking this was grand, that the Government knew what was going on and would do something about it. Unfortunately what we find today is that nothing is being done and no money has been found. It is worthy of note that when the Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Noel Dempsey, was in trouble in regard to funding for third level institutions, the Tánaiste, Deputy Harney, was able to find money in her Department, yet she cannot find the paltry sum required to maintain these vital services in communities throughout the country. This is not just in urban communities. I speak vehemently on behalf of those deprived urban communities which I represent where there are huge problems and where these schemes have made a difference.</P>
      <P>I have received letters also from rural communities. The following small areas in County Limerick have completely lost their community employment schemes: Caherconlish, Lough Gur, Kilteely, Herbertstown, Old Pallas, Templebraden, Cloverfield and Nicker &ndash; the heart of Minister of State, Deputy O'Dea's territory. As Deputy Howlin said this is for the miserly sum of &euro;24 per person per week. I have been given information by the South Hill community services community employment scheme which states that eight home care visitors earned &euro;149.20 per week per person. On the dole they will receive &euro;124.80 per week per person. Some 60 people will lose home carers for that paltry sum in one of the most deprived communities.</P>

      <P>One of the groups which has been devastated by the cuts in community employment schemes is lone parents. Since the inclusion of single parents in community employment schemes they have been enabled to avail of education, training and updating their skills, while at the same time accessing affordable child care. Another aspect of the benefits of bringing the marginalised &ndash; single parents &ndash; into our communities is that many became active members. Already we have witnessed the effects of the constant cutbacks in community employment schemes on the marginalised. It is important to stress it is the marginalised who are affected. Community programmes have been lost <Col N="96" />and essential services decimated. We may be repeating ourselves but the more times we say this the better the chance the Government might eventually realise the seriousness of the position.</P>
      <P>Community employment schemes have provided a main focus for community initiatives such as care of the elderly and the provision of child care, initiatives which ordinarily would have been ignored. This flies in the face of common sense and is directly contrary to the Government's so-called commitment to social inclusion. There is no social inclusion when the cutbacks affect the most marginalised and the consequences can be felt all over the country.</P>
      <P>Community employment schemes have made a positive impact on society and have provided opportunities for those who would otherwise have found it difficult to get into the workplace. If the Government is serious about tackling social disadvantage and the needs of the marginalised, it needs to reinstate the community employment schemes immediately. However, in recent years it has chipped at this programme and the numbers have dropped by 10,000. The length of time a person could spend on the scheme has been reduced. In addition, lone parents were dealt more devastating blows by the Government when the savage 16 cutbacks were announced recently. Not only has the Government reduced lone parents' social welfare entitlements but it has closed off one of their best entry routes back into education and the workplace.</P>
      <P>Community employment has also become an effective and successful training mechanism for those with disabilities. Time does not permit me to deal with the issues concerning those with disabilities. They are marginalised. The various groups dealing with disabilities have a difficulty because the criteria have been changed. Many organisations have found that without adequate trained staff, they can no longer provide essential services for those with disabilities. Is this social inclusion? It is for Fianna Fáil.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What fascinates me is that the Taoiseach does not understand what is happening. Today in the House he claimed there were no cutbacks because there were 25,000 people on the scheme. The Taoiseach is an accountant and there is nothing as good as creative accounting. One thing I want to do is to advise the Taoiseach that a community employment scheme is not the same as a jobs initiative or a social economy programme. Let us be clear &ndash; and I hope the Taoiseach is listening &ndash; that these are three separate and distinct schemes, each of which has its own objectives. This is a three-card trick by the Taoiseach who has shuffled schemes and tried to create the impression that there have been no cutbacks when clearly there have been cutbacks. Fianna Fáil fooled the people in the last election but it will not fool them again. I hope that when the Taoiseach speaks about CE schemes in future he speaks about CE schemes and not any other schemes. I urge all Members to support the marginalised in our society and to support this <Col N="97" />motion. Can we send a message out of this House this evening that we will not stand by while they are victimised by the Government's mismanagement of its own resources?</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>To delete all words after &ldquo;Dáil Éireann&rdquo; and substitute the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;&ndash;&nbsp;reaffirms that the primary role of community employment is that of an active labour market programme which through the provision of work experience and training opportunities can progress disadvantaged persons from a position of long-term unemployment into work in the open economy;</P>
      <P>&ndash;&nbsp;acknowledges the positive impact community employment schemes have had in disadvantaged communities and recognises that the work and commitment of participants in the scheme has played a significant role in community activity and has been essential to the viability and provision of many voluntary, youth, sporting, disability and many other important services in the community;</P>
      <P>&ndash;&nbsp;welcomes the decision of the Government in a more uncertain economic climate to maintain combined participation levels on community employment, jobs initiative and social economy programmes at 2003 levels with no further reductions in numbers envisaged in 2004 as a recognition of the invaluable contribution these programmes make to local communities all around the country and that the substantial level of funding provided for next year reflects this;</P>
      <P>&ndash;&nbsp; commends the policies of the Government that have resulted in a very low level of unemployment and have, in particular, brought about a substantial reduction in long-term unemployment in recent years;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ndash;&nbsp;notes that the review of the CE programme takes place not only in the context of a dynamic labour market, with jobs growth and historically low levels of unemployment being maintained, but at a time when Government has given huge priority to implementing a twin-track strategy of trying to prevent market, with jobs growth and historically low levels of unemployment being maintained, but at a time when Government has given huge priority to implementing a twin-track strategy of trying to prevent long-term unemployment while proac<Col N="98" />tively assisting persons who are long-term unemployed to get jobs;</P>
    <P>&ndash;&nbsp;recognises the substantial allocation of resources the Government is making available in the Estimates for 2004 for the provision of employment programmes, and notes that this will permit a very high level of activity in 2004 in support of local services and local communities;</P>
    <P>&ndash;&nbsp;notes with satisfaction that the total allocation for employment programmes has been fixed at &euro;351 million which will support up to 25,000 places across three employment schemes, that is, community employment, jobs initiative and social economy and will ensure that there will be no reduction in overall participation levels in 2004;</P>
    <P>&ndash;&nbsp;notes that the Government is providing, in addition, some &euro;308 million for training and integration supports, within FÁS, in 2004;</P>
    <P>&ndash;&nbsp;notes that the overall FÁS budget has increased from &euro;605 million in 1997 to &euro;837 million in 2004; and</P>
    <P>&ndash;&nbsp;welcomes the continuing review of the operation of these schemes to maximise the benefit to participants and to the organisations and committees with which they work.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Listening to the Labour Party Deputies it strikes me that their argument is based on a false premise. In this year's Estimate &euro;351 million was provided for community employment schemes, that is for the retention of 20,000 places in addition to 5,000 places for the jobs initiative and social economy programmes.</P>

      <P>Following a review of community employment schemes &ndash; the then figure was the maximum CE figure of 37,500 &ndash; it was decided because of the changing unemployment pattern to review and reduce that. This was done in consultation with the social partners at a time when unemployment was coming down from a high of 17% to 4%, or 4.4% as it is now. My Department gave out 6,000 work permits in 1999. As of the end of this year, it will have given out 47,000 work permits. The labour market has changed drastically from the time when we had long-term and high levels of unemployment. When CE was introduced it was an active labour market programme to provide an opportunity for people to get work experience and training.</P>

Those people are over 55 years of age and are either in receipt of disability benefit or have other special needs. The new CE programme is much improved on that which existed to date. The cost of expanding that programme is low because it will be funded out of the savings of people who would otherwise be on social welfare, plus the top-up&mdash;</P>

      <P>I support the Labour Party motion on community employment schemes. The Minister of State, Deputy Fahey, provoked this motion by stating last Wednesday that 5,000 more places were required for community employment schemes in fulfilment of the will of the Fianna Fáil parliamentary party.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankFahey" hpid="Mr. Fahey Mr. Fahey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fahey</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not. That is incorrect. I never mentioned anything about that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PhilipHogan" hpid="Mr. Hogan Mr. Hogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister of State wants to restore the number of places. He stated that he needed to restore to 25,000 places the number of people on CE schemes. The Taoiseach attempted to manipulate the figures today by amalgamating <Col N="110" />the places in the jobs initiative scheme, the social economy scheme and the community employment scheme to cloak the difficulties that have emerged in his parliamentary party last week.</P>
      <P>No amount of disguising the fact can make us doubt that the Fianna Fáil Members, including the Minister, have failed to convince the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Harney, and the Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, to increase the necessary number of places on community employment schemes. If there was no problem with this scheme, what was the difficulty last week when 40 members of the Fianna Fáil parliamentary party felt that they had to put down a motion to deal with this matter, and the Minister of State, Deputy Fahey, felt that he must publicly state that he disagreed with the Government policy and the Estimates which he helped vote through the previous week?</P>
      <P>The community employment schemes have carried out a very important function for many communities regarding sports fields, community halls, resource centres and help for the disabled. Even the commitments on ring-fencing the funding for RAPID throughout urban areas have not been kept. People and communities feel let down by the cuts in 2003 which will continue as a result of the publication of the 2004 Estimates.</P>
      <P>I know it is difficult for Fianna Fáil and Progressive Democrats Deputies because they are getting it in the neck in their constituencies on these issues. They are caught out by their own parliamentary party motion, while the Labour Party has wisely introduced this motion this evening to show the legitimate aspirations of people in their communities, but also to reveal the hypocrisy of Fianna Fáil and Progressive Democrats Deputies who have been trying to cloak their difficulties with this issue by promoting a new scheme. Deputy Sexton did not feel it appropriate to tell us tonight exactly what she had in mind, and I look forward to her contribution whenever that comes. She can explain to us the changes she regards as important in the present scheme to fulfil the commitments to communities and various organisations around the country.</P>
      <P>This motion is important and timely. We must free the Fianna Fáil 40 from their consciences. They have gone to their constituencies and said they would do the business for communities where schemes have been drastically cut back. We will have the opportunity on Private Members' Business tomorrow, and again during the budget debate, to see who is running this country and if the Fianna Fáil parliamentary party has any clout with its Ministers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardMurphy" hpid="Mr. Murphy Mr. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>The issue of community employment schemes has been running since the formation of the Government. It has been the subject of Dáil debates, Adjournment debates and every Question Time for the Ministers involved. Looking at all the answers from both the Tánaiste, Deputy Harney, and the Minister of State, Deputy Fahey, there is one thing that is consist<Col N="111" />ent &ndash; no matter what questions they were asked, they were awaiting the review of the FÁS schemes, which was always due shortly but has not yet been published.</P>
      <P>The history is simple. The Tánaiste and the Minister for Finance came to the conclusion that unemployment figures were down, and as figures and statistics are far more important to these Ministers than people or communities, these cuts were implemented. This was despite the fact that it was regularly pointed out to the Government that the difference between paying community employment scheme worker rates and unemployment benefit would have little or no effect on overall Government finances. As Deputy Howlin pointed out, the difference is only &euro;24 per person per week.</P>
      <P>No consideration was given to the disabled who participated in the schemes, to single parents or to the over-50s. The Minister continued to argue that participants must progress to the labour market, though every statistic indicated that most people in these categories would progress only to the live unemployment register.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardMurphy" hpid="Mr. Murphy Mr. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>Cuts were implemented without taking into account the varying job opportunities available in different parts of the country. No consideration was given to the fact that there were no suitable jobs available in small towns, villages or rural areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Precisely.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardMurphy" hpid="Mr. Murphy Mr. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>Another famous piece of jargon used to confuse the issue was the mainstreaming into health and education. The facts are simple. CE schemes were far more efficient and community-friendly than mainstreaming the small budget transfers into health or education. The success of that programme was jeopardised. The Minister then said that the environmental CE jobs would also be mainstreamed, presumably into local authorities. Thankfully, this never happened. Local authorities are now underfunded to the extent that they too are no longer any help to the communities they seek to serve.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Tánaiste then came up with the idea of having discussions with the Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht affairs, Deputy Ó Cuív, to devise a scheme to support community projects. In a Dáil reply the Tánaiste told me she had entered these discussions in November 2002, but they must be continuing 12 months later as no scheme has emerged to help local voluntary groups. Shortly afterwards, the Minister of State, Deputy Fahey, in a reply to a request to set up a social employment scheme to facilitate in particular the over-50s, lone parents and the disabled, told the House that he had recently entered into discussions with the Minister for Social and Family Affairs on further options for this category of <Col N="112" />workers. A year later, we must presume that the Tánaiste's discussions with the Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs and these discussions with the Minister for Social and Family Affairs are still ongoing.</P>
    <P>Despite these studies and discussions, cuts were implemented in the Estimates. On numerous occasions in the Dáil, Fianna Fáil backbenchers voted for cutbacks in community employment schemes and will do so again tomorrow. This seems to be some sort of joke for Fianna Fáil. Its members seem to think they can fool the electorate into believing they are against the cuts while at the same time voting repeatedly to support the Tánaiste and the Minister for Finance, thus enabling them to implement these cuts. It might be a joke and a stunt for Fianna Fáil but it is a serious issue for voluntary community groups trying to help the disabled, the elderly and the young. It is no joke for participants being dumped back on the dole queue or community environmental groups trying to improve their towns and villages. It is a sorry mess and a disservice to politics.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PadraicMcCormack" hpid="Mr. McCormack Mr. McCormack">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCormack</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sorry my constituency colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Fahey, had to leave before the debate was concluded. He must be under pressure. He gave a rambling speech which was a diversion from the problem he faces. He even went so far as to attack the Government record of our constituency colleague, Deputy Michael D. Higgins. The Minister of State and Deputy Higgins were in Government together for a while so I do not understand what the Minister of State could have been talking about. He did a disservice to the debate by giving such a peremptory speech and then leaving the Chamber. However, we must get on with the debate.</P>
      <P>During Leaders' Questions I heard the Taoiseach say that community employment schemes were working well. If that is the case, why is it necessary to cut 5,000 places from such schemes? Do the Taoiseach and the Tánaiste not realise the valuable work carried out by community employment schemes? How can the Government cut back the schemes when their good work can be seen in every town, village and parish? Community employment schemes do much necessary work, both visible and invisible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Participants in community employment schemes work with disadvantaged people. In the Galway area alone 15 such people are employed in CE schemes working with people with physical disabilities. At the end of this year seven of these will have served three years and, according to the new regulations introduced by the Government, will not be eligible to continue on the schemes. The assistance participants give to people with disabilities, for example, in the 19.5 hours per week which they worked, enables these people to lead independent lives in their own homes. That will be impossible if they lose the personal assistants they have had for the past three years. That <Col N="113" />is what will happen, whether Deputy Fahey likes it or not.</P>
    <P>In my constituency some people with physical disabilities are employed on community employment schemes. Any of these people who are under 35 years and have completed one year on a scheme will no longer be eligible for a scheme at the end of this year. Such people will no longer be able to live an independent life or have the means to employ a personal assistant for themselves. This is the reality of cutbacks in CE schemes.</P>
    <P>All this is being done for almost no advantage. A single person on a CE scheme earns &euro;149 per week. If such a person loses a place on a scheme, he or she will receive &euro;124 per week unemployment assistance. A person who has pride in his work and is doing useful work in his community is condemned to go back on unemployment assistance for the sake of &euro;25. Can no one at ministerial level see that this is the reality of cutbacks in social employment and community employment schemes?</P>
    <P>The cutbacks also rob participants of the pride they had in working for their communities instead of receiving unemployment assistance. In many schemes in villages, towns and rural areas skills such as traditional stone building have been acquired, with professional advice, by people on community employment schemes. Monuments to such schemes will be seen for many years and the people who took part in them will take pride in what they built. Participants in community employment schemes are being robbed of this pride in their communities, work and spirit and of their ability to work instead of drawing unemployment assistance, all for the sake of &euro;25 per week. I do not understand it.</P>
    <P>It is all very well for the Minister of State, Deputy Fahey, to shed crocodile tears, as he did last week, about cutbacks in CE schemes and leading the Fianna Fáil backbenchers in revolt against them. The real test of whether the Minister of State believes what he said last week or what he was told to say tonight will be when he is asked to vote at 1.30 p.m. tomorrow. Our constituents are not fools. They see what is happening, as does Deputy Fiona O'Malley. In a courageous speech she pointed out the hypocrisy of the Minister of State. He will be tested tomorrow at 1.30 p.m.</P>
    <P>I cannot overemphasise the value of working rather than drawing unemployment assistance or the value to communities of seeing people who were on long-term unemployment assistance working and adding to the structure and value of the community in which they live. A person could have no better or prouder task than to add to the value of work in his or her community. I support the Minister of State, Deputy Fahey, in his call to the Minister for Finance to see common sense and restore the opportunity to the 5,000 people who will be deprived of the opportunity to work in their communities in the next two or three years.</P>

      <P>I compliment the Labour Party on proposing this motion. Like Deputy McCormack and previous speakers, I hope RTE, the <i>Irish Independent</i> and all those who interviewed Fianna Fáil backbenchers last week will be present in the Chamber tomorrow to show on television how these people vote. The Labour Party motion is identical to that proposed at the Fianna Fáil parliamentary party meeting last week. I call on Fianna Fáil backbenchers to vote with us tomorrow and show the Minister for Finance, Tánaiste and Taoiseach that they are serious in their support for CE schemes. If they do so, by tomorrow afternoon we will have all the places on CE schemes replaced. Fianna Fáil backbenchers should put up or shut up and vote with us tomorrow. The media were taken in last week by their claims that they would change this Government measure.</P>
      <P>For the first time ever I have been invited to a funeral in my constituency next weekend. The Linenhall arts centre in Castlebar has a number of people working on a FÁS scheme, which will finish on Friday next. There will be a wake and a funeral and they will be buried. That is what the Government wants to do with the living. In Belmullet, the Irish Wheelchair Association had trained people to work with the wheelchair-bound. The elderly people became very fond of them. I ask why these people cannot be retained on FÁS schemes until the Department of Health and Children appoints them on a full-time basis. As Deputy McCormack stated, it is saving the State a fortune. The health board should be providing care assistants but instead the FÁS schemes are being taken away and uncertainty is being created. That is wrong.</P>
      <P>There are other communities waiting for FÁS schemes to re-train people and keep them working. These schemes have been a great success, yet the Government has imposed cutbacks of &euro;58 million on the poor. The Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, will not have the courage tomorrow to tax the millionaires.</P>
      <P>I am open to correction but I believe that in 1999 there were approximately 200 who earned more than £200,000 per year. There are now over 200,000 people earning that amount. That is a sign of what is happening. The rich have become richer, the middle class are being squeezed and the poor are being taken out by this Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am sick and tired of the hypocrisy of the Progressive Democrats, but they are consistent. They have no understanding of rural communities and of poor people. They were elected to this House by the middle class and the rich to protect those interests. It is the duty of the Opposition to protect the poor, the weak and the sick. Fianna Fáil used to pretend it was the party that looked after the sick, the weak and the poor. I will continue to declare in this House that Fianna Fáil now looks after the Alex Fergusons of this world and Rock of Gibraltar. The animals are better off in this country than the people. It is a disgrace that the Minister allows that to happen and allows the <Col N="115" />poor, the sick and the weak to be treated in such a fashion. The dietary allowance and the supplementary rent allowance have been taken away. The Government Members then tell the media from the plinth that they will vote against the measures. Fianna Fáil has its opportunity tomorrow to vote with us and protect the FÁS schemes. I am tired of the hypocrisy of this Government and I am sick and tired of how it treats the poor.</P>

I cannot understand how the Minister of State, as a rural Deputy, is allowing this to happen.</P>
      <P>I see what is happening to the poor and the underprivileged and they are the ones who should be protected. Agencies such as CORI, the Society of St. Vincent de Paul and Barnardos deal with children and with the disadvantaged. The Government wants to see them live in ghettos again.

      <P>I wish to share my time with Deputy Cowley tonight and with another speaker tomorrow. I had the misfortune to become economically active in the 1980s when many of my friends and compatriots chose to emigrate. I chose to stay and my options were various employment schemes such as the national manpower scheme which paid £30 a week. I had no incentive to come off unemployment assistance which at the time was £32 a week. Other schemes at the time were the Youth Employment Agency and the AnCO teamwork scheme which was the precursor of social employment. I was given the opportunity of being active in the economy, gaining work experience and eventually finding full-time employment within my chosen field of community and youth work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Later in my employment career, I was a community employment scheme supervisor. I have experience from both sides of how participants and organisers of schemes have benefited from the operation of this policy by successive Governments. As a result of my activity in voluntary organisations I have been involved in the supervision of such schemes. I have had a threefold benefit from employment schemes, as a participant, as a supervisor and as someone involved in voluntary organisations. I have seen the benefits in communities and to individuals. I am becoming more angry as I see this Government progressively run down what has stopped being an <Col N="116" />employment promotion programme and has become a community service programme.</P>
    <P>The Green Party argues that the time has come to consider taking the administration of the community employment schemes away from the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment because its agenda does not meet the needs of what the scheme is currently used for and its potential&mdash;</P>

      <P>This is a Department that for two consecutive years has handed money back to the Exchequer. It has handed back &euro;37 million every year while at the same time cutting down community employment schemes. It has not only cut down the numbers, it has emasculated the criteria by which people qualify for these schemes, making it all but impossible for people who are available but are suddenly deemed not qualifiable in terms of the schemes.</P>
      <P>This Government has gone beyond caring about the idea of society. Fianna Fáil was born out of the image of the cumann membership, the party of the small farmers and workers as it claimed at one stage. It is now a party that is not even the mirror image of the Progressive Democrats because they have blended into one party. They sing from the same hymn sheet and they have but the one ethos.</P>

      <P>We have developed a system, even if accidentally, that has filled the void created by the individualism which is sponsored by this Government. At one stage when this country was economically poor, we at least had a system of community support, of a healthy volunteerism which has all but disappeared due to the rampant individualism being practised by this Government. If our social services are to survive and provide the services which the Government is unwilling or unable to provide, then it must continue <Col N="117" />to support community employment schemes and must do so in a manner that takes the responsibility away from a Department that cares neither for the scheme nor the participants.</P>
      <P>On these grounds alone, I argue that the time has come for another Government Department. I would suggest a Department of Community, if it did not have a Minister so obsessed with himself, which would be more focused and with a belief in the idea of community. There must be a change in Government focus. This is a system in which the people of the country believe. They want greater participation in it and they want it to have more resources. If such support is given, there will be not just social benefits but long-term economic benefits also. If those lessons are not learnt by the Government, whatever hope I ever had for it will disappear. I cede to Deputy Cowley.</P>

I have lived in rural Ireland for many years and I am a sponsor of a community employment scheme. I can testify to the good work done by CE schemes all over Ireland. The effects of CE schemes are to be seen in every town and village. It has been beneficial to so many people right across Ireland. It has achieved magnificent work in upskilling people and allowing them to take a new pride in their work. For &euro;20 to &euro;30 more, people can be gainfully employed on a community employment scheme.</P>

    <Title>Aer Lingus Bill 2003: Second Stage (Resumed).</Title>
    <P>Question again proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="DamienEnglishFG" hpid="Mr. English Mr. English">
      <NameTxt>Mr. English</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister was quick to praise the role of workers in the financial turnaround of the company, and rightly so because without them it could not have been done. There is no such thing as bad workers, only bad management. In politics, when a boss or friends are praising or clapping one on the back, more often than not they are actually measuring one up for the knife.</P>
      <P>It is peculiar that the harder Aer Lingus staff work and the more productivity they achieve, the closer they are to being sold off. The company is becoming more of a cherry to pick from the financial tree but that is very wrong. Hard work should result in rewards, not some shoddy deal done behind closed doors, and behind the backs of the staff, to sell it off for the sake of doing so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Before the script writers of all political parties write me off as some sort of trendy socialist, let me put the record straight. I do not believe State money should be used for, or be involved in, <Col N="118" />something the private sector can and probably would do better.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TommyBroughan" hpid="Mr. Broughan Mr. Broughan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Broughan</NameTxt>
      <P>Why not be a trendy socialist?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DamienEnglishFG" hpid="Mr. English Mr. English">
      <NameTxt>Mr. English</NameTxt>
      <P>I have to grow into that role. That does mean, however, that I believe in privatisation as an overall policy. Privatisation for the sake of it is a sure way of robbing the State of its jewels &ndash; priceless assets that took years of hard work by taxpayers to build up. When a State company is in profit, competing on a level playing field with the private sector, why should it be sold off? This is especially the case if, as my colleague Deputy Naughten explained, the company is in control of valuable landing rights in major airports that are of vital interest to the country. How could they be valued and why would they be sold, unless to fulfil some mad privatisation policy? I hope common sense will prevail on this issue but I fear that this PD-led Government could bring us anywhere.</P>
      <P>If Aer Lingus is to be sold off, how can it be valued? It currently pays approximately &euro;80 million to the national Exchequer, but if that figure was multiplied by ten or 20 would it represent the company's true value? Landing fees would add yet more to that total. Let us examine whether there is another way to approach the matter. Could it be that if the company was run properly and if the culture of jobs for the boys was done away with, it would make &euro;100 million to &euro;220 million next year, perhaps increasing its profits every year over the next ten years or longer? If so, would the company not be worth more in real cash terms in ten years' time, in addition to the fact that every year it will pay its profits to the national Exchequer?</P>
      <P>Selling Aer Lingus may be like selling the goose that laid the golden eggs. If any Minister is in charge of selling such a goose, I would like to see a written undertaking that when he leaves office he will not be allowed to join the new private company in any capacity, in order to reap the rewards robbed from taxpayers. I am not referring to the Minister, Deputy Brennan, personally, but to a general policy. In other countries people have gained lucrative directorships after leaving politics and I would like to see it in writing that it will not happen here.</P>
      <P>Profitable State companies are valuable as we need money to pay for health plans, rather than swelling shareholders' coffers. Even if Aer Lingus is sold for a reasonable price, the way this Government wastes taxpayers' money, it would probably only help to shore up two or three seats the Government may consider to be in danger at the next general election. That seems to be the way money gets spent around here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The simple story of privatisation is that if something needs State money to sustain it, it should be put out of its misery by cutting the State's losses. If, however, it provides a service or guards a national interest, we should retain State control of it. Privatisation does not always work, <Col N="119" />however. As was stated recently on the &ldquo;Dunphy Show&rdquo;, if one takes a train in England and then travels in one in France, and examines the respective safety records, this should explain the situation to the Minister. I would be surprised if it did not. We have already created multi-millionaire tax exiles by selling off other State assets. We should consider the Aer Lingus issue in depth before leaping to the privatisation conclusion again. The hidden agenda behind this Bill is privatisation and I hope everybody will realise what they are voting for when they vote on the legislation.</P>
    <P>Earlier, Deputy O'Sullivan mentioned the spatial strategy and other reviews of the transport system. These are important matters that have not been debated in the House. The spatial strategy was launched over a year ago, am I right?</P>
    <Speaker pid="TommyBroughan" hpid="Mr. Broughan Mr. Broughan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Broughan</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DamienEnglishFG" hpid="Mr. English Mr. English">
      <NameTxt>Mr. English</NameTxt>
      <P>The spatial strategy was heralded as the future policy determining all investment in infrastructure, industry, health and transport. The Taoiseach did not launch the strategy in this House, however, which shows how important the Government considers it to be. The Government cites the strategy whenever it suits them, yet we cannot debate it in the House. The spatial strategy is a reasonable document and could lead to positive change but it has been produced seven or eight years too late. A spatial plan was drawn up in the 1996-97 period which could have been followed, but that was put to one side and another plan was produced instead. One year later the plan has still not been debated in the House and very few decisions have been made as a result of it.</P>
      <P>The strategic rail review is a very important document on the future of transport but it has not been discussed in this House. I have heard the Minister citing the review on a few occasions, yet his colleagues on the transport committee claim he is disregarding the document and will not use it. I am concerned about it because basically it has ruled out the construction of a rail link to Navan. The Navan rail link was included as one of the last items to be done in approximately 18 years' time, during the last few years of the current State investment plan. According to my calculations, if we have to wait for &euro;8.5 billion at a maximum of &euro;500 million per year we are talking about 18 or 19 years before the Navan rail link can be completed. The spatial strategy states that the economic viability of the greater Dublin region is based on rail, yet Navan is in the greater Dublin region.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One Government document states that rail is of economic importance and should be developed, while another advises us to wait for 20 years. The Minister should read these documents and rethink his policy on the strategic rail review. When I asked the Minister to investigate the Navan rail link in the context of a private-<Col N="120" />public partnership deal, he wrote to me saying that it had not been earmarked as an important item in the strategic rail review and, therefore, there was no point in proceeding with it. I am not quoting the Minister's letter exactly but he basically ruled out the idea of even appointing one member of his staff to investigate the project. Our local authority and the chamber of commerce are now faced with the task of convincing the Minister that it is worth creating the Navan rail link. To this end, we will have to undertake a feasibility study.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DamienEnglishFG" hpid="Mr. English Mr. English">
      <NameTxt>Mr. English</NameTxt>
      <P>I am referring to comments made earlier in the debate concerning rail transport, which were allowed by the Chair. It is very important and I have nearly finished my contribution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPerry" hpid="Mr. Perry Mr. Perry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Perry</NameTxt>
      <P>It concerns a rail line to the airport.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DamienEnglishFG" hpid="Mr. English Mr. English">
      <NameTxt>Mr. English</NameTxt>
      <P>I am getting to the metro line also. The lack of a rail link to Dublin Airport is causing &euro;650 million in congestion costs around the capital. All these elements are interrelated.</P>
      <P>As regards the Navan rail link, we will have to undertake a feasibility study which will cost approximately &euro;1 million. That will not be paid for by the Government which feels it has no involvement in checking whether or not Navan needs such a rail link. The Minister, through the strategic rail review, said that Navan should not have a railway line, but no feasibility study was undertaken to determine the investment figures involved. This goes back to how such decisions are made. If no feasibility study is done, how can one rule out a project? That is not the way to do business. The Government should lead the way with proper facts and figures before making decisions. We have seen the same approach concerning the break up of Aer Rianta, but we have not seen the figures so as to be able to determine whether such a move is good or bad.</P>
      <P>As regards the metro line to the airport, Luas should have been built underground for this purpose. Luas was delayed for seven or eight years, although I do not blame the Minister for that. If he had been there five years ago we would probably be travelling in the Luas now instead of waiting for it to start, with the streets in a mess. The plan was ready to be implemented years ago but it was not done. We are now having the metro debate and all kinds of figures are being quoted. We are told it would be cheaper to go to Spain for the project and I believe it. I would welcome any cost reductions the Minister can come up with. I hope he will be able to cut the cost of the Navan rail line from &euro;408 million to my estimate of &euro;200 million.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Has the Minister considered running a monorail link from the airport? We have had no debate on this question. Last week, a crowd of geniuses <Col N="121" />put forward a plan for a Vegas City theme park in County Dublin. They were talking about building a 25-mile long monorail, which would be the longest in the world. That length of track would reach Navan and a spur track of a few extra miles would reach Dublin Airport. These gentlemen reckoned that the monorail could be constructed much more cheaply. I saw it operating in Sydney in Australia, and it seems to be cheaper there. It may not look perfect because it is up on stilts but if it gets the jobs done more cheaply and quickly we should examine that possibility.</P>
    <P>In discussing Aer Lingus, we should examine all the options in order to facilitate a debate in the House on a proper transport system for the country and not just have a love affair with motorways and other roads. I realise I have strayed off the issue slightly but I am sure there are many others who will take it up.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPerry" hpid="Mr. Perry Mr. Perry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Perry</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to speak on this Bill, which allows for the employees of Aer Lingus to have share ownership of Aer Lingus as agreed by the Government and the unions, but I am also mindful of the broader implications of the Bill.</P>
      <P>It is clear that the Bill before the House is intended to mark the first step in the privatisation of Aer Lingus and one can only assume that this is based on the poor financial state of the company in 2001. However, given the Government's current financial deficit perhaps it is trying to capitalise on the massive changes that have taken place. That would be regrettable in light of the fact that &euro;1 billion has been calculated to be the miscalculation on the pre-1953 pensions and &euro;1 billion has been identified as the possible cost of the redress scheme. In terms of Government expenditure, what might be assumed to be a good price could be spent easily on services that are not nearly as essential as the national airline. However, it must be acknowledged by everyone that this is no longer the situation in Aer Lingus and it is to the credit of all involved, including the staff and particularly the management of the company, that they have effected a complete turn-around in the financial circumstances of the company. That was some achievement in a very short period of time. Aer Lingus is now showing a profit and its costs have been reduced by up to 14%. I know from my own business experience of the difficulty of keeping costs down while running a company efficiently. Keeping operational costs down is an example of good management and the profitability of the company clearly indicates its viability.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It would be unfair not to give Aer Lingus a longer tenure of management. We have seen the introduction of competition in the market with Ryanair. Competition is good but it would be a real disincentive to the company, unless there is something we do not know about, if the Minister is considering the possibility of putting the company up for sale, which is clear from the Bill. The future of Aer Lingus looks bright and it continues <Col N="122" />to reduce costs. That has to be applauded. The company appears to be making every possible effort to pass on these cost cuts to fare paying customers, which is important.</P>
    <P>We now see an airline company that is competing with Ryanair. The feeder service with Aer Arann is working well. I am aware the Minister opened the new airport in Sligo and I give credit where it is due. The Minister's support for Sligo Airport has been extraordinary. We had difficulties getting a carrier organised but what the Minister has done in Sligo has been very effective. As regards Aer Arann, which I acknowledge is getting good State subvention, with the level of aviation as an island country and the feeder services from regional airports, it has been very successful.</P>
    <P>Aer Lingus is a very good brand. It is like Kerrygold. When I pass through an international airport and I see the Aer Lingus brand I am always proud. It is like a tourism brand and we should not lose that. We are an island nation. We depend on the image of Ireland abroad that we are a progressive country which can run private and State companies and that we have multi-choice in that regard. We all saw the debacle over Eircom, the major advertising, the millions spent on buying shares and the subsequent miscalculation. The Minister may not go down the share option route but in terms of attracting another international airline, the passion for the company on the part of the Aer Lingus employees and the management and the Minister's support is extraordinary. The Minister must be proud that after only two years the State no longer has to give subventions to the company. That is a healthy sign and it is clearly something the Minister will examine from a business perspective.</P>
    <P>It has been predicted that Aer Lingus will return a profit of up to &euro;80 million by the end of 2003. That is over &euro;1.5 million per week. That is a significant achievement, particularly when one considers the war in Iraq earlier this year and the outbreak of SARS, both of which did much to turn people away from air travel in 2003 and depress the aviation industry. When one considers that the American possibilities have been brought to a standstill, that is a very good return. Globally, every airline is losing money. In America and throughout Europe section 11 companies have sought support from Governments and the protection of financial losses where airlines were losing money.</P>
    <P>Aer Lingus has done well, however, and it appears confident that it can reduce costs even further, with the welcome knock-on effects that will have for customer confidence and satisfaction with the airline. That is important because Ryanair was the brand leader. It is all about brand, being competitive, value for money and encouraging people to spend money. A total of 14 million people go through Dublin Airport. There was a major debate here when the duty free facility was removed from the airport but the spend in the stores in Dublin Airport is extraordinary. It is a huge industry that benefits from partnerships <Col N="123" />with a competitive airline and people coming here from abroad.</P>
    <P>It is evident that section 5 is the critical element of the Bill because it allows for the privatisation of Aer Lingus and gives the Government the wherewithal to attempt to attract an outside private buyer for the national airline. The issue of the future control of Aer Lingus is one which cannot be rushed. It necessitates a definite plan and a need to pinpoint in advance any problems or difficulties, strategic or financial, which could arise further down the road as a result of sale of the State airline. I know the Labour Party will support this position.</P>
    <P>Business is about profitability. If we are talking about supporting semi-State bodies and we consider the costs associated with benchmarking in the public sector &ndash;&euro;1.3 billion next year &ndash; the Minister could get a bad price for the sale of the airline. It would be difficult to put a value on such a sale because he must have regard to future profits, possibilities and the potential future involvement of the Government. Future Ministers will be sitting where the Minister is now and it is important that they have that independence and a stake on the board of the company.</P>
    <P>In the not so recent past the rationale for the sale of Aer Lingus was clear. It was a loss maker and a burden on the public finances. The company was inefficient, it did not provide an efficient and effective service. However, as I have outlined, the tide has turned in favour of the company. The company is not only standing on its own feet but it is doing so extremely successfully. This situation leads me to question the rationale behind taking the decision to sell off this valuable asset. Why favour privatisation? We must consider whether that is the best option and the best value for money, particularly when one considers the importance of protecting our national interest in aviation terms.</P>
    <P>I have no doubt that because of the profitability and the potential of Aer Lingus, there will be people who will have an interest but it would be wrong to take the easy option, namely, to dispose of the asset, eliminate the risk and hand over control to somebody else. The public service has the capabilities and the competence to run a business and because the tide has turned and the balance sheet looks better it is felt this is the optimum time to sell, but that is not the case. It is crucial that the Minister makes a solid business case for the privatisation of Aer Lingus. We must have a clear, straightforward business plan to justify the company's sale. A business case in favour of sale, however, also makes a case for maintaining a company. There would be nothing wrong in retaining ownership as currently constituted.</P>
    <P>Given the recent controversy surrounding the break-up of Aer Rianta, it is hardly surprising that one would question the viability of selling Aer Lingus. A PricewaterhouseCoopers report questioned the viability of the break-up of Aer <Col N="124" />Rianta, particularly from the perspective of Shannon and Cork airports. It also warned that Aer Rianta's debt levels could rise to &euro;400 million by 2006, while Dublin Airport's profits could fall by 75% if it has to assume the burden of the debts of Cork and Shannon airports. The lesson from the report is that privatisation of Aer Lingus should not be rushed through, as has so often been the style of the Government.</P>
    <P>The importance of a logical and workable business plan to privatise Aer Lingus cannot be over-stressed and I call on the Minister to guarantee to the House that one will be produced. Once a decision has been taken on privatisation &ndash; the main section of the Bill is an agreement in principle &ndash; it is possible the matter will not be discussed again in Dáil Éireann.</P>
    <P>Having reduced staff by 2,500, Aer Lingus has an excellent, effective team. Access to the United Kingdom is vital. The security of aviation links between Ireland and Britain, long facilitated by Aer Lingus, must be protected at all costs because they bring immeasurable benefits to sectors such as industry, tourism, trade and financial services, which heavily depend on them.</P>
    <P>It has been stated that the most likely future purchaser of Aer Lingus would be British Airways, which, it has been argued, would seek to reallocate or sell for financial gain Aer Lingus's valuable landing slots at Heathrow Airport. These slots, paid for by the State &ndash; the taxpayer &ndash; in difficult times are a prime asset and their loss would be detrimental to our national, strategic interests. We cannot allow them to be easily whittled away.</P>
    <P>I reiterate the call made by my colleague, Deputy Naughten, that the Minister ensure that any decision on the sale of Aer Lingus be made by the House and not solely by the social partners. As an island on the periphery of Europe, we have a unique and heavy dependence on a good quality, reliable air service for access to the rest of the world. As there are no guarantees that new owners would have loyalty to this country and its citizens, it is vital to obtain such guarantees before a sale takes place.</P>
    <P>Aer Lingus's links and connectivity with other airlines are critical to the growth of Ireland as a tourism destination and the future viability of our airports. Aer Rianta and Aer Lingus have worked as a partnership. Competition among carriers is good and I welcome the entrance of Ryanair and other carriers to the market. Knock Airport, which has developed a charter business, is performing exceptionally well and has generated significant traffic by offering chartered flights to European holiday destinations and daily direct flights to Manchester and Birmingham. The airport is competitive in bringing people into Ireland.</P>
    <P>It is a pity Shannon Airport and other airports in the west are not used more for charter flights. We have heard about difficulties in increasing business in Cork and Shannon airports. There is major potential for Ryanair, which is seeking a <Col N="125" />second terminal in Dublin Airport, to make greater use of airports in the west. I ask the Minister to encourage the company to use Shannon or Knock airports, with their considerable facilities, to offer cheap flights to the western seaboard, as opposed to Dublin with its traffic chaos.</P>
    <P>It would make economic sense to offer incentives to Ryanair to use Shannon Airport as a major international hub. Tourists arriving at Shannon or Knock airports could tour the country from a western base. An increase in passenger numbers at Dublin Airport would cause major difficulties by increasing traffic congestion in the city, whereas bringing increased numbers of people to the western seaboard would deliver major economic benefits which would filter through to the regions. I am disappointed Ryanair refuses to consider this possibility, given the excellent landing facilities available at Knock and Shannon airports.</P>
    <P>The sale of Eircom highlights only too well the disastrous outcome which can occur when the sale of State assets is not well thought through by those in power. I am concerned about the temptation to make short-term gains through the sale of Aer Lingus. That must not be allowed to prevail. The unique and important service provided by Aer Lingus must be at the forefront of all considerations of whether to sell Aer Lingus. The Government must lay out the terms under which the company would be sold well in advance of any sale, spell out its objectives and provide guarantees. I would prefer if Aer Lingus were not sold. In the past two years, which were difficult times for the aviation industry, the company has turned losses into profits in excess of &euro;6 million per month. It would be a disaster to consider a sale in light of this fact.</P>
    <P>The Minister has not made public the proposals he received from the chief executive of Aer Lingus, nor has he revealed what proposals he intends to bring to Cabinet on any future sale of the company. Instead, he is asking the House to push through legislation which opens the door for privatisation. The Minister has proved effective and decisive since taking on a difficult portfolio and I wish him well with his plans to resolve difficulties he inherited in Dublin. Given his commitment, I have no doubt he will show care in studying the option of privatisation, the implications of which would be disastrous.</P>
    <P>To set the record straight, the Minister should issue a White Paper setting out all the issues related to the sale of Aer Lingus. This should go some way towards answering important outstanding questions such as the likely capital needs of Aer Lingus in the coming years, whether a strategic partner for the company is required, whether the State will retain a certain amount of shares and many others.</P>
    <P>Section 11 provides for the repayment by Aer Lingus Limited to the Exchequer of moneys amounting to &euro;6,348,690 advanced to Aerlinte, now Santain Developments Limited, under the <Col N="126" />Air Companies (Amendment) Act 1969. What is involved in that? Has that been repaid from the point of view of the timescale? It seems the date has yet to be agreed. Section 2 provides for the repeal of the provisions in whole or in part and on different days under the Air Companies Acts 1966 to 1993, as detailed in the Schedule to the Bill.</P>
    <P>I am happy to speak on the Bill. This is an important debate. I appeal to the Minister not to rush into a sale without first discussing the clear benefits to the State. As I have seen in the Committee of Public Accounts, millions and even billions of euros can be spent unwisely, which means the taxpayers do not get value for money. We have an asset which does not cost the State money. We should consider all the possibilities before we rush to dispose of something which makes money.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Broughan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pleased to have the opportunity to speak on the Bill. I want to raise crucial issues on behalf of my constituents, specifically those who work in Aer Lingus and whose families are deeply concerned about the current course of action. Aer Lingus is the core industry in terms of job provision in the Dublin Airport nexus, which provides jobs for 40,000 to 50,000 people. It is appropriate that the symbol for the Fingal County Council development board includes a pair of wings to show the key role this industry plays on the north side of Dublin.</P>
      <P>I am surprised the Minister has introduced the Bill at this time. Deputy Shortall was accurate when she said that the Minister, who is clever in many respects as we have seen in the past year and a half in his use of public relations and in the way he tries to manage the debate on transport policy, pretends to do one thing in terms of the Bill and his policy on Aer Rianta while doing something else. His speech on the Bill concentrated on the employee share ownership plan and the workers' participation of 14.9%. The Labour Party welcomes that. The Bill was designed to create the conditions which allowed him and the Minister for Finance to have an ESOP in Aer Lingus. However, that is not the agenda. The Minister's agenda is to deal with the other 85.1%. He wants to flog it at the earliest possible opportunity to the best bidder, regardless of whether that is in the interest of the country. The Labour Party believes it is not.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister did not come in to the Chamber and tell us honestly that he wants to privatise Aer Lingus. When he came to office, he said he would reconsider the issue following the events of 11 September 2001, his predecessor's role in the 2000 Bill and the ill-fated initial public offering. He did not explain to the House why we should embark on this course of action at this stage. I know it is a subject for another day, but Aer Lingus and Aer Rianta are closely related in our minds and in those of more than 8,000 workers and their families. As in the case of Aer Rianta, the Minister's objective is to have a fully priv<Col N="127" />atised second terminal as soon as possible in Dublin Airport. All the huffing and puffing about the dismemberment of the three airports is a means of achieving that. The Minister knows &ndash; a recent PricewaterhouseCoopers report confirmed it &ndash; that he is placing the future of Cork and Shannon airports, in particular, in the gravest danger. The Minister cleverly uses public relations to advance a savage privatisation agenda. That is what he wants to achieve.</P>
    <P>It is extraordinary that the Minister is seeking to do that now, given that over the past two years the workers in Aer Lingus have heroically and determinedly turned that company around and made it, as he said, a profitable company. As a reward for that, the Minister is seeking to put their futures and the future of our region in jeopardy for a &euro;600 million or &euro;700 million injection to the Exchequer. The workers have achieved much and given up a great deal. The future of our aviation companies has been on the agenda for all the days I have served in this House. I was happy the other day to pass the eleventh anniversary of my first election to this House to serve with you, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, and others. It was on the agenda the first time the Labour Party served in Government with Fianna Fáil. I remember Deputy Seán Ryan and I walking through the other lobby to vote against the Government because we were afraid that a failure to inject the capital required at that time would endanger the future of the core industry in our region.</P>
    <P>Throughout the mid-1990s the workforce took the pain, but they were prepared to invigilate and reorganise their work schedules and disciplines. They were rewarded by a subsequent Government with the 5% workers' shareholding and with cash over the years. I am sure the Minister will agree that management subsequent to that failed to build on the gains of the early reorganisation in the early 1990s. It is extraordinary that after two years of further restructuring, the Minister has decided that it is not possible for a public sector semi-State body to do well. That is the nub of the problem. The Government, which is driven by the Progressive Democrats, hates the idea of an efficient commercial semi-State body.</P>
    <P>We had extraordinary nonsense in the newspapers at the weekend, which I presume was planted by the office of the Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources. It was reported that the Minister, Deputy Dermot Ahern, was hopping mad with the ESB. Why was he hopping up and down?</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanRyan" hpid="Mr. S. Ryan Mr. S. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>He must have got a shock.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TommyBroughan" hpid="Mr. Broughan Mr. Broughan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Broughan</NameTxt>
      <P>He got a shock. He found out that perhaps our most distinguished and valuable semi-State company, the ESB, a multinational publicly owned company, was doing so well that it could afford to get money for its recapitalisation at a lower interest rate than that in the <Col N="128" />State. It wants to rebuild the network with &euro;5 billion over the next few years. The Minister did not like that. The Government does not want a successful semi-State or State company. The Labour Party believes that semi-State or State companies can be successful. The ESB and its workers have proven that. The workers of Aer Lingus have proven that in the past two years. The policy of the Progressive Democrats driven Government is to try to handicap and abuse them and to turn them into basket cases. They should be rewarded and encouraged to spend their capital. I have not heard that further capital is needed from the Minister for Finance, the shareholder, to buy new equipment for Aer Lingus. It is embarking on all these projects itself as part of its cost cutting plans, as we have seen recently.</P>
      <P>The last speaker referred to the brand, which is very closely identified with our nation. As we have said down through the years in Dublin Airport, we are very proud of that company and its related companies and of what they have achieved for the country in Shannon, Cork and Dublin, but in other areas too, as other Deputies have mentioned.</P>
      <P>In recent times we have noticed with pride that the chief executive, Willie Walsh, has updated the brand in the form of <i>AerLingus.com</i>and could achieve a &euro;40 million reduction in cost by encouraging people to use the Internet to book flights. It is one of a range of measures the chief executive and his board have introduced which have increased the company's profitability.</P>
      <P>It is extraordinary at this time of success, following great sacrifice by the workforce, and where there is no shortage of finance for capitalisation, where the airline can quite easily finance its future needs, that we have this cloak and dagger Bill from this cloak and dagger Minister, to privatise our national airline and to take it away from the Irish people. It is part of the incoherence of this Government and its agenda. As our party leader, Deputy Rabbitte, mentioned a month ago, we were promised a White Paper in which all aspects of aviation policy would be examined, including airports, particularly the regional airports. It was extraordinary, as journalists rightly noted, that when the Pricewaterhouse report came to light people in this Chamber began to realise that the airport in their locality could be in serious trouble because of the recklessness of the Minister's policies on Aer Rianta. It was quite striking. Surely, a responsible Minister would not have put the cart before the horse and would have entered this House with a policy position.</P>
      <P>I believe that the whole area of State enterprise needs a coherent approach from Government, including the appointment of directors. As part of the portfolio I hold for my party I have heard the Minister's colleague moaning about the directors of An Post, directors he appointed himself. He says they cannot do their job and demands monthly reports from them and from other companies in the communications portfolio as well.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="129" />Perhaps it should be the case that we look at a new model of State company, where directors are not appointed by Ministers. They should be appointed, perhaps, by a competent body, in the same way as we appoint judges. Being a director of an important State company should not be the last refuge for a well-known party hack who can serve out a few years earning several thousand euros a year. We should, rather, appoint experienced people from the industry or from the community where they have made a good contribution. We should also be taking people from the workforce and allowing them to help run the company.</P>
    <P>I strongly support the allocation of a 14.9% increase to the workers of Aer Lingus, as they deserve it, in the light of their achievements. However, I am bitterly opposed to the Minister's plans to privatise this national asset at an early date. I praise the achievements of the workforce and their managers over the last two years in the massive turn around that we have seen from the losses of more than &euro;50 million in 2001 to the profits of &euro;64 million last year, and the projected profits of &euro;75 million for this year.</P>
    <P>The courage of the airline should be recognised in competing with the low cost model, pioneered by Mr. O'Leary and Ryanair. They are prepared to take on those people in the private sector head to head, in the acquisition of new aircraft, the new airbus fleet, and also in the expansion of destinations. It is good to see that our national airline will operate regular flights next year to other EU capitals like Berlin and Warsaw. This has to be welcomed. The new branding of the airline is dynamic and is something that workers and management at the airline deserve credit for.</P>
    <P>The workforce, and SIPTU and IMPACT trade unions, deserve praise for being prepared over the years, in difficult circumstances, to negotiate hard on different types of work practice. In recent times, not just in respect of Aer Lingus, the Minister will know that I have made extensive representations on the new flight limitation times for pilots, as there is grave concern about the safety issues involved. The low cost model could result in work systems for pilots and aircraft staff that would lead to tragedy and casualties. I hope the Minister will continue to represent strongly at European level the concerns felt by workforces in this regard. The achievements of new work structures in recent times have been outstanding.</P>
    <P>One of the major concerns about this Bill is the sections on pensions. Over the years, Labour Party Deputies have received strong representations from retired aviation workers on the evolution of their pensions. The State companies, Aer Lingus and Aer Rianta, were singled out, in that the percentage calculation for contributions to the pension fund was reduced to 6.375%. The result has been that the pensions of airline and airport workers have not kept pace with indexation and inflation in the way that pensions paid by other semi-State bodies have.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="130" />Late last year the leadership of SIPTU, Mr. Des Geraghty, then president, Mr. Jack O'Connor, vice-president, and Mr. Joe O'Flynn, general secretary, expressed grave concern to the Taoiseach about reports that the Minister was to fundamentally change the ownership status of Aer Lingus. At that stage, a major concern related to the future development of the employees' pension scheme. It is not clear from this Bill to what extent defined benefit contributions and defined benefit rewards can be carried forward.</P>
    <P>Is it the case that in this Bill, as in the Minister's previous major exercise in the case of Aer Rianta, he has not thought through the whole issue? He is prepared to create a situation where retired aviation workers may have their future endangered by a reckless rush to privatisation. As a letter in my possession from three senior SIPTU leaders says very clearly, the Taoiseach is no doubt aware that SIPTU believes Aer Lingus can thrive and prosper in public ownership, which is precisely what it has done. We see no reason why that should be challenged at this time.</P>
    <P>A series of problems will develop from the privatisation of Aer Lingus because of the role it has played in Irish transport and the fact that in the future our island nation may not be served by a securely based major airline, controlled from Ireland. Until next May, Ireland will be the only EU country without a land link to the rest of the EU. In that sense it is no accident that the aviation industry has become very important to us. It will continue to be a major industry because of the necessity of travelling to and from this island. The Minister should have come forward with a comprehensive view on aviation policy for the future.</P>
    <P>We must remember the awful history of the privatisation of Eircom. Citizens, including widows, who put their savings into the shares of that company tragically lost significant amounts of money during subsequent developments which led to the present Valentia ownership. There is another major problem in that this privatised company, which I accept is one-third owned by its workforce &ndash; almost 30% is owned by the 8,000 workers, although there were once 18,000 &ndash; has not, it is often said, invested enough in the public sector, particularly in terms of the roll-out of broadband. Aer Lingus could be said to be a similar case in the transport area. I once again urge the Minister to rethink this Bill and withdraw it. He could introduce a revised ESOP, but he should abandon his ill thought-out privatisation of this important national company.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeHiggins" hpid="Mr. J. Higgins Mr. J. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>The Aer Lingus Bill 2003 is nothing more than a Trojan horse from the Minister. In his introduction the Minister emphasised the share ownership arrangements provided for in the Bill for the transfer of a certain segment of shares to Aer Lingus employees. He also emphasised some pension fund provisions. However, these measures are merely a sheath within which <Col N="131" />is hiding the pointed dagger in which the Minister is really interested &ndash; the provision for the privatisation of Aer Lingus, a premier public company which was built up over decades by a dedicated and hard-working workforce in the interests of our society.</P>
      <P>Unfortunately, it is entirely appropriate that it is the Minister, Deputy Brennan, who brings this provision before Dáil Éireann. He holds an extreme right-wing philosophy on the economy and he will not be happy until every significant sector of public enterprise in the State is handed over to privateers. He wants to privatise public transport in Dublin, regardless of the disastrous experience of privatisation in Mrs. Thatcher's Britain. The Minister is not deterred. Of course, he is not alone. Sometimes people blame the Progressive Democrats or individual Ministers for foisting particularly right-wing provisions on an allegedly reluctant Government. That is not the case &ndash; the Minister is not hoodwinking the Cabinet. The Progressive Democrats are enthusiastic supporters of the privatisation philosophy of the Minister, and as long as the Taoiseach can remain in power he does not care, because he has no philosophy on the public sector, or any other sector for that matter.</P>
      <P>The Minister's agenda is incredible. He wants to break up Aer Rianta, although he refuses to tell us why. He provides no plan or anything to show it might be a good idea. Aer Rianta is another premier publicly owned company which is quite close to Aer Lingus. We are left with an understanding that it is the Minister's pro-privatisation mania that leads him to make these decisions, with no firm backing to support them. The reports about certain aspects of Aer Rianta's operation, such as the terminals at Dublin Airport, point in the opposite direction, but the Minister would have us believe he has a hunch that it would be a good idea to privatise these crucial national assets. President Bush had a hunch that it would be a good idea to invade Iraq and he dragged his country with him, but this proved to be a disaster.</P>
      <P>We must look behind the hunches. When we do this we see the Minister's determination to hand over crucial public assets to powerful elements in the private sector at any cost. Some of these, no doubt, are speculator friends of Fianna Fáil, who would like to move in on public assets, take over companies that have been founded and funded by the taxpayer and kept going by public sector workers and milk them for whatever profits are possible. In this regard, the key parts of the Bill are sections 3 and 5, which give the Minister the right to sell all or part of the shares in Aer Lingus.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government has been in power for six and a half years, during which time it has consistently savaged publicly owned enterprise. Eircom was the most notorious of these privatisations but there were a series of others which have almost been forgotten. Most involved important smaller <Col N="132" />public companies such as the Irish National Petroleum Corporation. Others were publicly owned financial companies. All were flogged off by the Government, but Eircom's privatisation was the most blatant. During the process a crucial public asset was handed over to privateers while thousands of ordinary working people were burned after being gulled into buying shares by an incredible propaganda campaign released by the Government. It had the effect of misleading people into thinking that speculation in Eircom shares would provide for their old age. Even more seriously, Eircom, a vital national asset, was consumed by sharks in the commercial sector as it was sold to multinational corporations to become the plaything of international financiers and profiteers.</P>
    <P>The Government agenda with regard to the aviation industry is clear and needs to be exposed. It wishes to hand over the right to create a private terminal to its friends. It wants to privatise Aer Rianta as a whole. There is no question that this is the downstream agenda from the break-up of Aer Rianta and now it wants to provide for the privatisation of Aer Lingus. It is time we launched a major public debate on the issue of public ownership of crucial assets and services. I was astounded to hear today, for example, that Dublin Corporation, which is supposed to be a servant of the people, is considering getting rid of its housing stock. What we see increasingly in the top management of public services are people who are thoroughly infected with the idea of privatisation and of the capitalist market.</P>
    <P>This poses a most serious problem for the future of public enterprise and publicly owned assets in our State. What is the purpose of publicly owned bodies such as local authorities if they are not to administer crucial services such as housing and waste management in the interests of the people? The reality of privatisation is extremely brutal as far as the ordinary workers in these public enterprises are concerned. There is now an all-out effort by Aer Lingus management to privatise the company's catering, for example, a section of the airline that employs close to 300 workers. Aer Lingus management executives are attempting to bludgeon and browbeat the catering workers to accept the most disgusting roll-back of wages and conditions in the company. They are fired up by all the values of companies such as Ryanair and the low-fare merchants in the United States and seek to impose on public service workers conditions that are completely contrary to any company that respects its staff's right to have reasonable pay and conditions. They say Aer Lingus catering is 30% over-staffed and about 50% overpaid and they want to offer a severance package to get rid of the current workforce so that they can bring in &ldquo;yellow pack&rdquo; workers, unfortunate people in search of employment, on much reduced wages and conditions.</P>
    <P>That is the regime the Minister for Transport, Deputy Brennan, is presiding over. It is a regime that needs to be exposed. This is against the back<Col N="133" />ground of the Minister's statement in introducing this debate that in 2002 Aer Lingus had achieved an operating profit of &euro;63.8 million and the projection for 2003 was &euro;78 million. At the same time it wants to batten down the wages and conditions of the Aer Lingus workers. It is all a preparation for privatisation. It wants to have a suitably cowed workforce that it can hand over on a plate and put forward as one of the marketing advantages when the Government sells it to the privateers. I have to question the role of senior management in Aer Lingus and indeed like companies.</P>
    <P>The Minister said in his introductory remarks that he had &ldquo;an opinion from the board and the chairman&rdquo; that they faced at least part-privatisation if not full privatisation of Aer Lingus. Chief executives and senior management in publicly owned companies should not, in any sense, be allowed to advocate the privatisation of their industries. Their remit should be as custodians of these public assets, to maintain them in public ownership and get the maximum benefit for the taxpayer consistent with proper wages and conditions for the workers. There is a disgraceful conflict of interest here such as we saw in Eircom, where people who were supposed to be looking after a publicly owned asset achieved massive financial gains from the privatisation of that enterprise. This is incredible and should not be allowed in any sense. The mouths of senior management executives probably water at the prospect of what privatisation means in terms of their own selfish interests. That should be anathema. It should not be allowed.</P>
    <P>The alternative to what the Minister and some senior management in Aer Lingus envisage is an entirely different approach to the national airline. Aer Lingus should be seen as a national jewel. It should be seen as a vibrant public enterprise which can be consistently developed and which is a crucial national asset in terms of public transport from our island. It is a national asset that can be developed for the benefit of the travelling public, the taxpayer and the Aer Lingus workforce. The workers should be involved in the management of Aer Lingus because it is they who have the best interests of the airline at heart. It is they who know the dots and commas, nuts and bolts of this particular service. If instead of being bullied and browbeaten, which they consistently are, by senior management, with the support of the Government, they were brought to the heart of the management of the company and properly rewarded, there is no doubt they would be instrumental in assisting the continued development of this crucial public asset. That is the alternative to the plans the Minister brings to the Dáil.</P>
    <P>The board of Aer Lingus should reflect on this. It is incredible that the &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; men and women of the Government are stuffed into the boards of crucial public services for no reason other than they are loyal hacks to one or other of the Government parties. It is incredible after the exposure of cronyism and all that has gone with <Col N="134" />it in recent years that there is still a Government that carries on this tradition. It is one that should be halted and ended forthwith. Instead of the cronies of Government, if the working people, both in the airline and those depending on the service, are involved in the development of the national airline, it will continue to be a premier company.</P>

    <P>Comhlacht an-thábhachtach is ea Aer Lingus. Is í príomh aidhm an Bhille seo ná Aer Lingus a choimeád mar chomhlacht in Éirinn. Tá sé soiléir, freisin, go mbeidh díol phíobháideach ann. An cóir an comhlucht ar fad a dhíol? Tá argóintí le cur ar an dá thaobh. Níl aon dabht ach go gcaithfidh aistriú an-mhór a theacht ar Aer Lingus de réir an Bhille seo. Díospóireacht an-<Col N="135" />mhaith is ea an ceann seo chun an cheist go léir a phlé.</P>
    <P>Le blianta fada anuas tá an-jab déanta ag Aer Lingus. Roimh theacht Ryanair ba é Aer Lingus an comhlacht ba mhó le rá imeasc comhlachtaí na hÉireann. Comhlacht an-mhaith is ea é, agus neamhspleách ó thaobh polasaí de. Deir gach duine a d'oibrigh do Aer Lingus gur chomhlacht cairdiúil ab ea é agus gur cuireadh suim i gcónaí ins na gnáth daoine a bhí ag taisteal ar eitleáin Aer Lingus. Tá creidiúint an-mhór ag baint le logo Aer Lingus dá bharr sin.</P>
    <P>Historically Aer Lingus has probably been the best known Irish company, certainly before Ryanair was set up to compete with it. It has a very proud tradition of service to the people who travel with the airline, directly on the flights and indirectly through the network of workers and support services within the company. It is something of which we are all very proud. I am more proud of Aer Lingus than of Eircom. I suppose I would have less complaints about Aer Lingus because it is a totally different service.</P>
    <P>Like other companies in the modern world, Aer Lingus must change and keep up with what is happening in the international market. The company has given very proud service. For many years, Aer Lingus hostesses epitomised everything good about Ireland. Younger people looking at the television liked to see images of an Irish airline, with friendly hostesses providing an efficient and effective service. Aer Lingus has a very safe aviation record, which is why we were always happy to choose it in the past and, I hope, will continue to do in the future.</P>
    <P>Aer Lingus employs thousands of people and even though it does not employ so many where I live in County Louth, a number of employees live in the area. The lives of thousands of people in north County Dublin revolve around what happens in Aer Lingus and, in the broader sense, what happens in the airport. The debate on the Bill must take into consideration the interests of people in north County Dublin and elsewhere who work for Aer Lingus. We must fully debate the proposals in the Bill.</P>
    <P>Aer Lingus has a fine business record. The company has recovered greatly in the recent past from the negative and adverse impact of 11 September on the aviation industry throughout the world. It has become a very slimmed down company in terms of how it operates flights. In many instances it is discontinuing the business class service. The most important aspect of Aer Lingus is its dot.com service. One can book flights on the Internet at a 50% reduction. It offers flights to New York in January for approximately &euro;120. When one travels with Aer Lingus, one will arrive in the city named on the ticket and not have to travel for three hours by bus or whatever to reach one's destination.</P>
    <P>Aer Lingus has a lot to offer. It is an efficient and effective company which is very well run. I listened recently to a radio programme about the <Col N="136" />chief executive officer, Mr. Walsh. He is a very young and dynamic man. He has made major changes in the company, none of which could be made without the clear and absolute support of the unions and workers involved. There have been difficulties. There was a recent strike because cabin staff were unhappy with issues. However, the company is being run efficiently, with all sides agreeing to the necessary changes being made. One must change to stay in business in the modern world, and Aer Lingus is certainly meeting these requirements.</P>
    <P>A number of Deputies addressed the issue of privatisation. There is no point getting caught in a 19th century philosophy for a 21st century business. Some people argue about privatisation as if it were evil, negative or bad. It can be good and bad but in itself it is not an issue. Its impact is important. If a public company needs more capital and the State is in a position to provide it there is no reason it should not approach the private sector for investment income and offer its shares for sale, particularly if is a company in which people wish to invest. I am not hung up on privatisation. Those who are miss the point. They live in a different world, belong to a different generation and a different time.</P>
    <P>It does not matter whether Aer Lingus is a private or public company. What matters is that it be a success and that the relationship between the management and staff is effective in achieving that. The question I put to those opposed to privatisation is whether it is good that a worker can invest in and be a shareholder in his own company? Is it not productive for a worker in Aer Lingus to be able to buy with his own money a guaranteed share of the company of upwards of 20%? It is a good thing to be able to do so. Companies in my own town of Drogheda have such schemes. For example, Irish Cement has a useful and modern share participation scheme for all its workers. Every worker has a share in the ownership of the company, ensuring a commitment to the company's success. The ability of workers to buy shares in their company constitutes a form of modern socialism and ownership. It transfers ownership from the boic móra, as Deputy Joe Higgins said, to the ordinary man. It gives the ordinary person a share, a say and a vote in the management of his company, something that would never happen if it is run solely by the Government. I do not have a difficulty with the principal issue here, which is the purchase of shares. I welcome it as a good thing.</P>
    <P>Shared ownership can also apply to those who use the company when travelling. This will encourage company loyalty. If I have X amount of shares in Aer Lingus I would be more inclined to travel with Aer Lingus rather than British Airways, SAS or whatever. Although only a small aspect, it will generate its own interest in travelling with the company.</P>
    <P>The world-wide aviation industry was in good shape until the events of 11 September 2001, when the international situation changed rad<Col N="137" />ically. I commend Aer Lingus on its one world alliance, its enterprise and the change it has made in management and particularly on reducing its prices, becoming more competitive, offering more choice to ordinary people and providing a better service. I do not see the sale of shares in Aer Lingus as right wing or left wing but as the best option. The good thing is that people can take ownership of the company.</P>
    <P>A number of Members referred to Eircom and the problems that arose directly as a result of the sale of shares in the company. In many ways the Minister's predecessor, Senator O'Rourke, of whom we can be critical, embarked on a challenge of which we were all in favour. We were all happy to invest. The problem was that many lost money. The less experienced one was in the world of finance, the longer one held onto one's shares and consequently the more one lost. That was a serious problem. People lost confidence in the IPO and the sale of State companies, which probably delayed the introduction of this Bill.</P>
    <P>When going to the market one has got to be careful at what price one sells. Eircom employed international consultants. There were different views on what the initial offer would be. The boic móra, as Deputy Joe Higgins would call them, did well out of the shares. They sold early and got out early while the ordinary person did not. When one invests and buys one takes a risk. I hope more thought will go into this issue if and when Aer Lingus shares are offered to the public. Members of the public will be more wary than was the case with the Eircom privatisation, but I hope more thought will be given to those who may be interested in buying only a small amount of shares, if that is possible. The more people who take shares in and ownership of Aer Lingus when offered for sale the better and the more interesting it will be. People will feel part of the company, more so than was the case with Eircom. Eircom left a sour taste in the mouths of many people. Many were unhappy at being forced to sell their shares even if they did not wish to do so. That had a negative impact.</P>
    <P>Other issues have been addressed in this debate, one of which is landing rights in other countries, particularly at Heathrow Airport. They are expensive to buy and constitute a national rather than a company asset. The Minister may have already addressed this aspect, but it is important that these rights be properly scrutinised. We should retain ownership of them if possible. There is a need to ensure that they cannot be sold without the consent of the Government.</P>
    <P>Some years ago I travelled on an Aer Lingus flight to New York. There was no problem on the outward journey but the return journey was different. I am not the smallest of men. Sitting in front of me was a guy who, as soon as he boarded the aircraft, backed his seat more or less into my face where it remained for the remainder of the flight. I complained to Aer Lingus in writing saying I was concerned about the leg room available <Col N="138" />on its international flights. I received a wonderful reply to the effect that this was the first such complaint the company had received and inquiring if I was dreaming it up. I was not. Medical research has since proven that on long haul flights, particularly over four or five hours, there is a serious problem if space is restricted. Aer Lingus policy on its international flights, certainly on its flights to New York, is shameful and unacceptable to me and many others to whom I have spoken about travel on the A330 Airbuses. They are wonderful aircraft but there is less room in them in terms of distance between passengers than on a flight to London, France or wherever.</P>
    <P>Last summer there was a sudden strike at British Airways. I happened to be in Nice and had hoped to travel back to Ireland that night. While the Aer Lingus staff in Nice were friendly the company had a problem in that it was sharing a flight with British Airways. When the British Airways flight did not turn up we immediately went to the Aer Lingus desk and were told we were travelling with British Airways and not Aer Lingus. When not in Ireland, problems may arise between Aer Lingus and its one world partner. In view of this, it may be useful if the company circulated a printed sheet setting out the procedures and what is normally done and, most important, a contact telephone number.</P>
    <P>Events such as this happen in unusual and rare circumstances. From my perspective, the company response was inadequate. I would have liked to have been able to read about the procedure to follow. I understood my contract was with Aer Lingus, the company from whom I bought the ticket, and I considered it was the company's responsibility to deal with it. However, Aer Lingus said it was British Airways. I had a row with the company over the matter. I was unable to return to Ireland and had to stay in France, from where I travelled to New York. Thousands of people were discommoded on that occasion. When I arrived at the Aer Lingus desk in New York the staff were very helpful and gave me the name of a Ramada hotel to which I travelled in a taxi. When I got there I found a half mile queue of people whose transport arrangements for the night had been upset. The hotel was very poor and the staff were unhelpful to everybody. The airline should re-examine where it sends people when unusual circumstances, such as a sudden strike and worldwide commotion, arise.</P>
    <P>I travel regularly from Drogheda to Dublin and, since the work began on the port tunnel, I can be delayed for an average of one hour. The arrangements are inadequate and many people travelling from the airport or, like me, from further up the road are delayed unnecessarily. I cannot understand why we are delayed for up to one hour. The Minister is an efficient man in these matters. Could he speak with someone to discover what is the problem? It seems to be the management of the volume of vehicles in the early morning <Col N="139" />because the problem is not as bad at night. Nobody seems to care; one sits there and nothing happens. Could the Minister call on those responsible to do something about it? Part of the problem is that drivers try to avoid staying on the main road, take an exit to a flyover and prevent the rest of the traffic passing. There are two flows of traffic, one appearing to go faster than the other. It is not fair on people like me who are rushing to get into the Dáil to do their business.</P>
    <P>I have problems about selling all the silverware but not in principle with the sale of some of it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanRyan" hpid="Mr. S. Ryan Mr. S. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pleased to have the opportunity to make a contribution on the Bill which is, by and large, an enabling one, although in that context I am disappointed. I want to see a viable and successful Aer Lingus in future. The content of the Bill does not do justice to the important strategic decision being put before us. We need a Green Paper on the future and merits or otherwise of Aer Lingus. I have always been and will remain a supporter of public enterprise because it has played a significant role in the development of the economy since the foundation of the State and can continue to do so in future provided the will exists at political, management and staff levels. However, the public enterprise of which I speak must be just as accountable in terms of management and staff performance as any company in the private sector.</P>
      <P>To achieve this, it is imperative that we separate the social and commercial aspects when making decisions. The Bill contains enabling provisions in respect of the establishment of the employee share ownership plan, the issue and sale of new shares by the company, the sale of shares by the Minister for Finance, the appointment of directors and the establishment of new pension schemes.</P>
      <P>In respect of existing pensions in the context of the proposals to privatise Aer Lingus, the annual report states:</P>
      <P>The group operates several externally funded pension schemes for the majority of its employees. These schemes meet the definition of defined benefit schemes under the terms of the Pensions Act 1990.</P>
      <P>The report then refers to surplus:</P>
      <P>If an actuarial valuation discloses a surplus, it shall be applied by the Trustees, after consultation with the Actuary, for the purpose of increasing the benefits to members or reducing the rate of contributions by the employers and-or members.</P>
      <P>It also refers importantly to deficiency:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If an actuarial valuation discloses a deficiency, the Trustees shall take such measures as they think appropriate, having regard to the recommendations of the Actuary, to remedy any such actual or anticipated deficiency provided that no such measures <Col N="140" />shall, without the consent of the employers, make provision for payment of any increased contribution by the employers or without the consent of the members make provision for the payment of any increased contribution by the members.</P>
    <P>That is a fundamental issue that must be addressed because there is a public perception of a scandal for Aer Lingus and Aer Rianta pensioners.</P>
    <P>It is important to note the background to this. Since the 1950s Aer Lingus and Aer Rianta management and staff jointly agreed that the terms and conditions of employment would be kept in line with public service and especially with the major State companies. That pact has been broken. Pension increases are among the worst in the public sector. They are paid at the discretion of the trustees and can be no higher than consumer price index increases.</P>
    <P>The staff have worked in the public sector all their lives and, with the possibility of privatisation in future, they are concerned and demand that a proper pension scheme be put in place comparable with those in the Civil Service, local authorities, Army, Garda Síochána, and for nurses, teachers, ESB and CIE salaried staffs. It is important to note that the pensions in these bodies were increased by 63% between 1989 and 2002 while Aer Lingus and Aer Rianta pensions grew by only 32%, creating a gap of 31%.</P>
    <P>The pensioners' representatives have met the Minister's predecessors, the Taoiseach and the Minister for Finance but do not seem to be closer to receiving a specific commitment to put in place a pension scheme that is fair, effective and prepares them for the future. There is no reference to pensions in the Bill beyond an outline of what the Minister proposes to do, but that must be addressed. I urge the Minister to make some commitment on that issue when summing up.</P>
    <P>Agreement was reached between the unions and Government to increase the employee shareholding in the company from 4.9% to 14.9% as part of the Aer Lingus survival plan. This was not a gesture on the part of the Government, it was a return for the sacrifices made by the staff over the years and, accordingly, I have no difficulty in supporting it. The legal requirements for the implementation of the share increase, however, could have been introduced without including provision for privatisation. The Minister will have the power to implement far-reaching decisions without recourse to the Oireachtas and it is wrong that fundamental decisions on the future of Aer Lingus could be made without detailed analysis in the Houses.</P>
    <P>I oppose granting the Minister for Transport and the Minister for Finance the power to sell shares in the company. It is evident that the Minister has deliberately cast aside a fundamental issue &ndash; the public interest. Any proposed legislation that provides for a change of status in Aer Lingus must take that interest into account because it is linked to the future viability of the <Col N="141" />company. The Bill does not refer to strategic issues and we are being asked to enact it without detailed debate. The legislation is flawed as a result.</P>
    <P>Aer Lingus has served this country exceptionally well in the past 66 years, giving immense returns on investments and making a vital contribution to industrial policy. I recall coming into the House during the difficult times in the early 1990s when we were talking about the possibility of Aer Lingus collapsing. We had to fight tooth and nail when in government with Fianna Fáil to ensure the then Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications, Deputy Cowen, would give a commitment to the provision of the equity needed to ensure the future viability of the company. At a time when competitors throughout Europe were in receipt of state investment, nothing was forthcoming from successive Governments here. My colleagues and I had to take action because we were not prepared to accept a diktat from the Minister on the future of Aer Lingus.</P>
    <P>Following that action, £175 million was invested in the airline and the Cahill plan was implemented. Thousands of jobs were lost but it put the company on a solid footing. People will acknowledge that the limited investment over the years has given real value for money. The Minister is betraying the committed managers and workers who built up the company, particularly the current staff who have made such huge sacrifices to bring about change in Aer Lingus. With support from top to bottom, staff have made substantial changes in the company.</P>
    <P>The economy at national, regional and local level depends on Aer Lingus, and Cork, Shannon and Dublin, particularly north County Dublin where thousands of Aer Lingus and Aer Rianta staff live, have benefited from its work. I have reservations, however, about the direction the Minister is taking with the Bill because, like everyone in the House, I want a vibrant and successful Aer Lingus. The tourism industry, which successive Governments have identified as the largest sector of the economy, with huge growth potential, could be affected if we lose our national airline. Where is there reference in the Bill to the significance of tourism?</P>
    <P>In the aftermath of 11 September 2001, the then Minister for Public Enterprise said that the strategic importance of the aviation sector to the economic well-being of the country had been well documented, particularly when our island status and position on the periphery of Europe were taken into account. She said that the aviation sector, through the provision of reliable, competitive services to and from our main markets made a major contribution to economic growth across the tourism, manufacturing and services sectors. Referring to the transatlantic service, she said it illustrated the crucial importance of Aer Lingus in supporting the tourism industry and the important and growing trade links with the US. If Aer Lingus is sold off, even to Irish buyers, <Col N="142" />there is no way to guarantee it will not be sold on to other owners who would have no loyalty to this country, no commitment to the maintenance of routes of strategic value and no consideration of the needs of the tourism industry.</P>
    <P>In light of the great success of the past two years, it is disturbing to read in the media that the chief executive of the company, Mr. Willie Walsh, and the chairman, Mr. Tom Mulcahy, have recommended to the Minister the sale of Aer Lingus. The Minister, who has always been in favour of privatisation, is using these recommendations to justify his own proposals, whatever they entail. I hope to have time later to delve into the Minister's proposals regarding the privatisation direction he intends to take.</P>
    <P>I admire what the chief executive of Aer Lingus has done and the direction in which he has brought Aer Lingus to date, but he is exceeding his duty in proposing privatisation of the company. What he and the Minister should do is come before an Oireachtas committee, or bring forward a Green Paper, and justify the direction being proposed for this company. Let us all question this seriously to ensure that we will in the end get a policy for Aer Lingus that will be right for the country, the employees and the economy.</P>
    <P>It is interesting that the chief executive is reported to have said that the proceeds of the sale of Aer Lingus, which could range from &euro;300 million to &euro;600 million, could go directly to the Minister for Finance to fatten up his campaign for the next general election. This is an utter disgrace. Considering all the negotiations that have taken place over the years and the difficult decisions that have to be taken, it is a disgrace to say it is &ldquo;interesting&rdquo; that the sale proceeds might go to the Government's kitty to finance the purchase of the new fleet and further expansions in the future.</P>
    <P>There is a further line of thought which I do not disagree with, namely, that Aer Lingus has shown that it is capable of competing in the aviation market and should be allowed get on with the job, rather than be interfered with by this Minister. I have given serious consideration to this Bill. Though it is able legislation, it is defective. It is in the hands of the Minister for Transport, Deputy Brennan, though any Minister could have been involved. Regarding this country's future there is too much at stake for our flagship carrier, Aer Lingus, to be delivered into the hands of one person and a Government to bring in policies for privatisation without being obliged to come before the Oireachtas to present a case for privatisation. That is why this Bill is defective and the reason I will oppose it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JerryCowleyIND" hpid="Dr. Cowley Dr. Cowley">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Cowley</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very honoured to speak on this Bill, which is extremely important. The main purpose of the Bill is to give effect to the employee share ownership plan, ESOP, agreed by the Government and Aer Lingus unions, and to provide for a legal framework to facilitate a legal process of external investment in the airline <Col N="143" />in the event that the Government embarks on such a process. It includes an enabling provision for the establishment of new pension schemes by Aer Lingus for general employees and pensioners and for amendments regarding the appointments of directors, including worker-directors.</P>
      <P>As noted, the story of Aer Lingus is remarkable. We all have great pride in our national airline. For a country of four million people it flies and has flown the flag. It is obvious there have been major changes at the airline and, as airlines go, it is unusual for both Ryanair and Aer Lingus to be in profit. We all recall the events of 11 September 2001 and the terrible effect on airlines. Aer Lingus has turned a loss of &euro;52 million in 2001 into a profit of &euro;63.8 million in 2002, and is already planning further changes such as new routes and the transformation of the fleet into one of Airbuses, which will allow more savings. The airline is the bridge which allows tourists to come to this country. Aer Lingus has done very well and has moved into profit. This legislation is very much connected with its future. There are big changes occurring. Airlines are very important, with airports necessary to support the airlines and <i>vice versa.</i>I will talk briefly of how Knock Airport has also done very well. It is another success story, with passenger numbers this year up 25%. This shows how Knock International Airport has developed as the major infrastructure in the BMW area of the west. A recent survey showed that 70% of people surveyed in the whole BMW area preferred Knock International Airport to Aer Rianta airports. The views of the people cannot be ignored.</P>
      <P>There is a 180-acre business park in the airport area which has major growth potential if it gets the support it needs. An air freight apron is also being developed. The wish would be that this wonderful investment by the very dynamic Knock Airport board would be matched by the Government.</P>
      <P>There are empty roads in my area &ndash; it took me five and a half hours to get to Dublin today. If I were going in the other direction, for example, from the midlands to Knock Airport it would have taken me no time. I wonder why major resources would be put into bringing more people into Dublin, which is already over-congested and lacks the infrastructure around the airport. Tax incentive schemes and manufacturing opportunities are needed at Knock International Airport. The story of Aer Lingus has been remarkable, but so too has that of Knock International Airport.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is the single greatest opportunity to divert traffic which is congesting the entire Dublin area. Second terminals and the like are necessary, but where is the infrastructure to allow cars in and out? How are the people to get in and out? Already the M50 is jam-packed. What will happen with more development at Dublin Airport? Is it not time to divert people to the uncongested <Col N="144" />Knock Airport? The Government must provide greater financial incentives to match the hundreds of millions that have been put into other international airports and turn a black hole of underdevelopment into a shining beacon of major potential for the whole area.</P>
    <P>The Minister will agree that the Knock Airport board is very dynamic and is competing very successfully with other international airports. The number of passengers will reach a quarter of a million this year. Knock is the fastest growing airport, with a 25% increase in passenger numbers this year. Some &euro;400 million has been allocated for marketing, safety and security, but that is very little for an airport with major potential. If we are talking about balanced regional development, this is a wake-up call. The Dublin area is bursting at the seams and if we were afloat, this whole area would be under the Irish Sea.</P>
    <P>Considering the cost of maintaining people in Dublin compared to maintaining them in the west, it would be much more cost effective to invest in balanced regional development rather than paying lip service. I know the Minister will agree with that and I hope he will take appropriate action. My area of the west is the most socio-economically deprived part of the country, a fact shown by the national census figures, yet the funds are going into the over-developed area in Dublin. As I said, it took me five and a half hours to get to Dublin from the west. It would make a lot more sense to direct people towards Knock Airport.</P>
    <P>The Bill is extremely important. It raises many questions. A major partnership effort has been made and it is extremely important that workers are benefiting by having a share in the company. This gives everyone an input into the situation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BillyKelleher" hpid="Mr. Kelleher Mr. Kelleher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelleher</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank you, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, for allowing me to raise the issue of St. Joseph's national school, Riverstown, County Cork. The following is an extract from a letter I received from the board of management of the school:</P>
      <P>The board of management of the above school has just finished a three year term. As it started its term of office, the school got the approval of the building unit of the Department of Education and Science to initiate a proposed extension of 8/12 classrooms and related ancillary rooms. This proposed extension is now at section 7 of the building list of the Department along with a couple of hundred other schools.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Glanmire is a rapidly growing area with no facilities for the increased number of children requiring education. The school is a well main<Col N="145" />tained school that is struggling under extremely overcrowded conditions. The school was built in 1979 as a 12 classroom school, in 1985 we were well on the way to a four classroom extension, having received planning permission, when the project was scrapped. It has taken continuous efforts by all boards of management to get on the Department's list again. We have now reached stage three of planning and we have no guarantee of going any further.</P>
    <P>St. Joseph's is a 12 classroom school with 20 classes, a staff of 33 comprising 26 teachers, one language tutor, four special needs assistants, a secretary and a caretaker. The enrolment for this year is 574 pupils and the expected numbers for the next three years are as follows: September 2004 &ndash; 601; September 2005 &ndash; 639; and September 2006 &ndash; 666.</P>
    <P>The school now has seven prefab classrooms, three portacabins, a language support teacher in the hall, a class in the medical-library room, a principal's office in a doorway and a staffroom for 33 which was built for 14. The school is well maintained and is being penalised for this good house management, even though some of the prefabs are nearly 20 years old and are getting difficult to maintain to the required standard.</P>
    <P>The board of management also feels that far too much money &ndash;&euro;146,000 &ndash; and time has been spent on this project to date for it to be put aside again. The board has organised a health and safety audit in the school and will forward it to the Department soon.</P>
    <P>In recent times the board of management has done the following. In November 2000 the school was granted permission to initiate eight to 12 classrooms and ancillary rooms. In December 2000 the board of management decided on school needs. In January 2001 three members of the board of management went to the Department building unit in Tullamore to request more resource rooms and a Cork-based architect. In February 2001 permission was granted for this, letters were sent to all design team members and meetings were held with architects to draw up programme of work. The board arranged testing of the school for asbestos by the health and safety unit of the Office of Public Works.</P>
    <P>In March 2001 discussions were held at board meetings about fund-raising of &euro;25,000, a search was done for drawings of the 1985 proposed extension and the fee for the design team was negotiated. In April 2001 a letter was sent to parents requesting a contribution of £50 per family for the extension.</P>
    <P>In May 2001 there were further meetings with the architect. A sketch scheme plan for eight to 12 classrooms was drawn up, delivered to the board of management for approval and sent to the Department for inspection. In June 2001 meetings were held with local residents' associations to discuss worries regarding the extension. Telephone calls were made throughout that summer to the Department to check if the sketch plan had been approved. In October 2001 three <Col N="146" />members of the board of management and the architect had meetings with the building unit in Tullamore to discuss the sketch scheme. They were asked to change certain aspects. Letters were sent to new parents requesting £50 contributions to the extension fund-raising.</P>
    <P>In November 2001 public meetings were held with local TDs to get their support and to see if they could speed up the process. The revised sketch scheme was sent back to the Department. In December 2001 the sketch scheme was ready for approval but the Department was not proceeding with proposals. There was a hold on all projects.</P>
    <P>In March 2002 the board put in a request for a new prefab classroom as pupil numbers would give an extra teacher in September 2002. In April 2002 a school walk was held to raise funds, a site plan for the prefab classroom was organised and planning permission sought. A quantity surveyor did figures for stage three documents.</P>
    <P>In May 2002 the stage three documents were sent to the Department and local Deputies were kept informed of the situation. In July 2002 approval was granted for a prefab classroom. The building unit of the Department sent letters with a number of questions for the design team. In August 2002 answers from the design team were sent back to the Department. Assurances were given by the Minister, Deputy Noel Dempsey, that the school extension would be considered for inclusion in the programme for 2003. In October 2003 local TDs were invited to the school to see the overcrowded conditions for themselves.</P>
    <P>I attended that visit to the school. In the light of the number of children attending the school, the 33 staff members and the projections for the next number of years, I urge the Minister to use his good offices to progress this project to ensure that the pupils of Riverstown national school can receive an education in decent surroundings.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatTheCope" hpid="Mr. Gallagher Mr. Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government (Mr. Gallagher)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Kelleher for giving me this opportunity to outline the proposals of the Department of Education and Science for additional accommodation at Riverstown national school in Glanmire, County Cork.</P>
      <P>The school has a staffing level of a principal and 20 assistants, with an enrolment of 574 pupils on 30 September 2003. The Department received an application from the board of management requesting the provision of additional accommodation.</P>
      <P>A full design team has been appointed and architectural design of the project is progressing. The Riverstown national school building school project is listed in section 7 of the 2003 school building programme. The proposed project is at stage three of architectural planning and a sketch scheme has been developed. It has been assigned a band two rating by the Department in accordance with the published criteria for prioritising large-scale projects.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="147" />The architectural design of additional accommodation is based on nine stages. The design and planning of the project is covered by stages one to five, during which the project is developed from the assessment of site suitability through the detailed design, including the obtaining of planning permission, to the point where detailed bills of quantities are prepared. At stage six tenders are sought in line with public procurement procedures, and subsequently a tender report is prepared and examined. Assuming that the outcome of the tender process is acceptable in terms of procurement procedures and providing value for money and that funds are available to meet construction costs, a construction contract is placed at that stage and the construction of the project begins.</P>
    <P>I am sure Deputy Kelleher is aware of the various stages in the process. Stages seven to nine cover post-contract cost control throughout the construction period, construction and practical completion of the project, including the handover of the building to the proposed occupiers and the completion of the cost analysis in the form of the final account, ensuring that cost control was maintained.</P>
    <P>The Minister intends to publish details of the 2004 schools building programme by early January at the latest. The programme will clarify what progress is planned for projects, such as that raised by Deputy Kelleher at Riverstown national school, during 2004.</P>
    <P>The Deputy is obviously familiar with the school. He can be assured that I will convey his strong views to the Minister for Education and Science at the first opportunity, possibly tomorrow, and relate his concerns and his anxiety that the project move to the next stage as quickly as possible.</P>

      <P>I am grateful to you, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, for the opportunity of raising the question of scoil náisiúnta Tuairíní, Moycullen, County Galway, roll no. 131415 D. In 1998 the school was examined by a senior architect from the Department of Education and Science who concluded that the existing building, which is more than 100 years old, is not capable of being modernised to current standards and the restricted site is not capable of being developed or extended. At that point the board of management identified three sites which it suggested to the Department of Education and Science. The Office of Public Works rejected two of the sites as the development costs were prohibitive. The last site has been surveyed and deemed suitable.</P>

      <Col N="148" />In September 2002, the Department of Education and Science wrote to the board of management and stated:</P>
    <P>A decision has been taken not to proceed with the acquisition of a site for a new school building. Later this year when a financial allocation has been made for the primary school building programme in the 2003 estimates the accommodation needs of the school as they apply on the existing site will be considered.</P>
    <P>When the list was published in January 2003, there was no mention of extra accommodation for the school. The parents have written to the five Deputies who represent Galway. The rather intemperate outburst of my colleague, the Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Fahey, draws attention to the fact that his energies might be better directed to addressing the resolution of this issue for the people of Moycullen. When the board of management was informed that the school was not to feature in the lists published in January 2003, it knew that it would be appointing a third assistant teacher in September 2003. Three classes are being held in a 24 square metre prefab and 20 hours a week of learning support, resource and instrumental music tuition is being taught in the teachers staff room which measures 2.5 metres by 2.5 metres. The staff room also houses the school's photocopier and learning support books and resources. Further resource teaching when granted will have to take place in the hallway.</P>
    <P>In April 2003, the Department granted &euro;70,000 for the provision of another prefab. As there was no space in which to put this prefab, the parents' association purchased land to the rear of the school to house the prefab.</P>
    <P>I wish to ask a specific question. I am familiar with the stages for approval of schools and the architectural process. The board of management has asked to be considered in the small schools pilot scheme. They need to know where the school stands with regard to that scheme. If money was granted under that scheme, the existing school could be extended, thus ensuring that half of the school's 79 pupils would not be taught in prefabs.</P>
    <P>I think the Minister for State will agree with my view. It is often stated that Ireland is the richest or the second richest country in Europe, with the fastest rate of growth and the highest level of foreign direct investment. It is unacceptable in 2003 that children are being taught in these conditions. It is not good enough and it involves a breach of trust, to make promises to parents and boards of management only to fob them off from one year to the next. They are asking straight questions such as where they stand with regard to funding and the provision of permanent accommodation and where they stand with regard to 2004 funding. They wonder where they stand with regard to the special pilot scheme for small schools. They look at their school and they see a <Col N="149" />great deal of money has been wasted on surveying and rejecting sites.</P>
    <P>I think the Minister of State and Members on all sides of the House will agree that if we are to do anything about equality and insuring the bunchlochanna and oideachas ceart, it is at primary level that one must ensure that facilities are of the standard of a modern country. I ask the Minister of State to answer those direct questions about the 2004 permanent accommodation and the pilot scheme for small schools.</P>

      <P>Gabhaim leithscéal an Aire Oideachaís agus Eolaíochta leis an Teachta ós rud é nach bhfuil sé in ann bheith anseo anocht. Gabhaim buíochas leis an Teachta fosta a chur ar an  Athló.</P>
      <P>I thank Deputy Higgins for raising the matter as it gives me the opportunity to outline to the House the position regarding scoil náisiúnta Tuairíní in Moycullen, County Galway.</P>
      <P>This school is a co-educational primary school. Enrolments have shown an increase in recent years from 67 pupils in 1997-98 to 79 pupils in September 2003. The school has a staffing of principal plus three mainstream assistants and one shared resource teacher. The board of management of this school applied to the Department of Education and Science in 1997 for an extension to the school premises. Following an assessment of the application it was agreed that the appropriate accommodation should be provided for a three-classroom school. A technical report carried out by the Department indicated that the existing premises did not lend itself to modernisation and that the site was somewhat restricted.</P>
      <P>Consequently, the Office of Public Works, which acts on behalf of the Department with regard to the procurement of sites, was asked to investigate and report on suitable sites for the proposed new school. However, in September 2002 the Department of Education and Science informed the board of management that due to current financial constraints, the site acquisition could not proceed for the time being. Accordingly the proposed building project was not included in the 2003 school building programme. To alleviate the school's temporary accommodation problems the Department of Education and Science sanctioned grant aid in May 2003 towards the purchase of a temporary classroom. The school has been renting a temporary portakabin to address its short-term needs.</P>
      <P>The school authority has applied to the Department for inclusion in the small schools initiative. This initiative was introduced last year to allow small primary schools undertake building and modernisation works on a devolved basis. I am familiar with the scheme in my county. It is an excellent initiative and great progress has been made. This initiative is a courageous action by the Minister, Deputy Dempsey. I believe it will cost well under the normal cost of the mainstream process.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="150" />I appreciate Deputy Higgins's concern. This application is being considered in the context of the 2004 school building programme. The purchase of a site and the advancement of the school's building project to architectural planning will depend on the budgetary provision for 2004 and subsequent years, the rate of progress of existing projects in architectural planning and the priority afforded to each project by reference to the published criteria for prioritising large-scale building projects. The Deputy can be assured that I will relay to the Minister tomorrow the strong case made by him. His colleagues, the Minister of State, Deputy Fahey, and the Minister, Deputy Ó Cuív, also expressed support for the pilot project. The new devolved scheme would seem to be the best for the resolution of many of the problems in the small schools.</P>
    <P>The 2004 school building programme will be published shortly and will outline details of projects for which funding is to be made available. In the meantime, it is the responsibility of the board of management to ensure the health and safety of pupils and teachers at the school. The school authorities should use the devolved grant to address urgent works which arise. Tá tuairim láidir ag an Teachta faoin scoil seo curtha in iúl don Dáil anocht agus don Roinn agus is féidir leis bheith cinnte go mbeidh mé ag caint leis an Aire agus cuirfidh mé in iúl na tuairimí atá nochtaithe aige.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerardMurphy" hpid="Mr. Murphy Mr. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to deal with an urgent matter, namely the inadequate funding provided by the Government for child care facilities. I highlight the plight of Millstreet Community Council, while making it clear that this is not an isolated case. I have been in touch with other such facilities, all of which are experiencing the same problem. Many of the projects are new and have not yet reached a crisis position but, having discussed the amount of staff grants available and the level of voluntary fundraising needed, all child care facilities will have to cut back services drastically or close completely.</P>
      <P>The plight of Millstreet Community Council is best expressed by the words of the chairman in a recent letter addressed to me, in which he stated:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Due to terrible underfunding we now find that our staff have to be put on protective notice; three full-time positions and five part-time. This is going to be a huge blow to a small rural community. This will also directly affect the parents using our service for childcare while they avail of employment, training and further education opportunities. This is not an isolated case. Through our contacts with other groups we have discovered that others are in a similar position, facing fundraising efforts of up to &euro;25,000 per annum and in other cases having to put their staff on protective notice also. There is an inherent flaw in the programme that funds big capital projects but fails to <Col N="151" />adequately staff the same. The Government has placed major responsibility on the shoulders of community groups in this programme and has failed to properly support these groups. Millstreet Community Council now has the responsibility for eight staff members and upwards of 40 children and their parents as users of our service on a staffing grant that will leave the group with an annual debt of &euro;40,000. It is obvious that this cannot be sustained by the group and we feel very used and abused by a Government which would bleed the community spirit dry through a badly thought out programme.</P>
    <P>They feel they have been badly let down on this occasion. After discussions and an appeal to the Department, the project ended up with a staffing grant of &euro;169,000 over a three year period, which amounts to &euro;56,000 per annum. It was obvious that this was insufficient to staff a full day-care facility offering baby places 11 hours per day, involving shift workers on rotas.</P>
    <P>This leaves the community council in an untenable position. The facility is now offering a high level of service to all social groups. Costs have risen because there is a considerably high number of baby places along with a large number of disadvantaged people availing of the service. Long opening hours are necessary to provide this range of services for all age groups.</P>
    <P>In addition to catering for the needs of the local community, the council also runs an asylum centre for women and children in the Drishane estate. Women in this asylum centre use the crèche facility for their children while they participate in local training opportunities. The neighbouring community of Ballydesmond, which is still in the process of completing its crèche, has suddenly realised that its project will not be viable in the second and third year, unless staffing grants are increased substantially. These projects are a major undertaking for any community. Only really strong communities with plenty of dedicated voluntary workers can even attempt such undertakings. If the establishment of child care facilities fails due to the lack of funding, the whole voluntary ethos in the area will be undermined.</P>
    <P>The Minister and his Department must act immediately, otherwise we will have empty crèches in our towns and totally demoralised community groups. If the Minister fails to act it will have far-reaching effects.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatTheCope" hpid="Mr. Gallagher Mr. Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>As Deputy Murphy will be aware, the Equal Opportunities Childcare Programme 2000-2006 is making &euro;436.7 million available in funding across a range of measures to help to address the child care needs of parents who are in employment, education or training. The services which are being developed address a great need to provide additional supports to parents who have previously found it difficult to access quality child care.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="152" />The Equal Opportunities Childcare Programme is a complex programme making a range of grants available to support and develop the child care sector. The programme includes the provision of capital grant assistance to create new child care places, in both community based, not for profit and private child care sectors, and capital grant assistance to enhance quality of existing child care places. Funding allocated to date will create 26,948 new child care places and support 25,919 existing places. The programme aims to put in place at least 28,500 new places by the end of 2006 and we are well on the way to achieving this target. Included in those total figures are approvals for the creation of 2,568 new places and the support of 2,906 existing places in Cork city and county.</P>
    <P>The crèche in Millstreet, to which the Deputy is referring, has received &euro;211,969 in capital grant assistance to enable it to build and equip its child care facility. The Equal Opportunities Childcare Programme also provides grant assistance towards the staffing costs of new and existing child care facilities in areas of disadvantage. This assistance has two purposes. First, it can help new child care facilities in their early days as they move towards full capacity and sustainability. Second, it can also help with sustainability in areas where the families availing of the crèche services cannot afford to pay the full level of fees due to economic disadvantage and, therefore, the crèche would not be economically viable were it not given assistance towards staffing costs.</P>
    <P>The child care facility in Millstreet initially received &euro;114,276 towards its staffing costs associated with its school age project in June 2001. This was supplemented by a further grant of &euro;54,724 in September 2002, over an 18 month period, bringing the total amount approved to the group, over a three year period, to &euro;169,000 in staffing grants. The management group submitted an appeal seeking additional funding earlier this year and I understand that this was given full consideration. However, on the basis of the information provided, the appraisal of the appeal suggested that the funding previously allocated was adequate to meet the level of services being provided and the numbers of children being catered for in the facility.</P>
    <P>The Equal Opportunities Childcare Programme is not intended, nor indeed is it resourced, to meet the full staffing cost of every child care facility but rather to contribute towards the staffing costs of the facility in accordance with need and the level of service being provided in each facility and the level of disadvantage among families availing of the service. It is a matter for the management group of each facility to put in place an appropriate fee structure so as to ensure sustainability of the project.</P>
    <P>Where there is significant disadvantage among the client group the Equal Opportunities Childcare Programme makes assistance available towards the staffing costs. It is recommended that the Millstreet group should consult with the Cork <Col N="153" />county child care committee and with the national voluntary child care organisations for advice on the sustainability of its project. The Equal Opportunities Childcare Programme is also funding the 33 city and county child care committees and seven national voluntary child care organisations to offer support to groups, such as Millstreet Community Council, to enable them to enhance the quality of their services.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatBreen" hpid="Mr. P. Breen Mr. P. Breen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Breen</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank you, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, for giving me the opportunity to raise this important issue in the House tonight, namely, the need for the Minister for the Environment and Local Government to provide adequate specific funding, other than European Union co-financed grants, for the Ennis inner relief road, which will cost more than &euro;3 million, to ease the congestion in the centre of the town.</P>
      <P>In 1985, the critical objective identified in the Ennis traffic plan, as compiled by consultants for the then Ennis Urban District Council, was the provision of a relief road to the east of Ennis town centre. This inner relief road would provide much improved access between the main northern and southern areas of the town centre from the east side, which would considerably ease town centre congestion. That was in 1985. Not only has the population of County Clare reached more than 103,000, Ennis has grown into a modern, urban town with a population of more than 20,000. In 1997, Ennis was selected as the information age town.</P>
      <P>Despite all these achievements, daily town congestion is part of everyday life. Vehicle numbers have increased on average by 75% throughout the town centre network. The town has also expanded significantly. A shopping centre has transformed the centre of Ennis and created part of the Ennis relief road. To the eastward side there has been large-scale commercial and other developments with auxiliary parking facilities.</P>
      <P>In 1997, a traffic review confirmed the recommendations of the 1985 plan and outlined the urgent need for the provision and completion of the eastern inner relief road. The road is also a major objective in the current Ennis and its environs development plan, as in the previous plan. The proposed project, when completed, will consist of four separate sections. Two of these have already been completed from internal council resources and developer-led construction, as I outlined earlier. Parts of the other two sections have been constructed and the compulsory purchase orders relating to the unconstructed elements have been approved. Arbitration procedures have progressed with a view to finalising compensation due to property owners, which includes residential and business interests, and final resolution in this regard is imminent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Given the nature of the existing land uses, costs associated with compensation to property owners will be far greater than actual construction costs. <Col N="154" />Taking this into account, the current estimated cost of the completion of the project as proposed is &euro;3.5 million. Given the locations of the interchanges and junctions between the proposed Ennis bypass and the existing roads infrastructure, specifically at the Tulla Road, the need for completion of the remaining section is critical. If the relief road is not available to absorb this additional pressure, some of the many positive impacts of the Ennis bypass will be counteracted to some degree by virtue of increased congestion on the eastern side of the town centre.</P>
    <P>In addition to improvements in traffic management and access which will result from the construction of the inner relief road, positive impacts will also result in the context of economic and social development due to the fact that the lands will be available for new development, which will reinforce the commercial centre of Ennis. The development of new commercial property is imperative in Ennis due to the dormitory nature of the town and the rapidly increasing residential population. In addition, the designation of Ennis as a hub town under the national spatial strategy reinforces the strategic importance of infrastructural development to accommodate future growth.</P>
    <P>To date, no funding has been forthcoming from any external source and the considerable progress made to date has been achieved by the council working in partnership with private developers and through expenditure of funding drawn from their own resources. Given the locations and envisaged costs associated with the outstanding elements to which I referred, its completion is outside the financial capacity of the council. Unless most of, if not all, the funding can be provided by the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, it will not proceed. EU co-financed grants have been applied for on many occasions, but the applications have been unsuccessful because the level of funding is small in the context of projects such as the inner relief road. The total allocation for County Clare in 2003 was &euro;2.4 million, and more than 20 applications had to be considered. Unless there is a substantial increase in the EU co-financed grants allocation for Clare, this approach is impractical.</P>
    <P>The other factor which prohibits the type of funding is the criteria associated with EU co-financed schemes which require that not more than 10% can be expended on land or on compensation to property owners. Much of the cost of the provision of the Ennis relief road will be absorbed through such land acquisition and compensation payments.</P>
    <P>It is critical that the Minister's Department provides adequate and realistic funding as compensation for land acquisition is approximately &euro;1.5 million and will have to be paid when the arbitration is decided. The survival of the commercial heart of the town of Ennis is at stake and I earnestly ask the Minister to consider this proposal in the interests of the town.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Pat Breen for raising the matter of the Ennis inner relief road project. Before dealing with the specific issue raised in respect of Clare County Council, I wish to outline the significant progress being made on the resourcing of non-national roads.</P>
      <P>On 27 January this year, a provision for non-national roads of &euro;433.986 million was announced for 2003. This is almost double the original 1997 allocation which was &euro;219 million and is just short of the record 2002 State grant payment of &euro;435.457 million, which was the highest ever State grant provision for non-national roads. In making this provision, the Government was again delivering, as it had in previous years, on its commitment to ensure an adequate financial base for the non-national roads programme. I look forward to a new record level of allocation to the non-national roads programme in 2004.</P>
      <P>Clare County Council's 2003 allocation of &euro;15,633,269 represents an increase of almost 75% on the 1997 outturn of just below &euro;9 million. In addition, Clare County Council has indicated that it intends to invest around &euro;4 million from its own resources on non-national roads this year. This, in effect, means that the council should have almost &euro;20 million available to it this year for non-national roads.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In July this year, my Department invited applications from local authorities for funding under the EU co-financed specific improvement grants <Col N="156" />scheme in 2004. This is the only grant category available for projects such as the Ennis inner relief road project. The selection and prioritisation of projects for funding under this scheme is a matter for Clare County Council in the first instance. The council's submission, which was received in my Department on 17 September this year, does not include an application for funding for the Ennis inner relief road. It remains open to the council to designate this scheme as a priority for funding under the EU co-financed scheme in 2004.</P>
    <P>If such an application is submitted by Clare County Council, it will, together with all other applications under the EU co-financed scheme of grants, be assessed in my Department having regard to compliance with eligibility criteria, the need to prioritise projects, competing demands from other local authorities and the funds available for the scheme in 2004. I intend to announce the 2004 non-national road grant allocations, including allocations under the EU co-financed improvement scheme, early in 2004.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social and Family Affairs (Mary Coughlan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 65 and 127 together.</P>
      <P>The back to education allowance is a second chance education opportunities programme designed to encourage and facilitate certain groups who are receiving social welfare payments to improve their skills and qualifications and, therefore, their prospects of returning to the active workforce.</P>
      <P>At present, to qualify for participation an applicant must be, among other things, in receipt of a relevant social welfare payment for at least six months. The qualifying period will be increased from six months to 15 months for new applicants intending to commence third level courses of study, with effect from September 2004.</P>
      <P>One of the factors that influenced me in taking this approach is the concern that some people are going on the live register for six months or so specifically to qualify for the back to education allowance. The scheme is intended primarily to assist people with a history of long-term dependence on social welfare. It is not intended to be a parallel third level grant scheme for people who were already planning to study at third level. It is estimated, based on the numbers who actually came forward for the scheme in the 2002-03 academic year, that up to 1,200 people who might otherwise have qualified for the scheme in 2004 will not now qualify.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="158" />The qualifying condition will remain at six months for people who wish to pursue a second level qualification. Time spent pursuing a second level course with the assistance of the back to education scheme will count towards meeting the 15 months qualification condition for the third level option.</P>
    <P>Participants already pursuing third level courses of study with the assistance of the scheme will not be affected by this change. The change affects people who have been unemployed for fewer than 15 months and who wish to start claiming the allowance in order to pursue a third level qualification.</P>
    <P>I have decided to restructure the back to education allowance in this way to ensure that this support retains its focus on the more vulnerable groups in our community, particularly people who do not have a second level education qualification and who are at risk of becoming dependent on social welfare payments on a long-term basis.</P>
    <P>I want to ensure that available resources are aimed at those in greatest need of an intervention to prevent them from drifting into long-term unemployment. This change recognises the more urgent need for intervention in the case of people who have not completed formal second level education.</P>
    <P>The total number of participants on the back to education allowance scheme for the 2002-03 academic year was 6,473 of whom 4,968 were pursuing third level courses of study. The remaining 1,505 participants pursued a second level course of study.</P>

      <P>Since the beginning of 2003 some &euro;2.1 million was spent by the Department on consultancy &ndash; covering a number of reviews and key strategic information technology projects. The major portion of expenditure in 2003 on consultancy was incurred on these projects.</P>
      <P>Overall expenditure on consultancy over the period 1 November 2002 to 31 October 2003 amounts to some &euro;6.4 million. Some &euro;3.5 million was incurred in the last two months of 2002 on three major customer service projects. This level of expenditure at the end of 2002 arose because of the phasing of major developments: in the service delivery modernisation programme, child benefit; Reach, the public service broker; and the General Register Office automation projects.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My Department is a major user of information and communications technology and, on an <Col N="159" />ongoing basis, would have a range of projects and initiatives under way to update and improve aspects of the system and the technology underpinning it. These projects and initiatives range from very large ones involving major expenditure and, usually, external consultancy assistance, to small projects which may be undertaken from time to time to improve aspects of the system, with or without external assistance.</P>
    <P>In relation to advertising, some &euro;965,000 was spent by the Department over the 12 month period 1 November 2002 to 31 October 2003. This expenditure covered advertising on a wide range of departmental schemes and services and a special public information campaign on the uses of the personal public service number, PPSN.

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social and Family Affairs (Mary Coughlan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 67 and 103 together.</P>
      <P>Section 12 of the Pensions Act 1990 provides that the Pensions Board may, subject to my approval, engage such consultants or advisers as it may consider necessary for the performance of its functions. There is a delegated authority in force which allows the Pensions Board to appoint consultants without prior approval where the value of the contract does not exceed &euro;31,740.</P>
      <P>The operation of the Pensions Board is generally financed through fee income received from registered pension schemes and providers of personal retirement savings accounts. Accordingly, the Department would not normally fund the cost of consultancy assignments requested by the Pensions Board unless the board was specifically asked to undertake the work by the Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="160" />In the current year I requested the Pensions Board to undertake a national pensions awareness campaign to promote the need for people to provide themselves with supplementary pensions cover. My Department is also providing a temporary recoverable subvention to the Pensions Board as a contribution to cover development, start up and administration costs associated with personal retirement savings accounts until the fee income associated with these new products reaches an adequate level.</P>
    <P>The total value of consultancy costs paid by the Department in 2003 in respect of work done in the areas outlined amounted to &euro;126,256 together with a residual payment of &euro;13,902 in respect of a report on income continuance plans commissioned by the Pensions Board on behalf of the Department.</P>
    <P>Except in exceptional circumstances all consultancy assignments are subject to competitive tendering. In the limited cases which have not involved tendering I am satisfied that the award of assignments was in line with public sector tendering procedures.</P>

      <Quest>if all those living alone in receipt of invalidity pension or disability allowance were directly informed of their entitlement to claim this allowance when it came into effect in April 2001; and the number of persons who availed of it.</Quest>

      <P>The living alone allowance scheme was extended from 4 April 2001 to persons who were receiving disability allowance, invalidity pension, blind person's pension or unemployability supplement. A number of measures were undertaken by my Department at that time to ensure that recipients of these payments were made aware of their potential entitlement to this allowance. The extension of the allowance to these recipients was advertised in all provincial, national, daily and Sunday newspapers. A freefone number was also provided, whereby customers could obtain further information concerning the allowance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>All disability allowance recipients who were paid through the post office were notified of their potential entitlement to the allowance in their payable order books which issued to them on 4 April 2001. All invalidity pension recipients who were paid through the post office were notified of their potential entitlement to the allowance in their payable order books which issued to them on 2 August 2001. Recipients of disability allowance and invalidity pension who were paid by electronic fund transfer received a direct mailshot. This included details on the qualifying conditions for the allowance and advice on how to apply. Details of all social welfare budget <Col N="161" />changes, including those relating to the living alone allowance, were advertised on Aertel.</P>
    <P>From 4 April 2001 all new applications for disability allowance and invalidity pension are examined to have their entitlement to living alone allowance assessed in conjunction with their primary claim entitlement. All application forms for these payments currently include an application for living alone allowance. There are 7,843 recipients of invalidity pension who are in receipt of living alone allowance and 9,900 recipients of disability allowance.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that the measures put in place when the scheme was extended to recipients of long-term disability payments were adequate to ensure that eligible persons were made aware of their possible entitlement to living alone allowance.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social and Family Affairs (Mary Coughlan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 69, 79, 105 and 337 to 345, inclusive, together.</P>
      <P>Recipients of social welfare or health board payments who have been prescribed a special diet as a result of a specified medical condition and whose means are insufficient to meet their food needs may qualify for a diet supplement under the supplementary welfare allowance scheme. Entitlement to a diet supplement is determined by the health boards in accordance with the legislative provisions that specify the type of diets which qualify for a supplement and the means test which must be applied. My Department does not hold information on the medical condition or the special dietary needs of individuals. The amount of supplement payable depends on which of two categories of diet has been prescribed by the applicant's medical adviser as well as the age of the person and the income of the individual and his or her dependants.</P>
      <P>The current basis for calculating the amount of supplement payable was put in place in 1996. In general, the amount of supplement is either &euro;34.28 for lower cost diets or &euro;44.44 for higher cost diets less one third of the applicant's income at 1996 rates or one sixth in the case of couples. In the case of children under the age of 18 there is a standard rate of &euro;10.20 per week for a higher cost diet and &euro;6.40 per week for a lower cost diet.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In 1996, the need for a diet supplement was based on the premise that the cost of special diets exceeded one third of the value of social welfare payments. It was considered that it would not be reasonable to expect people dependent on social welfare to meet those extra costs from their social welfare payments. Since 1996, means assessments for diet supplement have not taken into account the annual increases in social welfare rates or <Col N="163" />changes in the cost of special diets and neither have the rates of diet supplement payment changed. During this period, increases in social welfare payments have ranged from 57% to 71% for the majority of persons in receipt of diet supplement while the cost of food, according to the consumer price index, has risen by 28%. Consequently, the gap that the diet supplement was intended to address has narrowed over time.</P>
    <P>I propose to amend the regulations governing diet supplements to take account of both food inflation since 1996 and increases in social welfare rates of payment. In the case of applicants for diet supplement from 1 January 2004, the amount of supplement payable will be based on the revised diet costs less one third of the applicant's income or one sixth in the case of a couple. Future budgetary increases will be assessable with the consequence that over a number of years, the amount of diet supplement payable will be adjusted as social welfare rates increase. A person in receipt of a diet supplement prior to the introduction of the revised regulations will continue to receive the current rate of supplement until such time as there is a change in his or her circumstances that would warrant a review of the supplement.</P>
    <P>I hope it is now clear that I have not decided to terminate diet supplement payments. I have simply re-established the means test as it was envisaged in 1996 for new applicants for diet supplements from 1 January 2004. The amount of supplement payable to these new applicants will in future reflect the changes in social welfare rates and as such will be reduced over a number of years. The 13,542 people currently in receipt of a diet supplement, whose average payment is &euro;10.22 per week, will retain their existing rate of payment until such time as there is a change in their circumstances that warrants a review of the supplement.</P>

      <P>The report to which the Deputy refers, Waste Collection Charges and Low-Income Households was prepared by the Combat Poverty Agency at the request of the National Advisory Committee of the Money Advice and Budgeting Service, MABS. The committee was concerned about the impact of waste charges on low-income households.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The report highlights the complexity of the issue, which is characterised by significant local variation as regards waste collection methods, charges, payment arrangements and financial impact on households. This variation is reflected <Col N="164" />in the fact, noted in the report, that some MABS offices identified waste charges as an issue for their clients while others did not. With a view to having a uniform approach to waiver arrangements, the report recommends, among other things, that guidelines for such a national waiver scheme might be drawn up by the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government in consultation with the MABS, Combat Poverty Agency, my Department and community and voluntary sector interests. It also advocates more widespread application of payment mechanisms that reflect the budgeting patterns of-low income households and the enhancement of recycling facilities for those in low-income households. My Department is examining the report at present and will consider, in consultation with the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, the desirability and feasibility of implementing its recommendations.</P>

    <P>The focus of the Christmas bonus has always been on long-term welfare payment recipients, who rely on the social welfare system for financial support over long periods. Recipients of short-term payments, which include short-term unemployment payments, disability benefit, maternity benefit, carer's benefit, family income supplement and supplementary welfare allowance do not, therefore, qualify for the bonus payment. Approximately 196,950 people receive these short-term weekly payments, and the estimated cost of extending entitlement to the bonus to this category is &euro;27.2 million.</P>

      <P>The means test under the one-parent family payment scheme is designed to encourage those in receipt of the payment to avail of opportunities to take up employment and to ensure that the scheme is not an obstacle in that regard. This approach involves supports for lone parents in their efforts to find work or participate in training and education schemes and other programmes to that end, including the full range of employment support schemes operated by my Department. Lone parents are further encouraged to take up work through the earnings disregards which are a feature of the one-parent family payment scheme. These disregards are designed to recognise the particular expenses, which a lone parent may face in taking up employment and training opportunities, and to encourage him or her to consider employment as an alternative to long-term welfare dependency. There are no similar disregards applicable in other means-tested schemes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The operation of the earnings disregard means that a lone parent may earn up to &euro;293 per week and still retain entitlement to some level of pay<Col N="166" />ment. Transitional arrangements have also applied whereby a lone parent who exceeds the earning threshold retained 50% of his or her previous payment for a further 12 months. The latest figures available at the end of October 2003 indicate that there were 91,945 unmarried, separated or deserted lone parents receiving the one-parent family payment or a payment under a corresponding scheme. Of these, 628 were on a transitional half rate payment.</P>
    <P>The Abridged Estimates provide for the ending of the transitional payment that applies under the scheme. The lone parents concerned will, however, be eligible for the family income supplement. This will have the effect of treating lone parents on low income in the same way as other workers on low earnings with child dependants. The family income supplement, in providing cash support for employees with families on low earnings, preserves the incentive to remain in employment in circumstances where the employee might only be marginally better off than if she or he were claiming other social welfare payments.</P>
    <P>I am confident that this scheme will effectively serve the same purpose for lone parents in employment as it does for other workers on low earnings with families. More generally, the issue of the effective use of resources in providing child income support is being examined under the special initiative on ending child poverty under Sustaining Progress. The outcome and recommendations will be fully considered in the context of further policy development in this important area.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social and Family Affairs (Mary Coughlan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 73 and 124 together.</P>
      <P>My Department is a customer-centred organisation. The Department's modernisation and change agenda is designed to ensure that the services which this Department gives to people are improved and developed and that its staff are supported and equipped in the delivery of this objective. The Sustaining Progress agreement has provided the opportunity to build on and accelerate the programme of change on which the Department is engaged.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="167" />The Department's modernisation action plan is a detailed document containing some 100 commitments that make up a challenging agenda for the Department over the course of Sustaining Progress. This is available on the website of the Department of Finance and I am also arranging for copies to be sent to the Deputies.</P>
    <P>While the plan must be considered in its totality, five key priority areas have been identified. These involve the increased use of new technology to deliver better service, greater flexibility in the way services are delivered, implementation of a new control programme, a range of changes in human resources, in particular in the area of promotions and development of better financial management and information systems.</P>
    <P>Priorities under the heading of new technology include the development of a new generation of IT systems to facilitate better customer service and to support the Government's strategy for electronic service delivery generally. Projects such as the civil registration modernisation programme, the public service broker, and the public service identity project are linked with this agenda.</P>
    <P>In the area of flexible delivery of service, the key element is the phased localisation of the one-parent family payment scheme. In effect, this means that the administration of the scheme will move from one central office to the Department's local office network. This initiative will result in a better, more personalised service to the customer, faster decision-making, readier access to local support programmes and enhanced control measures.</P>
    <P>The third priority is control. The Department's existing control strategy entails the use of a mix of measures to minimise risks of fraud and eliminate incorrect payments. Implementation of the new control strategy, involving greater emphasis on risk assessment and risk management and a more focused control approach will provide for a more effective and efficient allocation of resources in this area.</P>
    <P>A number of developments in the Department's human resources strategy are reflected in the action plan. Promotion policy is one of the main elements of this strategy. As indicated in the plan, the aim is to move towards a higher proportion of competition-based promotions and the adoption of best practice in this regard.</P>
    <P>In the area of financial management the Civil Service management information framework, MIF, project aims at ensuring better decision-making about allocation of resources, better management of resources once allocated and greater transparency and accountability for the use of resources. My Department has a detailed programme of activity scheduled in this area over the course of the period covered by Sustaining Progress.</P>
    <P>The overall aim of the action plan is to increase the efficiency and effectiveness of the Department in terms of service delivery and the internal <Col N="168" />management processes that support this delivery. As required under the Sustaining Progress agreement, my Department recently submitted its first progress report on the action plan to the Civil Service performance verification group. I am confident that the Department will continue to deliver on the commitments contained in the plan and will maintain its leading role in the development of better customer service generally.</P>

      <Quest>the reasons behind her decision to change the SWA rent supplement allowance which now requires an applicant to be renting for a period of six months before he or she can be considered for this emergency payment; if she now expects people to become homeless in order to be eligible for the SWA rent supplement; and if she will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social and Family Affairs (Mary Coughlan)</NameTxt>
      <P>Under the terms of the supplementary welfare allowance scheme, which is administered on behalf of my Department by the health boards, payment of a weekly or monthly supplement may be made in respect of rent to eligible people in the State whose means are insufficient to meet their needs after they pay their rent. The purpose of the supplementary welfare allowance scheme is to deal with emergencies and short-term needs that arise when a person suffers a change in circumstances, for example when a tenant becomes unemployed and can no longer afford their rent.</P>
      <P>Rent supplements were never intended to meet a persons long-term housing needs. The scheme is not a housing programme but, in practice, has become such over the years. It does not make sense to have two parallel but entirely separate programmes one operated by the housing authorities and the other by the health boards. Furthermore, the rent supplement scheme does not give a good long-term outcome to the individual. They have limited security of tenure, accommodation standards can sometimes be poor and they must remain on social welfare in order to retain their accommodation. Neither does the scheme give a good outcome to the State, as it provides poor long-term value for money and, in effect, bypasses the priorities set by the local authorities in their housing programmes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is the reason I have taken a number of initiatives in this area. First, rent supplement will be payable only where, at the time of application for a rent supplement, the person has been in rented accommodation for a period of six months. Provision will, however, be made for cases where a housing authority designates that a person is homeless or a person has been identified by a housing authority as having a housing need which cannot be met by the housing authority or by a voluntary housing organisation or by the person <Col N="169" />concerned. This will help re-focus the rent supplement scheme on its original objective of short-term support. Second, rent supplement claimants will be referred to a housing authority for an assessment of their housing need in a more systematic manner. This will provide the housing authority with a more accurate picture of the long-term housing needs of those living in its area.</P>
    <P>I should also mention that, following a meeting which I had with the chief executive officers of the health boards earlier this year four pilot projects were set up in Donegal, Fingal, Cork and Offaly to address this issue. The relevant officials from the health board, the local authority and my own Department's local office meet to make practical progress in meeting the needs of people relying on rent supplement on a long-term basis.</P>
    <P>Discussions between my Department and the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government on the future of rent assistance are well advanced and I expect that concrete, positive proposals will be agreed shortly which will determine the appropriate roles of local authorities and my Department in respect of people on rent supplement with long-term housing needs. In the meantime, I recognise that there will be situations where rent supplement is the only viable solution available to meet the needs of some people who have not been renting for six months. Rent supplement will continue to be available to people with housing needs whose safety or well-being is at risk, such as people with disabilities, the elderly or those experiencing severe social problems. Full and sympathetic consideration will be given to the needs of these people in implementing the new rent arrangements, with the involvement of the housing authorities.</P>

      <P>I have been made aware of the figures released by the Society of St. Vincent de Paul which show that there has been a significant increase in the numbers of people making contact with the society. I am deeply conscious of the invaluable contribution which the society makes in alleviating the effects of poverty on the most vulnerable members of Irish society and the close contact society members maintain with the least well-off.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is not clear from the society's statements what specifically occasioned this increase in the <Col N="170" />demand for its services, as the steady improvement in payment levels and in the services for the less well-off have been maintained. I understand that the society is making available in its annual report a more complete analysis of calls to the society and I will be interested to note to what the calls specifically relate. The policies pursued by the Government over recent years in combating unemployment and in reducing the level of consistent poverty have brought about a significant improvement, in real terms, in the situation of people on lower incomes.</P>
    <P>The Government's ongoing priorities in this regard are reflected in the approach set out in the revised national anti-poverty strategy, NAPS, published in February 2002, and in the national action plan against poverty and social exclusion launched in July of this year. These contain ambitious targets across the range of policy areas which impact on poverty and social exclusion &ndash; including social welfare payments, education, health, employment, and housing and accommodation. Notably, they include a key target of raising the lowest social welfare rate to &euro;150 in 2002 terms by 2007.</P>
    <P>I believe that the delivery of the targets contained in the revised national anti-poverty strategy, NAPS, and in the national action plan against poverty and social exclusion, taken with the achievements to date in that regard, will help to create a more just and inclusive society. I am also concerned to ensure that the resources available are used in the most effective way to address the real needs of people and I will take on board any views of organisations such as the society, which deal with people in need on an ongoing basis, in formulating policies for the future development of the social welfare system.</P>

      <Quest>the reason the allocation in her Department's Estimates for 2004 for employment support services has been reduced by over ?40 million or 19%; the way in which it is intended to achieve this reduction; and if she will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <P>My Department's employment support services are designed to assist the unemployed, lone parents and persons with disabilities to return to work. They include the back to work allowance scheme, back to education allowance scheme and a range of other supports.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As part of the process of managing and developing the social welfare system, my Department continuously reviews the operation of its spending programmes to ensure that resources are best directed at those in need and that the objectives of schemes still continue to be relevant. As part of this process, the back to education scheme was considered in the context of the improved economic situation since the scheme <Col N="171" />was introduced. It is necessary to ensure that the scheme is targeted at cases of labour market disadvantage. By refocusing the scheme's third level option to those furthest away from labour market, that is, 15 months unemployed, and by maintaining the second level option for those who are six months unemployed, we have sought to keep the scheme relevant to current labour market conditions.</P>
    <P>Similarly, the back to work allowance scheme was reviewed last year following on from an independent evaluation of the scheme. It found that a significant proportion of applicants would have progressed regardless of whether an allowance was available. It recommended that participation levels be reduced and the scheme refocused on the very long-term unemployed. Due to the continued decline in demand for the scheme and in light of the above recommendations the qualifying period for participation on the scheme was extended from 15 months to five years for persons in receipt of an unemployment payment from January 2003. Other relevant qualifying social welfare payments were not affected by the change.</P>
    <P>The reduction of 29% in the 2004 Abridged, or pre-budget, Estimate for employment support services also reflects the fact that the number of recipients on back to work allowance in 2003 is lower than had been expected. The 2003 Estimate, to which the 2004 Estimate is compared in the Abridged Estimates volume, provided for an average of 24,530 recipients in the year. The number of persons in receipt of back to work allowance currently stands at 17,824. The 2004 Estimate for back to work allowance provides for the number of persons who are expected to participate on the scheme based on current qualifying conditions. The number is 14,000 which is almost 4,000 lower than the number at present. This further reduction reflects the fact that the number of long-term unemployed has fallen significantly. As a consequence, there are fewer people who need the service and the numbers participating on the scheme have been declining over recent years. It also reflects the change made to the scheme in January 2003.</P>
    <P>The 2004 Abridged Estimate also reflects the increase in the qualifying period for back to education allowance from six months to 15 months in respect of the third level option. It is important that my Department's employment support services retain their relevance to current employment and economic conditions and continue to focus on the most vulnerable groups. I will continue to monitor the schemes on an ongoing basis.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions No. 77 and 351 together.</P>
      <P>Subject to certain conditions, any person in the State whose means are insufficient to meet his or her basic needs and the needs of any adult or child dependant may be entitled to assistance under the terms of the supplementary welfare allowance scheme which is administered on behalf of my Department by the health boards. The objective of the supplementary welfare allowance scheme is to meet immediate, short-term income maintenance needs. The scheme is not intended to be a long-term solution in any individual case.</P>
      <P>The crèche supplement was introduced with the intention of providing assistance to the parent of a child who is in need of a short-term emergency support. This could arise, for example, to assist a parent who would not otherwise be able to avail of particular supports such as counselling services or addiction treatment programmes.</P>
      <P>At 21 November 2003 there were 1,738 crèche supplements in payment. The current figure represents an increase of almost 150% in less than three years from January 2001 when there were approximately 700 people in receipt of a crèche supplement. The main categories of recipients of crèche supplements are one parent families and the unemployed. The cost of these payments will be some &euro;2.1 million in 2003. Payment of crèche supplements are increasingly being made for reasons which are clearly outside the scope of the original intentions of the scheme.</P>
      <P>An analysis of crèche supplements shows that some 35% of supplements have been in payment for over eight months, 20% of supplements for over one year and approximately 10% for more than two years. The fact that the supplements are in payment for long durations in many cases indicates that they have become a long-term child care support rather than the short-term social support for which they were intended. In effect long-term child care needs are now being provided through a short-term emergency provision scheme. At present many of the groups involved in providing early education initiatives receive the bulk of their funding from the health boards. While the total amount spent on crèche supplements is significant the actual amounts contributed in individual cases is relatively small and administratively inefficient. My Department will be discussing this matter with the health boards concerned to ensure that appropriate alternative measures are put in place to address the needs of families with children in this regard.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Question Nos. 78 and 128 together.</P>
      <P>Family income supplement, FIS, is designed to provide cash support for employees on low earnings with families, thereby protecting the incentive to remain in employment. The estimated average number of families in receipt of FIS in 2003 is 12,200. The 2004 Abridged, or pre-budget, Estimate for FIS is &euro;45.9 million. This sum provides for an average of 12,600 recipients at current weekly income thresholds, an increase of 400 compared to the 2003 average.</P>
      <P>The reduction of 4% in the 2004 FIS Estimate against the 2003 Estimate reflects the fact that the number of recipients in 2003 is lower than had been projected a year earlier when the 2003 Estimates were being drawn up. The 2003 Estimate, to which the 2004 Estimate is compared in the Abridged Estimates volume, had provided for a projected increase of 1,100 in the year to reflect an increase of &euro;17 in income thresholds for FIS qualification from January 2003. However, the net increase in numbers was considerably less, resulting in an underspend against the projection.</P>
      <P>The arrangements whereby lone parents could retain 50% of their previous entitlement for a period of 12 months where earnings exceed the &euro;293 threshold was originally intended to ease the move from social welfare to employment by cushioning the loss of the social welfare payment. The family income supplement scheme also achieves this in respect of low-income families with children, and it is considered to be the more appropriate support in such circumstances. It is estimated that this will affect 350 recipients of one-parent family payment in 2004. The provision for increased FIS numbers in 2004 will therefore facilitate this change.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This policy change is also consistent with the conclusions of the recent OECD survey, which stated that the existing system of earnings disregards serves largely to encourage lone parents to top-up income from one-parent family payment with small earnings rather than provide an incentive to increase earnings. The study also suggested that the family income supplement could be better promoted as a tool for providing financial incentives for lone parents to enter employ<Col N="174" />ment. It should be noted that the Estimates do not include any provision for measures which may be announced tomorrow in the budget.</P>

      <P>Details of the total amounts paid in unemployment assistance and unemployment benefit are contained in a tabular statement which I am making available to the Deputy. This table shows that the amount spent on unemployment assistance fell each year from 1998, when it amounted to &euro;770 million, to a figure of &euro;430 million in 2001. This reflects the fact that the average live register was reducing in this period, when it dropped from a weekly average of 228,278 in 1998 to a figure of 141,765 in 2001.</P>
      <P>The number of claimants in receipt of unemployment assistance also dropped from 128,986 at the end of December 1998 to 78,897 at the end of December 2001 &ndash; a reduction of 64%. Expenditure on unemployment benefit also fell, but less markedly in the period 1998 to 2001, in line with the fact that the number of claimants declined by 6% or 3,700 persons. The increase in the live register during 2002 from 152,406 at the end of 2001 to 166,142 at the end of December 2002 was a significant factor in the increase in expenditure for unemployment benefit and assistance in 2002. The estimated outturn for unemployment assistance for 2003 is &euro;572 million and for unemployment benefit is &euro;483 million.</P>

      <Quest>the proportion of GDP spent on social protection and the expected figure for 2004; if her attention has been drawn to figures showing that Ireland spends the lowest proportion of GDP on social protection in the EU; if the Government intends to raise this level to the European average; and if she will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <P>EUROSTAT, the statistical office of the EU, publishes comparisons of social protection expenditure as a percentage of GDP across the EU. This encompasses not only social welfare expenditure but also expenditure in other areas such as health care, social housing, employment <Col N="175" />support programmes and other social exclusion programme.</P>
      <P>The latest EUROSTAT figures on social protection expenditure were released in February 2003 and deal with developments up to and including 2000. These figures show that in 2000, Ireland spent 14.1% of its GDP on social protection expenditure. This figure does not take into account the developments in social protection expenditure over the last two years. No comparable figures are available in 2003.</P>
      <P>When interpreting comparative data on social welfare budgets, it is important to remember that the nature and scope of social welfare systems of EU member states vary greatly. It is also the case that gross expenditure measures can distort the real picture, as they do not take account of social charges or taxes which may be levied on benefits, nor do they include transfers made by means of tax concessions, as opposed to direct cash payments.</P>
      <P>The level of expenditure is also significantly influenced by the age profile of the population. Currently Ireland, with one of the youngest populations in the EU, needs to spend less on pensions and health care and care of the elderly than most other member states. The extent to which the State directly provides supplementary pensions and child care are also important factors.</P>
      <P>In addition, social protection expenditure as a percentage of GDP is significantly influenced by the pace of economic growth and the level of unemployment. For example, in the three year period 1990 to 1993 overall EU social protection expenditure as a percentage of GDP rose on average by over 3% from 25.5% to 28.8%, as a result of the slower rate of economic growth and rising unemployment during that period. Conversely, over the five-year period 1994 to 1998 the percentage declined slightly to 27.7%, due to renewed economic growth and a decline in unemployment during that period.</P>
      <P>For Ireland in 1990, expenditure on social protection as a percentage of GDP was 18.4%. This rose to 20.2% in 1993, and then declined to 14.7% in 2000. These changes mirrored the developments just described in other EU countries, except that the level of economic growth and the decline in unemployment were much greater in Ireland than in most other EU countries. Annual rates of growth ranged from 8% to 11% in the period 1994 to 2000, compared to an average of 2.5% in the EU, while levels of unemployment declined from 14.3% to less than 4% over the same period.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under this Government there have been sustained and substantial increases in social protection expenditure. The EUROSTAT report on social protection states that the increase in real terms expenditure on social protection in Ireland over the period 1993 to 1999 was &ldquo;well above the average&rdquo;. EUROSTAT figures show a 21.4% increase in the <i>per capita</i> expenditure on social protection in the period 1995 to 2000, compared <Col N="176" />with an EU average of 8.7%, and over the longer period of 1990 to 1999, an increase of 50% in real terms, compared with an EU average of 24%. There is scope for further improvements in Ireland's social protection infrastructure and the Government will continue to address this, guided by the national anti-poverty strategy, while at the same time continuing to take measures to maintain economic growth and competitiveness.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 83, 93 and 112 together.</P>
      <P>At the end of December 2002, there were 188,350 people receiving an old age contributory or retirement pension. A recent actuarial review of the social insurance fund, undertaken on behalf of my Department, estimated that the number of recipients of these pensions will increase to 255,000 by 2011 and to 321,000 by 2016. The increase will be balanced, to some extent, by a reduction in the number of people receiving the old age non-contributory pension. The numbers receiving this pension have declined by more than 20% in the past ten years which reflects improved social insurance coverage and increased labour force participation, particularly among women.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In common with other European countries, the population of Ireland is ageing as a result of a combination of increasing life expectancy and a declining birth rate. The decline in the birth rate is relatively recent and this, coupled with the effects of high emigration for much of the period up to the 1990s, has resulted in Ireland having the lowest proportion of older people in the EU &ndash; 11.2% aged 65 and over, as compared to the current EU average of 16.1%. The proportion of older people in Ireland will remain at much the <Col N="177" />same level for the next ten years after which it is projected to increase rapidly to 15% in 2021, 19% in 2031 and 28% in 2056. A similar situation exists in relation to the numbers at work relative to the number of pensioners.</P>
    <P>Given that the situation will remain relatively stable for the next ten years or so, no particular measures are planned in that timescale. However, the Government has a clear strategy in place to meet these challenges which includes the national pensions reserve fund, now standing at &euro;8.4 billion. The Government aims to increase private pensions coverage among the workforce from a current level of 50% to 70% partly through personal retirement savings accounts PRSAs and a general increase in the awareness of the need for having adequate pensions provision.</P>
    <P>A joint EU Commission and Council report on national pensions strategies published earlier this year considered that Ireland has made good progress in ensuring the financial sustainability of the pension system while at the same time making provisions for increasing the adequacy of pensions. There is a target rate of &euro;200 per week for the basic social welfare rate to be achieved by 2007.</P>
    <P>The Government has no plans to increase retirement age as suggested by the Society of Actuaries. However, this is not to say that the very important role which increased workforce participation can play in ensuring sustainability is not recognised. The root of the challenge facing pension systems is a reduction in the active workforce and an increase in the number of pensioners. It is important that we encourage and facilitate those who wish to extend their working lives after normal pension age. Pensions will remain an important issue for this country, and the EU as a whole, and it will be necessary to monitor closely the situation on an ongoing basis in the years ahead.</P>

      <Quest>if she has taken account of the likely hardship arising from recently announced curtailments of the rent allowance, having particular regard to the already serious housing crisis; if her attention has been drawn to the fact that this is likely to lead to even greater homelessness than already exists; and if she will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 84, 85, 100 and 113 together.</P>
      <P>Under the terms of the supplementary welfare allowance scheme, which is administered on behalf of my Department by the health boards, payment of a weekly or monthly supplement may be made in respect of rent to eligible people in the State whose means are insufficient to meet their needs after they pay their rent including the provision that a person must have been renting for six months.</P>
      <P>As Deputies will be aware, I announced a number of measures in relation to the rent supplement scheme when the 2004 Estimates were published. When implementing the new measures particular care will be taken to ensure that the interests of vulnerable groups, such as the homeless, the elderly and people with disabilities, are fully protected. Health boards will retain the discretion to make exceptions in individual cases.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These measures will be implemented in the context of a greater role for local authorities in meeting the long-term housing needs of people who currently rely on rent supplement, particularly the vulnerable groups mentioned. Discussions in that regard between the relevant Departments are well advanced. A number of projects are under way, involving close co-operation between the local authority, the health board and the Department of Social and Family Affairs at local level, with a view to achieving a better outcome for rent supplement recipients. There are also ongoing discussions between officials in my Department and officials from the Departments of Environment, Heritage and Local Government and Finance, with a view to <Col N="179" />determining the appropriate roles into the future of local authorities and my Department in relation to support for people on rent supplements with long-term housing needs.</P>
    <P>The Government has responded actively to the increased level of housing need by expanding social and affordable housing output very significantly. In 2004, despite the pressure on the public finances the total housing provision has again increased by 5.5% to &euro;1.885 billion. This will allow progress to be consolidated, with an increase in the level of housing starts by local authorities by comparison with this year to about 5,000 units. Funding available to the voluntary and co-operative housing sector will allow the sector to continue to make a very valuable contribution in housing those with social and special housing needs.</P>
    <P>Under the Government's homeless strategy, local action plans to tackle homelessness are being implemented under the aegis of the local homeless fora. Significant progress is being made in meeting the accommodation and care needs of homeless persons. Substantial additional funding has been made available to support the implementation of the homeless strategies. Current funding for accommodation-related homeless services by local authorities has increased substantially from &euro;12.6 million in 2000 to &euro;50 million this year. Capital funding for the direct provision by local authorities of accommodation for homeless persons is being doubled from &euro;25.4 million to &euro;50.8 million over the period 2001 to 2005. Funding continues to be made available to the voluntary sector for the provision of accommodation for homeless persons under the Department of Environment, Heritage and Local Government's capital assistance scheme.</P>
    <P>The fact is that people with a long-term housing need require a housing solution, not a weekly top-up to their social welfare payment. In the future, local authorities will play a greater role in meeting the housing needs of the people concerned and the rent supplement scheme will be re-focused on its original aim of meeting short-term income needs.</P>

      <P>The Abridged Estimates for social welfare provide a total of &euro;10.65 billion in 2004, even before the improvements to be announced in tomorrow's budget. The 2004 Estimates underline this Government's commitment to the elderly, to caring for our children, those less well off, those who are sick, unable or incapable of caring for themselves and those who find themselves unemployed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="180" />The Estimates represent year on year increases under this Government in social welfare spending, for example, in the year 2001 the social welfare budget totalled &euro;7.8 billion and in 2004 it will reach the highest ever spend of &euro;10.65 billion before the budget measures &ndash; an increase of over one third in three years. Spending has almost doubled since 1997. An estimated 970,000 people on average are expected to claim weekly social welfare payments next year and almost 1.5 million people, including dependants, will benefit from these payments.</P>
    <P>Some of the main areas of increased expenditure in the 2004 pre-budget Estimates are as follows: child benefit &ndash; plus &euro;70 million; old age contributory pension &ndash; plus &euro;51 million; widow and widower's contributory pension &ndash; plus &euro;23 million; disability allowance &ndash; plus &euro;40 million; and supplementary welfare allowance &ndash; plus &euro;72 million.</P>
    <P>The 2004 Estimates are framed to stay within the overall spending guidelines agreed by the Government, despite spending pressures arising from the underlying increases in numbers claiming various payments. In the context of the Estimates a number of schemes have been reviewed and adjusted to ensure better targeting of resources under the social welfare system and ensure that I am in a position to make adequate provision for those less well off, disadvantaged, ill or unemployed. Details of these measures were set out by me when the Estimates were published on 13 November.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that in the circumstances in which we find ourselves, the Estimates provision represents an appropriate response to the needs of customers in the light of the financial constraints facing the Government in 2004.</P>

      <Quest>if her attention has been drawn to the recent address by the director of the NESC in which he said that child poverty was not being adequately addressed; the specific steps she plans to take to deal with the problem of child poverty; and if she will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan" hpid="Mary Coughlan Mary Coughlan">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Social and Family Affairs (Mary Coughlan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand that the address referred to was based on the recent NESC strategy review, An Investment in Quality: Services, Inclusion and Enterprise, March 2003, where it is argued, <i>inter alia,</i> that ending child poverty is integral to achieving social and economic objectives. The council in that report has stated that the roots of many difficulties that people have in securing satisfactory employment and leading fulfilling lives as adults can be traced back to deprivation in their childhoods. I fully share the views of the council in this regard and tackling child poverty continues to be one of my top priorities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="181" />Strategies to address child poverty and the measures to give effect to them are set out in the revised national anti-poverty strategy, the national children's strategy and, more recently, in the national action plan against poverty and social exclusion. The overall target is to reduce the number of children who are consistently poor to below 2% by 2007 and, if possible, to eliminate consistent poverty among children by then. Significant progress has already been made towards achieving this target. For instance, the number of children who are consistently poor has more than halved in the four year period 1997 to 2001, falling from 15.3% in 1997 to 6.5% in 2001.</P>
    <P>One of the key means of achieving a reduction in child poverty lies in reducing the numbers of parents who are unemployed. The current low rates of unemployment, especially long-term unemployment, and the very significant increases in the numbers in employment, have undoubtedly contributed to the reduction in the level of consistent poverty among children. The aim must be to continue to maintain high levels of employment and to remove obstacles to taking up employment especially in the case of lone parents and parents with large families.</P>
    <P>The importance of tackling child poverty is reflected also in the fact that ending child poverty was identified as one of ten special initiatives to be undertaken under Sustaining Progress. The objectives which are being pursued under this initiative include better medical and health services within the community for young children and their parents; priority to early education and child care facilities for disadvantaged families; ensuring every child obtains a threshold of numeracy and literacy; accelerated provision of play environments for local communities; wider availability of parenting support services for families at risk; and maximising the efficacy of child income support arrangements.</P>
    <P>The application of different instruments and strategies for ending child poverty will be an integral part of how the Government, together with the social partners, will progress this key special initiative and a strong focus will be maintained on evaluating the instruments and strategies employed on the basis of their outcomes.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social and Family Affairs (Mary Coughlan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 89, 108, 123, 334 and 358 together.</P>
      <P>The free travel scheme is available to all people living in the State aged 66 years or over, to all carers in receipt of carer's allowance and to carers of people in receipt of constant attendance or prescribed relative's allowance. It is also available to certain people with disabilities and people who are in receipt of certain welfare type payments.</P>
      <P>The scheme provides free travel on the main public and private transport services for those eligible under the scheme. These include road, rail and ferry services provided by companies such as Bus Átha Cliath, Bus Éireann and Iarnród Éireann, as well as services provided by over 80 private transport operators. The vast majority of private contractors providing services under the scheme operate in rural areas. I am always willing to consider applications from licensed private transport operators who may wish to participate in the free travel scheme. However, while my Department pays transport providers to operate the free travel scheme, it is not in a position to provide transport services where none exist.</P>
      <P>Various alternatives to the existing system, including the use of vouchers, have been examined. A study published in 2000 under the Department's programme of expenditure reviews concluded that a voucher type system, which would be open to a wide range of transport providers including taxis and hackneys, would be extremely difficult to administer, open to abuse and unlikely to be sufficient to afford an acceptable amount of travel. This position remains unchanged.</P>
      <P>The issue of access to public transport is being addressed through the rural transport initiative, which is being managed by Area Development Management, ADM, on behalf of my colleague, the Minister for Transport.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="183" />The free travel scheme, in conjunction with the Northern Ireland concessionary travel scheme, also provides free travel on cross-Border routes for passholders of both jurisdictions. This scheme applies to cross-Border journeys and not to travel exclusively within either jurisdiction. The implementation of an all-Ireland free travel scheme for pensioners resident in all parts of this island will require detailed discussions and agreements with the relevant authorities and transport providers on both sides of the Border. Preparatory work on this proposal will commence shortly.</P>
    <P>With regard to time restrictions on the free travel scheme, these restrictions have been a feature since its inception. They do not, however, apply in the case of people with learning disabilities, people attending long-term rehabilitation courses or certain work experience programmes and certain other disabled or blind people. These people are issued with an unrestricted free travel pass which enables them to travel during the normally restricted travel times.</P>
    <P>The central issue in regard to time restrictions is that of capacity constraints and the pressure on the transport system from commuters travelling to and from work and school in the morning and evening. There are no peak time travel restrictions on DART, suburban rail services and on services provided by private transport operators in other parts of the country. Any general lifting of the time restrictions could cause capacity problems for transport operators. In exceptional or extenuating circumstances, however, where hospital appointments cannot be arranged out of peak travel time, my Department can issue a temporary unrestricted free travel pass. Requests for such passes, however, can only be considered on a case by case basis and passes are only granted in exceptional circumstances.</P>
    <P>Significant improvements have been made to the free schemes, including the free travel scheme, in recent budgets both in terms of the qualifying conditions and the coverage of the schemes. I will continue to review the operation of these schemes with a view to identifying the scope for further improvements as resources permit.</P>

      <P>The reduction of 6% in the Estimate for this scheme in the 2004 Abridged Estimates volume reflects mainly the fact that the number of recipients on this scheme is reducing. The reduction in numbers is due to an increasing number of persons qualifying for contributory pensions on reaching pension age. This is due to the easing of qualifying conditions for contributory <Col N="184" />pensions and to the extension of social insurance coverage to the self-employed and public servants.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan" hpid="Mary Coughlan Mary Coughlan">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Social and Family Affairs (Mary Coughlan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 91 and 101 together.</P>
      <P>The figures cited by the Deputies derive from the analysis undertaken by the Economic and Social Research Institute of the results of the living in Ireland surveys. They relate to the &ldquo;risk of poverty&rdquo; indicator which is among the common indicators adopted at EU level to facilitate cross-country analysis. The risk of poverty rate is defined by reference to an income threshold set at 60% of average median income, adjusted for family size and composition using equivalence scales.</P>
      <P>The analysis undertaken by the ESRI indicates that in 2001, some 21.9% of persons had incomes which fell below that threshold while for children, the number was 23.4%. This equates to some 280,000 children. These figures differ substantially from the consistent poverty measure which underpins the national anti-poverty strategy. In 2001, the level of consistent poverty amongst children had fallen to some 6.5% or around 74,000 children. Consistent poverty measures a combination of low incomes and enforced deprivation.</P>
      <P>Tackling child poverty continues to be one of my top priorities. Strategies to address child poverty and the measures to give effect to them are set out in the revised national anti-poverty strategy, the national children's strategy and, more recently, in the national action plan against poverty and social exclusion. The overall target is to reduce the number of children who are consistently poor to below 2% by 2007 and, if possible, to eliminate consistent poverty amongst children by then. Significant progress has already been made towards achieving this target. For instance, the number of children who are consistently poor has more than halved in the four year period 1997 to 2001, falling from 15.3% in 1997 to 6.5% in 2001.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the key means of achieving a reduction in child poverty lies in reducing the numbers of <Col N="185" />parents who are unemployed. The current low rates of unemployment, especially long-term unemployment, and the very significant increases in the numbers in employment, have undoubtedly contributed to the reduction in the level of consistent poverty among children. The aim must be to continue to maintain high levels of employment and to remove obstacles to taking up employment, especially in the case of lone parents and parents with large families.</P>
    <P>The importance of tackling child poverty is reflected also in the fact that ending child poverty was identified as one of ten special initiatives to be undertaken under Sustaining Progress. The policy approach underpinning this initiative includes better medical and health services within the community for young children and their parents; priority to early education and child care facilities for disadvantaged families; ensuring every child obtains a threshold of numeracy and literacy; accelerated provision of play environments for local communities; and wider availability of parenting support services for families at risk; maximising the efficacy of child income support arrangements. Specific measures under each of these headings will be undertaken over the period of Sustaining Progress and there will be a strong focus on evaluating the effectiveness of the various strategies which are adopted.</P>

      <P>My immediate legislative priorities in 2004 will be the introduction and passage of the Social Welfare (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill 2004, and the progression of the Civil Registration Bill 2003. In addition, to improve accessibility to the existing body of social welfare legislation, and to address my commitment to regulatory reform, I intend to bring forward a social welfare consolidation Bill. The Social Welfare (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill 2004 will provide for any amendments to the social welfare schemes consequent on the budget 2004 which are not provided for in the Bill. I will bring this Bill before the House immediately after the Budget Statement, and any additional measures requiring a basis in legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Civil Registration Bill 2003 was published last July, and I intend to progress it to enactment in 2004. The purpose of the Bill is to provide for the establishment of the civil registration service, an t-seirbhís um chlarú sibhialta. This will entail the re-organisation and modernisation of the system of registration of births, stillbirths, adoptions, marriages and deaths. The Bill further provides for the extension of the system to cover decrees of divorce and decrees of nullity of marriage granted by the courts. The new system is part of <Col N="186" />a joint project between my Department and the Department of Health and Children, to modernise and update the present system through, <i>inter alia,</i> the use of modern technology.</P>
    <P>The social welfare (consolidation) Bill 2004 will bring together the existing body of primary social welfare legislation in a single document. Currently, social welfare legislation is contained in the 1993 consolidation Act and some 15 subsequent amending Acts. The purpose of this initiative is to facilitate access to social welfare legislation and meet Government commitments to regulatory reform.</P>
    <P>It is also my intention to publish early in 2004 a Comhairle (amendment) Bill. The primary purpose of this legislation will be to give statutory effect to Comhairle in the context of the delivery of the Government's commitments in relation to services for people with disabilities. In addition, I envisage introducing a social welfare Bill following the budget in December 2004 to provide for the implementation of budget increases in social welfare payments and any other changes which would be scheduled to take effect from January 2005.</P>

      <P>Strengthening families and the promotion of continuity and stability in family life, the welfare of children and support and affirmation for parents in carrying out their important child rearing responsibilities are core features of the Government's pro-families policy approach. The importance of accessible information about parenting issues and child development to strengthen the capacity of families in carrying out their essential functions of caring for children was highlighted by the commission on the family. Under my Department's families research programme a research project entitled Effective Parenting &ndash; An Exploration of Need was commissioned. The study involved 1,000 parents and 200 children and provides a comprehensive report of parents' perspectives on their parenting role and the support available to them within their own family network, in their community and through family support services. The report recommends that the Family Support Agency would have specific responsibility to provide appropriate general and targeted information on parenting issues.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The agency, which was established in May 2003, brings together a range of family and community supports and services which were <Col N="187" />developed by the Government over the past number of years. Its responsibilities include promoting and disseminating information about a range of issues affecting families. Key among these is the provision of information in relation to parenting. It is also charged with co-operating with other public authorities in providing information to assist persons in balancing their work and family responsibilities. I am currently examining the Family Support Agency's draft strategic plan which sets out its strategies for fulfilling the functions for which it has been given responsibility.</P>

      <P>According to statistics compiled by the Pensions Board, at the end of September 2003 a total of 6,707 individuals had commenced a personal retirement savings account. Employers who do not currently provide an occupational pension scheme for employees, or where they do provide a scheme but not all employees are eligible to join, must provide access to a standard PRSA for these employees. These provisions took legal effect from 15 September.</P>
      <P>Since the introduction of PRSAs earlier this year, providers have put a significant effort into signing up employers in advance of the September deadline. In these circumstances, the numbers who have already taken out a PRSA are encouraging. I understand that providers are now contacting employees in these firms to encourage them to commence saving for their retirement on foot of the contracts signed with employers. At the same time, the Pensions Board is running a national pensions awareness campaign on behalf of my Department to support and complement the effort being made by providers to promote PRSAs. The combined effect of the introduction of compulsory employer access, the efforts being made by providers to promote PRSAs and pension products generally, and the national pensions awareness campaign should see a significant increase in activity in this whole area over the coming months with many more workers signing up for PRSAs. The Department and the Pensions Board are monitoring progress closely and will continue to do so. The next PRSA returns will refer to the end December position and will be available in early February.</P>

      <P>My overall focus for the Irish Presidency will be to advance the EU social policy agenda generally and in particular, make progress in delivering on the ten-year goals set by the Lisbon European Council in 2000. One of the ambitious goals of the Lisbon agenda is to achieve greater social cohesion. In this regard the second round of national action plans for social inclusion are being evaluated at EU level. A joint Council-Commission inclusion report will be considered by the Council of Ministers in time for presentation to the European Council at its spring meeting during the Irish Presidency. We will also be involved in organising a conference of people experiencing poverty, the aim of which will be to further develop ways of promoting participation by and consultation with people experiencing poverty in the context of developing policies in this area.</P>
      <P>A key policy area is &ldquo;Making Work Pay&rdquo;, which explores how the interaction between social protection and working arrangements affects people's decisions to seek, take up, and remain in work. As our contribution to modernising social protection systems, this issue has been chosen as the main theme for discussion at the informal Council of Ministers for employment and social policy in January next.</P>
      <P>The issue of migration will also be a priority for my Department during the Irish Presidency. We will be hosting a conference in April the theme of which will be reconciling mobility and social inclusion and its main focus will be on the role of social and economic policies in achieving social inclusion for people moving within the EU. A major priority in this context for the Irish Presidency will be to work for adoption by the Council of Ministers and the European Parliament of the proposals to simplify and modernise the EU regulations on social security of migrant workers. This will provide migrant workers moving within the EU with a more streamlined set of rules aimed at protecting their social security and health care rights.</P>
      <P>Following the accession of the ten new member states in May next, it is our intention to host a special conference, in co-operation with the Hungarian Government, on the practical application of the new regulations for all member states, particularly the newly acceding states. In the area of family policy and to mark the tenth anniversary of the UN International Year of the Family, the Irish Presidency will be hosting a major international conference the title of which will be Families, Change and Social Policy in Europe. I am happy that these events represent a substantial programme of work and a significant contribution to moving forward the social policy agenda of the Community.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social and Family Affairs (Mary Coughlan)</NameTxt>
      <P>All decisions on claims are made by deciding officers and appeals officers who are statutorily appointed for that purpose. The reports of medical assessors represent an important part of the evidence on which determinations are made in cases relating to sickness or disablement issues. Where a person is dissatisfied with the decision of a deciding officer, he or she may appeal against it. In cases where there is a medical issue involved it is normal to seek the opinion of a medical assessor of my Department. Appeals officer determinations are not made solely on the basis of reports by medical assessors. The appeals officer will take account of all available evidence, including medical reports furnished by the appellant and evidence adduced at any oral hearing. The main categories of social welfare payments where the opinion of medical assessors may be sought are disability benefit, disability allowance, invalidity pension and disablement benefit.</P>
      <P>In disability benefit cases the question normally at issue is whether the person is incapable of work. When an appeal is received against a decision that a claimant is not incapable of work it is normally referred for a second opinion of a different medical assessor. If this assessor considers that the appellant is incapable the case is referred back to the deciding officer for a revised decision. In 2002, out of 3,432 disability benefit appeals disposed of, a total of 1,363, 40%, were the subjects of such revised decisions. A further 658, 20%, were allowed by the appeals officer.</P>
      <P>The issue in disability allowance cases is whether the claimant fulfils the statutory conditions, including the medical requirements, for receipt of payment. The appeals procedure in this scheme is similar to disability benefit. There were 1,827 appeals disposed of in this category during 2002, although this would include cases where the question at issue, that is the appellant's means, was non-medical. Figures for the outcomes of appeals in the category show that 558, 31%, were revised by deciding officers and 356, 19%, allowed by the appeals officer.</P>
      <P>The issue in regard to invalidity pension cases is whether a person is permanently incapable of work. Procedures for invalidity pensions appeals also involve a second examination by a medical assessor. The figures for 2002 show that there were 554 such appeals disposed of during that year. The number of these appeals where the deciding officer revised his-her original decision in the light of further evidence on appeal was 292, 53%. A further 103, 18%, were allowed by the appeals officer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="190" />The question in disablement benefit is usually the degree to which a person has suffered a loss of faculty arising from an accident at work. Most disablement benefit cases do not involve medical assessor examinations on appeal and very few would be disposed of by way of revised decision. The available statistics show that, out of 451 such appeals determined, 344, 76%, obtained favourable decisions.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that the social welfare appeals office offers an independent and effective recourse to persons who are dissatisfied with decisions given following examination by medical assessors and I have no plans to change this system at this time.</P>

      <P>The Abridged Estimates volume published on 13 November provided for a total allocation for social welfare spending in 2004 of &euro;10.65 billion. This represents an increase of &euro;358 million, or 3.5%, compared with the 2003 allocation. Furthermore, these estimates do not include any additional expenditure in respect of improvements to social welfare payments and programmes to be announced in the forthcoming budget. Taking that into account, I will have secured a considerable increase in the social welfare budget for 2004.</P>
      <P>This increase in social welfare spending underscores the Government's commitment to meeting the needs of the most vulnerable in our society. However, in the interests of good financial management and targeting of resources, we must continue to review social welfare spending programmes so as to ensure that programme objectives are still valid and are met in the most efficient and effective way. For this reason, I announced as part of the Estimates process a number of changes to the conditions underlying some schemes so as to ensure that they continue meet their objectives. In line with the normal confidentiality of discussions in relation to the estimates and budgetary processes, it would not be appropriate for me to give details of my discussions with the Minister for Finance or with my Cabinet colleagues on these matters.</P>

      <P>Families and family life are undergoing profound changes in Ireland. The main reasons include the increasing participation of women in employment, difficulties in reconciling work and family life, growing incidence of marital breakdown and lone parenthood, ageing of the population and the likely growth in the numbers of dependent elderly. I established the Family Support Agency in May of this year to draw together the main family-related programmes and services developed by the Government since 1997. Its functions include the provision of services in relation to family mediation, marriage and relationship counselling and family support services and programmes, including parenting, and support for the promotion and development of family and community services. I am currently examining the agency's draft strategic plan on implementing its functions which has recently been submitted to me.</P>
      <P>Against this background, I commenced a nationwide consultation on the future development of family policy in May this year, five years after publication of the report of the commission on the family. The fora are designed to provide me and my officials with an opportunity to hear the views of a cross-section of family members from different regions of the country and those who work with them, including public representatives. Their views are being sought on the main challenges that confront families today, the effectiveness of Government policies and programmes in supporting families to meet these challenges, and on what the priorities should be for strengthening families. Part of the process includes workshops on parenting, balancing work and family life, the family as carer and relationships in difficulty. These workshops allow a more focused examination of the issues and the identification of the supports families need to carry out their important role.</P>
      <P>To date four fora have been held in Donegal, Kilkenny, Cork and Galway. The final forum will take place in Dublin on 4 December. Reports on each forum meeting are being drawn up. A final thematic report that will draw together all the issues raised is being prepared. Already a clear picture is emerging of the concerns people have on family related issues, the type of policy developments desired, and the priorities for action. The thematic report is scheduled for publication in early 2004 at the start of the tenth anniversary of the UN International Year of the Family. In the context of the Irish Presidency, with the support of the EU Commission, I will be hosting an international conference entitled Families, Change and European Social Policy in Dublin on 13-14 May 2004 to mark the year. This conference will address in an international context many of the issues being discussed at the fora.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Drawing on the views and analysis emerging from this consultation process, it is my intention to have a clear, coherent and comprehensive statement of family policy prepared by end 2004. <Col N="192" />This will be designed to address the profound changes for families and family life taking place and to identify priorities for strengthening families in the key contribution they make to the well being of their individual members and society as a whole.</P>

      <P>The purpose of the supplementary welfare scheme is to deal with emergencies and short-term needs that arise when a person has a change in circumstances, including when a tenant becomes unemployed and can no longer afford their rent. Rent supplements were never intended to meet a person's long-term housing needs. The scheme is not a housing programme but over the years the scheme has, in effect, become a major housing support system. It does not make sense to have two parallel but entirely separate programmes in this area, one operated by the housing authorities and the other by the health boards.</P>
      <P>The rent supplement scheme does not give a good long-term outcome to the individual. They have limited security of tenure, accommodation standards can sometimes be poor and they must remain on social welfare in order to retain their accommodation. The scheme does not give a good outcome to the State either as it provides poor long-term value for money and in effect, it bypasses the priorities set by the local authorities in their housing programmes. This is why I have taken a number of initiatives in this area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am aware that a number of organisation have expressed concerns about these measures. I wish to assure the Deputy that careful consideration went into the formulation of these measures. The measures are designed to ensure that rent supplement is paid in appropriate circumstances, in accordance with established policy and taking into account the objectives of the scheme, which is to focus on meeting immediate, short-term income maintenance needs. A rent supplement payment will continue to be available to people <Col N="193" />with housing needs who are at risk, such as people with disabilities or those experiencing severe social problems and due regard will be paid to the needs of these people in implementing the new rent arrangements. However, the important difference will be the involvement of the housing authorities in addressing their long-term housing needs.</P>
    <P>I have also announced the ending of the transitional payment that applies under the one-parent family payment scheme. This will have the effect of shifting the policy emphasis for lone parents from earnings disregards in the one-parent family payment scheme to the in-work family income supplement scheme. The present earnings disregard enables lone parents to retain a significant level of income support in the transition to full-time employment. I believe that when that stage is reached they should then avail of family income supplement rather than continuing on a further transitional payment. Family income supplement is a mainstream benefit payable to all low income workers with children and is specifically designed to provide cash support for employees with families on low earnings and thereby preserve the incentive to remain in employment in circumstances where the employee might only be marginally better off than if she or he were claiming other social welfare payments.</P>

      <P>The household benefits package, which comprises the electricity and gas allowance, telephone allowance and free television licence schemes, is generally available to people living in the State, aged 66 years or over, who are in receipt of a social welfare type payment or who fulfil a means test. The package is also available to carers and people with disabilities under the age of 66 who are in receipt of certain welfare type payments. People over 70 years of age can qualify regardless of their income or household composition. The free travel scheme is available to all people living in the State aged 66 years, or over, to all carers in receipt of carer's allowance and to carers of people in receipt of constant attendance or prescribed relative's allowance. It is also available to certain people with disabilities. Widows and widowers aged from 60 to 65 whose late spouses had been in receipt of the household benefit package or free travel retain that entitlement to ensure that those households do not suffer a loss of entitlements following the death of the spouse.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The free schemes share a common set of objectives in the area of social inclusion as follows: to <Col N="194" />provide assistance to those living alone by targeting them with specific benefits providing both income and social inclusion gains; to support older people and people with disabilities in their wish to remain in the community as opposed to institutional care; and to support Government policy which seeks to acknowledge the value of older people in society. A range of proposals has been made to extend the free schemes to other groups, including all widows and widowers and these are kept under review in the context of the above criteria and budgetary resources.</P>

      <P>Ireland has participated in an OECD review of family friendly policies with a number of other OECD member states. Austria and Japan were the other countries reviewed with Ireland in the latest phase of the project. The review, which is part of a series entitled &ldquo;Babies and Bosses&rdquo; analyses how the existing mix of policies, including tax and benefit policies, child care policy and employment and workplace practices, contributes to different parental labour market outcomes and other societal outcomes. Demographic trends, in particular the growing participation of women in the labour market and changes in the structure of families, means that most people will combine work with caring for children, those with an illness or disability, or older family members at some stage in their working lives.</P>
      <P>The OECD report makes specific policy recommendations for Ireland which include introduction of an entitlement to part-time work for parents with very young children, measures to facilitate lone parents take up full-time employment thus avoiding long-term dependency on one parent family payment, encouragement for employers and unions to make workplace more family-friendly and good quality child care services.</P>
      <P>Responses to many of these policy recommendations are already in train. I recently established the Family Support Agency to further strengthen the institutional framework for the development of effective and responsive family support services. One of the functions of the Family Support Agency is to promote and disseminate information about a range of family related issues including information to assist persons in balancing their work and family life.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="195" />The Government has set out a range of specific commitments on work-life balance in Sustaining Progress. We have also agreed that the work of the national framework committee for family friendly policies established under the PPF will continue. Special initiatives under Sustaining Progress on ending child poverty and on care-children, people with disabilities and older people will address many of the issues raised in the OECD report. Some of the type of issues raised in the OECD report are also being discussed in the consultation process on strengthening families currently under way by means of regional family fora. The thematic report to be published early in 2004 on the outcome of the consultation will provide a basis for further more widespread discussion in the coming year, the tenth anniversary of the International Year of the Family. The Irish Presidency will also host an international conference on Families, Change and European Social Policy, to mark the year at which a representative of the OECD will be one of the speakers. This conference will provide a further important international perspective on the best way forward. It is my intention to publish by the end of 2004 a comprehensive strategy for integrated family policies which will take account of the outcome of the national consultation and of the best international practise.</P>

      <P>The 2004 Abridged, or pre-budget, Estimate for appropriations-in-aid in my Department's Estimate for 2004 is &euro;133.51 million. This sum is provided for in subhead V which is the receipts subhead of my Department's Vote in 2004. The most significant receipts under this heading are the recovery from the social insurance fund of that portion of the Department's administration costs which is attributable to social insurance schemes. The balance arises mainly from the recovery of overpayments and repayments from the social insurance fund of amounts paid initially as social assistance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The increase of 2% in appropriations-in-aid provided for in my Department's Estimate for 2004 is expected to arise almost entirely on the provisions for recovery of overpayments and repayments from the social insurance fund of amounts paid initially as social assistance. The increases in these provisions reflect the fact that receipts under the corresponding headings in 2003 are emerging at a higher level than had been expected. No change has been made to the cri<Col N="196" />teria which determine the level of these receipts in 2004.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social and Family Affairs (Mary Coughlan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 110, 121 and 126 together.</P>
      <P>The Abridged Estimates Volume for 2004 provided for a total allocation for social welfare spending in 2004 of &euro;10.65 billion. This represents an increase of &euro;358 million, or 3.5%, compared with the 2003 allocation. Furthermore, these Estimates do not include any additional expenditure in respect of improvements to social welfare payments and programmes to be announced in the budget. The increase in social welfare spending underscores the Government's commitment to meeting the needs of the most vulnerable in our society.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, my Department continues to review social welfare programmes so as to ensure that programme objectives are still valid and are met in the most efficient and effective way. Arising from this and so as to stay within Government financial guidelines, a number of measures were announced as part of the Estimates process. Changes to the conditions underlying some schemes seek to ensure that the schemes continue to meet their underlying objectives. Within the context of overall spending guidelines, the measures were evaluated so as to minimise any adverse impact that they might have on social welfare recipients. In the first instance, the <Col N="197" />measures applied for the most part to new cases only and existing payment recipients will not generally be affected. Certain measures will have an impact only when family income is in excess of around &euro;300 while other measures re-focus existing schemes on the groups or needs for which they were primarily intended. Further measures were introduced because income thresholds had previously been set in absolute terms and required updating while other measures were adopted because there are more appropriate mechanisms for delivering the necessary support.</P>
    <P>The total allocation to social welfare spending in 2004 will not be known until after the budget announcement. Accordingly, it is not possible to complete a complete poverty proofing exercise on the 2004 spending allocation until the budget package is decided upon. Nonetheless, my Department has completed a more limited poverty proofing exercise in respect of the range of measures which were announced as part of the Abridged Estimates exercise. Any effects on the risk of poverty arising from the measures will be considered in the context of rate increases to be announced in the budget.</P>
    <P>The social inclusion consultative group is one of the new institutions established under the revised national anti-poverty strategy, NAPS. It comprises representatives of the social partners, the ESRI, the Combat Poverty Agency and equality authority and relevant Departments. Its role is to offer advice and observations on the NAPS process as it unfolds. The consultative group does not have a specific role in the Estimates process and was not asked for its views in this regard. However, in so far as the group considers the Estimates and the budgetary measures to be announced as relevant to the NAPS process, any views which are put forward by this group, as well as any other submissions in relation to the Estimates provision, will be fully considered.</P>

      <P>The five statutory agencies operating under the aegis of my Department are the Pensions Board, the Combat Poverty Agency, Comhairle, the Social Welfare Tribunal and the Family Support Agency. The Pensions Board was established under the Pensions Act 1990 and has the general function of monitoring and supervising the operation of the Pensions Act and pensions developments generally. The current membership of the board is 17 of which seven are women. I <Col N="198" />have not appointed any members to the Pensions Board since I became Minister.</P>
      <P>The Combat Poverty Agency was established in September 1986 under the Combat Poverty Agency Act 1986. The main functions of the agency are to advise the Minister for Social and Family Affairs on all aspects of economic and social planning in relation to poverty; to initiate and evaluate measures aimed at overcoming poverty; and to promote greater public understanding of the nature, causes and extent of poverty and the measures necessary to overcome poverty. The current membership of the board of the agency is 16 of which eight are women. I have appointed seven women to the board since I became Minister.</P>
      <P>Comhairle has responsibility for promoting the provision of independent information, advice and advocacy services to all citizens. It was established in June 2000 and replaced the National Social Service Board and certain functions of the National Rehabilitation Board. The current membership of the board of Comhairle is 20 of which eight are women. I have appointed six women to the board since I became Minister.</P>
      <P>The Social Welfare Tribunal is a statutory body set up in 1982 to deal with cases where entitlement to unemployment benefit or assistance is refused due to an involvement in a trade dispute. It comprises a chairperson and four ordinary members, two of whom are representative of workers and two representative of employers. The current membership of the Social Welfare Tribunal is five of which one is a woman. I have appointed one woman to the tribunal since I became Minister.</P>
      <P>The Family Support Agency was formally established on 6 May 2003. The new agency provides a family mediation service; supports, promotes and develops the provision of marriage and relationship counselling and other family supports; supports, promotes and develops the family and community; and undertakes research, provides and disseminates information about parenting and family issues and provides advice to the Minister on matters relating to its functions. The current membership of the board of the Family Support Agency is 12 of which seven are women. I have appointed seven women to the board since I became Minister.</P>

      <P>Disability allowance is a social assistance payment made to people whose employment capacity is substantially restricted because of a disability and whose income falls below certain limits. Continuing entitlement to disability allowance is subject to the person satisfying both a means test and the medical eligibility criteria that apply. In this regard my Department recognises post viral fatigue syndrome, chronic fatigue syndrome and ME, myalgic encephalomyelitis, as medical conditions for which, if sufficiently serious, disability allowance is payable.</P>
      <P>Where a person claims a payment in respect of illness, an opinion regarding the person's medical condition is given in the first instance by his or her doctor. Where required, a second opinion is provided by medical assessors employed by my Department for the guidance of the Department's deciding officers who ultimately determine entitlement. When conducting an examination the medical assessor does not dispute the existence of the certified cause of incapacity but rather she or he assesses the degree to which the loss of function in work-related activities resulting from the disease or injury affects the ability of the person to perform either his or her own job or alternative work.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social and Family Affairs (Mary Coughlan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 116, 117, 353 and 355 together.</P>
      <P>The purpose of the supplementary welfare allowance is to deal with emergencies and short-term needs that arise when a person has a change in circumstances, for example when a tenant becomes unemployed and can no longer afford their rent. Expenditure on rent supplements in 1998 was &euro;112 million. In 1999 it was &euro;128 million and in 2000 it was &euro;151 million. In 2001 it rose to &euro;179 million while in 2002 it reached &euro;252 million. Expenditure this year is expected to be approximately &euro;330 million or almost three times the 1998 level.</P>
      <P>As Deputies will be aware, future rent supplements will be payable only where, at the time of application for a rent supplement, the person has been in rented accommodation for a period of six months. Provision will be made for cases where a housing authority designates that a person is homeless or a person has been identified by a housing authority as having a housing need which cannot be met by the housing authority or by a voluntary housing organisation or by the person concerned. This will help re-focus the rent supplement on its original objective of short-term income maintenance. The six month requirement is not currently a condition for entitlement to rent supplement and therefore details in respect of the number of recipients in 2003 who had previously been in rented accommodation for a six month period or less are not available.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>People currently in receipt of rent supplement will not be affected by the introduction of the six month requirement and their rent supplements will continue to be paid. There was never any question of withdrawing rent supplement from existing recipients who qualified for payment under the current arrangements. Rent supplements were never intended to meet persons long-term housing needs. The scheme is not a housing programme but despite this over the years the scheme has become a form of housing support outside of the remit of the housing authorities. It does not make sense to have two parallel but entirely separate programmes, one operated by the housing authorities and the other by the health boards in this area. In consultation with the Department of Environment, Heritage <Col N="201" />and Local Government, I am considering how to address the anomalies in the recent arrangements.</P>

      <P>In April of this year my Department commenced a special review of the one parent family payment scheme to examine the entitlement of clients identified as having earnings from employment at a level above the statutory limit for receipt of the payment and who had not notified the Department of this fact. To date, over-payments have been assessed in 444 cases. Those concerned have received a formal decision on their claim, a detailed breakdown of the amount of money overpaid and the period involved. All have been advised of their statutory right of appeal. In all cases, the over-payments are recoverable and those concerned have been notified of the code of practice operated by my Department which affords them the opportunity to comment on the repayment method proposed.</P>

      <P>The conditions for receipt of unemployment benefit or UB aim to preserve a fair balance between contributions paid and the benefit received. In view of this and the need to remove a number of anomalies or to better target scheme resources, a number of measures were introduced as part of the Estimates process.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The new measures are: increasing the weekly earnings threshold for payment of a full rate of unemployment benefit and the corresponding thresholds for the three bands of graduated rates; withdrawal of half rate child dependant allowance of &euro;8.40 per child where a claimant's spouse or partner has weekly earnings in excess of &euro;300; discontinue entitlement to half rate unemployment benefit where a person is in receipt of a widow's or widower's pension or a one parent family payment; increase the period where unemployment benefit claims are linked to a previous <Col N="202" />claim from 13 weeks to 26 weeks; increase the number of paid contributions required to qualify for unemployment benefit from 39 to 52, applicable to new cases; reduce the maximum duration of unemployment benefit claims from 15 months to 12 months where a person has less than 260 paid contributions.</P>
    <P>Most of these measures will affect only new claimants or, in some cases, people who are returning to unemployment benefit after a break in their current claim. The impact of the measures differ in effect. The first four measures outlined are expected to reduce the average payment made to persons on unemployment benefit. On any given week in 2004, it is expected that these measures will affect 8,400, 13,500, 1,300 and 150 cases respectively. This compares with an expected average of 74,000 UB claims in 2004 before policy measures were introduced. The last two measures will impact on the number of persons on unemployment benefit. The first of them will affect 300 new claims per week in 2004. This compares with an average of about 3,100 applications weekly currently. The final will result in shorter durations for about 700 persons per week on average.</P>

      <askee>Minister for Social and Family Affairs</askee>
      <Quest>the reasons her Department so substantially underestimated the cost of extending pension rights to those who had pre-1953 insurance contributions; the original estimated cost when the decision was made and the actual cost; the steps being taken to ensure that all such decisions are accurately costed in the future; and if she will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan" hpid="Mary Coughlan Mary Coughlan">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Social and Family Affairs (Mary Coughlan)</NameTxt>
      <P>In May 2000, a special half rate old age contributory pension was introduced to enable people with pre-1953 insurance, who could not qualify for a payment under normal qualifying conditions, to receive a pension. People already qualifying for pensions at less than half rate could also benefit from the new scheme. In order to be eligible for the payment, a person needs 260 paid contributions at the appropriate rate, which can comprise a mixture of pre-1953 and post-1953 contributions.</P>
      <P>Based on an analysis of pension claims which failed to satisfy the standard conditions and on experience of take up on previous pension measures, it was estimated that 3,000 persons would qualify for the new pension in 2000 at a full year cost of &euro;8.9 million. The overall claimload ultimately was not expected to exceed 5,000 people. To date, a total of 28,649 pre-1953 pensions have been awarded. Almost 63% of these pensions are being paid to residents of the UK and other countries. The cost in 2002, which includes the budget increases in those payments and arrears, amounted to &euro;113 million.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="203" />One of the difficulties in estimating costs in this case was that the records available in the Department on pre-1953 contributions were not in such a form as to allow for ready estimation of the numbers of contributions. Many of the records in question were incomplete and had to be supplemented by separate information obtained when claims were made. Furthermore, the Department, based on its databases, did not anticipate the number of successful claims which would be made by persons resident abroad.</P>
    <P>It must be acknowledged that the numbers qualifying and the overall cost of this measure have been seriously underestimated. That said, my Department is frequently required to estimate the costs of policy measures and its record in this regard is a good one. This has been recognised by the Department of Finance. The experience in this case was highly unusual and related to lack of data. However, the Department will take on board the specific lessons of this project in estimating the costs of similar proposals in the future.</P>

      <P>I understand, from additional information supplied to my Department for a similar question on 5 November 2003, the question concerns a former Army officer who applied for a living alone allowance from my Department and was refused. The refusal was based on the grounds that he is not in receipt of a pension from my Department. The living alone allowance is not a payment in its own right but an allowance which can only be paid as a supplement to an Irish social welfare pension such as the old age contributory or non-contributory pension.</P>
      <P>Commissioned Army officers recruited prior to 6 April are insurable under PRSI class C. Contributors can build up entitlements to a number of benefits under this class as follows: widow's or widower's contributory pension, orphans contributory pension, bereavements grant and carer's benefit. Enlisted personnel of the Defence Forces are insurable at class H which provides additional entitlements, including old age contributory pension. The Army officers concerned are not entitled to an old age contributory pension on the basis of their class C contributions. However, a person may qualify for a non-contributory pension if he/she has income below a weekly means threshold which is currently set at &euro;147.60.</P>

      <Col N="206" />The Thurles interagency task force completed its work and submitted its report to me in September 2002. Follow-up action on the report has been actively pursued by the State development agencies and other interests. The downturn in the global economy has adversely affected the flow of foreign direct investment to Ireland but current indicators are more positive for investment and economic recovery. A major marketing effort by the Thurles marketing group is under way with a view to promoting the attractiveness of Thurles as an investment location. IDA Ireland, Shannon Development and the Tipperary North County Enterprise Board are active participants in this initiative, together with local development interests. In this regard, the first phase of the development of the Tipperary Technology Park by Shannon Development is now completed and should enhance the attractiveness of the area for new industry.</P>

      <Quest> the numbers employed in the labour inspectorate of her Department since 1 January 2000; if there are currently unfilled posts in the inspectorate; her proposals to increase the personnel and resources, especially having regard to the additional workload it now faces; and if she will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>

    <Speaker pid="FrankFahey" hpid="Mr. Fahey Mr. Fahey">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Mr. Fahey)</NameTxt>
      <P>In 2000, the Government authorised a significant increase in the number of labour inspectors, from ten to 17, in conjunction with the introduction of the National Minimum Wage Act in that year. The current complement of inspectors remains at 17. However, from time to time, that figure can fluctuate as a consequence of events such as promotions or transfers.</P>
      <P>At present, there are 16 officers, including two job sharers, actively assigned to the labour inspectorate, covering 15 posts, for the purposes of carrying out the functions of labour inspector. An interview process has recently been completed to identify suitable officers to take up the outstanding two posts. It is anticipated that those additional officers will be assigned, and will take up their new positions, before year end.</P>
      <P>In 2001, as part of a continuing process to strengthen and modernise employment rights enforcement, a major business process re-engineering exercise took place in the employment rights section of my Department, including the labour inspectorate. The business process review looked across the support activities to the labour inspectorate in the area of employment rights enforcement. In the employment rights information unit, enhanced customer service standards, including lunchtime opening, were introduced and in the prosecution and enforcement units procedures and linkages with the Chief State Solicitor's office were improved. In addition, a new fully integrated IT system to support the employment rights enforcement effort was launched in mid-June 2003 at a cost of &euro;900,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="216" />I am satisfied that this level of investment, together with implementation of appropriate streamlined procedures, is sufficient to provide for adequate inspection and enforcement activity so as to ensure, as far as possible, that employment rights and entitlements of workers working in Ireland are protected. There are no plans, at this stage, to increase the number of inspectors further.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 143 and 144 together.</P>
      <P>In the tables that follow details are set out of the activity of the labour inspectorate and legal services units in my Department over the period 2000 to date.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The labour inspectorate of my Department is responsible for monitoring certain employment conditions for all categories of workers in Ireland, including non-national workers. Where allegations of worker mistreatment are received the inspectorate pursues these and if evidence of non-compliance with the relevant employment rights legislation is found, the inspectorate seeks redress <Col N="217" />for the individuals concerned and also, if appropriate, a prosecution is initiated. The statutory employment rights and protections that apply to native Irish workers also apply to non-national workers in the same manner. In this regard, the inspectorate operates without any differentiation <Col N="218" />with respect to worker nationality. Similarly, statistical data does not specifically identify or differentiate the activity undertaken by the labour inspectorate or the legal services unit that may particularly concern non-national workers.</P>
    <P>Year 2000</P>
    <P Just="Center">The labour inspectorate completed 14,167 inspections/visits in year 2000. This included a particular emphasis on checking compliance with the recently introduced national minimum wage.</P>

My Department has no direct role, under this order, in the day to day operation of the pension scheme, which is administered by the Construction Industry Federation.</P>

    <P>There is provision in the agreement for a trade union representative of employers or workers to complain to the Labour Court where an employer is alleged to have failed to comply with the registered employment agreement. In pursuing the matter the Labour Court can be assisted by the labour inspectorate of my Department. Acting on specific information from the Labour Court, the employment records of an employer will be examined by an inspector and any relevant information gathered is communicated back to the Labour Court. The inspectorate has no other function in the matter. Having completed its examination of the complaint, the Labour Court can, where it deems it appropriate, issue a court order. My Department will process legal pro<Col N="220" />ceedings against an employer who fails to comply with that court order.</P>
    <P>It should be noted that under the Payment of Wages Act 1991, employees have the right to complain to a rights commissioner against an unlawful deduction from wages by their employer.</P>

      <P>The person named applied for an allocation of suckler cow quota from the 2004 national reserve under category A, which caters for first-time applicants for suckler cow premium in 2004 who are under 35 years of age. Farmers who applied for the suckler cow premium for the first time in 2003 were also eligible to apply under this category.</P>
      <P>One of the main conditions which category A applicants must satisfy is that the total number of livestock units on the holding must not exceed 50. Livestock units are calculated by reference to the number of animals applied on under the suckler cow premium scheme 2003, ewe premium scheme 2003 and special beef premium scheme 2002. The milk quota, off-farm income &ndash; every &euro;270 is one livestock unit &ndash; and any acreage used to produce cereal crops are also converted to livestock units.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The person named first applied for suckler cow premium in 2002 so he could not be regarded as a first-time applicant in either 2003 or 2004. He was allocated seven suckler cow quota rights from the 2003 national reserve. In addition, he declared an off-farm income of &euro;8,240, which converted to 30.52 livestock units. These units together with his animal and milk quota units <Col N="221" />were combined to give an overall total of 57.08 units, which exceeds the 50 unit limit. In the circumstances, it was not possible to make an allocation of quota to him from the 2004 national reserve and the decision already taken by my Department must stand. The person named may appeal this decision, if he so wishes, to the Agriculture Appeals Office, Kilminchy Court, Portlaoise, County Laois.</P>

      <P>The EU regulations governing the current and earlier scheme of early retirement from farming, introduced in 1994, do not provide for indexation of rates of payment. The rate of pension payable under the 1994 scheme is the maximum provided for in the EU Council regulation under which the scheme was introduced. In its proposals for the current scheme, which commenced in November 2000, my Department had made provision for annual increases in the rate of pension. However the European Commission rejected this proposal and insisted that a fixed rate be set for the full period of the CAP Rural Development Plan 2000-2006.</P>

      <P>Commonage land eligible for payment under measure A of the REPS attracts payment of &euro;242 per hectare on the first 40 hectares, &euro;24 per hectare for areas over 40 hectares and up to and including 80 hectares, and &euro;18 per hectare for areas over 80 hectares and up to a maximum of 120 hectares. Where the total area of the holding qualifying for the measure A payment is less than 40 hectares, the balance of the area up to a maximum cumulative area of 40 hectares attracts the basic REPS payment of &euro;151 per hectare.</P>
      <P>In addition, farmers with commonage may avail of the supplementary measure for rearing animals of local breeds in danger of extinction. Under this supplementary measure, once-off payments are made in respect of registered pure-bred female progeny of a recognised breed. The payment is &euro;400 per registered female bovine or equine and &euro;60 per registered female ovine. The farmer must be a member of a recognised breed society and have the animal registered with that society, and the animal must be retained for 100 days after the date of lodgement of the registration certificate.</P>

      <P>As both the above-mentioned schemes are co-funded by the EU, the approval of the European Commission is required before the changes can be implemented. As it is a matter for the regional assemblies to seek this approval, the proposals were considered and approved at recent meetings of the monitoring committees for the regions, following which the formal approach to the European Commission was made. This was done by the directors of both assemblies on 24 October.</P>
      <P>As part of the Sustaining Progress agreement, the income unit, IU, ceiling for eligibility under both the farm waste management scheme and dairy hygiene scheme is to be increased from the current level of 200 IUs to 450 IUs. The investment ceiling under the farm waste management scheme is to be increased to &euro;75,000 and, in the case of the dairy hygiene scheme, to &euro;50,000. In addition, a standard rate of grant aid of 40% is to be introduced for most investments.</P>
      <P>In the meantime, work is at an advanced stage on revising the scheme documents and the necessary application forms in anticipation of early EU approval. Significantly increased funding has been allocated to both schemes in the recently published Estimates, with a total of &euro;33.5 million available, representing an increase of nearly 60% over the 2003 allocations.</P>

      <P>Section 140 of the Finance Act 2003 gave legislative effect to the stamp duty increase from &euro;19 to &euro;40 per annum on credit card accounts. I announced this in the budget for 2003. This section also contains an anti-avoidance provision as, under the previous legislation, the stamp duty on credit cards was in respect of an account maintained by the bank on 1 April. However, people could cancel their cards in a particular manner to avoid the annual charge. In view of this, an anti-avoidance provision was included in the Finance Act 2003 for credit cards to ensure that a stamp duty charge will arise where the account is maintained by the bank at any time during the 12 month period ending on 1 April rather than its being maintained specifically on 1 April. This change is effective where the charge arises after 1 April 2003.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Accordingly, if an individual who has used a card at any time cancels that card after 1 April in a year, a further stamp duty charge of &euro;40 is payable on closure of the account, as the account had been maintained by the financial institution at <Col N="225" />any time during the year ending on 1 April of the following year. This is consistent with applying a stamp duty charge for a year or part of a year for which the credit card account is held.</P>
    <P>I can confirm that representations relating to this matter have been received from the company concerned. There are revenue implications in any change to the current provisions. I will keep this matter under consideration.</P>

      <P>Based on the information available at present to the Revenue Commissioners about the income earner, it would appear that he can earn up to &euro;15,000 free of income tax in the current year, the &euro;15,000 being the age exemption limit for a single or widowed person aged 65 or over.</P>
      <P>If a certificate of tax credits is required, the income earner should get in touch with the Westmeath-Offaly Revenue District, Government Offices, Pearse Street, Athlone, County Westmeath.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 160 and 163 together.</P>
      <P>VAT registered businesses and charitable and voluntary organisations are subject to different treatment under EU and Irish VAT law. Registered businesses are allowed to recover input VAT since they generally charge VAT on their onward sales to their customers. Charities and not-for-profit bodies on the other hand are exempt and do not charge VAT for the services they provide and therefore are unable to recover VAT incurred on their inputs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The State already provides significant resources to fund the operation of charities and not-for-profit bodies. Charities enjoy relief from most taxes and I provided in the Finance Act 2001 for a scheme of tax relief on donations to <Col N="226" />charities. This is a scheme which has been of significant benefit to them. Any such scheme as outlined by the Deputies would be expensive, much more so than has been indicated by the charity sector. This is because a wider group who could benefit from charitable status would be likely to seek access to any such payments. In addition I would be concerned that there would be pressure to have similar grant or subsidy schemes replicated for other areas that incur VAT. I have no plans to introduce any mechanism outlined by the Deputies.</P>

      <Quest>the regulations governing the designation of electric bicycles with regard to tax and insurance; and the criteria used in the decision regarding whether an electric bicycle is subject to duty or requires insurance cover for its use.</Quest>
      <QRef>[29079/03]</QRef>

    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Road Traffic Act 1961 includes in the definition of a &ldquo;mechanically propelled vehicle&rdquo; both &ldquo;a bicycle . . .  with an attachment for propelling it by mechanical power&rdquo; and &ldquo;a vehicle the means of propulsion of which is electrical or partly electrical and partly mechanical&rdquo;. A mechanically propelled vehicle is required to comply with the various provisions of the Act which, among other things, require the user to have third party insurance in a public place. The vehicle also has to comply with the provisions of the Road Traffic (Construction, Equipment and Use of Vehicles) Regulations and the Road Traffic (Lighting of Vehicles) Regulations. Electric bicycles are also subject to motor tax.</P>
      <P>As regards vehicle registration tax, VRT, section 130 of the Finance Act 1992 defines a &ldquo;mechanically propelled vehicle&rdquo; as: a vehicle intended or adapted for propulsion by a mechanical means, including</P>
      <P>(<i>a</i>)&nbsp;a bicycle, tricycle or quadricycle propelled by an engine or motor or with an attachment for propelling it by mechanical power, whether or not the attachment is being used, a moped, a scooter and an autocycle, and</P>
      <P>(<i>b</i>)&nbsp;a vehicle the means of propulsion of which is electrical or partly electrical and partly mechanical.</P>
      <P>The effect of this section is that electric bicycles are liable to VRT and, as such, must be presented at a Vehicle Registration Office for registration. The VRT rates of duty which are payable on the registration of such vehicles are: &euro;2 per cubic centimetre where the cubic capacity of an engine does not exceed 350 cc; &euro;1 per cubic centimetre in respect of each additional cubic centimetre in excess of 350 cc.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Electric engines are measured in watts and 50 watts of electric power equate to approximately <Col N="227" />1 cc. Such modes of transport attract a VAT charge at the rate of 21%. The amount on which VAT is chargeable is the total consideration, including all taxes, commissions, costs and charges which the person supplying the goods becomes entitled to receive. The rate of customs duty applicable to electric bicycles is 6%.</P>
    <P>Electrically assisted cycles, known as &ldquo;pedelecs&rdquo;, which have electric motors that only assist the pedalling effort and which do not act as a means of propulsion in their own right, are not considered to be mechanically propelled vehicles and therefore they are not subject to insurance or motor tax.</P>

      <P>I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that there is no tax relief available for the purchase of a property to be used as a music school <i>per se.</i> However, tax relief may be available under one of the general property incentive schemes depending on where the property is situated and the circumstances of the case. Tax relief is available for certain commercial properties under the urban renewal, town renewal, rural renewal and living over the shop schemes.</P>
      <P>To qualify for tax relief the local authority must certify that the particular development is consistent with the aims, objectives and criteria of the particular scheme. This certification condition does not arise in the rural renewal scheme, which scheme applies to the entire counties of Leitrim and Longford and to certain areas of Roscommon, Sligo and Cavan.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="228" />In general, commercial premises must be in use either by an owner-occupier for the purposes of a trade or profession or by a lessee who is renting the premises on commercial terms. The schemes have different requirements in terms of the qualifying period, the type of expenditure allowed and the tax relief available. Based on the information provided in the question it is not possible to be specific about any tax relief for which the individual in question might qualify. It is suggested that, subject to checking with the relevant local authority, the individual in question contact the Revenue Commissioners for further information.</P>

      <P>I am aware of the case raised by the Deputy. The Irish Embassy in Greece has been monitoring this matter. The group of seven, made up of a Briton, a Syrian, two Spaniards and three Greeks, was arrested during the protests surrounding the European Council in Thessaloniki in June. In accordance with Greek national procedures, its members were held while awaiting trial. In late September, one of the seven began a hunger strike and was followed in this course by some of the other detainees. There have been a series of protests in connection with this in Greece, seeking to bring their situation to the attention of the authorities there. Last week the Greek courts took the decision to release the men on bail pending a trial date. The Greek Government has expressed its satisfaction with this action.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs (Mr. Kitt)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government through its overseas development assistance programme provides considerable resources to address the basic needs of developing countries, including in the health and education sectors.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At the multilateral level, the Government contributes to a number of UN bodies involved in the promotion of human rights and development. For example, Ireland is a major donor to the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights. In 2002, we contributed &euro;2.539 million to this office, of which &euro;250,000 was earmarked for <Col N="232" />work in the area of HIV-AIDS, gender and disability. In 2002 we allocated &euro;200,000 to research by the office on the rights of people with disabilities.</P>
    <P>At the International Labour Organisation, Ireland is supporting a multi-annual programme focused on disability and the workforce. The ILO, with assistance from Ireland, is developing a range of activities to support small enterprise training targeted at women with disabilities. With our support, the ILO is also undertaking a systematic examination of the range of laws in place in developing countries to promote employment opportunities for disabled people. Based on this research, the ILO will provide advice to Governments, employers' and workers' organisations on policy, legislation and programmes relating to people with disabilities.</P>
    <P>At the bilateral level, the Government supports development co-operation programmes in six countries in sub-Saharan Africa and in Timor Leste. Our development co-operation in these countries has moved away from specific stand-alone projects and towards pooled donor funding in support of health and education systems. This sector-wide approach to development co-operation is in line with international best practice. It means that we are basing our assistance on our partner countries' national health and education strategies rather than on a donor-driven development agenda.</P>
    <P>The specific needs of people with disabilities are more likely to be addressed if they are integrated into broad nationally owned health and education strategies, rather than dealt with through a stand-alone ring-fenced fund. Development Co-operation Ireland, through its close dialogue with partner Governments in the development of national health and education programmes, and through its funding of these sectors, is in a strong position to advocate for national policies to focus on the needs of people with disabilities.</P>
    <P>In some cases the Government, through its funding of non-governmental organisations and missionaries, has allocated specific funding for projects to support people living with disabilities. For example, Development Co-operation Ireland is providing &euro;457,000 for a project to support independent living and full civic participation of disabled people in Serbia. The project, which is being implemented by the Catholic Relief Services and a local NGO, the Centre for Independent Living, will assist in the training of personal assistants who will then facilitate an independent lifestyle for disabled people.</P>
    <P>In many developing countries, conflict and its aftermath have left many thousands of non-combatants seriously disabled, particularly by landmines. Ireland is funding the clearing of landmines and has also funded efforts to assist those disabled by mines to rebuild lives and livelihoods.</P>
    <P>The needs of people with disabilities are recognised both at the multilateral and bilateral levels in the Government's official programme of <Col N="233" />development assistance. The Government will continue to place a strong emphasis on this issue as it works in partnership with developing countries to fight poverty and social exclusion.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>I refer the Deputy to my reply of 6 November on the appointment of an EU special representative for Tibet.</P>
      <P>In March 2002 the Dalai Lama wrote to EU Foreign Ministers, including myself, asking for a special EU representative on Tibet. In a joint response, at that time, the EU Ministers were unanimously of the view that it would not achieve anything practical. The position has not changed. It remains the shared view of EU Ministers that our concerns regarding Tibet are most usefully expressed to the Chinese authorities directly.</P>
      <P>Our ongoing concerns about the protection of human rights in Tibet continue to be addressed, along with the general human rights problem in China, both bilaterally and within the framework of the EU-China Human Rights Dialogue. This is also done through appropriate action at the UN, including at the Commission on Human Rights.</P>
      <P>I am encouraged by China's first ever policy paper on the EU that was published on 13 October. It calls on EU representatives to visit Tibet and welcomes EU support for the economic, cultural, educational and social development of Tibet.</P>
      <P>The Government's position remains that the best way to achieve progress in Tibet is through dialogue between the Government in Beijing and the Dalai Lama. During the summer a delegation of the Dalai Lama's envoys visited China following a change in its leadership. I welcome the reports of positive dialogue between Chinese officials and the delegation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. N. Dempsey Mr. N. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Mr. N. Dempsey)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 177, 201 and 202 together.</P>
      <P>Voluntary secondary schools, including schools in County Dublin, are funded on the same basis as secondary schools throughout the country. The funding arrangements for voluntary secondary schools are structured mainly on the basis of capitation grants with additional grants for secretarial and caretaking services.</P>
      <P>There have been significant improvements in the level of funding for voluntary secondary schools. In the context of the 2004 estimates, I recently announced a further improvement in the <i>per capita</i> grant to &euro;274 per pupil, as against the rate of &euro;224.74 that applied in 1997. The increase will bring the grant to &euro;312 in the case of disadvantaged schools.</P>
      <P>In addition, secondary schools have benefited under the school services support initiative. The initial grant of &euro;25 per pupil that was introduced for second level schools in September 2000 was increased to &euro;89 per pupil from September 2002. It was further increased by &euro;10 per pupil from January 2003 to &euro;99 per pupil. In the case of voluntary secondary schools the grant was increased by a further &euro;28 to &euro;117 in September 2002 bringing the support services grant in the case of such schools to &euro;127 per pupil from January last. In the context of the 2004 Estimates the grant will be further increased to &euro;131 per pupil. The increase is in addition to the range of equalisation grants of up to &euro;15,554 per school, &euro;44.44 per pupil, per annum that have also been approved for voluntary secondary schools.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For a secondary school with 500 pupils it amounts to extra funding of up to &euro;105,684 per annum and annual grants of &euro;242,501, &euro;261,551 in the case of disadvantaged schools, towards general expenses and support services. Schools are afforded considerable flexibility in the use of these resources to cater for the needs of their pupils. This is in my view a preferable approach <Col N="235" />to putting in place grants for specific initiatives, including those referred to by the Deputies.</P>
    <P>Tackling the difficulties that are being caused by high insurance premia is a clear priority for the Government and for my colleague, the Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment. A key concern to which the Tánaiste is giving priority is the cost and availability of liability insurance. She has announced a comprehensive programme for the fundamental reform of the Irish insurance market. The Government considers that these measures constitute a programme that is capable of delivering real reform and that reductions in insurance costs will translate into significant reductions in premia.</P>
    <P>I am committed to further improving the funding of voluntary secondary schools in the light of available resources.</P>

      <P>At present the child in question attends an Enable Ireland pre-school for 13 hours per week. My Department initially sanctioned ten hours home tuition per week in June. The parent subsequently submitted supplementary professional documentation that was considered by the national educational psychological service. As a result an allocation of ten hours home tuition per week was recommended for the 2003-2004 school year. The family was informed of the decision on 1 September. A decision was also taken at the time to provide retrospective sanction of home tuition for July.</P>
      <P>Letters of appeal have since been received from the parent requesting an increase of home tuition to a minimum of 30 hours per week. As already indicated, following an examination of the relevant supporting documentation by NEPS, ten hours home tuition per week was recommended and sanctioned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My Department has considered a request that the allocation of home tuition be backdated to <Col N="238" />21 March, the date of application. As the home programme was in place during the period my Department has agreed, as an exceptional measure, to sanction the home tuition for the period from 21 March to 6 June. A letter to this effect will issue to the family shortly.</P>
    <P>My Department will process the Freedom of Information request as soon as possible and a response will issue to the person in question thereafter.</P>

      <P>The higher education grant schemes operate under the Local Authorities (Higher Education Grants) Acts 1968 to 1992. They define a mature student as follows:</P>
      <P>Of not less than 23 years of age, or such other age as may stand specified for the time being in regulations made by the Minister with the consent of the Minister for Finance, who have secured places in approved institutions and have reached that age on the 1st day of January, or such other date as may be prescribed from time to time by the Minister with the consent of the Minister for Finance, in the year of entry to such institutions.</P>
      <P>The Acts further provide, <i>inter alia,</i> for the making of grants to mature students whose means and those of their parents, where the mature students are dependent on their parents do not exceed prescribed limits.</P>
      <P>Under the terms of the schemes mature students are categorised as either independent mature students or mature students dependent on parents. An independent mature student is defined to mean a mature candidate who was not ordinarily resident with his or her parents from 1 October preceding their entry on an approved course. Independent mature students are assessed without reference to either their parents' income or address.</P>
      <P>To date sufficient evidence to establish that the candidate, in this case, is living independently of his parents has not been supplied to the awarding body concerned. It is not open to me, or my Department, to depart from the terms of the maintenance grant schemes in individual cases.</P>

Section 4 of the Act enables additional institutions that are identified as reformatory, industrial, orphanages, children's homes and special schools, in respect of which a public body had a regulatory or inspection function, to be added to the Schedule.</P>
      <P>My Department has received correspondence from both individuals and survivor groups identifying a number of additional institutions that may be eligible for inclusion in the Schedule. Discussions have taken place between the Department and other Departments that provided a regulatory function in the operation of these facilities to ascertain whether these institutions are eligible for inclusion. The initial information received in some cases was scant due to the long period that had elapsed since these institutions were closed and therefore the process of verifying each of these institutions has been time consuming. The inclusion of St. Luke's Hospital, Clonmel, in an updated Schedule is still under consideration.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Mr. N. Dempsey)</NameTxt>
      <P>The issue of the future of St. Catherine's arose in the context of a decision by the Dominican trustees of St. Catherine's that, due to personnel and financial considerations, they were no longer in a position to fulfil the role of trustees of the college. Following discussions between the trustees and my Department, it was agreed that a consultant would be appointed who would meet with relevant parties and prepare a report on the options available for consideration by the Minister. The report of the consultant was presented to the Department in July 2002.</P>
      <P>The consultant's report was thoroughly examined in the Department and the options for the future of the college were set out for my consideration. Having carefully considered all of them and having taken into account other factors such as the national spatial strategy, relevant costs in a time of financial constraint, a Government decision to restrict public service numbers, the need to secure value for money and a better allocation of resources, I decided that these considerations are best served by the closure of St. Catherine's and the designation of St. Angela's College, Sligo, as the sole centre for the training of home economics teachers.</P>
      <P>The closure of St. Catherine's will be phased over the next four years to facilitate students enrolled in the college in completing their course of training in the college. It will also allow time to make the necessary practical arrangements, including the position of the staff of the college. In this regard my officials have already met with the trustees of the college and with the Irish Federation of University Teachers which represents the academic staff in the college.</P>
      <P>I am not making the consultant's report available at this stage as I believe that access to it could have a significant adverse effect on the performance by my Department of its functions relating to management, including industrial relations. Furthermore, it could disclose positions taken, or to be taken, or plans, procedures, criteria or instructions used or followed, or to be used or followed, for the purpose of any negotiations carried on or to be carried on by or on behalf of the Department.</P>

      <P>Under the terms of my Department's free fees initiative and the regulations governing the middle level technician and higher technical &ndash; business skills programme, the Exchequer meets the tuition fees of eligible students who are attending approved full-time undergraduate courses, including certificate and diploma courses, which must generally be of least two years' duration at approved colleges. Eligibility under these initiatives are subject to a number of conditions. For example, students who are repeating a year are generally not eligible for funding.</P>
      <P>It is the third level institutions which take decisions regarding eligibility under these schemes, based on the criteria issued by my Department. These institutions do not refer individual queries to my Department except, in exceptional cases. Where an institution has not extended the benefit of free tuition fees to an individual student, and the student is of the view that the criteria have not been interpreted correctly in his or her case, a letter outlining the position may be sent to the Department. Alternatively, as already indicated, the institute itself may, in exceptional circumstances, seek clarification on an issue from the Department.</P>

      <P>The timing of when the proposed building project for Ennis national school may progress to architectural planning is dependent on the financial allocation for 2004 and subsequent years, the rate of progress of existing projects in architectural planning and the priority afforded to each project by reference to the published criteria for prioritising large-scale building projects.</P>
      <P>As an interim measure, significant grant aid has been provided to alleviate accommodation difficulties at Ennis national school.

    </Speaker>
    <P>The position in relation to public private partnership, PPP, projects is that under EU rules, <Col N="249" />where projects are financed on a deferred payment basis by the private sector, such as PPP projects, the capital value of such projects is a charge on the general Government balance, GGB, during the construction phase. The GGB is the critical measure of what can be accommodated within our obligations under the Stability and Growth Pact of the Maastricht Treaty. A EUROSTAT group is reviewing the accounting rules on this issue as is a standing committee established by my colleague, the Minister for Finance, to advise on the GGB implications of private sector financed projects.</P>
    <P>The position remains that consideration of PPP projects will be based on a thorough assessment of affordability of such projects in the context of the competing demands on the likely capital funding envelopes going forward and taking into account the issues surrounding the general Government balance.</P>

      <P>In line with normal staffing arrangements for national schools, teacher post allocations for the purpose of the Giving Children an Even Break scheme are determined by reference to enrolments in junior and senior classes on the previous 30 September. The Department excludes children where an additional teaching resource has already been provided. This occurs in the case of pupils with special needs taught by a recognised special class teacher and pupils receiving tuition by a recognised resource teacher for Travellers. There are 519 resource teachers for Travellers at primary level.</P>
      <P>My Department is committed to developing a five year Traveller education strategy, including an evaluation of existing provision.

    </Speaker>
    <P>The main focus of the Traveller education strategy exercise is to review and evaluate existing activities, the wide range of inputs, the quality of outcomes and the experience of Traveller learners within the education system. The strategy will provide recommendations on the way forward for Traveller education, taking account of the complexity of the issues involved, the history of provision and existing measures and recommend a phased implementation plan. Clear objectives will be set and it is envisaged that any <Col N="250" />baseline data required to support implementation of the strategy will be identified and the required arrangements to benchmark performance against this baseline data during the five year implementation period will be outlined.</P>

      <P>Having given careful consideration to the matter, I decided in April 2003 that the national centre as proposed should not proceed, having regard to the low and declining pupil numbers in the schools for the visually impaired and the development costs, estimated to be in excess of &euro;30 million.</P>
      <P>However, the Department proposes to explore with the school authorities concerned how aspects of the proposed centre could be developed, in the context of available resources.

      <P>The electricity systems between North and South are linked by interconnectors at three points. The main interconnection is between Louth and Tandragee, County Armagh, which has been upgraded from 280MW to 400MW since December 2001. In addition to the main interconnector, there are two standby interconnections at Letterkenny and Strabane and Corraclassy and Enniskillen, which are largely used to facilitate network support.</P>
      <P>Some of the capacity on the interconnectors is reserved for contingency purposes to facilitate transfer of power reserves between both systems in emergency conditions. At present, 300MW of the transfer capacity North to South is offered to the market. Usage of the interconnector in the South-North direction is limited as a result of network conditions in Ireland and usage in the North-South direction is limited as a result of system conditions in the North. For the 12 month period 1 November 2002 to 31 October 2003 an analysis of physical flows shows that the average North-South flow is 58.2 MWh/half hour and the average South-North flow is 0.672 MWh/half hour.</P>
      <P>However, as a means of mitigating the problems caused by constraints in physical capacity on the South-North direction, the regulators and transmission system operators in both jurisdictions agreed the introduction of a system of &ldquo;superpositioning&rdquo; with effect from 1 April 2003, which allows for parties to trade between systems on a contractual basis without the physical transfer of electricity across the interconnector being necessary. This ensures that potential crossBorder trades beneficial to both jurisdictions are not hindered.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The details in terms of prices of market trades are the contractual business of the firms involved and consequently price information is not publicly available. However, imported electricity itself would not set or determine the tariff for electricity customers in the Republic, as determined by the regulator. Furthermore, I am advised by ESB that following the price increase announced by the Commission for Energy Regulation in September last, the price of electricity <Col N="253" />for domestic customers in the South will be up to 5% cheaper than those obtaining in Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>As the Deputy may already be aware, ESB has recently signed an energy and capacity contract with Northern Ireland Electricity plc. This positive security of supply measure secures 167MW of capacity, which has been contracted on a priority basis to meet customer demand here. The initial term of this contract is due to run up until 30 June 2005 and may be extended up until autumn 2006.</P>

      <P>The closing date for receipt of applications under the current local authority swimming pool programme, which is administered by my Department, was 31 July 2000 and there are no plans to re-open the programme at present. No application was made in respect of a swimming pool in Douglas before that date.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The position on a swimming pool for Douglas is that two meetings were held in 2001 between representatives from Cork and, in the first instance, departmental officials and subsequently, the former Minister. At both meetings the representatives were advised that the local authority swimming pool programme was closed for the time being but that capital funding might be available under the sports capital programme for elements of an integrated swimming pool complex. Funding in respect of the pool itself could be considered if and when a <Col N="254" />new phase of the local authority swimming pool programme is launched. In March 2002, Cork City Council submitted a feasibility study for a proposed development of the pool and the council were advised in the Departments letter of 17 May 2002, that the proposal could not be considered for funding under the pool programme as it was received outside the closing date for applications. The priority for the programme is to support the proposals on hand and new proposals for swimming pools cannot be considered at this time.</P>

      <P>The information requested by the Deputy is provided in the following table. The table sets out the numbers of beds available and patients treated for both in-patients and day cases for the period 1998-2003 inclusive. Also included are figures for the numbers of in-patient procedures carried out annually in publicly-funded acute hospitals. The latter figures are derived from the Hospital In-Patient Enquiry, HIPE, which captures diagnostic and procedure data on each discharge from hospital. Procedures include surgical interventions as well as other investigative and therapeutic procedures. A proportion of the very significant increase in numbers of procedures carried out is likely to be due to improved reporting. HIPE provided for the recording of up to four separate procedures per hospital stay up until the end of 2001. This has now been extended to allow for reporting of up to ten procedures. Data for the current year are not yet complete.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children (Mr. Callely)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy may be aware that additional funding of &euro;5.5 million was provided by my Department to the Eastern Regional Health Authority and the Southern Health Board in July 2003 to deal with the issue of older people in the acute hospital sector whose discharge had been delayed because of a lack of appropriate facilities to which they could be referred. Over 300 older people are expected to benefit from this initiative and the authority and the board have been in discussions with these people, their relatives and the hospitals concerning their discharge to nursing home or other care.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Since my appointment as Minister of State, I have been encouraging the authority and the health boards to introduce personal care packages for older people as an alternative to long-stay residential care. Personal care packages are specifically designed for the individual concerned and could possibly include the provision of a home help service, home subvention payments, arrangements for attendance at a day centre or day hospital and other services such as twilight nursing. Personal care packages allow older persons the option of remaining living in their own <Col N="260" />home rather than going into long-stay residential care.</P>
    <P>The home first scheme referred to by the Deputy is being piloted in the Northern Area Health Board. This service is being targeted at older people to help support the transition from acute hospital care to living at home. High levels of support are provided to the individual for a particular period when such support is needed, using assistive technology.</P>
    <P>A home care grant project is being piloted in the East Coast and Northern Area Health Board areas and the pilots are currently being evaluated by Trinity College Dublin on behalf of the Eastern Regional Health Authority. The Deputy might also be interested to note that I formally launched the Slán Abhaile programme in the East Coast Area Health Board in early November and that this initiative is being undertaken by the board in partnership with the Royal Hospital, Donnybrook and St. Vincent's Hospital.</P>

      <P>Last week I announced that the national treatment purchase fund will be assuming the lead role in targeting reductions in waiting times for patients. To date, the NTPF has arranged treatments for approximately 9,000 patients. Based on the findings of a survey undertaken by the NTPF, satisfaction among those patients who have availed of the services being provided by the NTPF appears to be very high.</P>
      <P>I am confident that having a single funding stream through the NTPF to reduce waiting times for patients will ensure an efficient use of resources and guarantee good value for money from the funding being provided.</P>

The NTPF has also undertaken an information campaign among general practitioners and hospital doctors to raise awareness of the fund. Liaison officers are also in place at individual hospital level to identify those patients who may qualify for treatment under the NTPF.

      <P>The National Treatment Purchase Fund is used for the purpose of treating public patients who have been waiting longest for operations. The initial target for the NTPF was to concentrate on those adults who had been waiting more than 12 months and those children who had been waiting more than six months for operations. To date, more than 9,000 patients have received treatment under the NTPF.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My Department has been informed by the NTPF that in general health boards outside the Eastern <Col N="265" />Regional Health Authority area have achieved the initial target of treating adults who have been waiting more than 12 months and children waiting more than six months. St. James's Hospital in Dublin also reports that there are no in-patients waiting more than 12 months for treatment.</P>
    <P>Where the target has been achieved, the NTPF has agreed to allow those agencies reduce the threshold to six months for adults and three months for children in line with health strategy targets. The NTPF has informed my Department that in the case of general practitioners or individual patients who contact the NTPF on its Locall number, 1890 720 820, patients will be facilitated if they have been on an in-patient waiting list for an operation for six months in the case of adults or three months in the case of children. Patients are made aware that it may not always be possible to arrange for them to have their treatment locally and it may be necessary to have the procedure elsewhere. My Department has requested that the NTPF provide details on the number of patients treated to the Deputy.</P>

The BreastCheck clinical unit in the southern area will be located at South Infirmary, Victoria Hospital, with three associated mobile units. Counties covered include Cork, Kerry, Limerick, Waterford and Tipperary S.R. The BreastCheck clinical unit in the Western area will be at University College Hospital Galway, with two associated mobile units. The area of coverage is counties Galway, Sligo, Roscommon, Donegal, Mayo, Leitrim, Clare and Tipperary N.R. Under the extension, approximately 150,000 women in the target population of 50 to 64 years of age will be eligible for screening. The programme expects to diagnose approximately 360 cancers per annum among this population.</P>

A project team was established in May 2001 to progress this development. The project team has identified the preferred site for this development on land attached to Tralee General Hospital.

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy is aware, the provision of orthodontic treatment services is the responsibility of the health boards or the Eastern Regional Health Authority in the first instance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In June 2002 my Department provided additional funding of &euro;5 million from the treatment purchase fund towards the treatment of persons on the orthodontic waiting lists. My Depart<Col N="271" />ment instructed the health boards or authority that the funding was to be allocated on the basis of the following principles: treatment of clients longest on the waiting list in accordance with the severity of their treatment need; allocation to provide additional treatments over and above what was provided in the normal way; efficiency and value for money; and equitable delivery across health board populations.</P>
    <P>I am pleased to advise the Deputy that I have taken a number of measures to improve orthodontic services on a national basis. The grade of specialist in orthodontics has been created in the health board orthodontic service. This year my Department and the health boards are funding 13 dentists from different health boards for specialist in orthodontics qualifications at training programmes in Ireland and at three separate universities in the United Kingdom. These 13 trainees for the public orthodontic service are additional to the six dentists who commenced their training in 2001. Thus, there is an aggregate of 19 public service dentists currently in training for specialist in orthodontics qualifications. These measures will complement the other structural changes being introduced into the orthodontic service, including the creation of an auxiliary grade of orthodontic therapist to work in the orthodontic area.</P>
    <P>Furthermore, the commitment of the Department to training development is manifested in the funding provided to both the training of specialist clinical staff and the recruitment of a professor in orthodontics for the Cork Dental School. This appointment at the school will facilitate the development of an approved training programme leading to specialist qualification in orthodontics. In recognition of the importance of this post at the Cork Dental School, my Department has given approval in principle to a proposal from the school to further substantially improve the training facilities there for orthodontics. This project should see the construction of a large orthodontic unit and support facilities. It will ultimately support an enhanced teaching and treatment service to the wider region under the leadership of the professor of orthodontics.</P>
    <P>The chief executive officers of the health boards or authority have informed me that at the end of the September quarter 2003 there were 20,784 children receiving orthodontic treatment in the public orthodontic service. This compares with 20,151 children receiving treatment at the end of December 2002. I expect that the number of children getting orthodontic treatment from the health boards or authority will continue to increase over time as the measures that I have put in place take effect.</P>

      <P>Persons suffering from any of the following conditions, who are not already medical card holders, may obtain without charge drugs and medicines for the treatment of that condition under the long-term illness scheme: mental handicap, mental illness for persons under 16 years only, phenylketonuria, cystic fibrosis, spina bifida, hydrocephalus, diabetes mellitus, diabetes insipidus, haemophilia, cerebral palsy, epilepsy, multiple sclerosis, muscular dystrophies, parkinsonism, thalidomide and acute leukaemia. There are no plans to amend the scheme to include persons with lupus.</P>
      <P>People who cannot, without undue hardship, arrange for the provision of medical services for themselves and their dependants may be entitled to a medical card. Eligibility for a medical card is solely a matter for the chief executive officer of the relevant health board to decide. In determining eligibility, a chief executive officer has regard to the applicant's financial circumstances. Health boards use income guidelines to assist in determining eligibility. Where a person's income exceeds the guidelines a medical card may be awarded if a chief executive officer considers that the person's medical needs or other circumstances justifies it. Medical cards may also be issued to family members on this basis.</P>
      <P>Non-medical card holders, and people with conditions not covered under the scheme, can use the drugs payment scheme. Under the scheme no individual or family unit pays more than &euro;70 per calendar month towards the cost of approved prescribed medicines.</P>

I am advised by Iarnród Éireann that in considering these figures the Deputy should bear in mind that the recording of SPADs has improved due to advances in technology such as data recorders and automatic <Col N="275" />SPAD alarms. It also advises that the increased figures for year to date 2003 are to a large extent explained by improved recording of SPADs caused by shunting in the area of Heuston Station. The improved recording arose as a result of the new signalling installed in that area as part of the recent major upgrading of the station.</P>

      <Quest>the consultation that has taken place between his Department and representatives of the motor trade, including such representative bodies as the Society of the Irish Motor Industry, concerning the implications of the transfer in September 2004 to an inclusive system of metrication whereby imperial measurements will be replaced with metric measurements with regard to speedometers and related instrumentation; if technical specifications have been prepared by his Department in order to facilitate the industry in pre-planning the transfer and making the necessary changes in the ordering of components from external suppliers; the co-ordination there is between his Department and the relevant Department in the United Kingdom in order to harmonise the transition, in view of the fact that suppliers regard both the British and Irish markets as one unit for the purposes of imperial instrumentation; the steps that need to be taken by all those engaged in the motor trade and its related ancillary activity in order to ensure that they are compliant with the requirements of EU regulations and directives in this regard; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <P>The technical specifications for speedometer equipment are laid down in European law under Directive 75/443/EEC as amended by Directive 97/39/EC. The directive provides, <i>inter alia,</i> that a speedometer shall display speed in metric values. Where speed is measured in imperial values speedometers may display speed in both metric and imperial values until such time as the member state's national legislation provides for metric units of measurement. With regard to passenger cars, the directive is already in force in Ireland as part of the whole vehicle type approval process that is also mandatory under European law.</P>
      <P>In line with their obligations under the WVTA process, authorised distributors of cars are already aware of the requirements relating to speedometers. The requirements of the speedometers directive will also apply to vehicles other than passenger cars from the changeover to metric units. Following further consultation with SIMI about arrangements for a smooth changeover, I intend to make the necessary regulations early in 2004.</P>

Irish Rail plans to allocate an additional 26 railcars to the commuter services operating on the Kildare to Heuston Station corridor that serves Clondalkin.</P>

    <P>The level of services through a station is an operational matter for Irish Rail. The company has informed me that as a result of the introduction of the new railcars and timetable, operational from 14 December, there will be 17 services daily in each direction between Clondalkin and Heuston Station. Under the present timetable there are only 16 services daily between Clondalkin and Heuston Station and 15 services daily in the opposite direction. The company will achieve an increase in capacity of 25% on services to and <Col N="277" />from Clondalkin Station with the increased frequencies and longer trains.</P>

      <P>Under the Road Traffic Act 1961 and the Road Traffic (Licensing of Drivers) Regulations 1999 to 2001, it is a matter for the appropriate licensing authority to determine the eligibility of a person for a driving licence and to issue licences.</P>
      <P>We have no detailed information on the individual concerned. There have been representations from time to time about his eligibility for a licence. An application for a driving licence must, <i>inter alia,</i> be accompanied by a certificate of competency issued by either a driver tester; the director cavalry corps or director supply and transport corps of the Defence Forces in respect of a person who, as a member of the Defence Forces within a period of five years prior to the date of application, held a permit issued by director cavalry corps or the director supply and transport corps to drive vehicles of the category to which the application relates; or the assistant commissioner (training) of the Garda Síochána in respect of a person who, as a member of the Garda Síochána within a period of five years prior to the date of application, held a certificate issued by or on behalf of the assistant commissioner to drive vehicles of the category to which the application relates, unless the applicant already holds a driving licence issued by a recognised state, which will be surrendered with the application.</P>

      <P>I have stated consistently that every effort should be made by Irish Rail to develop its rail freight business. Irish Rail's immediate priority is to achieve financial viability for its freight business. The company's strategy is to develop the profitable traffics such as bulk cement and mineral ore concentrates and reshape the loss-making container business. The company informs me that the fortunes of its freight operations have improved con<Col N="278" />siderably in recent times. It has secured two major contracts and is in the process of consolidating those markets which are financially sustainable. It also anticipates that the volume of pulp wood currently handled in Sligo will increase significantly next year.</P>
      <P>The allocation of individual pieces of equipment among different Irish Rail facilities is an operational matter for the company itself to decide. Irish Rail has informed me that while it is intended to transfer the container and keg handling operations to the Ballina and Claremorris depots, there are no plans to remove or sell the gantry crane in Sligo. Neither are there any plans to sell off Sligo's freight yard. The effect any of these necessary changes will have on Ireland's commitments under the Kyoto Agreement will be negligible.</P>

      <P>I set out my policy objectives for public transport reform in my November 2002 statement to the public transport partnership forum and to the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Transport in June 2003. These detailed proposals can be summarised as follows: as Minister I will continue to set the overall regulatory policy and approve the broad public transport investment strategy; within that regulatory and investment framework, an independent body will be established to procure public transport services, regulate public transport and allocate current and capital funding for specific purposes from an overall allocation provided by the Exchequer; franchising will be the primary means of procuring bus services in the greater Dublin area; the independent body will also regulate public transport fares and set and enforce quality standards for public transport services. CIE will be dissolved and Bus Átha Cliath, Bus Éireann, and Iarnród Éireann will be established as independent commercial State companies with strong commercially focused boards.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Responsibility for the funding of concessionary travel lies with the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs. The proposed introduction of franchising will have no impact on elderly persons who avail of bus passes or members of the public who avail of yearly passes. Discussions on reform of the regulatory framework for public transport are currently taking place between my Department and the CIE trade unions and the managements of Bus Átha Cliath and Bus Éireann. As I have indicated a number of times, it is my intention to proceed with the <Col N="279" />necessary legislation in 2004 and technical preparatory work on this is under way in my Department.</P>

      <P>The programme for Government contains a commitment to the establishment of a dedicated traffic corps. As I have already indicated in the House, I support the implementation of this proposal through the formation of a corps that will be separately identifiable and visible. A consultation process, involving my Department, the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform and the Garda Síochána, on the establishment of a dedicated traffic corps is in progress. The question of the relationship the corps will have with the Garda and in particular whether it will be under the overall control of the Commissioner is central to the development of this proposal.</P>
      <P>The establishment of a dedicated traffic corps which is independent of the Garda would require the introduction of legislation, in particular to establish the powers and functions of the corps and its accountability. A working group has been established to urgently consider the options available in terms of advancing this proposal. This group comprises representatives from the Department of Transport, the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, the Garda Síochána, the Dublin Transportation Office and the Office of the Director of Traffic.</P>

      <P>The rural transport initiative, RTI, provides funding for voluntary and community organisations and community partnerships to address the particular transport needs of their rural areas through a number of pilot projects. The initiative is being managed by Area Development Management Limited, ADM, on behalf of my Department.

    <P>I understand from ADM that there are four RTI projects providing rural transport services on six islands off the coast. These are Comharchumann Chléire, which is operating on Clear Island, County Cork; Síob Teoranta, which is operating on Aranmore and Tory Islands, County Donegal; Bealach Teoranta, which is operating on Inishmore, County Galway; and Meitheal Mhaigh Eo Teoranta, which is operating on Inishbiggle and <Col N="280" />Clare Islands, County Mayo. More than 2,000 passengers are carried on more than 400 services that are provided monthly on these islands under the RTI.</P>

      <P>The authorised number of driver testers, including a chief tester and supervisory testers, is 130. A panel for driver testers was formed in 1998 after the Civil Service Commission held a competition for this position. This panel has now been exhausted. While my Department has no immediate plans to initiate a competition for driver testers, the position is reviewed regularly having regard to current and future requirements of the driver testing service.</P>
      <P>Recruitment to these positions is carried out centrally by the Office of the Civil Service and Local Appointments Commissioners and persons can register their interest on the <i>www.publicjobs.ie</i>website. Once a person registers his interest, he will be notified automatically when a competition is announced. Any proposed competition will also be advertised in the <i>Irish Independent</i> on a Thursday or in <i>The Irish Times</i> on a Friday. In order to deal with the increased level of demand for driving tests my Department, following consultation with the Department of Finance, introduced a bonus scheme in June 2003. The scheme provided for bonus payments per additional test conducted with payment conditional on delivery of a minimum number of additional tests. In addition, my Department has recruited eight retired driver testers who commenced testing with effect from 13 October.</P>

      <P>The importance of prisoners maintaining contact with family and friends in the community must also be taken into account. Telephone facilities for prisoners have been consistently recommended by experts as a measure to assist in rehabilitation and prevent suicide and self-injury generally.

    </Speaker>
    <P>I am informed by the Registrar of Titles that the application referred to by the Deputy is an application for a duplicate land certificate which was lodged on 29 March, 2001. Application No. D2001CR002332V refers. I am further informed that the actual land certificate which was missing related to another folio, which now forms part of the folio umber referred to by the Deputy and that, on foot of ongoing correspondence with the lodging solicitor, the solicitor informed the Land Registry that the land certificate was located on <Col N="284" />8 October 2003. On 13 October 2003 the application for a duplicate land certificate in this regard was withdrawn.</P>
    <P>An application for a new land certificate on the folio number referred to by the Deputy was lodged on 9 October 2003. Application No. S2003CR000936D refers. I understand that this land certificate cannot issue until the transfer of part pending on this folio, which was lodged on 30 September 2003, has been completed. &nbsp; Dealing No. D2003CR008496U refers. However, I can assure the Deputy that these applications are receiving attention in the Land Registry. I refer the Deputy to my reply to Parliamentary Question No. 275, of Tuesday, 25 November 2003.</P>
    <P>A grant application for capital grant assistance from the 2000-2006 equal opportunities child care programme was received from this private childcare provider in August 2003. All applications for grant assistance undergo a thorough assessment and appraisal process against the programme criteria by Area Development Management Ltd. I have made enquiries with the childcare directorate and have been informed that this applicant has recently submitted the outstanding information which is required to enable the assessment process to continue.</P>
    <P>When the appraisal process is completed, this application will be considered by the programme appraisal committee, chaired by my Department, for a recommendation before I make a final decision. It would be premature of me to comment further on this application for capital grant assistance to the completion of its appraisal.</P>

      <P>Women are under-represented in many decision-making fora, including those dealing with conflict resolution. However, the resolution of the most intractable conflicts in the world is a complex matter, to which the contribution of increased numbers of women, is just one element. Under the equality for women measure of the national development plan, my Department is funding a positive action programme which promotes equality for women in a number of areas, including gender balance in decision making. A sum of &euro;254,000 has been <Col N="286" />allocated to three political parties, Fianna Fáil, Fine Gael and Sinn Féin. These parties are being funded to develop initiatives designed to increase the participation of women in politics.

      <P>A review of the maternity protection legislation was carried out in 2000 by a working group, chaired by my Department, which comprised the social partners and relevant Departments and agencies. The working group was set up in accordance with commitments in the An Action Programme for the Millennium and the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness. The report of the working group on the review and improvement of the maternity protection legislation was published in February 2001.</P>
      <P>Significant improvements have already resulted from the review of the legislation in that paid maternity leave was increased from 14 weeks to 18 weeks in March 2001 and unpaid maternity leave from four to eight weeks. The outstanding recommendations of the working group have been incorporated into the Maternity Protection (Amendment) Bill 2003, which was published and initiated in Seanad Éireann on 2 May 2003. The Bill is currently progressing through the Seanad and is scheduled for Committee Stage this afternoon. It is expected to be enacted early in 2004.</P>
      <P>The Parental Leave Act 1998 implemented the Parental Leave Directive 96/34/EC. The Act provides for an individual and non-transferable entitlement to both parents for 14 weeks unpaid leave from work to take care of children up to age five years. In accordance with section 28 of the Parental Leave Act 1998 and a commitment in the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness, my Department chaired a working group which undertook a review of the Parental Leave Act 1998 in 2001. The working group comprised the social partners, relevant Departments and the Equality Authority. The report of the working group on the review of the Parental Leave Act 1998 was published on 29 April 2002 and is available at <i>www.justice.ie</i> Paternity leave was considered by the working group, taking into account the following issues: reconciliation of work and family life and balanced participation of men and women in work and family life; cost to employers; and the comparative situation in EU member states.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While acknowledging that a statutory arrangement to provide an entitlement to time off for fathers at the time of childbirth would enhance arrangements for the reconciliation of work and family life, the group could not reach <Col N="287" />consensus on the issue and there are no plans at present to introduce statutory paternity leave. Notwithstanding the absence of a statutory entitlement, many employees in both the public and private sectors have arrangements in place to provide short periods of paid paternity leave.</P>

      <P>I am informed by the Garda authorities that 136 burglaries have been committed in homes in the Coolock area in the year 2003 to date. This is a substantial drop on the 2002 figure which was 234 on the same date last year. Nineteen suspects have been arrested and charged with a number of these crimes and further investigations are taking place into the unsolved burglaries.</P>
      <P>I am also informed that drugs with a total estimated value of &euro;20,883,370 have been seized in the area, and that 278 people have been charged with drug related offences. These figures are provisional and subject to verification. The Coolock area continues to benefit from a substantial policing programme designed to cope with crime patterns in the area. Garda management continues to review the level of policing to ensure that a sufficient and appropriate allocation of manpower is deployed at all times in the Coolock district.</P>

      <P>There are almost 900 civilian clerical and administrative staff employed as a support to the Garda Síochána.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In November 1997 the Government accepted in principle the recommendations set out in the report of the steering group on the efficiency and effectiveness of the Garda Síochána. That review was conducted in the framework of the strategic <Col N="289" />management initiative, SMI, across the public service. The report contained a number of recommendations requiring a more comprehensive development of issues relating to the organisation, operations, financing and performance and accountability of the Garda Síochána.</P>
    <P>The report recognised the potential for further civilianisation within the force. It stated that the concept behind the introduction of civilianisation was to allow for certain jobs to be done at a more economic cost and to free up gardaí for work more suited to their training and development, while at the same time increasing the operational capacity of the force.</P>
    <P>As the Deputy will be aware, in October, 2001 the Government approved the report of the SMI steering group on civilianisation in the Garda Síochána which recommended a programme of civilianisation of 496 technical and administrative posts occupied by gardaí to allow for the release of Garda members to operational policing. These posts are located in Garda Headquarters, in the Garda College and in districts and divisions throughout the country. The civilianisation report also provides for the transfer of finance functions from the Garda district clerks to civilians, and the subsequent upgrading of the new civilian role to staff officer.</P>
    <P>A working group, comprising representatives of the Garda Síochána and my Department, is overseeing implementation of the report. It is envisaged that the posts will be civilianised on a phased basis over a number of years. A number of posts have been identified to commence this process and it is envisaged that the remaining posts will thereafter be civilianised on a phased basis. However, in this regard, the Department must remain within Government guidelines as to public service numbers.</P>

      <Quest>the number of persons awaiting to avail of free legal aid for separation and divorce; the average waiting time; and the additional resources his Department is proposing to supply to reduce this waiting time.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. McDowell Mr. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. McDowell)</NameTxt>
      <P>I can inform the Deputy that the Legal Aid Board does not maintain records of the number of people awaiting particular legal remedies. &nbsp;However, it does record the length of time the person longest on the waiting list at each law centre has waited. For the Deputy's information the table below shows the length of time the person longest on the waiting list has waited as of October, 2003 for each law centre. &nbsp;</P>
      <P>The Deputy will be aware that the allocation to the Legal Aid Board for 2004 has increased by 5% to &euro;18.388 million. This increase follows a pattern of increased funding to the Legal Aid Board since 1997. &nbsp;The 2004 grant-in-aid for the board represents an increase of 71% in funding since 1997. &nbsp; When an increase of this magnitude is compared to an increase of just 26.63% in the consumer price index during the period from January 1997 to October of this year, the Deputy will agree that in recent years the Legal Aid Board has received significantly increased resources in real terms. In addition, the board now has sanction to employ 89 solicitors throughout its law centre network, an increase of eight solicitor posts during the period in question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I can also inform the Deputy that the board operates a procedure whereby priority is accorded for certain categories of cases, for example, domestic violence, child-care, child abduction and other cases where there are time limits. These cases are dealt with immediately and such applicants are not placed on a waiting list. Such a system for priority treatment is necessary to ensure that persons subjected to domestic violence and cases involving the care of children are provided with a speedy service. &nbsp; It is important to note that in 2002 priority appointments offered by law centres was approximately 22% of the <Col N="292" />total number of appointments offered to new clients during the year.</P>
    <P>In addition managing solicitors at law centres have authority to give priority to any case on the waiting list at their centre. For example, if an applicant is gravely ill or in cases where an applicant is in danger of losing assets or of losing title to a legal remedy if services are delayed, the managing solicitor can accord such case priority status.</P>
    <P>I can also assure the Deputy that the Legal Aid Board continuously monitors the operation of its law centre network and where waiting times at any law centre, for whatever reason, become excessive the position is examined by the board with a view to taking remedial action.</P>

      <P>The Government remains committed to bringing forward a disability Bill which will underpin the principle of mainstreaming and provide for positive action measures to remove barriers to equal participation for people with disabilities.</P>
      <P>Given the complex and crosscutting issues involved, the process of overseeing the preparation of the disability Bill has been referred to a Cabinet sub-committee. The process has required co-ordination on a significant scale across Departments with a view to facilitating publication as a matter of priority now that the Education for Persons with Disabilities Bill 2003 has been published. The intention is that the Bill will be ready for publication before the Dáil resumes after the Christmas recess.</P>
      <P>The Taoiseach met with the Disability Legislation Consultation Group, DLCG, on 28 November 2003 to advise it accordingly. The DLCG is a group representative of people with disabilities, their families, carers and service providers. It was brought together by the National Disability Authority, NDA, to facilitate dialogue at national level.</P>

The other locations are, in alphabetical order: Athlone, Ballyfermot, Bray, Carlow, Castlebar, Clondalkin, Dundalk, Dun Laoghaire, Ennis, Finglas, Galway, Kilkenny, Limerick, Sligo, Tallaght and Waterford.</P>
      <P>The contract for the supply, installation and commissioning of a Garda CCT system for Bray, Dundalk, Dún Laoghaire, Finglas, Galway and Limerick &ndash; and the associated civil works &ndash; was awarded at the end of March 2002 to SKS Communications Limited following a competitive tender competition in accordance with EU and national procurement rules.</P>
      <P>The pre-tender process for the CCTV systems in Athlone, Clondalkin, Tallaght and Waterford is at an advanced stage. The requests for tender and detailed technical specification documents are currently being drafted by the superintendent in charge, telecommunications section at Garda Headquarters, taking into account the experience of other Garda CCTV systems and technological developments in this field.</P>
      <P>The planning for the installation of CCTV system for Clonmel is currently ongoing. No applications have been received by the CCTV advisory committee concerning Carrick-On-Suir or Tipperary Town. Should any applications be received, they will be considered in due course by the committee.</P>

      <P>I have been informed by the Garda authorities, who are responsible for the detailed allocation of resources, including personnel that local Garda management is very much aware of the community policing and other needs in both the Clonmel district and in the Tipperary division overall. The Clonmel youth diversion project, which was established in April 2001 is a Garda-community partnership initiative designed to address issues of youth criminality and disorder and is an example of a positive response by the gardaí to local needs.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="295" />Garda manning levels and personnel deployment are constantly kept under review by both local Garda management and by the Assistant Commissioner, human resource management. All decisions in relation to the deployment of additional personnel to Clonmel are made as a result of regular reviews and also by taking account of local needs.</P>
    <P>I have been further informed that the establishment of a community policing unit at Clonmel is under active consideration at present. However, any decision in relation to the provision of additional resources must be taken with regard to the demands from other areas within the division and the country as a whole.</P>

Mandatory drug testing can at an individual level identify those persons engaged in the use of intravenous drugs within the prison environment, and can at an institutional level provide prison management with important information on the levels of drug taking in prisons. &nbsp;I am satisfied that drug testing has a valuable contribution to make to the strategy for tackling heroin use among prisoners.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 312 and 325 together.</P>
      <P>Preparations for the 2004 local and European Parliament elections are continuing and my Department is, in the normal way, in contact with local authority officials and returning officers regarding their responsibilities. Comprehensive guidance documentation has issued to local authority returning officers and further documentation will be sent to European returning officers, local European returning officers and presiding officers which will, <i>inter alia,</i> provide advice on accessibility issues. My Department has also arranged for the procurement of customised tables for the voting machines with a tilt facility for easier access for people with a physical disability, and in particular, for persons using wheelchairs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Electoral law already provides for several measures covering accessibility to polling buildings. The Electoral (Amendment) Act 1996 provides that local authorities, in making polling schemes, shall endeavour to appoint polling places where at least one polling station is accessible to wheelchair users. The Act also requires <Col N="299" />that, &ldquo;The returning officer shall, where practicable, provide polling stations which are accessible to wheelchair users.&rdquo;, and must, in addition, &ldquo;where practicable, give public notice of all polling stations which are inaccessible to wheelchair users not later than the eighth day before polling day.&rdquo; If an elector has difficulty gaining access to a polling station, the person may apply in writing for authorisation to vote at another polling station in the same constituency or local electoral area.</P>
    <P>Once in the polling station, persons with a physical disability or with a literacy difficulty may avail of companion voting or may seek the assistance of the presiding officer. Alternatively, if a person has a physical disability or illness which prevents him or her from going to the polling station, the person can vote by post if he or she applies to be included in the postal voters list which is drawn up each year as part of the register of electors.</P>

      <P>I recently announced the award of a contract for the carrying out of a pavement condition study of the non-national road network and a review of pavement management systems, to a consortium headed by RPS-MCOS Ltd., consulting engineers, at a cost of &euro;734,180. The costs of the study will be met from the local govern<Col N="302" />ment fund administered by my Department resulting in no direct cost to the Exchequer.</P>
      <P>The purpose of the study is to establish, by county and nationally, the lengths and areas of various categories of non-national roads requiring remedial works. The output from the study will be the length, average width and area, on an engineering area by engineering area basis, of regional roads, local primary roads, local secondary roads and local tertiary roads needing surface restoration, road reconstruction or restoration of skid resistance. This study is essentially a needs analysis which is critical to the proper planning of the non-national roads programmes over the coming years. The consultants are also being asked to review existing pavement management systems and recommend a single one for use by local authorities on the non-national road network. This is intended to assist local authorities in prioritising schemes for inclusion in the restoration programme. Work on the study and review has now commenced and it is expected that preliminary results will be available by mid 2004.</P>

      <P>In July 2003, very high radon concentrations were identified in a house located close to the town of Castleisland, County Kerry. The Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland subsequently wrote to the approximately 2,500 householders in the four ten kilometre by ten kilometre grid squares closest to the town to inform them of the finding and to advise them that they should have their own house measured for radon. Based on the national radon survey carried out by the RPII in the 1990s, two of these grid squares are classified as high radon areas, with between 10% and 20% of houses predicted to exceed the reference level of 200 becquerels per cubic metre. In the other two grid squares, less than 10% of houses are predicted to exceed the reference level.</P>
      <P>By way of response to the RPII letters, approximately 400 householders have requested radon measurements. This is in addition to the 80 measurements made in these four grid squares as part of the national radon survey. Kerry County Council has also commissioned approximately 90 measurements in respect of local authority housing in the area. Following a presentation made by the RPII at a public meeting in Castleisland on 20 November 2003, additional requests for measurements from a number of people living locally have been received.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="303" />Measurements in all houses take a minimum period of three months each and the first results will become available in late December 2003. Once all measurements have been completed and the householders informed, the RPII will evaluate the results obtained and assess the implications for the local population.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government (Mr. Cullen)</NameTxt>
      <P>The carrying out of radon measurements in respect of workplaces is a matter for the employer.</P>
      <P>In 1998 the Department of Education and Science commissioned the Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland to carry out a survey of radon concentration levels in primary and post primary schools. As a result of this survey, the Department of Education is currently carrying out a programme of radon remediation in respect of schools identified as having high radon concentration levels. Those schools which did not participate in the survey have been issued with invitations by the RPII to have radon measurements carried out and the measurement programme is expected to commence in January 2004.</P>
      <P>In so far as hospitals and nursing homes are concerned, I am not aware of any radon measurement programme in place. I understand from the Department of Health and Children that some health boards have undertaken surveys and carried out the necessary remedial works. The procurement of health facilities requires compliance with the technical guidance document C, site preparation and resistance to moisture, of the building regulations 1997 as published by my Department.</P>
      <P>Radon in workplaces is subject to regulatory control as set out in the Radiological Protection Act 1991 (Ionising Radiation) Order 2000. The RPII is responsible for the enforcement of this order in Ireland. It specifies a concentration for radon gas in workplaces of 400 becquerels per cubic metre &ndash; Bq/m³ &ndash; averaged over a minimum period of three months. Where workplaces are found to have concentrations greater than this value, employers must evaluate whether remedial action to reduce the radon concentration to less than 400 Bq/m³ is justified. Under the order, the RPII has the authority to direct employers responsible for underground workplaces, above ground workplaces in high radon areas, and other workplaces which may be identified by the RPII as liable to have radon concentrations in excess of 400 Bq/m³, to carry out radon measurements.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In addition, the Safety, Health and Welfare at Work Act 1989 requires employers to identify the <Col N="304" />hazards at their workplace, assess the risk to health and safety from these hazards and put in place measures to eliminate or reduce the risk. Where radon gas is identified as a hazard in the workplace the employer has a duty, as with any other hazard, to assess the risk and eliminate or reduce that risk. There is a general duty on employers in high radon areas to include radon in their risk assessment. This means that in order to comply with health and safety legislation, radon measurements should be carried out in indoor workplaces in these areas.</P>
    <P>It is important to note that radon concentrations above the 400 Bq/m³ reference level for workplaces can be found in any part of the country. The RPII urges all employers to adopt a pro-active approach and have radon measurements carried out in their workplace, regardless of its location. There is no direct evidence that older buildings are more likely to accumulate high radon concentrations and consequently the age of a building should not be used as a basis for deciding on whether or not to measure for radon.</P>

      <P>As part of the national survey of radon in domestic dwellings carried out by the Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland during the 1990s, measurements were made in ten houses in the ten kilometre by ten kilometre grid square containing the town of Annascaul, County Kerry. The average radon concentration for the ten houses was 109 Bq/m³, with one house showing radon concentration levels above the reference level of 200 Bq/m³. The RPII's data base of all radon measurements has results for 18 houses which include Annascaul as part of the address. Of these, three exceeded the reference level and the maximum radon concentration level was 356 Bq/m³. Based on these data, the grid square in which Annascaul is located is defined as a high radon area with 16% of all houses predicted to exceed the reference level.</P>
      <P>The RPII has actively encouraged householders in those areas designated as high radon areas to have their house measured for radon levels if they have not already done so. The RPII has also advised that householders who have a radon concentration above the reference level should consider taking remedial action in respect of their house. Over the years, significant resources have been committed by Government to assessing the extent of the radon problem throughout the country and to heightening public awareness of radon.</P>

      <P>The figures quoted by the Society of St. Vincent de Paul are primarily based on an analysis undertaken by the Economic and Social Research Institute of the results of the Living in Ireland surveys. They relate to the &ldquo;risk of poverty&rdquo; indicator which is amongst the key common indicators adopted at EU level to facilitate cross-country analysis. The risk of poverty rate is defined by reference to an income threshold set at 60% of median income, adjusted for family size and composition using equivalence scales. The analysis undertaken by the ESRI indicates that in 2001, some 21.9% of persons had incomes which fell below that threshold while for children, the number was 23.4%. This equates to some 280,000 children. However, the measure which underpins the National Anti-Poverty Strategy (NAPS) is the consistent poverty measure, independently formulated by the ESRI. This combines low incomes and enforced deprivation, that is, below 50% to 60% of average disposable income and lacking at least one of a set of eight basic deprivation indicators. In 2001, the level of consistent poverty amongst children had fallen to some 6.5% or around 74,000 children.</P>

      <P>Under the terms of the supplementary welfare allowance scheme, which is administered on behalf of my Department by the health boards, payment of a weekly or monthly supplement may be made in respect of rent to eligible people in the State whose means are insufficient to meet their needs after they pay their rent. The purpose of the supplementary welfare scheme is to deal with emergencies and short-term needs that arise when a person has a change in circumstances, for example when a tenant becomes unemployed and can no longer afford their rent.</P>
      <P>Rent supplements were never intended to meet a person's long-term housing needs. Despite this the scheme has, over the years, become in effect a form of housing support. It does not make sense to have two parallel but entirely separate programmes one operated by the housing authorities and the other by the health boards. The rent supplement scheme does not give a good long-term outcome to individuals. They have limited security of tenure, accommodation standards can sometimes be poor and they must remain on social welfare in order to retain their accommodation. The scheme does not give a good outcome to the State either as it provides poor long-term value for money and in effect it by-passes the priorities set by the local authorities in their housing programmes.</P>
      <P>This is why I have taken a number of initiatives in this area, including the provision that a person must have been renting for six months. Rent supplement will be payable only where the person has been in rented accommodation for a period of six months at the time of application. Provision will be made for cases where a housing authority designates that a person is homeless, or a person has been identified by a housing authority as having a housing need which cannot be met by the housing authority, a voluntary housing organisation or by the person concerned. This will help re-focus the rent supplement scheme on its original objective of short-term income maintenance.</P>
      <P>In the course of implementing these measures, particular care will be taken to ensure that the interests of vulnerable groups, such as the homeless, the elderly and people with disabilities are fully protected. The measures will be implemented in the context of a greater role for housing authorities in meeting the long-term housing needs of people who currently rely on rent supplement, particularly the vulnerable groups mentioned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are ongoing discussions between my Department and the Departments of Environment, Heritage and Local Government and Finance, on the future of rent assistance and in particular the role of local authorities in that regard. These discussions follow on the recommendations made in the report of the inter-departmental committee on the administration of rent assistance which reported in <Col N="310" />1999. In addition, a number of projects are under way, involving close co-operation between the relevant housing authority, the health board and my Department at local level, with a view to achieving improved co-ordination of existing arrangements for housing support and a better outcome for rent supplement recipients.</P>

      <P>The person concerned was in receipt of unemployment assistance until 20 September 2003 when his payment was  uspended following his failure to provide information regarding his means. It has since come to light that in addition to his continued engagement in self-employment, the person concerned has also been engaged in employment on a part-time basis as a home help. He did not inform my Department of this. My Department has established that the person concerned has current earnings in excess of &euro;100 per week in respect of his part-time employment as a home help. These matters have been investigated and are now being considered by a deciding officer who will shortly make a decision with regard to his entitlement.</P>

      <Quest>the impact of the change announced in her Estimates that the earnings threshold for unemployment benefit and disability benefit will be increased from ?88.88 to ?150.</Quest>
      <QRef>[28981/03]</QRef>
    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan" hpid="Mary Coughlan Mary Coughlan">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Social and Family Affairs (Mary Coughlan)</NameTxt>
      <P>The purpose of the increase in the earnings threshold for unemployment and disability purposes, which was announced as part of the recent Estimates decisions, is to remove a disincentive to employment that has developed in the operation of both of these payments for workers on low earnings.</P>
      <P>Following the extension of full social insurance cover to part-time workers earning in excess of &euro;31.17 a week from April 1991, a range of measures was introduced in the case of the short-term disability and unemployment benefit schemes in order to ensure that disincentives to employment were not created. In the absence of these measures, a situation would have existed whereby many workers on low incomes would have had access to weekly social welfare payments which would have greatly exceeded their income from employment. For instance, while someone earning &euro;31.17 a week or more would have been liable for PRSI class A contributions, the maximum personal rates of unemployment and disability benefit available to them from January 1993 was &euro;70.60 a week, that is, the social welfare benefits available would have been more than twice the level of income from employment for some people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In order to overcome the potential disincentives involved, new arrangements were introduced with effect from January 1993 so as to relate the rate of benefit payable to the level of the claimant's earnings. A new contribution condition was introduced for the purposes of qualification for disability and unemployment benefit which requires claimants to have reckonable earnings in excess of &euro;88.88 a week <Col N="312" />in the relevant income tax year. Where the reckonable weekly earnings are &euro;88.88 or more, benefit is paid at the full rate. However, where the reckonable weekly earnings are less than &euro;88.88, the personal and qualified adult rates of payment are paid at reduced rates, known as the graduated rates. Paying reduced rates of benefit to people with earnings below the &euro;88.88 threshold therefore, ensures that there is an incentive to return to work following spells of illness or unemployment.</P>
    <P>Since 1993, the graduated rates of payment have been uprated annually in line with the general increases in disability and unemployment benefits. However, the &euro;88.88 weekly earnings threshold and the related reduced earnings bands have not been adjusted in the interim. All of the current graduated personal rates of disability and unemployment benefit are now higher than the associated average weekly earnings bands, by between &euro;8.92 and &euro;36.16 a week. At these levels, the current weekly earnings threshold and graduated payment rates represent a serious disincentive to employment.</P>
    <P>The increase in the earnings threshold to &euro;150 a week announced in the recent Estimates, together with the related reduced earnings bands, will make substantial progress towards removing these employment disincentives. These measures will only apply to new applicants from January 2004. It is estimated that in any given week approximately 10,300, on average, will be affected across the relevant schemes in 2004. Estimated net savings of &euro;7.4 million, which take account of potential extra spending on unemployment assistance and supplementary welfare allowance will result from this measure in 2004.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan" hpid="Mary Coughlan Mary Coughlan">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Social and Family Affairs (Mary Coughlan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very conscious of the pressures on families and family life arising from the major changes taking place in our society. These include demographic, social and cultural changes, economic developments, technological innovation, changing employment patterns, migration, the quest for equality between men and women, and widening opportunities for women.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="315" />In Ireland one of the most significant recent changes affecting family life has been the substantial growth in female employment. Over the past 20 years it has more than doubled among women in the younger age groups, to reach a stage where it is now above the EU average. I very much welcome these developments. They provide many women with equal opportunities with men in all spheres of life and especially greater economic independence. The income generated also contributes significantly to improving the family's standard of living.</P>
    <P>A major challenge, however, is how best can we support women and men in these situations reconcile work and family life especially where they have caring responsibilities for children and other dependent family members. Having children can have a significant impact on a couple's standard of living, and this is added to with larger families and for lone parents. Children in larger families and in lone parent families are at greatest risk of poverty. An economic downturn can exacerbate these problems for all families.</P>
    <P>Ireland currently has a comprehensive range of supports, both income and otherwise, for families. I am committed to maintaining these supports in real terms. However, these also require ongoing modernisation to meet the rapidly changing realities of modern life.</P>
    <P>As part of this modernisation process, I have launched a nation wide consultation on strengthening families and family life. This is currently taking place by means of a series of regional fora. These have already taken place in Donegal, Kilkenny, Cork and Galway, with the final forum scheduled for Dublin on 4 December. A thematic report on the outcome is due for publication in January to mark the tenth anniversary of the International Year of the Family. This will provide a basis for a further wider debate on strengthening families and family life during the international year.</P>
    <P>These changes to families and family life are not, of course, confined to Ireland, but are also occurring and being addressed in most other countries. To get a good international perspective on the matter and learn from the experience of other countries, Ireland has participated in an important OECD study on family friendly policies entitled, Bosses and Babies. The second volume of the study, featuring Ireland, Austria and Japan, has just been published and is already generating a lively and informed debate on the issues.</P>
    <P>I have also arranged for the Irish Presidency, in co-operation with the EU Commission, to host a major international conference entitled Families, Change and European Social Policy, to take place in Dublin on 13 and 14 May, to coincide with the eve of the International Day of the Family on 15 May. This is designed to provide the new enlarged EU of 25 member states with an opportunity to reflect on how we can strengthen families, and how member states can support each other in doing so.</P>
    <P>At the end of the debate and reflection at national and international levels, it is my inten<Col N="316" />tion to issue a comprehensive strategy for an integrated policy to strengthen families and family life in which full account will be taken of the findings of the process.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan" hpid="Mary Coughlan Mary Coughlan">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Social and Family Affairs (Mary Coughlan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 362 and 363 together.</P>
      <P>The Abridged Estimates Volume (AEV) for 2004 provides for total social welfare spending of &euro;10.65 billion. This represents an increase of &euro;358 million or 3.5% and on the 2003 published Estimate. This increase does not take into account any additional social welfare spending to be announced in the budget.</P>
      <P>In order to stay within Government spending guidelines, a number of policy measures were identified and announced as part of the Estimates process. I have no plans to announce further measures at this stage. It is estimated that the total value of savings from the measures in 2004 will be &euro;55.8 million or 0.5% of total spending.</P>
      <P>The specific policy measures are detailed, as follows, together with an estimate for its associated savings. The back to education allowance is being refocused on people who are long-term unemployed in that the qualifying period for the allowance is being increased from six months to 15 months in respect of the third level option, for all new claimants with effect from September 2004. Estimated savings are &euro;2.2 million in 2004. Transitional payments for recipients of the one parent family payment &ndash; where earnings rise over &euro;293 per week &ndash; will be discontinued from next January. Savings in 2004 will be &euro;1.3 million.</P>
      <P>An increase in the rate of the minimum contribution to be made by the recipient from &euro;12 to &euro;13 per week. This measure will result in savings of &euro;3 million in 2004. A measure which provides that if either of a couple is in full-time employment, they will be excluded from claiming rent/mortgage supplement will save &euro;1 million in 2004.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Health boards will be given the power to refuse rent supplement in cases where the applicant has not already been renting for a period of six <Col N="317" />months, with provision for exceptions in relation to e.g. the homeless and people who are at risk, with estimated net saving of &euro;10.5 million in 2004.</P>
    <P>Rent supplement claimants will be referred to the local authority to have their housing needs assessed. In addition, any applicant who has left or refused offers of local authority housing will be refused rent supplement. It is estimated that this will generate savings of approximately &euro;0.6 million in 2004.</P>
    <P>Payment of certain other supplements under the supplementary welfare scheme are being phased out or discontinued in the light of changes in the environment in which these supplements apply or where they have been applied beyond what was originally intended. This will apply to crèche, money advice and budgeting service and diet supplement, with savings of some &euro;2.3 million, &euro;0.7 million and &euro;1 million respectively in 2004.</P>
    <P>Entitlement to child dependent allowance will be discontinued in January 2004 in respect of unemployment benefit and disability benefit claims where the claimant's spouse-partner has gross weekly earnings in excess of &euro;300. This provision is estimated to save &euro;10.4 million.</P>
    <P>In the case of disability benefit, unemployment benefit and health and safety benefit, the weekly earnings threshold of &euro;88.88 for the purpose of payment of reduced rates which has not being adjusted in line with increases in benefit since its introduction in 1993 will be increased to &euro;150. The increase will result in net savings of &euro;7.4 million.</P>
    <P>Entitlement to the additional half rate payment of disability benefit, injury benefit, unemployment benefit, unemployability supplement, maternity benefit, adoptive benefit and health and safety benefit &ndash; currently payable at half rate &ndash; where the recipient is already in receipt of widow/er's pensions, lone parent payments etc., for new claimants, will be discontinued. A saving of &euro;5.8 million is estimated for 2004.</P>
    <P>From April 2004, the linking period for unemployment benefit and disability benefit claims will increase from 13 weeks to 26 weeks. This condition will apply to approximately a weekly average of 275 claimants and result in a saving of &euro;2 million.</P>
    <P>The underlying number of paid contributions required for entitlement to disability benefit, unemployment benefit and health and safety benefit will be increased from 39 to 52 paid contributions. &euro;2.5 million will be saved in 2004.</P>
    <P>Entitlement to unemployment benefit will be reduced from 15 months to 12 months where less than 260 social insurance contributions have been paid since first entering employment. This measure will save some &euro;5.2 million in 2004.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 364 and 365 together.</P>
      <P>The back to education allowance is a second chance education opportunities programme designed to encourage and facilitate certain groups who are receiving social welfare payments to improve their skills and qualifications and, therefore, their prospects of returning to the active work force.</P>
      <P>At present, to qualify for participation an applicant must be, <i>inter alia,</i> in receipt of a relevant social welfare payment for at least six months &ndash; 156 days. The qualifying period will be increased from six months (156 days) to 15 months &ndash; 390 days &ndash; for new applicants intending to commence third level courses of study, with effect from September 2004. The qualifying condition will remain at six months &ndash; 156 days &ndash; for people who wish to pursue a second level qualification. Time spent pursuing a second level course with the assistance of the back to education scheme will count towards meeting the 15-months qualification condition for the third level option.</P>
      <P>Participants already pursuing third level courses of study with the assistance of the scheme will not be affected by this change. I have decided to restructure the back to education allowance in this way to ensure that this support retains its focus on the more vulnerable groups in our community, particularly people who do not have a second level education qualification and who are at risk of becoming dependent on social welfare payments on a long-term basis. I want to ensure that available resources are aimed at those in greatest need of an intervention to prevent them from drifting into long-term unemployment. This change recognises the more urgent need for intervention in the case of people who have not completed formal second level education.</P>
      <P>It is estimated that savings accruing will be in the region of &euro;2.2 million in 2004. I believe that I have ensured, in a situation where priorities had to be set and choices made, that those in the greatest need of assistance under the BTEA scheme have been protected.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 366 to 368, inclusive, together.</P>
      <P>I announced a number of measures in relation to rent supplements when the Estimates for 2004 were published. Apart from the proposed increase of &euro;1 in the minimum contribution which, all rent supplement recipients are required to make towards their rent costs from their own resources, the measures being introduced will not affect tenants in the private rented sector who are already in receipt of a rent supplement.</P>
      <P>With regard to future claims, it is anticipated that in the region of 2,000 fewer claims for rent supplement will arise in 2004 as a result of the new measures. The legislation and regulations governing the rent supplement scheme require amendment to implement these measures. The necessary amending legislation will be introduced shortly and the measures are intended to apply from the beginning of next year.</P>

      <P>Payments under the scheme for the summer period were discontinued in 2003 for BTEA participants who were in receipt of an unemployment payment prior to participation in the scheme as many students traditionally find seasonal work at home or abroad during the summer months.

      <P>All other participants on the scheme &ndash; lone parents and people with disabilities &ndash; were unaffected by this decision and retained payment during the summer period. Estimated savings from the proposed changes in the eligibility criteria in 2004 is &euro;2 million.</P>
