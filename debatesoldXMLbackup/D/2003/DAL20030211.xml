    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 1 to 5, inclusive, together.</P>
      <P>There are no plans at present to hold referenda in 2003. The previous Government acted on most of the key recommendations that have emanated from the All-Party Committee on the Constitution. In all, the previous Government brought forward nine referenda on cabinet confidentiality, the Amsterdam treaty, the British-Irish Agreement, local government, the death penalty, the International Criminal Court, the protection of human life in pregnancy and the Nice treaty. Unfortunately, a proposed referendum on judicial oversight did not proceed due to lack of cross-party support in the Dáil.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="3" /> The Government will avail of any appropriate opportunity to take forward further recommendations of the all-party committee as the opportunity arises or if there is any particular issue which is pressing. The nature of the referendum process requires that careful consideration be given to the frequency with which referenda can realistically be held and the significance of the issue in question.</P>
    <P>On the specific matter of the committee's seventh progress report concerning Parliament, there are various different recommendations ranging from eligibility for membership of Dáil Éireann to changing the composition and functions of the Seanad. The recommendations mostly require changes in standing orders and procedures rather than constitutional change and could be implemented by changes to standing orders in the Dáil or Seanad &ndash; and this is a matter for the Houses themselves. I have asked the Government Chief Whip to consult other parties on the participation of Northern Ireland representatives in the Dáil and I will shortly meet the Leader of the Seanad who is anxious to progress reforms in that House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny" hpid="Mr. Kenny Mr. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenny:</NameTxt>
      <P>Now that the Convention on Europe has published most parts of a draft constitution, will the Taoiseach confirm that a referendum will be required to ratify that constitution? When does the Taoiseach envisage that will happen? Will it be held during the Italian Presidency or is it likely that he, as President, will deal with the treaty negotiations? What is the Government's attitude to the treaty containing references in whatever context to the words &ldquo;federal&rdquo; and &ldquo;federalism&rdquo;?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>On the matter of the Convention on Europe, we have only seen the first draft clauses of the treaty. It is premature to say when it will be finished or what it will contain. I said at Christmas that there is a possibility that the convention would be finished in the summer. If that is the case the Intergovernmental Conference will be held in the autumn. I think that has been put back a little because the Swedish Government has decided to hold a referendum on the euro currency in October.</P>
      <P>A number of referenda will be held during this year by all the applicant countries to deal with enlargement. It is thought to be highly unlikely that the Intergovernmental Conference will start even if the convention has finished. It is not certain but it seems there will be a break between the convention and the Intergovernmental Conference. That is not certain because the Italians are anxious to initiate the process during their Presidency and there is a strong possibility that will be the case. It could be put back to the Irish Presidency or even beyond but it is difficult to predict at this stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The question of whether we will require a referendum can only be considered when the pro<Col N="4" /> cess has finished. It is probably likely that a referendum will be required but I do not want to give a definitive answer on that matter.</P>
    <P>I am sure many issues will arise during the debate. Deputy Kenny will know that the federalist agenda for Europe is one that I have always argued against and will continue to do so.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny" hpid="Mr. Kenny Mr. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenny:</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to ask the Taoiseach a different question. Will he consider bringing forward legislation to amend the Referendum Act 1998 in light of the recommendation in the sixth report of the all-party committee on the Constitution that the Referendum Commission put the proposals for and against referenda? Will the Taoiseach consider putting into effect the report of the all-party committee with regard to a reduction in the age eligibility limit for the Office of President from 35 to 18 years?</P>
      <P>Has the Taoiseach considered the unique situation that applies to sign language in Ireland and recognising it as the third official language of the country? I was not aware until recently that Irish sign language, although it is used by only a small number of skilled people, is a unique form of communication distinct from sign language in any other country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte:</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach does not need it.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>The sixth report of the all-party committee on the Constitution review group deals with the fact that &ldquo;for and against&rdquo; arguments must be put, and legislation for that has been passed. The answer to the second question on the reduction of the age from 35 to 18 as recommended by the all-party committee is &ldquo;No&rdquo;. It is a daft idea and I totally disagree with it. While I know Irish sign language is a vital part of communication and is used by probably a larger number than we imagine, I am not sure a constitutional provision would need to be made for it. I am not too sure of its status but will check the situation. I know it is used in education and as a means of communication. If I remember rightly from a visit to the Irish Deaf Society, several different forms of sign language are used.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent" hpid="Mr. Sargent Mr. Sargent">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sargent:</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach will be aware from the draft report of the all-party committee on the Constitution focusing on Government that Article 28 of the Constitution, dealing with conditions under which the Government might declare or participate in a war, was considered. There was a feeling that it needed to be extended to include &ldquo;or other armed conflict&rdquo;. Will the Taoiseach agree that if that amendment was in place it would change the situation in which Ireland is currently co-operating with an armed conflict or war in Iraq? Is there a view in Government that there should be an amendment to extend the range of that article to include the term &ldquo;or other armed conflict&rdquo;? Does the Taoi<Col N="5" /> seach agree there needs to be a credible policy of military neutrality following the Nice treaty and the inclusion of a reference which is supposedly about neutrality?</P>

    <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent" hpid="Mr. Sargent Mr. Sargent">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sargent:</NameTxt>
      <P>I am trying to stay within order. A referendum on neutrality is what my question is about and we are dealing here with a question about a referendum on the Constitution. I want to ask the Taoiseach if he is considering amendments to the Constitution mindful of the need to clear up the uncertainty as to whether Ireland is neutral, given that we have paid &euro;1.5 million in landing charges&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>That matter was dealt with in mid-October in the Nice referendum when we changed our Constitution to deal with the issue. The people voted and there is no need to change the Constitution now. It is clear. We are not involved in any common defence initiative and are totally within our Constitution. The matter does not arise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent" hpid="Mr. Sargent Mr. Sargent">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sargent:</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not clear at all.</P>

      <NameTxt>Caoimhghín Ó Caoláin:</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach will be aware that the all-party committee on the Constitution recommended reform of the Seanad, including the election of 48 of its Members by the full electorate and by a list system. The Taoiseach will be aware that Seanad reform was among the recommendations of the All-Party Oireachtas Committee on the Constitution, including the election of 48 of its number by the full electorate using a list system. Does he support this? Would he support the idea of the list being composed on an all-island basis, thereby affording direct elections to the Seanad across the 32 counties?</P>
      <P>Can the Taoiseach confirm that granting attendance and speaking rights to Six County MPs and, perhaps even Assembly members, is something that requires only a change in Standing Orders for such a facility to be accommodated in this Chamber? This is also one of the areas addressed by the All-Party Oireachtas Committee on the Constitution. I fear the Taoiseach is dithering because he has sent the matter back for discussion to the same committee, which has now reconvened following the last general election.</P>

      <NameTxt>Caoimhghín Ó Caoláin:</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Taoiseach spell out clearly what is his position in regard to this proposal, recognising the importance of such a statement from him?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I know the Ceann Comhairle will not let me <Col N="6" /> back in later because I do not have sufficient political <i>avoirdupois.</i></P>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle An Ceann Comhairle">

      <P>That has been the pattern heretofore. He would accuse me of boxing above my weight. It is logical to add on a point <i>vis-à-vis </i>a referenda accommodating the proposed changes to the Seanad.</P>
      <P>Does the Taoiseach not think it odd in regard to presidential elections that an Irish citizen born and living in County Down with an address there, had to find an accommodation address in order to stand in the last presidential election? Should we not grasp this moment and face up to the challenges that these anomalies present? Many would describe them as injustices. Should we not accommodate the opportunity throughout this island for citizens to not only present themselves for election to the presidency, but to share the franchise? Go raibh maith agat.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy has raised three points &ndash; the first in regard to Seanad reform. As I have said here previously, I am in favour of this. I have spoken to the Members of the Seanad and am to meet the representatives of the parties there in the next week. They have started an internal examination of what they wish to achieve. We have the all-party committee report and we also have some other reports; there are three separate reports in total.</P>
      <P>First of all, the Seanad needs to consult among its Members as it believes it can make a number of changes within the electoral system. Proposals already exist but they are not the same. I have an official working on this area who is looking at finding areas of common concern. After I meet the representatives of the parties in the Seanad, I hope to be able to write to the party leaders on what is the best way to bring this forward.</P>
      <P>I am in favour of Seanad reform, but I am not quite sure whether it will require amendments. I have been advised that we can do quite a good deal without amendments. That is also the conclusion of the all-party committee and the separate examination of the Seanad that took place some years ago.</P>
      <P>With regard to the matter of representation, the all-party committee has given its views on this. I agree with its view that it would be valuable, from time to time, to have the expertise, experience and insight of Northern Irish politicians in specific and appropriate debates in the Oireachtas. The Government supports making the necessary procedural arrangements to allow MPs elected in Northern Ireland constituencies to speak on periodic debates on Northern Ireland, particularly on matters relating to the Good Friday Agreement. This was put forward by the committee and we have written and sought the support of other parties to bring it about.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The all-party committee referred to and made <Col N="7" /> some suggestions about the presidency, but it did not include the one made by Deputy Ó Caoláin. This is not one to which I have yet given any thought. Perhaps if we come around to making changes in this area, which are not envisaged at present, this proposal can be discussed. This issue did not arise either during the long debate which was held on the matter a few years ago.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte:</NameTxt>
      <P>Last week the Minister for the Environment and Local Government did not seem to know too much about the 10,000 affordable houses in the new social contract. He said it would have no implications for the Exchequer and the Taoiseach was a bit woolly on the matter himself. Does the Taoiseach intend holding a referendum along the lines he suggested on 5 January in an interview with <i>The Sunday Tribune,</i> when he said that if he thought it would be successful he would propose a constitutional amendment to cap the price of land, given that land is the problem in this matter? Does the Taoiseach still think he might hold a referendum to that effect?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>As I stated on that and previous occasions, I have asked the new all-party committee on the Constitution to give priority to looking at the constitutional aspects of land rights and particularly to revisit the proposals of the Kenny report of some years ago. This issue must be looked at and I am advised that a way of successfully doing something about it could be a constitutional referendum. Governments, including some led by me, have tried many things to deal with the problem of house prices in the greater Dublin area. The problem does not apply elsewhere, as people continually point out to me. However, in the greater Dublin area the price of land is the problem and it must be dealt with. Otherwise we will continue to see excessive house prices.  </P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte:</NameTxt>
      <P>From memory I think we have seven reports from the All-Party Committee on the Constitution. How long will it take for the committee to give the Taoiseach this assessment? The Taoiseach has been in office for six years. Attaining a house of one's own is now more difficult than at any time during those six years.</P>
      <P>I agree with the Taoiseach's analysis. The price of land and identifying land is the problem. Even the housing co-operatives say they cannot use the legislation because they cannot compete for land in the private marketplace. If we are all agreed on the analysis of the problem why are we deferring the decision about holding a referendum, which seems to have been encouraged by the recent Supreme Court case and which the Minister of State with responsibility for housing, Deputy Noel Ahern, said he would favour? </P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In parts of this county, including north County Dublin which is the territory of the Taoiseach's old mate, Rambo, land is controlled by six devel<Col N="8" /> opers who have taken an option on land, even open meadow, although no money changes hand. Would it not be a contribution to getting house prices under control and a signal to developers and builders if a referendum were held, with all-party support, to cap the price of land for this public purpose?  </P>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad Deputy Rabbitte agrees with me. When I made this proposal in the last Dáil I got very little agreement for it. I was told how impractical it was.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Rabbitte is correct, it was not by him. I do not represent north County Dublin but I know that in the Deputy's constituency a small site in the town centre of Tallaght was sold for between &euro;20 and &euro;30 million. He will understand these matters better than I do. I represent the inner-city where we do not have these problems.</P>
      <P>In none of the seven reports did anyone suggest a constitutional amendment. I raised it in January and I have no doubt the chairman of the All-Party Committee on the Constitution, Deputy O'Donovan, will deal with it as soon as possible.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>I have already formally asked the all-party committee on the Constitution to see whether it can get all-party agreement. I agree with what the Deputy has said on this matter. While a considerable amount of work has been done in this area over the years, most of it 25 years ago, many other suggestions have been considered since. In relation to affordable housing, we are making substantial progress on the number of affordable houses that will be supplied. On the housing trusts in recent years, we have managed to get ourselves into a position where housing associations are building a substantial number of houses. They used to build a few hundred houses but now we have moved, though not as much as other European countries and particularly the United Kingdom, in regard to the number of houses being produced. We are using the system properly but the outstanding issue is still the land question. I have highlighted my opposition &ndash; and Deputy Rabbitte agrees with me &ndash; to the idea that people can pay large amounts of money on options on land for long periods.</P>
      <P>The effect of that is that in five, ten, 15 or 20 years the price of land, when they finally come to build on those sites will be enormous and when they build on those sites they will say they need what I consider to be excessive margins on them, because they have to buy options on the next land and on it will go. I am totally opposed to that. Through the Bacon reports we have tried all kinds of mechanisms to combat this &ndash; some have worked, some have not. We tried to deal with it in the Planning and Development Act, the largest Act in 40 years and far larger than the original Act. Even with all those mechanisms, being partially successful, even very successful, until we look at the land question we will not get to the end of it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sargent:</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Taoiseach aware that in the first draft of the Free State Constitution it was clearly outlined that the land of the country should be in the common ownership of the people and it was the British Crown that shot that down as conflicting with the interests of landlords who were loyal to that Government? Can the Taoiseach say whether it is time to revisit that clause of the first draft of that first Constitution given <Col N="10" /> that in 1937 when Eamon de Valera looked again at it, he came under the belt of the crozier and the Church did not want the common ownership clause included. Is it not time to realise the Government does not hold a brief for either the British Crown or the Church and that it should face up to the responsibility of putting to the people an amendment to the Constitution which would restore the common ownership of the land to the people of Ireland so that we can organise proper housing and have price structures that do not prohibit housing for our people? Will the Taoiseach agree it is time to grasp that nettle and to put the amendment which has been discussed around the House and at the all-party committee on the Constitution for so long?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>I think I have answered that question. The Deputy is merely stating the things I have already stated and he thinks they are a good idea. We should also look at these things and at the powers of objectors because objectors drive the price of land as well. Deputy Sargent could help us to try to resolve that issue.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms McManus:</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Taoiseach accept that the all-party committee on the Constitution has done an enormous amount of work for very little return? Does he accept that it would transform the approach the committee might adopt to this proposal of a constitutional amendment if he stated clearly that it was his intention to bring forward a constitutional amendment and a timeframe to reach that objective? Otherwise, it will inevitably be seen simply as deferring a decision on a crucial point in relation to land, something which everyone recognises. I welcome the fact the Taoiseach now recognises that. If it is left open-ended and for the all-party committee to deal with, it will not happen within a reasonable timeframe. It is up to the Taoiseach to give a commitment that he intends to hold this referendum, to state the approximate length of time he expects it will take before he holds it and to adopt a similar approach to that which he adopted to the abortion referendum.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>There are two major issues. I have asked the all-party committee to look at this and to give me its views because, as the Deputy knows, if I take off on one track and do not get all-party agreement, we will not make much progress. I note what Deputy Rabbitte said in this regard and appreciate it. I do not wish to dictate to the all-party committee but I have asked it to make this the priority item and I understand it will do that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>NESC has almost completed a major report on housing; I might be wrong but I believe it is to report in March. It has looked at much of the work which has been around for the last 20 to 25 years. It has gone back to look at the situation <Col N="11" /> before Kenny's time. That report will be very useful to us in our deliberations. We also have the work done by the former Minister for the Environment and Local Government, Deputy Dempsey, over the last five years. Those examinations and reviews will also be very useful. Much of the work is finished and we will have to see if we can come to a conclusion.</P>
    <P>Over the years others have looked at trying to get over the individual rights in these issues and have said they could not do so, but I am not convinced. I have spoken about this to the Attorney General and others and I am not convinced that there is no way to deal with this. Maybe I will be defeated and it will not be possible but if we can have constitutional referendums on everything else, it must be possible to try to deal with this issue.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore:</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Taoiseach has made a formal request to the all-party committee to look at this issue, will he give the House more detail on the nature of that request? If he has the text of the request with him, perhaps he will avail of the opportunity to read it into the record of the House. If it is not available to him, will he agree to circulate the text of the formal request he has made to the all-party committee? </P>
      <P>Since the issue of land is clearly critical, although there is also the wider issue of housing provision, will the Taoiseach take up the suggestion made by the Labour Party that there should be a constitutional guarantee of the right to shelter? This is one of the few countries in Europe which has neither a constitutional nor a legislative guarantee of the right to housing.</P>

They obviously have the contribution I made in the House on this issue in December, which Deputy Rabbitte quoted. I am not too sure if everything should be written into the Constitution. Most countries in Europe have very little in their Constitution, unlike ours, which is far more restrictive, despite what Deputy Gilmore said. I have no difficulty in trying to deal with the issues raised by the Deputy by way of legislation, which is a different matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins:</NameTxt>
      <P>I have been sitting here patiently for 20 minutes in the hope that the Taoiseach might bring us a bit more forward on the question. The Taoiseach should stop playing games with us. Is it not the reality that nothing has been done in 30 years since the Kenny report? Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael have been beholden to very powerful speculators who have made a fortune from speculating in land and held ordinary people to ransom for the price of a home while they did not lift a finger. Is it not the case that powerful supporters of the Taoiseach's party continue to be substantial land owners and to speculate in the price of land continuing at the same level or continuing to rise? Given that the Taoiseach has had the distinction of being Taoiseach while the price of a home for ordinary working people doubled or trebled in six years, what hope can we have that he will take action at this point? I call on him to take action, but what hope can we have that he will do so to burst the speculators' charter and legislate on this matter in the interests of the big majority of ordinary people who are victims of the speculators?</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot convince Deputy Higgins that I would do anything right, so I will not try very hard. I am convinced that supporters of my party would probably own less property than the .001% level of support the Deputy's party has, if someone would go to the trouble of analysing the matter. I reject totally the points he made about speculators. In other countries, those who have leanings towards the far and extreme left are normally the wealthiest people in society, while they lecture the rest of us. I do not accuse Deputy Higgins of lecturing us, but I do not accept his arguments in this regard.</P>
      <P>We are doing our best to improve the situation and that is why in the Deputy's constituency where some 30 years ago, grass and clover was growing in fields there are now tens of thousands of people residing. The Deputy receives his mandate from the people who built houses in the area, together with shopping centres, schools and third level colleges. This is as a result of the progress Fianna Fáil has made and I am sure Fine Gael and Labour would claim some of the credit over the 30 years.</P>

We need to find a new method of dealing with the problem. Every Attorney General for the past 30 or 40 years has spoken of the difficulties in relation to land rights, property rights and civil rights. It is a complex area that needs to be carefully examined. The Supreme Court judgment on Part V of the Planning and Development Bill 1999, which was introduced by the Minister, Deputy Noel Dempsey, shows that the common good can be taken into account in such matters. This important judgment can be used to aid us as we try to deal with this serious <Col N="14" /> question.

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin):</NameTxt>
      <P>The standards applying to the training of postgraduates are being reviewed on an ongoing basis. As changes to these standards have implications for service delivery, I established the Inter Agency Care Health Forum to allow those who set standards and those who deliver service to discuss emerging issues. The IAHCF meets quarterly to discuss various issues of concern, including the implications of the implementation of new training standards. The forum is chaired by the chief medical officer at my Department. Comhairle na nOspidéal, the health boards, the Medical Council, the Postgraduate Medical and Dental Board and the training bodies are also represented at the forum.</P>
      <P>In June 2002, the Irish Surgical Postgraduate Training Committee of the Royal College of Surgeons of Ireland published guidelines for the recognition of training posts in accident and emergency departments of acute hospitals providing such services. These guidelines state: &ldquo;The accident and emergency department must be under the clinical and administrative control of one or more emergency medicine consultants devoting the whole or major part (eight or greater sessions) of their clinical time to the day to day supervision and training of the junior medical staff&rdquo;. I am advised that the health boards and the training bodies have, through the inter-agency forum, come to interim arrangements which will allow for hospitals to continue to provide services while arrangements are being put in place to meet the standards required. In general, both the colleges and the Medical Council have adopted a flexible approach when approached by the boards with realistic efforts to meet the standards set. Discussions on the guidelines are also taking place between Comhairle na nOspidéal, the Medical Council and the RCSI.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="OliviaMitchell" hpid="Ms O. Mitchell Ms O. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Ms O. Mitchell:</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to have been a fly on the wall when the Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland was persuaded to change its mind from a position where the guidelines were essential to one where they were merely the ideal towards which it would work. Will the Minister outline the interim arrangements to be entered into and how long it will take to put them in place? Will he also indicate if it is intended that every hospital without an A&amp;E consultant will have one? Is it intended that all such hospitals will retain a full A&amp;E service? If some will not, will they be informed and will members of the public be advised or will they be left to ascertain the position in the same way as those in County Monaghan, when insurance cover was withdrawn from Monaghan General Hospital for similar reasons?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin:</NameTxt>
      <P>Interim arrangements are entered into by health boards and respective individual hospitals in certain locations and they make <Col N="19" /> arrangements with the colleges. From my experience, having met with the Medical Council and the colleges on these matters, once realistic efforts are made by the hospitals concerned to respond to the standards set out in the guidelines, the colleges and the council generally take a flexible approach in terms of the maintenance of services. In some areas, and especially since the appointment of a significantly greater number of A&amp;E consultants in the last two years, they have generally played a supervisory role over hospitals in specific regions. In its review of A&amp;E services last year, Comhairle na nOspidéal recommended that existing surgeons within acute hospitals could also play a role in the supervision of training. Comhairle is currently in discussion with the Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland in terms of the guidelines that have been published in view of what appears to be different perspectives by the Comhairle review and the guidelines issued by the college.</P>
      <P>The interim arrangements are decided upon at local level between the boards and the colleges. On a national level, the work of the Hanley committee, the National Task Force on Medical Manpower Planning, will be important in terms of the more medium to long-term scenario that will unfold regarding the configuration of hospital services.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin:</NameTxt>
      <P>In early 2002, action was taken by nursing staff in accident and emergency departments of hospitals providing such services. Proposals put forward by the Labour Relations Commission aimed at resolving the dispute included an independent review of the bed management function in acute hospitals providing A&amp;E services. The review was commissioned by the Health Service Employers Agency and the unions representing nursing staff in A&amp;E departments. Its purpose was to help to establish some of the causes of weakness in the system and to provide guidance on how these difficulties might be addressed. The CAPITA report, referred to by the Deputy, is the product of this independent review and was completed on 27 January 2003.</P>
      <P>While the report is critical of certain aspects of bed management it found, in general, evidence of good bed management practices around the country. The report is designed to ensure the development of enhanced and uniform bed management practices across the hospital system. Its recommendations are at present being considered by the management and staff sides in the context of the continuing implementation of the LRC proposals.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Improved bed management is one of a range of measures being taken to improve A&amp;E services arising from the LRC proposals. Management <Col N="21" /> structures and procedures have been strengthened, a staffing review is nearing completion while a review of security practices was conducted and its recommendations are being implemented.</P>
    <P>A comprehensive range of measures has been taken by the Government which is designed to enhance further A&amp;E service provision. This includes a &euro;41 million investment package in 2001 which provided for the recruitment of additional A&amp;E consultants. Seventeen of these posts have now been filled and the recruitment process is continuing in respect of the remaining posts. It also includes the provision of capital funding in respect of the development and upgrading of A&amp;E facilities in hospitals throughout the country. This will total approximately 14 A&amp;E facilities across the country. New A&amp;E departments will be built or there will be significant extensions to existing departments. It further includes the provision of a chest pain service at St. James's Hospital and minor injury units at Beaumont, the Mater, James Connolly Memorial, St. James's and Tallaght hospitals; the recruitment of discharge planners and patient liaison personnel; and the development of deep venous thrombosis treatment at Beaumont Hospital. These initiatives are designed to improve the delivery of services in A&amp;E departments.</P>
    <P>Comhairle na nOspidéal has undertaken a detailed review of the structures, operation and staffing of A&amp;E departments while last year I established an accident and emergency forum to identify urgent measures which could be taken to enhance A&amp;E services in acute hospitals, consistent with the commitment in the national health strategy. The work of the forum helped to build on the existing and proposed policy framework for A&amp;E services as set out in the strategy. A number of short, medium and long-term actions aimed at alleviating service pressures were identified and these are now being advanced by the National Partnership Forum through the involvement of partnership groups at local level.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LizMcManus" hpid="Ms McManus Ms McManus">
      <NameTxt>Ms McManus:</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister indicate if he is filled with a deep sense of shame that, yet again, there has been a crisis in A&amp;E departments with the result that patients have greatly suffered? In one instance an elderly woman was treated in an ambulance outside an A&amp;E department because the situation at the department was so grave. Others were made to wait 17 hours before they received the treatment they desperately needed. This is now a perennial experience for patients under the watch of the Minister for Health and Children. I wonder if he is aware that there are reports in today's newspaper about pressure on the accident and emergency department of the Mater Hospital because of bed blocking. Will he not come clean regarding what the report actually stated rather than skipping over what is clearly its most important conclusion &ndash; because it is the first &ndash; namely, that the lack of rehabilitation or step-down beds is the cause of <Col N="22" /> much of the difficulty, stress and strain in our accident and emergency departments? What has the Minister done about this? It is great to talk about provisions in the future, but where are the significant increases in the numbers of step-down and hospital beds?</P>
      <P>There is very clear criticism in the report of the fact that community care services finish during standard working hours and that there is no out-of-hours provision. Has the Minister done anything about that or what does he intend to do?</P>
      <P>The criticisms in the report of consultants' practices in hospitals raise issues to which the Minister should respond, especially in regard to the discharge policy of some consultants and the current pressures on consultants to discharge patients early when they are probably not ready to be discharged. Will the Minister address the issue of the high return rate of patients?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin:</NameTxt>
      <P>I have responded to hospitals that have come up with initiatives to try alleviate the stress on accident and emergency departments, particularly in the Dublin region, which has had acute problems. A significant part of the problem emanates from historical under-provision of post-acute, rehabilitation and continuing care beds. The budget for nursing home subvention and contract beds, for example, has increased dramatically from approximately £38 million in 1998-99 to approximately &euro;102 at the end of 2002. This represents immediate action the Government and I took to try to absorb capacity in the private sector to put spare beds in place.</P>
      <P>Many of the district hospitals in the Dublin region closed throughout the 1980s and early 1990s, resulting in a dearth of public sector community nursing unit beds in the eastern region and, to a certain extent, the southern region. We have commissioned a public private partnership to try to get 850 beds on stream within the next two years to increase public sector capacity. Last year we commissioned 50 more beds in the eastern region. That is a key issue and nobody is underestimating in any way its centrality to the overall problem of bed accommodation.</P>

      <P>Last year I established an accident and emergency forum to identify urgent measures which could be taken in order to enhance accident and emergency services in acute hospitals, consistent with the commitment in the health strategy. Participants included hospital management, members of the medical and nursing professions, paramedical and non-nursing personnel, staff representative associations and unions, patient advocacy groups and other interested parties. The work of the forum helped to build on the <Col N="23" /> existing and proposed policy framework for accident and emergency services, as set out in the strategy. A number of short, medium and long-term actions aimed at alleviating service pressures were identified and are now being advanced by the National Partnership Forum through the involvement of partnership groups at local level.</P>
      <P>In 2002 action was taken by nursing staff employed in accident and emergency departments in hospitals providing such services. The Labour Relations Commission made a number of recommendations aimed at resolving the dispute. These included the undertaking of a full security assessment in each accident and emergency department in hospitals providing such services; the establishment of a national accident and emergency nursing staffing structures review group to carry out an immediate examination of existing structures and staffing levels in accident and emergency departments; and a review of the bed management function in acute hospitals providing accident and emergency services.</P>
      <P>The staffing review is almost complete. A security review has been conducted and its recommendations are being implemented, and the report of the bed management function has recently been completed. That report is designed to ensure the development of enhanced and uniform bed management practices across the hospital system. Its recommendations are being considered by the management and staff sides in the context of the continuing implementation of the LRC proposals regarding accident and emergency service provision.</P>
      <P>Improved bed management is one of a range of measures being taken to improve accident and emergency services arising from the LRC proposals. Management structures and procedures have been strengthened, a staffing review is nearing completion and a review of security practices was conducted, the recommendations of which are being implemented.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I outlined in my previous reply a comprehensive range of measures which are designed to further enhance accident and emergency service provision. The measures include the use of chest pain clinics and minor injury units, as we have established; the re-organisation of diagnostic services to ensure increased access to and availability of services at busy times in accident and emergency departments; the appointment of advanced nurse practitioners in acute hospitals; the use of admission protocols to ensure emergency patients will be the only patients admitted to hospital through accident and emergency departments; the appointment of additional personnel to liaise with patients while they await diagnosis and treatment at accident and emergency departments; and the introduction of information systems that record comprehensive, comparable and reliable data on activity in accident and emergency departments. Last year, for the first time in a decade, we increased successfully <Col N="24" /> the bed capacity by 520 beds in the acute side, which was sought for a long time by all involved.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Additional information</i>I will continue to support initiatives designed to further enhance services and facilities at accident and emergency departments. I am satisfied that the range of measures I have outlined represents tangible evidence of the continuing support by this Government of the development of front-line hospital and emergency services.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnGormley" hpid="Mr. Gormley Mr. Gormley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gormley:</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister accept that he has failed to address the accident and emergency crisis properly? In his reply, he mentioned bed management. Why does the CAPITA report state that only five of the 23 hospitals visited had detailed plans for bed management? Surely that is an indictment of the Minister's policy.</P>
      <P>I put a parliamentary question to the Minister about the treatment purchase fund and he indicated that, of the &euro;6.6 million spent on the fund in the last six months of 2002, approximately 17% or &euro;1 million related to indirect payments, indirect patient care and travel. Given that the total sum is $31 million, about &euro;5 million will be spent on travel arrangements etc. The Minister may say the figure does not amount to &euro;5 million, but that is my calculation. What sort of bed capacity could we get for that money? Does the Minister accept that this is a waste of money?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin:</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot understand how anybody could say that providing the opportunity for a person who is waiting for longer than 12 months to have an operation is a waste of money, particularly when some people have to wait for over two years.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnGormley" hpid="Mr. Gormley Mr. Gormley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gormley:</NameTxt>
      <P>What about travel arrangements?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin:</NameTxt>
      <P>The people are not all travelling. Of the 600 patients travelling per month last year, only 200 would have been travelling abroad. The remaining 400 would have been provided for within the private sector in Ireland. The chief executive officer of the treatment purchase fund team is clear that value for money is being attained. The projected estimate for this year is that we will achieve about 7,200 operations through this mechanism.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In terms of the public sector, we have had bed occupancy of anything up to 95%, which is too high. That is why we put in 520 beds last year and provided the necessary funding. Since I became Minister for Health and Children, everybody in the public sector was saying that their premises were full up, they could not take any more patients and could only do so much. Many consultants were saying to me that their capacity to do elective work was undermined by the almost 100% occupancy levels, particularly through medical admissions. Therefore, what we are doing through the treatment purchase fund is <Col N="25" /> identifying capacity in the system, albeit in the private sector, and utilising it for the benefit of public patients who are waiting for more than 12 months for operations.</P>
    <P>I am glad to say that many health boards have more or less achieved that target within the 12 month period. In the eastern region we have not yet reached it, but some hospitals in the region are beginning to use the fund quite effectively.</P>
    <P>In terms of accident and emergency provision, if we did not take the steps we took over the past three years, in terms of the winter initiative of 2000-01, the additional facilities we put into the major acute hospitals or the additional money that went towards nursing home subvention and contract beds, we would have had an extraordinary collapse in our hospital system.</P>
    <P>We must try to deal with the interim and immediate problems, which we have been doing. More importantly, the medium and long-term problems involve the development of a strong post-acute patient capacity response.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children (Mr. T. O'Malley):</NameTxt>
      <P>The overall economic position in 2003 has had implications for all aspects of public investment which is reflected in the Estimates and budget adopted by the Government for 2003. Within this framework, two thirds of the additional funding available for non-capital investment in services has been allocated to the health services. This funding is being applied largely to maintain existing levels of service across all programmes, including those which cater for people with an intellectual disability. Between 1997 and 2002, an extra &euro;188 million revenue and &euro;139 million in capital funding was provided, making up a total additional investment of &euro;327 million for the maintenance and development of services to persons with an intellectual disability and for those with autism.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the current year, further additional funding of &euro;13.3 million has been allocated to services for persons with an intellectual disability or autism to meet the full year cost of the 2002 developments. The funding will also be used to further enhance the health related support services to children with an intellectual disability or autism. This funding brings the total extra investment in these services to &euro;340 million over seven years and of <Col N="26" /> this total amount, over &euro;200 million has been built into the ongoing budget base.</P>
    <P>This funding has brought about significant developments in the services. Between 1997 and 2002, around 1,700 extra residential places were provided, with most based in the community. This figure includes new residential respite places developed in 1997 and 1998. Between 1999 and 2002, around 465 dedicated respite places were also provided while the period 1997 to 2002 saw the provision of around 2,950 new day places. Despite this very significant investment, demographic factors are contributing to growing waiting lists for residential services in particular even though the number of people in receipt of services, including full-time residential services, continues to increase. The increased birth rate in the 1960s and 1970s has resulted in large numbers of adults in their late 20s and early 30s requiring full-time residential services.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Additional information</i>People with intellectual disability live longer which adds to the need for more services than were required in previous generations. This has also been the international experience in service provision to this population. While it is regrettable that the level of investment in these services achieved in recent years could not be maintained in 2003, my Department will work closely with the health boards and other service providers in relation to service provision this year.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin:</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy is aware, BreastCheck, the national breast screening programme, commenced in March 2000 with phase 1 covering the Eastern Regional Health Authority, Midland Health Board and North Eastern Health Board areas. Screening is being offered free of charge to all women in those areas in the target age group of 50 to 64 years of age. The target population consists of approximately 136,000 women and represents about 50% of the national target population. To end November 2002, 106,585 <Col N="28" /> women had been called for screening and 79,906 women have been screened, representing an uptake of 75%. Yesterday, I announced the extension of BreastCheck to a further three counties and I am committed to its extension nationally.</P>
      <P>As a result of yesterday's extension, approximately 19,000 women in the 50 to 64 age bracket in counties Wexford, Kilkenny and Carlow will be invited for screening. Approximately 9,500 per annum will be invited once the programme is fully operational in these counties and it is expected that approximately 60 additional cancers will be diagnosed and treated annually. With regard to the further expansion, the board of BreastCheck has submitted a business plan to my Department which requires a further investment totalling &euro;26 million, including &euro;13 million in capital costs. Two static units are proposed in host hospitals, one in Cork and the other in Galway, at which breast surgery would be performed for women in the south, west, mid-west and north-west following diagnosis.</P>
      <P>A number of key issues have been raised by health boards and health professionals in relation to the national roll-out of BreastCheck which need to be addressed in advance of further expansion. I will be meeting BreastCheck shortly to discuss these issues. The objective is to prepare an effective and cohesive model which is in the best interests of the women concerned and which builds on the quality standards of BreastCheck and the symptomatic services.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LizMcManus" hpid="Ms McManus Ms McManus">
      <NameTxt>Ms McManus:</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister admit that this was to be a nationwide programme of breast cancer screening and that the original date for its completion was 1999? The date was put back to 2002 and has now been further delayed for an unknown period of time. Is the Minister aware that &euro;26 million, which he said would be the cost of the full scheme, represents half the cost of a Government jet? The Minister has cut the country down the middle to create a whole new form of apartheid in which a woman fortunate enough to live in the east of the country can access breast cancer screening which can save her life, but if she lives in the west or the south she will not be able access a life saving programme. Experts are clear that screening reduces the breast cancer death rate by 25%. This is insupportable. The matter does not involve a huge amount of money, but it involves bad planning by the Minister's Department and it is a question of life and death.</P>

      <P>The Deputy is engaged in political polemicizing. When I took office this scheme was well advanced for 50% of the population. Phase 1 was always identified as such in accordance with the original decision taken in the lead-up to the establishment of the breast cancer screening programme to introduce it in two stages. Phase 1 was to inform phase 2 in terms of best practice, evaluation, quality assurance and standards.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin:</NameTxt>
      <P>The establishment of a service like this requires the recruitment of specialist personnel which accords with the way the programme was planned and rolled out. We have had a very successful implementation of phase one and have received a business plan from the BreastCheck board. Since 2001, we have spent an additional &euro;30 million cumulatively on symptomatic breast cancer services for women who present with symptoms. That was not in the country prior to 2001. We are building those services up over time. When BreastCheck was first conceived the symptomatic centres had not even been announced or decided upon as a policy. We are committed to the expansion of BreastCheck, it is not something we are saying we will not do. The key point now is that as we develop centres of excellence in Limerick, Cork, the south-east and the west, there needs to be some engagement with the professionals as regards a cohesive approach between both strands. That is the issue that has to be sorted out.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LizMcManus" hpid="Ms McManus Ms McManus">

      <P>Does the Minister not accept it is time he stopped leading people on? Commitments were made to this nation-wide programme; everybody recognises it is excellent and that there is no need for it to be adapted in any significant way. The only problem is that so many women cannot access the service. That is the difficulty. When does the Minister intend to publish the report on radiotherapy treatment centres? It is of crucial interest, particularly to people in the south-east who were misled in terms of their understanding about the needs being met by the Government. Maybe the Minister will now state what the situation is in relation to that report and what it means for people who are living far away from the proposed centres.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin:</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 98 and 347 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A research project on fluoride delivery sys<Col N="31" /> tems, which includes an investigation into fluoride intake in the population, is currently being undertaken at the oral health services research centre in University College, Cork. As part of this project, the fluoride laboratory in UCC is determining the fluoride content of foods, drinks and toothpaste.</P>
    <P>Methods are also being developed for measuring the total dietary fluoride intake of two to three year old children and baseline information on current levels of fluoride absorption in Irish children is being measured using fingernail clippings. These studies are being undertaken in close collaboration with researchers in Europe and the United States in order to make sure that the methods being used conform to international standards.</P>
    <P>The director of the project at the oral health services research centre in University College Cork has informed me that the expected date of completion for this project is mid-2003. Consequently, as the Forum on Fluoridation has already reported, the final outcomes of this project would not have been available to the forum.</P>
    <P>The use of fluoride technology is known to manifest a positive oral health outcome. Local and national surveys and studies conducted since the introduction of fluoridation here attest to the reduced dental decay levels of children and teenagers in fluoridated areas compared to those residing in non-fluoridated areas. The safety and effectiveness of water fluoridation has been endorsed by a number of international and reputable bodies, such as the World Health Organisation, the Centre for Disease Control and Prevention, the United States Public Health Service and the United States Surgeon General.</P>
    <P>Despite these endorsements, I decided to establish the Forum on Fluoridation to review the fluoridation of public piped water supplies in Ireland. The forum's report was recently launched and its main conclusion was that the fluoridation of public piped water supplies should continue as a public health measure, subject to the recommendations of the forum. The forum also concluded that water fluoridation has been very effective in improving the oral health of the Irish population, especially of children, but also of adults and the elderly. The best available and most reliable scientific evidence indicates that at the maximum permitted level of fluoride in drinking water at one part per million, human health is not adversely affected.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Additional information</i>Dental fluorosis, a form of discoloration of the tooth enamel, is a well-recognised condition and an indicator of overall fluoride absorption, whether from natural sources, fluoridated water or from the inappropriate use of fluoride toothpaste at a young age. There is evidence that the prevalence of dental fluorosis is increasing in Ireland.</P>
    <P>The forum consisted of people with expert <Col N="32" /> knowledge spanning the areas of public health, biochemistry, dental health, bone health, food safety, environmental protection, ethics, water quality, health promotion and representatives from the consumer and environmental areas. This diversity of professional backgrounds and representation was reflected in the comprehensive way the forum conducted its work and research.</P>
    <P>The forum's report emerged from 14 plenary meetings, several meetings of sub-groups and oral presentations of material from both proponents and opponents of fluoridation. The forum invited the public to forward their views and examined more than 1,000 submissions. The forum took a participatory and evidence-based approach striving to ensure balance between participants from both sides of the debate on water fluoridation.</P>
    <P>The report of the fluoridation forum made 33 recommendations covering a broad range of topics such as research, public awareness, policy and technical aspects of fluoridation. Following publication of the report, I have asked my Department to establish an expert body, as recommended by the forum. This expert body will oversee the implementation of the wide-ranging recommendations of the forum and advise me on all aspects of fluoride. In particular, ongoing research related to fluoride will continue to be evaluated by the expert body and expanded to deal with new emerging issues.</P>
    <Speaker pid="OliviaMitchell" hpid="Ms O. Mitchell Ms O. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Ms O. Mitchell:</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for his response. He referred to the maximum permitted levels of fluoride which are safe but we are ingesting it and it acts systemically. Why would we assume that fluoride simply finds its way into our teeth and does not have any other health impact? That aspect was not measured in the fluoride report which devoted only eight or nine pages to it from a total of almost 300. A crucial point in the report's section on the health impact was that the amount of exposure to fluoride dictated the level of fluorosis. The report only dealt with dental fluorosis and ignored the impact on other aspects of health. Is the Minister aware, for instance, that young girls are drinking large quantities of water because they think it is good for them? Is the Minister happy to allow each local authority to use fluoridation? Is he happy that fluoridated water in measured doses is healthy for our population?</P>

      <Quest>the assessment of the needs of institutions catering for people with an intellectual disability before responsibility of which was transferred from his Department to the health board; the scale of the needs gap in staff and in funding identified in absolute terms and as a percentage of existing services for each health board; and the extent to which that gap has been filled to date in each health board area.</Quest>
      <QRef>[3299/03]</QRef>
    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="TimOMalleyPD" hpid="Mr. T. O'Malley Mr. T. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. O'Malley:</NameTxt>
      <P>The first health strategy, which was published in 1994, proposed that responsibility for certain voluntary organisations, funded at that time by the Department of Health and Children, should be transferred to the health boards. In the area of services to persons with an intellectual disability and those with autism, this process began in 1998 with the transfer of the relevant organisations in the Southern and Mid-Western health board regions. The process continued in subsequent years and was completed in 2000 with the transfer of formerly direct-funded organisations in the Eastern Regional Health Authority region.</P>
      <P>In addition to providing funding to put in place new service developments to meet identified needs in relation to residential, respite, day and other support services, funding has been provided to meet identified needs in existing services. These needs arise as a result of the changing profile of persons with an intellectual disability or those with autism in the services, in particular the residential services, which has resulted in an increasing number of older and medically fragile persons. They also relate to issues such as underfunding of base budgets, including the need to consolidate elements of services previously funded from sources such as fundraising. My Department has sought over the years to address these issues as resources have permitted. It was agreed that this process should continue, albeit through new, more appropriate mechanisms, as part of the transfer process.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="35" /> Between 1998 and 2002, additional funding amounting to &euro;27.2 million was allocated to services to persons with an intellectual disability and those with autism to meet identified needs in existing services. The estimated costs associated with meeting those needs in respect of the former direct funded voluntary intellectual disability services is approximately &euro;26 million. This is based on the costings agreed at the time of transfer with each of those agencies. Between 1998 and 2002, approximately &euro;17 million of the &euro;26 million was allocated specifically to meet those needs. The balance was allocated to services provided by the health boards and other voluntary service providers to meet similar needs within their services.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Additional information</i>I have asked the health boards to provide my Department with the more detailed information by health board region which the Deputy has requested and I will forward it to him as soon as it becomes available.</P>
    <P>The overall economic position in 2003 has had implications for all aspects of public investment, and this is reflected in the Estimates and budget adopted by the Government for 2003. Within this overall framework, however, two thirds of the additional funding available for non-capital investment in services has been allocated to the health services. This funding is being applied largely to maintain existing levels of service across all service programmes, including services for people with an intellectual disability.</P>
    <P>Between 1997 and 2002, an extra &euro;188 million revenue and &euro;139 million capital funding has been provided, making a total additional investment of &euro;327 million for the maintenance and development of services to persons with an intellectual disability and those with autism. In the current year, further additional funding of &euro;13.3 million has been allocated to services for persons with an intellectual disability or autism to meet the full year cost of the 2002 developments and to further enhance the health related support services to children with an intellectual disability or autism. This funding brings the total extra investment in these services to &euro;340 million over seven years. Of this total, more than &euro;200 million has been built into the ongoing budget base. This funding has brought about very significant and unprecedented developments in the services.</P>
    <P>Between 1997 and 2002, approximately 1,700 extra residential places were provided, with most of these based in the community. This figure includes new residential respite places which were developed in 1997 and 1998. Between 1999 and 2002, approximately 465 dedicated respite places were also provided. In addition, the period 1997-2002 saw the provision of approximately 2,950 new day places.</P>
    <P>Despite the significant investment over recent years, demographic factors are contributing to growing waiting lists for residential services in particular even though the number of people in <Col N="36" /> receipt of services, including full-time residential services, continues to increase. The increased birth rate in the 1960s and 1970s has resulted in large numbers of adults in their late 20s and early 30s requiring full-time residential services. In addition, people with an intellectual disability are living longer than previously, adding to the need for services compared to previous generations. This has also been the international experience in service provision for this population.</P>
    <P>While it is regrettable that the level of investment in these services achieved in recent years could not be maintained in 2003, my Department will work closely with the health boards and other service providers in relation to service provision this year.</P>

      <P>I thank the Minister of State for his reply. The question arises from my experience of agencies such as St. Michael's House and the Order of St. John of God, but the worst case relates to Drumcar. Is the Minister of State happy that sufficient progress is being made to fill the funding gap of &euro;26 million for existing services? Is he saying four years into this process that there is still a shortfall of &euro;10 million, which should be provided to ensure services reach an acceptable level? Will he give a commitment that the gap will be filled rapidly? Will he assure the House there is absolute equity in regard to the allocation of the moneys because there is a sense that some health boards, blessed by the presence of a Minister in their area, have better access to resources than others?</P>

I am happy that all health boards have been and will be treated equally. They will not be responded to on the basis of whether there is a Minister in their area. I am happy with the progress that has been made but there have never been sufficient resources for people with disabilities and the progress, therefore, is not acceptable to any of us. However, over the past five years substantial progress has been made, much more than in any other period in the history of the State. I am happy that the Government will continue to make extensive progress in this domain.</P>

      <P>I must explain to a constituent whose 29 year old son is in Drumcar, for example, that the institution is 90 staff short. How can the Minister of State say acceptable progress is being made when such people ought to have access to an acceptable level of service to meet their base needs? This is the bedrock with which they should be provided. How can he accept a scenario where the providers of these crucial services must turn people away because they have nowhere to place them and are under-resourced? This issue must be given greater priority. Will the Minister of State, who is new, and the Minister make com<Col N="37" /> mitments that funding will be made available for institutions such as Drumcar?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin:</NameTxt>
      <P>The national task force on medical staffing is completing its report. I will consider the report in detail when I receive it and will then bring proposals to Government. I understand that the task force will make recommendations regarding the number of consultants and NCHDs required to achieve a consultant-provided service and a 48 hour working week for NCHDs. These and other recommendations are being finalised. I propose to seek the Government's approval to publish the report.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LizMcManus" hpid="Ms McManus Ms McManus">
      <NameTxt>Ms McManus:</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has read the report. How many hospital consultants are needed? Given the report is long awaited, has preparation been made in terms of funding? There is no commitment to funding and resources to meet its recommendations. What is the Minister doing in terms of allocating funding? It is reported two pilot projects will be up and running relatively quickly, which will require funding. What is the timeframe for implementation of the report? Given that the task force has taken so long to reach conclusions, there will be major financial implications, particularly in light of the changes in NCHD working hours.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin:</NameTxt>
      <P>The report will endeavour to illustrate the funding implications of the proposals. The entire process has taken considerable time, with the first part being the manpower forum. The forum's recommendations led to the establishment of the task force. This is a key report because its proposals have the potential to transform the way we do things in our hospitals, as they essentially move from a consultant-led service, which is too dependent on doctors in training currently, to a consultant-provided service. That will mean an increase in the number of con<Col N="38" /> sultants. I do not have an exact figure for the Deputy but as the number of consultants increases there will have to be a consequential reduction in the number of NCHDs.</P>
      <P>The report is much more complex than the simplistic notion of only increasing consultant numbers because that has an implication for all layers of staff within hospitals. That is what the work has been about over the past 12 months. The Hanly group held 300 consultative meetings and it received comprehensive written submissions from people in the pilot areas, which are the Mid-Western Health Board and the east coast health board area.</P>

      <P>If the deal with NCHDs in 2000, for example, is examined, it represented a substantial improvement in terms of overtime, conditions and so on for junior doctors and the pay bill that resulted was significant. Moving to a consultant provided service may not be as huge a cost as it would have been prior to 2000. There will obviously be costs attached but we are proposing to await publication of the report, perhaps in March, and obtain Government approval of it. The recommendations will have a significant impact in terms of consultants' contracts, practices, rostering and around-the-clock cover. In essence we are looking at a renegotiation&mdash;</P>

      <P>Statutory responsibility for the provision of intellectual disability services, including the funding of the Drumcar service, lies with the North-Eastern Health Board in the first instance.

      <P>These discussions were adjourned last week and are due to resume tomorrow. The objective of my Department in these discussions is to ensure that the range of issues raised in the consultants' report on the Drumcar service will be addressed by the parties concerned without unnecessary delay.

      <NameTxt>Ms O. Mitchell:</NameTxt>
      <P>For many years Drumcar was under the direct remit of the Department of Health and Children. Does the Minister accept that it was effectively a dumping ground for disabled persons who were not wanted by anybody and not wanted by any health board? When the Celtic tiger arrived was it not the moral responsibility of the Government to ensure that it was properly resourced and funded before it was handed over to the North-Eastern Health Board? The people who were forgotten by society were tied up and locked up and those caring for them were not given proper resources and were forced to work under those conditions. Has the Minister of State no sense of shame? He comes to the House and says that this is a matter for the parties concerned. How will they do it and where is the money coming from? How much money will the <Col N="40" /> Minister of State give to the North-Eastern Health Board to ensure that it can do something about the situation in Drumcar?</P>

It would be sad that the excellent service given by the Hospitaller Order of Saint John of God at Drumcar would be so categorised. Nevertheless, the kernel of what Deputy Mitchell says is very important. There is undoubtedly a failure of the Department to recognise that it is not within the gift of the North-Eastern Health Board, as I emphasised to the Minister of State on the last occasion we addressed it here. I am a member of that health board and I am aware of the absence of funding&mdash;</P>

      <P>This Government is now in its sixth year. There have been massive budgetary surpluses for a number of years but the services represent those of the 19th century as distinct from the 21st century. Investing in this area is a matter of choice. This Government has chosen not to support those who are in pain, who are confused and those who feel lost. I say to the Taoiseach that these people have no one in Government to represent them. They have no social partner, no vocal lobby group and no friend in Cabinet. They are relying on the Taoiseach and his Ministers to represent them and to ensure they receive a decent service and collectively the Government has let them down.</P>

      <P>In reply to Deputy Kenny, two years ago many of the organisations involved in mental health requested that there should be a specific Minister dealing with mental health and I appointed Deputy O'Malley as Minister of State for that reason to deal exclusively with mental health. The organisations concerned have acknowledged his appointment.</P>
      <P>The Government has long recognised that in the past there had been a deficit in the level of funding for the development of mental health services. We demonstrated our commitment to address this through the provision of significant additional resources. We are dealing with an enormous deficit from the past. Great strides continue to be made in developing a service which is comprehensive and which is now community-based. The working group document of 1994 became the blueprint for dealing with the changes in mental health management. It is a community based service and is integrated with the general health services. It is removing the stigma that traditionally applied to psychiatric illness.</P>
      <P>In 1984 I was on the working group of the Eastern Health Board which prepared the document Planning for the Future. The Amnesty International report acknowledges the significant advances made in the provision of community psychiatric nursing services, community residences, day hospitals and day centres since the publication of that report 19 years ago.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the period 1999 to 2002 an additional &euro;70.7 million has been invested in mental health services. This year additional funding of &euro;7.6 million has been provided for ongoing developments. In addition &euro;190 million capital has been provided over the lifetime of the national development plan to develop mental health facilities. This <Col N="43" /> investment is unprecedented. The new Mental Health Commission has an important role to play in improving the quality of our mental health services. While problems in this area have long been highlighted, the Minister for Health and Children and the Minister of State with responsibility for mental health are providing specific funding for the development of services under the new national policy framework on mental health which it is hoped to commence this year. The Government will continue to deal with this major problem of the past.</P>

      <P>If the Taoiseach recognises this as important it is time the Government, now in its sixth year, did something effective about it. The Taoiseach refers to a comprehensive and integrated community based service. Is he aware that, while in Cavan there are excellent community mental health services and 96 staff working in the community, there are only two staff working in the community in Tallaght? In Kildare a lousy &euro;30 per head of population is provided for mental health services. It is not true to say that there is a comprehensive community based integrated service available here. If the Taoiseach believes in a fairer and more caring Ireland will he see to it that the Government commits real resources to do an effective job in respect of those people identified by the Amnesty International report as in dire need of effective and decent services? Will he commit the Government to that now?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>I would be the first to admit that for half a century the resources that went into mental health were insufficient. What we have done in recent years is try to catch up and develop a service but we cannot resolve all the problem. In the past two years an unprecedented additional &euro;70.7 million was given to resources and we have put &euro;190 million into the capital end. We all know and accept that those resources were necessary. Many of the large psychiatric hospitals required modernisation and redevelopment, many were rebuilt and a large number of people moved into the community.</P>
      <P>When one looks at the figures for the number of people who were in institutions under the care of the State who have now moved into the community, compared to before Planning for the Future in 1984, it is fair to say that there is a comprehensive community based service although it may not be perfect. People are engaged on behalf of the health boards, visiting, minding and caring for people in hospitals and homes owned by the health boards and for those who are in rented accommodation. This year for the first time specific funding has been made available for the development of advocacy services. I accept that enormous strides still need to be made. I am not saying that the mental health service is beyond criticism but we are making progress.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte:</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to come back to the leg<Col N="44" /> acy the Government has left to the over-burdened taxpayer as a result of the deal with the religious congregations. It diminishes this House that one got more answers in the weekend newspapers than I did in pursuing this matter last week with the Taoiseach. I ask the Taoiseach now to skip the bit about his apology, which we welcomed, and to accept that everyone wants to see the victims get the speediest possible awards.</P>
      <P>Did the Taoiseach ever discuss this matter with Cardinal Connell? Is it true that the deed of indemnity that protected religious congregations and gave unlimited exposure to the taxpayer was drafted in Arthur Cox's office on behalf of the religious congregations? Was the agreement based on figures that were grossly out of date &ndash; between 900 and 2,000 victims? Is it true that when the deed was signed in June the Department of Education and Science had 3,000 claimants on its files and that there are now 5,000 victims? Is it true that the estimated figure of those alive who spent time in those institutions is between 20,000 and 30,000?</P>
      <P>Who authorised or directed the intervention of the Minister for Education and Science at the time, Deputy Woods? Who advised the Minister? I draw the Taoiseach's attention to a document of 14 January 2003 to the finance committee where the official stated that the Office of the Attorney General and the Department of Finance were involved in the negotiations but &ldquo;however, the final agreement was negotiated by the Minister for Education and subsequently endorsed by the Government&rdquo;. Who accompanied the Minister for Education and Science? I accept that I was wrong last week when I said that he did it two days before he left office &ndash; he did it the day before he went out of office.</P>
      <P>Why did the secretary to the finance committee feel obliged, the same day, to redo a revised note that changes the meaning of that separate involvement of the Minister for Education and Science, leaving it open to many interpretations? How can the Taoiseach justify leaving the taxpayer with unlimited exposure as a result of a secret deal that never came before the House and in respect of which he refused to answer questions last week?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>I answered questions on this last week and on several other occasions. I never had discussions with Cardinal Connell or any other religious person on this matter. I was at none of the discussions whatsoever, contrary to the impression Deputy Rabbitte gave on the &ldquo;Today with Pat Kenny&rdquo; programme this morning.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There seems to be confusion over the agreement reached with the religious congregations. That agreement gives indemnity to a number of religious orders that ran institutions which the State entrusted with functions that perhaps it should have carried out itself. There is no agreement with the Catholic Church as some people are endeavouring to make out. There is no deal <Col N="45" /> with it and there is no agreement giving it indemnity.</P>
    <P>Despite Deputy Rabbitte's difficulty with my raising the Residential Institutions Redress Act 2002, I will explain again. It is about providing financial compensation to people who suffered abuse in residential institutions. These were institutions which the State entrusted with functions that the State should, perhaps, have carried out itself. The agreement concluded between the State and the religious congregations was about ensuring that the religious made a meaningful contribution to the State's redress scheme. I use this opportunity to reject the bogus claim that this agreement was a rushed or secret deal pushed through in the last days of the previous Government. The Deputy's office is well aware that nothing is further from the truth. The negotiations with CORI on the extent of the contribution began at the end of 2000, contrary to the misleading opinion some people seek to generate. The House and the public were kept well abreast of developments.</P>
    <P>As far back as 22 November 2000, the Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Woods, issued a comprehensive statement saying that the religious congregations agreed in principle to participate in a child abuse compensation scheme. In the period since then the Department issued statements on at least three occasions detailing progress of the agreement with the religious congregations on contributions to the redress scheme. This can hardly be described as secretive behaviour. I excuse Deputies for not having the time to log into the Department's website to read the statements there.</P>
    <P>I remind Deputies that the Residential Institutions Redress Bill 2002, which is central to the agreement with the religious orders, came before the Oireachtas not less than 16 times over five readings in the House and four readings in the Seanad. As well as the opportunities presented by open debate on the Bill, I and Ministers have answered numerous questions on the issue. The agreement with the religious orders came before the Oireachtas no less than 16 times over five readings in this House and four readings in the Seanad. As well as the opportunities presented by the debate on the Bill for open discussion on the proposed agreement, both myself and Ministers have answered numerous questions on this. I looked at one or two debates from the Official Report at the weekend in which Deputy Bruton and the former Deputy Shatter received replies from the Minister in regard to provisions of compensation; that is not a secret agreement. On 20 June last year Deputy Shortall raised the agreement on the Adjournment and Deputy Bruton did so last week. Last week when Deputy Rabbitte was looking for the agreement I did not know that Deputy Shortall was given an assurance that the Official Report had been put in the Oireachtas Library last June.</P>
    <P>Throughout 2001 officials in the Departments of Finance and Education and Science, as well as <Col N="46" /> the Office of the Attorney General, had at least ten meetings with representatives of CORI. All of these are documented, all of them are on Department files. I was not aware of those matters last week, but they are all on record.</P>
    <P>A point was reached based on what was thought to be the maximum numbers.</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>There was no exact, scientific formula for reaching a figure for the contributions of the congregations, but there were guiding considerations. The State was looking for a voluntary contribution as it could not compel the congregations to pay and it did not want to put such a burden on them that they would be driven out of business. The Department of Finance had suggested that it should be on a 50:50 basis, according to the figures then available, which was the approach taken.</P>
      <P>The redress board was designed to facilitate victims. As we all know, it requires a much lower standard of proof than is the case with the courts. The religious congregations were quite happy to go into the courts on a case by case basis; it was the Government that was not happy with this arrangement.</P>
      <P>In May 1999, I was the one who had concerns about it. I was the one who was not prepared to go on saying to these people that the State did not give two damns about them. I made the apology. We made the system easy so that these people could get their money rather than having to go in and fight the State on cases that were 30 years old. I do not make any apology for what the last Government or this one did to help these people. I am afraid that Deputy Rabbitte is wrong in this case.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte:</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach obviously had notice because his servants on the payroll of the State were listening to the &ldquo;Today with Pat Kenny&rdquo; radio show. Is that the best the Taoiseach can do? The only document in the Oireachtas Library is one that refers to the redress scheme. The four folders which are referred to in it were not in the Library up to this morning.</P>
      <P>The Taoiseach avoided all of my questions. There is no point dragging in red herrings about the Catholic Church. I never referred to the Catholic Church but was careful to refer to the religious congregations. The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform is advising the Taoiseach. Will he advise him as to whether he was involved in this indemnity? If there is anything the Taoiseach does not understand about this question, will he please ask me about it? Was Deputy McDowell, in his then role of Attorney General, involved in drafting the most open-ended indemnity in the history of the State? Is that not a clear question? If he was then how did it get past him and if he was not, then why not?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>How many cases are contained in the four folders? There was 3,000 at the time of signing, <Col N="47" /> although a deal was done on completely out of date numbers. Is it true that there are now 5,000? Who accompanied the then Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Woods? Who directed that he should become involved? Did the Taoiseach's colleagues know when they authorised &ndash; the Minister for Health and Children appears to find this very funny.</P>

It is an extremely important matter and is not simply a question of Sinn Féin becoming involved in the policing boards, as it is sometimes reflected in a facile manner in the media.

      <P>It is hoped that the discussions tomorrow afternoon and tomorrow evening will be about the restoration of the institutions and finding a way of restoring devolved government to Northern Ireland and that they will deal with all the important aspects which have been broached in the discussions that have been going on since November. There are a number of important issues and Deputy Ó Caoláin has mentioned some of them. Demilitarisation, the end of paramilitarism and the establishment of trust and confidence are important issues. Policing has to be dealt with. I agree with what the Deputy has stated and I said in reply to Deputy Rabbitte dur<Col N="50" /> ing Question Time last week that policing is probably one of the most important issues because without trust and confidence by the community in the Police Service of Northern Ireland it will be difficult to make the progress we all want to make.</P>
      <P>In Weston Park we had moved close to the Patten proposals and the legislation reflecting that position is going through the Houses of Parliament in Westminster at present. I know there are outstanding issues but I hope tomorrow's talks will give an opportunity to find conclusions to some of those very important issues.</P>
      <P>I am sure Deputy Ó Caoláin will agree that the most important task tomorrow is to get a fair agreement, whatever the agenda of the various parties. That means we must reach an agreement which deals with the end of paramilitary activity, targeting, punishment beatings and arms procurement and equally deals with demilitarisation and the question of towers and other army infrastructure in areas where there have not been problems for several years. We will be dealing with the bill of rights and other human rights issues. All these issues will be discussed tomorrow, and starting tomorrow and continuing for the next few weeks I hope we can find resolutions to them.</P>

I accept my responsibilities in these matters and I ask everyone else to accept theirs. There are issues for everyone to deal with. We must move on the issues we failed to resolve during the last period. They are the ending of paramilitary activities and problems relating to that; demilitarisation and policing; and human rights and other issues. I assure the Deputy that I do not see this process as a single agenda but I realise that everyone else has a point <Col N="51" /> to make. I try to include all the issues that have been referred to. People on the other side tend to leave out the issue which is their own party's responsibility, as Deputy Ó Caoláin did today. However, I take a fair view and try to give all points equal importance. I recognise that all issues must be surmounted and we will do our best to do so. We will take our own responsibilities seriously.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Cowen):</NameTxt>
      <P>Last Saturday Kofi Annan, the Secretary General of the United Nations, focused everyone's thinking when he said &ldquo;War is always a human catastrophe &ndash; a course that should only be considered when all other possibilities have been exhausted, and when it is obvious that the alternative is worse.&rdquo;  He went on to say &ldquo;We all &ndash; and first and foremost the leaders of Iraq itself &ndash; have a duty to prevent it if we possibly can.&rdquo;  In the course of the same address, Kofi Annan stated that there is no substitute for the unique legitimacy provided by the Security Council. He emphasised, as he did when the Council unanimously adopted Resolution 1441 last November that &ldquo;if Iraq fails to make use of this last chance and continues its defiance, the Council will have to make another grim choice. The Council must face up to its responsibilities&rdquo;  He then stressed that the Security Council &ldquo;always does so best and most effectively when its members work in unison.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The position set out by Kofi Annan is entirely consistent with the position taken by the Government from the outset of the current stand off. In a few days' time the Security Council will hear a report from the chief weapons inspectors on steps Iraq has taken to disarm. In considering these reports, the Council may need to take deep and serious decisions if they show that this response falls short of what is required.</P>
      <P>Resolution 1441 decided that Iraq was already in material breach of its obligations under earlier resolutions. Despite this, it afforded Iraq a final opportunity to come into compliance. Iraq was required to provide an accurate, full and complete declaration of all aspects of its weapons programmes. Any false statement or omission, together with failure to co-operate, would constitute a further material breach and would be reported to the Council for assessment.</P>
      <P>The resolution also decided that Iraq should provide the arms inspectors with unconditional access to sites and persons. It directed the heads of the arms inspection teams to report immediately any interference or failure to comply. The Council was to convene immediately on receipt of such a report. The resolution then recalled that the Council had repeatedly warned Iraq that it would face serious consequences as a result of its continued violations of its obligations. The resolution did not, however, provide automatic authorisation for military action; rather, did it deliberately place the threat of serious consequences in the context of the circumstances surrounding the reconvening of the Council.</P>
      <P>At the same time, it did not specify that a further resolution was required to authorise the use of force. This would simply not have been acceptable to either Britain or America and given their veto powers, it was simply not attainable. These two countries have long held the view that earlier Security Council resolutions already mandate the use of force, and that no further authorisation is required.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="58" /> Last summer some said that a unilateral military strike against Iraq by the United States and the United Kingdom without reference to the United Nations was imminent. This did not happen. Instead, President Bush brought the issue back to the United Nations. I warmly welcomed that step for which the majority of members on the Security Council, including Ireland, strongly argued.</P>
    <P>After lengthy and intensive debate, in which Ireland took an active and constructive part, agreement was reached on resolution 1441. This left the issue firmly within the framework of the Security Council. This is where Ireland wants to see the issue dealt with and where any further decisions should be taken.</P>
    <P>Resolution 1441 also offered the best prospect of achieving our three principal objectives. These are to obtain Iraq's voluntary compliance with its disarmament obligations; to avoid a military conflict; and to uphold the primary responsibility of the Security Council for the maintenance of international peace and security.</P>
    <P>The first objective is disarmament and this is the key to peace. If this is done, there will be no cause for war. In April 1991 the Security Council adopted resolution 687 requiring Iraq to get rid of its weapons of mass destruction. Some 12 years passed during which Iraq has not made the effort to comply. On the contrary, Iraq has used every means at its disposal to conceal its weapons, to obstruct the arms inspectors and to thwart the will of the international community. This is a regime which launched two wars in the past and has used poison gas against its neighbour and its own people.</P>
    <P>The second objective is to avoid a military conflict. We absolutely believe that force should be used only as a last resort when every other possibility has been tried and failed. No one can have any illusions about the consequences of conflict. Nobody in this House or in this country wants to see a war take place. As firm advocates of the United Nations, we all want to see Iraq comply, as required by Security Council resolutions, so that this matter can be settled peacefully.</P>
    <P>The overriding purpose of the United Nations is to prevent conflict but it also faces up to the reality that the use of force may sometimes be necessary. As Kofi Annan consistently points out, the UN founders were not pacifists. Chapter seven of the Charter empowers the Security Council to decide on the measures needed to remove any threat to the peace.</P>
    <P>We have made very clear our hope that the Security Council would not be placed in a position where it would have to contemplate such a decision, but Iraq must realise that it cannot repeat its mistakes of January 1991 when it tried to deceive and outwit the United Nations.</P>
    <P>The third objective is to preserve the primary responsibility of the Security Council for the maintenance of international peace and security. Ireland has always been a totally committed supporter of the system of collective security, with <Col N="59" /> the United Nations and the Security Council at its very centre. It is now up to Iraq to discharge its obligation under Article 25 of the Charter whereby all UN members agree to accept and carry out the decisions of the Security Council.</P>
    <P>As the UN Secretary General has emphasised &ldquo;All countries have a clear interest as well as a clear responsibility to uphold international law and to maintain international order.&rdquo;  We accepted that commitment as long ago as 1946 when we applied for UN membership.</P>
    <P>The Government has spoken out and used its influence at every opportunity, in every forum and in all its meetings and contacts to urge the need for a peaceful solution. It has insisted that all means short of force must be tried, and that force may be used only as a very last resort. It has repeatedly warned of the dangers which would inevitably result from military conflict. It has called attention to the threat of large scale loss of life, casualties and human suffering. It has pointed to the risk that conflict could destabilise a region which is already volatile. It has pointed out that extremists and terrorists would seek to exploit growing tensions between the Moslem world and Europe and the United States. It has spoken of the possible disruption of economic growth. It has laid particular emphasis on humanitarian concerns, as it always has in such circumstances. It has sought and obtained confidential briefing from the UN Secretariat on the extensive plans it is making to deal with a possible humanitarian crisis. It maintains regular contact with the key UN relief agencies and is ready to take part in a humanitarian conference on Iraq to be held in Geneva on 15-16 February at the initiative of the Swiss Government.</P>
    <P>Last week I conveyed these views to President Bush's special envoy on Northern Ireland, Ambassador Richard Haass when he visited here. It is our strong view that the inspections should continue as long as the inspectors and the Security Council consider that they serve a useful purpose. At the same time, we recognise that the inspections cannot continue for ever. The question of increasing the number of inspectors has been raised but, as Hans Blix has pointed out, the real issue is not the number of inspectors but whether Iraq is willing to co-operate actively with them.</P>
    <P>The report delivered by Dr. Blix to the Security Council on 27 January was disturbing and raised a number of serious questions. In particular, he conveyed that Iraq had not come to a genuine acceptance of disarmament and was not co-operating satisfactorily on substance.</P>
    <P>Dr. Blix set out a whole series of areas where the Iraqi declaration on its weapons programmes was incomplete or unsubstantiated. The Iraqis, for instance, were known to be in possession of well &ndash; documented quantities of weapons. It is clearly up to Iraq to produce evidence to back its claim that it has destroyed these weapons and not for the inspectors to prove the contrary. Among <Col N="60" /> the many discrepancies Dr. Blix listed were 6,500 chemical bombs, holdings of VX nerve gas precursors, and quantities of anthrax.</P>
    <P>It is deeply worrying that Dr. Blix has reported that Iraq is not prepared to co-operate sufficiently on the substance of the issues with the inspectors. Regrettably, the regime in Baghdad seems to respond only to the threat of military action. For that threat to be credible, it has to be real and visible. Kofi Annan reinforced this point when he distinguished between pressure and the actual use of force &ndash; as he put it &ldquo;there is no doubt in anyone's mind that the pressure has been effective. Without that pressure, I don't think the inspectors would be back in Iraq today.&rdquo;  This thought was also voiced by Hans Blix when he said &ldquo;that diplomacy needs to be echoed by force sometimes, and inspections need to be backed by pressure.&rdquo;  The military build up in the Gulf has to be seen in that context.</P>
    <P>Dr. Blix and Dr. EI Baradei were in Baghdad over the weekend. They report that some progress was made, which is welcome, but much more is needed. We all hope there will be further major progress in the remaining days. Ireland has repeatedly stated its view that if Iraq continues with non-compliance, a second Security Council resolution should be adopted. The arguments as to whether a second resolution is a legal necessity are a distraction from the real point. The compelling political reality is that a second resolution will signal the unity and resolve of the international community and the clear legitimacy of any subsequent military action.</P>
    <P>The report which Dr. Blix and Dr. El Baradei will make to the Security Council on Friday will be crucial to all further consideration in that forum. It will be equally central to our consideration at EU level on Monday. This will begin with a meeting of foreign Ministers and continue that evening at Head of State and Government level. We, as a Union, will have by Monday, individually and collectively, to weigh up the chief inspectors' statement. This will be a difficult and awesome challenge. No assessment of the way forward can or should be made until the facts are available. It is not a question of avoiding our responsibilities, but of treating with the utmost seriousness one of the most important documents to come before the Security Council of the United Nations.</P>
    <P>On Friday and over the week-end the Government will be engaged in studying the chief inspectors' report and will be in active contact with our EU partners. The objective of our meeting on Monday is to try to form a common position on the way forward, based on the chief inspectors' report. It will not be easy, however, and may well not be possible. There are, unfortunately, openly different positions at this stage, including between the EU representatives on the Security Council. I am equally concerned about the space that has opened up between many in Europe and the United States, which is in no one's interests. There is also much that unites us. We must not <Col N="61" /> forget that during our term on the Security Council, all members, including Syria, voted unanimously in favour of Resolution 1441. There is total agreement on what Iraq has to do to meet its obligations. It must disarm, and it must do so proactively. A united Security Council has conveyed this message. The Arab League has done so, as have Iraq's neighbours. It has been clear that, in the absence of compliance, the Security Council will have to, as Kofi Annan said, assume its responsibilities.</P>
    <P>Finally and crucially, during his address at Williamsburg on 8 February last, the Secretary General said, &ldquo;There is also universal confidence in the two chief inspectors, Dr. Blix and Dr. El Baradei.&rdquo;  It is around their report next Friday that a consensus should be crafted. This inevitably, as with any fine political judgment, will require a degree of compromise and flexibility all round, while being anchored in the reality that Resolution 1441 was not and cannot be a mandate for endless excuses and prevarication.</P>
    <P>After the inspectors report again, the Security Council, in particular, carries an immense burden of responsibility. It must in the immediate future seek to reach a common understanding on the answers to three questions. What precisely does Iraq now have to do to meet the demands of the council? How long does it have to do it and how will the Security Council discharge its responsibility if Iraq does not comply? It is in all our interests, including Ireland, Europe, the United States and the United Nations, that a consensus on these points is reached following Friday's report.</P>
    <P>As we did during our term on the council, the Government will play its full part in the effort to forge that consensus, both in Brussels on Monday and thereafter.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GayMitchell" hpid="Mr. G. Mitchell Mr. G. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell:</NameTxt>
      <P>Today we debate the crisis on Iraq as preparations for war intensify, the inspectors prepare to report again to the UN Security Council and the division between European and American attitudes to the crisis deepen, as exemplified in the decision by Germany, France and Belgium to veto the reinforcement of Turkish defences by NATO forces.</P>
      <P>As the time of final decision approaches, it is time for the Government to clearly spell out its policy on the crisis. I listened carefully on Sunday to the Minister for Foreign Affairs speak at length on the central issue. Does the Government believe a new UN resolution is necessary prior to any unilateral or multilateral action against Iraq? In the event of no such resolution being forthcoming, will the Government oppose any such action and refuse overflight and refuelling activities to those engaged in any such actions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister at the outset of his speech quoted Kofi Annan who emphasised after the council unanimously adopted Resolution 1441 last November that, &ldquo;If Iraq fails to make use of this last chance and continues its defiance, the Council will have to make another grim choice.&rdquo;  Is that <Col N="62" /> the Minister's position also, because it seems his position has changed, and continues to change, from supporting only multilateral action to leaving open the possibility of recommending to this House that we might support unilateral action.</P>
    <P>The Minister pointed out on Sunday that Resolution 1441 includes the provision whereby failure by Iraq to comply with the provisions of the resolution would lead to serious consequences, and so it should. However, it is for the Security Council, not Britain or the United States acting alone, to decide what these consequences should be. Saddam Hussein has undoubtedly flouted UN resolutions over the years and only now, under enormous and welcome pressure from the United States, it appears the inspectors may be making progress. We must await their report on Friday and, in the meantime, take no precipitous action. I welcome the veto by Belgium, France and Germany of any NATO action for now. At least they show they have a capacity to think for themselves, even though they are NATO partners with the United States.</P>
    <P>The pressure must be maintained on Iraq to comply with the UN resolution. I accept it is not possible to maintain the enormous pressure now deployed indefinitely. I share the Minister's concern in that regard. I believe that when we look at the destruction and death a war would bring, we can surely wait a further two weeks after Friday for a further inspectors' report. I am not convinced the German-French plan for long-term intensified inspection will work because it seems that without imminent threat of war, Iraq may return to its previous policy, perhaps its continuing policy, of lies and deception. At least I acknowledge that the German and French are trying to put forward other ideas for consideration. If the reports from Baghdad in the past 48 hours are true and the regime is now more willing to co-operate, the inspectors should prepare a short final list of demands based on Resolution 1441 and demand final conclusive answers within two weeks. In particular, the inspectors must be given clear evidence of the fate of Iraqi stocks of chemical and biological weapons which it held as recently as 1998.</P>
    <P>It is time for clear thinking and actions. Those who say this is a key element for the credibility of the UN are correct, but not perhaps in the way they mean. Credibility does not come from merely following the lead of the body's strongest member, the United States. The Security Council must ensure that Resolution 1441 is complied with and, if not, it should be prepared to implement the serious consequences mentioned in the resolution. However, the Security Council should reach that view in its own time, based on the assessment of its inspectors rather than on fine dossiers, filled with old magazine articles and postgraduate thesis. The Security Council cannot deliberate indefinitely, but if, as I expect, the inspectors' report on Friday seeks more time, they should be given a further two weeks. The Government should stop its equivocation on this <Col N="63" /> issue. It should articulate in a clean manner its opposition to unilateral action and indicate it supports the idea of giving the inspectors some limited additional time should the inspectors think that worthwhile.</P>
    <P>I want on behalf of Fine Gael to be clear on this debate. We have for months outlined the core elements of what we believe should be the Irish approach to this crisis. There should be opposition to unilateral attacks against Iraq. Only multilateral action supported by the UN should be considered and prior Dáil approval for Irish refuelling or overflight facilities should be sought if multilateral action is authorised by the United Nations. Independent verification should be sought in relation to US and UK reports on Iraq's weapons stock, as distinct from the inspectors' reports. Every proactive step possible should be taken to show that this State stands with civilised, democratic states and against demagogues and dictators.</P>
    <P>Ireland's security and defence needs should be re-assessed. I will repeat time and again, as I do not hear it being raised in any other quarter, that I am extremely concerned about Ireland's ability to defend itself if it leaves itself open to attack or retaliation. The self-serving behaviour of politicians in this House has left this country outside a military alliance. The Defence Forces are not equipped to adequately secure the State, which should be the first duty of the Government and the Parliament. I am extremely concerned about this issue.</P>
    <P>The General Affairs and External Relations Council should be asked to consider the contribution the European Union will make to stability and prosperity in Iraq after Saddam Hussein. I will return to this matter if I have the opportunity. The Government should raise the alarming concerns expressed by Dr. Hans Blix in relation to unanswered questions concerning the possession by Iraq of weapons of mass destruction. It should unequivocally condemn the dictatorship of Saddam Hussein.</P>
    <P>While Fine Gael clearly opposes unilateral action, it realises that multilateral action, authorised by the United Nations, may be needed quite soon. My party will consider supporting such action if it is needed and if it has UN authorisation. I hope, even at this late hour, that war can be avoided. Following Friday's report by the inspectors, the EU leaders should issue a statement spelling out the Union's view that time is running out for Iraq if it is to avoid the serious consequences of its failure to comply with UN Resolution 1441. I hope such a statement will be issued after next Monday's meeting, which was mentioned by the Minister, as it is necessary to ensure the Iraqi regime does not doubt it is running the risk of war. I do not underestimate the difficulty involved in agreeing a text, but I believe it is worth the effort. The Union cannot allow itself to be paralysed due to internal differences and thus sidelined at this crucial time.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="64" /> Actions taken or not taken in the days ahead may have consequences in years to come. It is time for the Government to end the double-speak and to show leadership. It is all very well to campaign for a seat on the UN Security Council, but we have to face our responsibilities, even as a country with the limited power of a small EU member state that is no longer on the Security Council. It is time for clear leadership.</P>
    <P>I am concerned that the Minister mentioned in his speech that there have been discussions with the UN in relation to the humanitarian aid that may be put in place in Iraq in the event of war, possibly after the departure of Saddam Hussein. I have said in this House that the European Union, as the biggest donor of humanitarian aid in the world, should make similar provisions. It should have put in place a long time ago a plan to assist Iraq after Saddam Hussein. The EU should ensure that instability does not become widespread in the region. There will be serious implications, for example, if the Sunni, Shiite or Kurdish communities decide to break away from Iraq.</P>
    <P>We should take account of the real concerns expressed by UNICEF, which has graphically related to individual Members of the House the terrible things that have happened and are happening in Iraq. I have spoken with representatives of UNICEF at some length. Each Iraqi child suffers about 14 episodes of diarrhoea each year as a consequence of water problems and malnutrition and 70% of child deaths result from the illness. It is difficult to believe that one quarter of children are malnourished in a country that had a problem with child obesity until the recent past. The infant mortality rate in Iraq is two and a half times greater than it was in 1990.</P>
    <P>Certain Members of the House believe that the UN should take responsibility for the problems I have mentioned, but it is time that we stopped equivocating on the matter. Saddam Hussein is running a police state. People are terrified to speak against his regime unless they get the opportunity to do so outside Iraq. There are serious problems there &ndash; people are stockpiling kerosene and one third of the population is destitute. It is a little extreme that Members of the House, by implication or statement, claim that the turnaround in the fortunes of what should be a prosperous nation is the fault of the West, the UN or the US. It is wrong to attribute it to anybody but Saddam Hussein. There are dreadful problems in Iraq, including the fact that a blind eye is being turned to the illegal trade in Iraqi oil, which has implications for the economies of Syria and Turkey. Important economic implications for countries in the region like Iran arise not only from the sanctions and the treatment of the people of Iraq by the regime there, but from the war we are possibly facing.</P>
    <P>When the Minister goes to the General Affairs and External Relations Council meeting and accompanies the Taoiseach to the European Council meeting on Monday, could he raise the question of humanitarian aid? The EU should put <Col N="65" /> in place a policy to assist the region, so that UNICEF is not left to rely on its own resources. I understand that UNICEF has about $9 million, but war will cost it $39 million per month. If the situation deteriorates and a war sanctioned by the UN Security Council commences, Europe should assist countries on its doorstep like Turkey and Iran. In particular, it should help the people of Iraq to overcome the terrible humanitarian suffering they have endured and may endure during a war that may result from the actions of Saddam Hussein.</P>
    <P>I would like to question the Minister for Foreign Affairs on some specific matters at a later date. As I said at the beginning, I am not clear whether the Minister stands with Kofi Annan's remarks about UN Resolution 1441. Does the Government stand behind Mr. Annan's comment that another resolution will be needed? The Security Council will have to make another grim choice if the resolution is not complied with.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins:</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to speak during this debate. I want to raise a number of issues that directly arise from the Minister's speech. When the Minister addressed the House in a substantial speech on 23 October 2002 he referred, for example, to the sanctions and to UN Resolution 1409. I note that today's speech did not contain a single reference to sanctions.</P>
      <P>I visited Iraq in 1990, 2001 and again earlier this year. The effect of the sanctions could be seen in the changes in Iraq between 1990 and 2001. I respect the opinions of various Members of the House, but it is important that we speak directly this afternoon. Nobody can defend the impact of the sanctions on the civilian population of Iraq. It is irresponsible to suggest that the problems faced by the people of Iraq are solely the responsibility of the Iraqi Government, although a great deal of responsibility lies with it. However, the greater responsibility lies with the community of nations, including this one, in the name of which so many children have died and continue to die needlessly every month. I have visited the UN 661 Committee in New York during a visit by the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs to the US State Department in Washington where we discussed the 661 Committee. The State Department in the United States came back and said that so many contracts were held up because it did not have enough people to handle them. It then announced a huge number of humanitarian contracts which were suddenly released. These were concerned with medicines which children need for leukaemia, black fever and a host of other illnesses.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The death of children is not a propaganda item. I have no doubt that civilians and children have been caught in the middle between the Iraqi Government and United Nations sanctions. There is not a single reference to sanctions in the Minister's speech yet the people to whom a war would be directed are those who have experienced sanctions for 12 years. The Iraqi Govern<Col N="66" /> ment's food programme is admittedly regarded by the World Food Programme as one of the most efficient in the world, probably free from corruption and delivering a calorific intake per day of about 2,000. If there are perhaps 18 million people relying on it, have they not been driven through sanctions into total dependency on Saddam Hussein and his government? </P>
    <P>That is what has been achieved but, much worse than that, Iraq has never produced its own food. There is no time in its history when it imported less than 70% of its food. Some 200 to 300 missiles are said to be aimed at Baghdad with its population of 4.5 million to five million people. They will knock out the food programme and we should be clear that the movement of 500,000 tons of food per month is needed to replace it. The largest amount that has been moved in one month is 100,000 tons between Afghanistan and Pakistan.</P>
    <P>Knocking out the food programme will impact on an entirely dependent population. The energy that will be knocked out will affect hospitals, clinics and the capacity to look after children. If that is the case &ndash; this is an issue with me whether it is popular or not &ndash; those who advocate the necessity of war under the United Nations charter are under an obligation to consider the consequences of war. There are two separate issues: Iraqi compliance and the instrument of war. There can be no picking and choosing from the UN charter; it opens with reference to saving succeeding generations from the scourge of war and goes on to say that no nation shall threaten another with war.</P>
    <P>It cannot be argued in any internationally legal or consistent way that a Chapter VII or Article 42 resolution can ignore the principles in the preamble or the early articles of the United Nations charter. The Vienna treaty is there to clearly establish this. We must accept the charter. This House should be clear that the United Nations was established to prevent war not to facilitate it &ndash; an important principle. In that regard, it is interesting that in the Minister's speeches and interviews, when this extraordinary silence has been broken, we do not get answers that arise strictly out of international law and our commitments. One question concerns whether a pre-emptive strike would be illegal. The Minister should give us an answer to that question but, notwithstanding that, I will answer. It is illegal. There is no such notion as a pre-emptive strike in favour of collective security. There is no basis in the charter or international law for that.</P>
    <P>I remind the Minister of something that has slipped away in this House in recent times &ndash; the Geneva Convention. For example, its fourth protocol gives explicit directions regarding the protection of civilians and children. There are three minimum directions with regard to children: they must be distinguished from combatants, no infrastructure affecting their welfare must be damaged and children who are dislocated from parents must be facilitated. In the long sections of that <Col N="67" /> protocol is the notion that children in time of war must be given additional food and whatever else is required.</P>
    <P>There is not a single line about the consequences of the instrument of war in the Minister's speech. What is the Government's position with regard to the principle of automaticity? I take the Minister's point that UN Resolution 1441 was concocted so that it could mean anything to anyone who wanted to take meaning from it. The Minister came to this House and said it was an alternative to war. Others state that far from being an alternative it is a preliminary to war. The Irish public are asking the Minister to be active in generating options that are alternatives to war and not to roll over.</P>
    <P>I am not an apologist for the Iraqi regime but I feel it is time that some other facts were heard in the Minister's speeches. For example, within the much-quoted UN Resolution 978, which the United States and Britain say is a mandate for war, is the suggestion that compliance on removing weapons of mass destruction will lead to the abolition of sanctions. Does this House realise that, in April 1994, Mr. Warren Christopher unilaterally removed that suggestion from the negotiations with the Iraqi Government, thereby removing the carrot of compliance. Later on, Ms Madeleine Albright confirmed that the agenda had moved from the destruction of weapons of mass destruction to regime change. Let us hear all the facts.</P>
    <P>I get weary of suggesting the distinction between being a critic of a US foreign policy that wants war and being anti-American. I will not do it today; people know my position. However, I find interesting a document that appeared on the www.newamericancentury.org website on June 3 1997 which contained the following:</P>
    <P>American foreign and defence policy is adrift. Conservatives have criticised the incoherent policies of the Clinton Administration. They have also resisted isolationist impulses from within their own ranks. But conservatives have not confidently advanced a strategic vision of America's role in the world. They have not set forth guiding principles for American foreign policy. They have allowed differences over tactics to obscure potential agreement on strategic objectives. And they have not fought for a defence budget that would maintain American security and advance American interests in the new century.</P>
    <P>It rolls on:</P>
    <P>We need to increase defence spending significantly if we are to carry out our global responsibilities today and modernise our armed forces for the future; we need to strengthen our ties to democratic allies and to challenge regimes hostile to our interests and values.</P>
    <P>They succeeded. In 2003, the United States defence budget was $964.1 billion &ndash; twice that of <Col N="68" /> all of its allies combined and 25 times the $16 billion of the combined enemies list of Ronald Reagan and George Bush II.</P>
    <P>I want to know why the Minister is so silent on other issues, and I think it interesting. He does not come to the House to speak about the impact of sanctions yet we are responsible for those sanctions which are in our name. I want to clearly establish the position of the Labour Party with regard to that. My party is opposed to the war as an instrument, is against sanctions and believes that diplomacy has not been exhausted. It favours initiatives such as the Franco-German one, but there are other possible initiatives including using groups of eminent persons. The Minister should, in our name, use our friendship with the United States and Britain to develop non-war options, which are still possible.</P>
    <P>I noticed several interesting points on my visit to Iraq. Some 46% of the population are under the age of 15; the population of Baghdad is between 4.5 million and five million; and in 1991, 90,000 tonnes of explosives was dropped on Iraq. Jane's Defence Weekly &ndash; a great publication &ndash; is no doubt read by the Taoiseach because it must have informed his suggestion in Portugal that Mr. Colin Powell's statement was a model of clarity. I found that cheap little statement extraordinary. The Minister invites us to let the inspectors conclude their work, yet the Taoiseach makes a comment that turns out to be one of the best robberies of intellectual property in recent times.</P>
    <P>I have outlined what will happen to the food programme for Iraq if war breaks out, with a population dependent on distributed food. I have also described what would happen in hospitals and the destruction that is occurring on a daily and monthly basis. This is not an academic point. The children of Iraq are the same as the children all over the world. While there are Iraqi responsibilities, the resolution 661 committee has worked in an irresponsible manner in what it has visited on the people of Iraq.</P>
    <P>It is also relevant to take account of the new conservative agenda driving the new philosophy to which I referred. The most interesting aspect to the article appearing on the website www.newamericancentury.org, to which I referred, is the signatories, of whom there are approximately 26, including Donald Rumsfeld and Jeb Bush. The article envisages a new century for the United States in which there will be a combination of increased military budgets, a neo-liberal version of the economy and a cultural project. I do not suggest this is the view of the people of the United States, far from it. However, it is relevant to take it into account as a context in this issue. Even with compliance across so many different aspects, it provides an insight into why so many people still want war. That mindset for war must be opposed.</P>
    <P>I have said previously that compliance with the United Nations resolutions is possible. The Minister should reconsider his speech of 23 October 2002 when he correctly, helpfully and intelligently <Col N="69" /> said this issue is about weapons of mass destruction. He suggested that there is no mandate for anything else and he explicitly rejected regime change as a policy aim. What has happened to these views? If the Minister believed them then should he not now be an activist in seeking to avoid the tragedy of war?</P>
    <P>The tragedy of war will not be confined to the civilians and children of Iraq. It will destabilise the region and sow centuries of hatred that can be avoided. The biggest deceit is to make a connection between war in Iraq and international terrorism. For example, there have been two attacks on the life of Tariq Aziz from two of the fundamentalist groups mentioned in the statement by Secretary of State Powell. This war will create a seed bed for hatred and terrorism, such as has never existed before. Silence in the face of this amounts to complicity and silence and inactivity is unforgivable. That is why the people are so much ahead of their Government with regard to the catastrophe we now face.</P>
    <P>It is a long time since I became a Member of this House and I thought the day would never come when I would say that the Vatican has a more advanced position than the Government on this issue. It has made a number of welcome statements, including one where it said it found Secretary of State Powell's statement vague and unconvincing. It has also appealed to the international community to work for peace. The Pope has sent an envoy to Baghdad.</P>
    <P>The Government is hoping that by keeping its head down it can keep right with the forelocking section that would like to have foreign policy run in terms of simple economic gain. It has thrown overboard the fine normative moral agenda it had when it canvassed votes around the world for membership of the Security Council. That is the shame it has drawn on itself. It has the opportunity to become active in preventing and opposing war, answering the questions, taking initiatives and assisting every non-military option. That is what the public seeks and it is what the Labour Party will support and demand.</P>

      <P>What policies have the Government and its Fine Gael colleagues pursued? What position has it adopted on behalf of the State on the international stage? Next Saturday, people from all over the country will march in this city in what will be unprecedented numbers. They will be joined by countless millions of others who will mobilise in 316 cities throughout the world to make a clear and unequivocal statement. It will amount to perhaps the biggest one day global demonstration in our lifetimes.</P>
      <P>I salute the peace campaigners who established their camp at Shannon Airport. By their vigilance they exposed what was happening. They revealed how the Government had concealed its co-operation with the build-up for war and they forced it to admit that both troops and arms were being facilitated and in huge numbers. They stirred the conscience of the people and for that we are grateful. A number of people, including some in this House, hysterically condemned them for damaging a military aircraft. Is it wrong to strike a military aircraft with a hammer in protest at an unjust war, but right for that aircraft to participate in the aerial bombardment of a city full of innocent civilians?</P>
      <P>During the debate on war in the past number of weeks there have been the predictable taunts at Sinn Féin from the usual sources. The Minister participated in these and, as always, he was enthusiastically joined by Deputy John Bruton.</P>

      <P>I will listen to the Deputy and he should at least have the decency and the manners to allow me to continue uninterrupted. I wish to strongly assert my party's position by saying it is consistent with the proud tra<Col N="71" /> dition of Irish republicanism, which we uphold, and with our central role in the peace process. From the days of Wolfe Tone and the United Irishmen, the demands for an independent Irish foreign policy and Irish neutrality have been fundamental to the cause of Irish freedom. As a colonised people we have opposed empires and superpowers and have expressed solidarity with oppressed peoples throughout the world. That is the historic origin of Irish neutrality, an issue that will be visited again in this House on a daily basis in the coming weeks. It is not simply down to Eamon de Valera's position in the Second World War, as the Government often asserts.</P>

      <P>I have only a few minutes so I will cut to the chase. I want to summarise the US position for the Minister: if the arms inspectors find weapons there will be a war; if they do not find weapons there will be a war; if there is a UN resolution there will be a war; if there is no UN resolution there will be a war. Does the Minister agree that there would be a war if the US had its way? Does he think this is a reasonable position? Did he communicate any of this to Mr. Richard Haass when he was over here? I doubt if he did.</P>
      <P>I have listened to you, Minister, and you have frequently sought in this Chamber to outdo Mr. George W. Bush in bellicose rhetoric. Why have you assisted the American war effort? Why is there such an affinity between you and Mr. George W. Bush?</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnGormley" hpid="Mr. Gormley Mr. Gormley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gormley:</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a clue to this affinity in Mr. George W. Bush's walk. The Minister may be familiar with this walk because it is the quintessential walk of a cowboy. There is now a clear identification between the cowboys in Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats and the cowboys in the White House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I believe the Minister's cowboy days are over because he has to answer a number of questions. He has to ask himself if he is closer to Boston than Berlin and if he supports the Franco-German proposal which makes sense, is under the auspices of the UN and will avert a full-scale war in Iraq. The Minister should be endorsing the <Col N="72" /> proposal wholeheartedly. He should welcome the decision of our European partners &ndash; the French, Germans and Belgians &ndash; not to take precipitative action and thereby lessen the chances of a war. If the Minister rows in behind these positive proposals, it will increase the chances of peace.</P>
    <P>I have said in the past that the Minister deliberately misled this House on 13 and 26 November and on 17 December 2002 when he told us he was in full compliance with Irish law. That is clearly not the case. He only signed the orders in question in January 2003.</P>
    <P>In his speech the Minister made reference to Kofi Annan. Again, he has done this repeatedly. Like my colleague, Deputy Michael Higgins, I remind the Minister of what the Charter of the United Nations states under Article 2.4: &ldquo;All Members shall refrain in their international relations from the threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of any state, or in any other manner inconsistent with the purposes of the United Nations.&rdquo;  That is plain and simple. A pre-emptive strike is illegal and the Minister cannot justify it in any shape or form.</P>
    <P>Like many, I am not anti-American. When I went to Iraq along with Deputy Higgins I met the Speaker of the House. I reminded him of his country's spending on arms and the persecution of the Marsh Arabs. This war cannot be justified. It will destabilise the entire region and lead to a humanitarian crisis. The Minister has already stated that we need to prepare for a humanitarian crisis, as if the war had already started. The war will sow the seeds of further terrorism. Has the Minister fully thought out the consequences of his actions or is it simply a knee-jerk reaction to row in behind the Americans on every occasion? I ask the Minister, even at the eleventh hour, to change his mind and back our colleagues in Europe. This is the only chance we have to avert full-scale war.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeHiggins" hpid="Mr. J. Higgins Mr. J. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins:</NameTxt>
      <P>The moves by France, Germany and Russia to slow the mad stampede of the Bush and Blair regimes to launch a war on Iraq are hugely significant. It is absolutely incredible that the Minister for Foreign Affairs, speaking on behalf of the Government today, did not even refer to these new circumstances. Why? It is because the Government is absolutely terrified of offending the US and some of the European powers. It wants to hide from taking any principled position on this question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The opposition of France, Germany and Russia and their Governments is not because they have had a sudden conversion to moral virtue. France and Russia have substantial business dealings with Saddam Hussein's regime. They wish to protect these and are capable of acute cynicism in doing so. However, Russia, France and Germany recognise something more important, i.e. the mass opposition among the working class people of Europe to an attack on Iraq. The ordinary people of Europe have drawn clear conclusions about the present crisis. They know that the <Col N="73" /> mania of the Bush regime to unleash the dogs of war has nothing to do with alleged weapons of mass destruction and that Saddam Hussein is boxed in and has as good a chance of hitting the United States with a pea-shooter as with whatever limited missiles he still has.</P>
    <P>The ordinary people of Europe know that a war would not be to institute democratic rights in Iraq since the United States and Britain, the primary belligerents, continue to support and arm with weapons of mass destruction some of the most vile regimes that still besmirch the face of our globe, more than George Bush could possibly count up to. They know that the imminent war is to corral the second largest oil reserves for the future of US capitalism and to send a message to the huddled masses on our globe, particularly the poor of the Third World, that the 21st century will be the century of the United States empire and that it will set the terms in trade, military might and international politics.</P>
    <P>Contrast the perception of the masses in Europe and their determination to stop the disaster of war with the utter craziness of the Irish Government. Its trembling subservience &ndash; that is all I can call it &ndash; to US foreign policy on Iraq inspires an analogy with a jellyfish. This is unfair to the jellyfish which, like the Government, may not have any backbone but at least have a sting.</P>
    <P>The statements of the Minister and the Taoiseach over recent weeks have virtually invited Messrs. Bush and Blair to start the war. They have faithfully repeated all the old codology about the justification of slaughtering thousands of innocent people and laying waste to a nation because Saddam Hussein is allegedly hiding some of the arsenal which was given to him by the same people who now want to attack him and, incredibly, because he is fostering al-Qaeda in some way. A majority of the US media put this latter point abroad as propaganda. The Government continues to allow Shannon to be used as a launch-pad for war and refuses to say the facility will be withdrawn in the event of a unilateral strike. The Minister is silent because he does not want to break with United States policy.</P>
    <P>I have no illusions about the ability of NATO or the UN Security Council to prevent a war. Should we be impressed if one of the permanent members, China for example, gives its blessing to a war? China still harbours in its Government the butchers of the youth of Tiananmen Square. Should we be impressed if Mr. Putin says in a few weeks that a war is permissible? Mr. Putin brutally and routinely crushes several ethnic and national minorities within his own country that want to have an independent voice.</P>
    <P>For the Iraqi people the whistle of falling bombs will sound no sweeter if they bear a United Nations logo rather than that of the United States of America. To prevent a war, I look to the hundreds of millions of ordinary people in Europe, the Arab world and, crucially, in the United States who are standing up and saying that a war is not <Col N="74" /> in the interests of humanity. It may be in the interest of a minority of the elite of the corporate sector of the armaments industry and of the leaders of the power blocs but the war should be stopped. On Saturday, people will turn out in their millions around the globe to bring that message home to the governments which, like ours, are still not hearing the message clearly enough.</P>

      <P>We find ourselves at a critical juncture in terms of foreign and security policy and major decisions will have to be made over the coming days and weeks. It is a very challenging time for Government and citizens during which we have important decisions to make as to how we want to play our part in this dilemma.</P>
      <P>In all policy decision making areas there exists a hierarchy of values and principles and while many factors can influence our choices, they do not all carry equal weight. There are too often conflicts and dilemmas whereas decision making is only easy when there is a clear and overriding consideration involved. It is much tougher on policy and decision makers when different values and objectives pull us in divergent directions. Only those people who have never had to make responsible decisions in complex circumstances say that the issues involved are simple. Even in this House, there are some who appear to believe that all of Irish foreign policy can be encapsulated in the neat and unassailable word &ldquo;neutrality&rdquo;. They advance neutrality as the sole guide to complex foreign policy decisions and elevate it as the only principle and value that Ireland stands for. They fail to contemplate or question any development of the concept of neutrality as it applies to modern Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While there is a long history of neutrality in our foreign policy, it has by no means been our only value or principle since the foundation of the State in terms of the actions we have taken in difficult circumstances. The first foundation stone of Irish foreign policy is our constitutional mandate to favour the peaceful resolution of disputes, an integral aspect of which is our fundamental commitment to support and work with international institutions to resolve them. Everyone in this House recognises that the lead actor with regard to international security is the United Nations and its Security Council. The effective role of the UN and multi-lateral institutions connected or unconnected to it is central to our foreign policy. A further credo is our traditional commitment to the vindication of human rights and development, areas in which we have a strong profile and are held in high esteem by our peers and our development partners. We are <Col N="75" /> leading donors in the field of development aid to poorer countries. We believe there is a human right to development and we work to realise that belief in practical ways. We work towards eradicating poverty and injustice in the world as well as towards building a fairer world order.</P>
    <P>However, our foreign policy is also charged with the pursuit of the national interest and the understanding of the external environment in which we must work as part of the community of nations. Since 1973 we have been very important partners in the development of the European project, internally and externally, in terms of its shared fundamental aim of sustaining peace and prosperity on the European continent. Among these principles and values, we have a commitment to military neutrality. We are not party to any agreement with an automatic defence commitment, but instead reserve to ourselves the right to decide in each case how, where and when to deploy our defence forces. Military neutrality is just one consideration in our foreign policy approach and at this point in time it is not the primary principle governing our actions. Of the utmost importance in the context of the debate on Iraq is the principle of the peaceful resolution of disputes and the recognition of the UN as the only forum for ensuring international security. The UN not only gives clear legitimacy to armed action where necessary, it requires that the nations of the world respect fully its decisions in pursuit of international security.</P>
    <P>An effective and respected United Nations is central to Ireland's foreign policy objectives. Our mission at the UN is respected for its diligence, professionalism, attention to fairness and its diplomatic skills in brokering compromise. Ireland's constitutional imperative for the peaceful resolution of international disputes and our diplomatic tradition since the foundation of the State is not served by a UN the authority and primacy of which is diminished by any member state. During the 1990s we saw the dangers of defiance of the UN from outside and of weakness from within. It was ordinary human beings and civilians who suffered most. We need look no further than the horrors of the Rwandan genocide to see the need for a decisive and interventionist UN. Members should remember the gross violations of human rights that went unchecked in the Balkans because the UN could not or did not discharge its mandate effectively and allowed itself to be mocked by Milosevic and his brutal regime. We should remember our shame when UN troops abandoned the ordinary people of Srebrenica to slaughter. Even the sceptics now agree that the armed intervention in Kosovo under NATO was effective, though it is not the way things should be done in future.</P>
    <P>The background to our current angst about war and peace in Iraq is not just the atrocity of 11 September, it is also the lessons learned over the past ten years of the need for resolve and surefootedness in the pursuit of international security. <Col N="76" /> These lessons were learned at the expense of the lives of millions of civilians in Europe, Africa, the Middle East, Asia and, after 11 September, North America. Since we align our foreign policy so closely with the UN we should be the strongest defenders of its effectiveness. In pointing to its past failures we must acknowledge that too often they were the result of the politics of inertia and tactical advantage among UN member states. In the 1990s we learned that effective multi-lateral action will not work if the major powers stand in the way. We are seeing similar tensions today among member states of NATO, the EU and the United Nations. I welcome the ferocity of democratic debate on this issue. We are standing at the precipice of an extremely important moment in our history and the more ferocious and robust the democratic debate around the world, the better will be the policy which is made.</P>
    <P>The considerations I have outlined go to the heart of the policy decisions which will be made over the next few weeks and they are much more important than issues of who uses facilities at Shannon. Ireland's vision for the world is not pacifist or neutral, it involves upholding values and internationally recognised rights by getting states to work together through international organisations. That vision allows for the legitimate use of force under UN resolutions in pursuit of those aims. These are dangerous, testing times for political leaders and they are decisive moments for the United Nations. I urge the Minister, Ireland, its colleagues in the European Union and our friends in the United States of America and the United Kingdom not to go beyond the parameters allowed by the United Nations.</P>
    <P>I share Deputy Michael Higgins' worry that there has not been sufficient talk about the humanitarian outturn of a possible attack on Iraq. I was recently at the UN for a briefing and it was very clear that the people working on the food for oil programme had their heads in their hands. They are aware that Iraq is on its knees from sanctions and that a huge percentage of the population relies on the oil for food programme which is now at a standstill. Everything depends on negotiation skills and I hope Ireland uses its traditional diplomatic talents to avoid the tragedy of war.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>The current crisis in Iraq has been discussed repeatedly in the House. This crisis has been long in the making and Iraq has spent 12 years ignoring and evading its obligations as a responsible member state of the United Nations. The heads of the UN inspection teams met with the Iraqi authorities last weekend and indicated that Iraq is prepared to take some steps to meet the demands of the Security Council. The inspectors will make another report to the Security Council on Friday and we hope to hear evidence that Iraq <Col N="77" /> has finally agreed to engage seriously in the crisis, which is of its own making.</P>
    <P>It is less than a week since the US Secretary of State, Colin Powell, put before the Security Council the evidence which the US believes demonstrates that the Iraqi authorities have been systematically deceiving the inspectors about their weapons of mass destruction. Together with the inspectors' reports, this is disturbing. If the US has not proven Iraq to be guilty beyond all reasonable doubt and neither has Iraq managed to demonstrate its innocence, in weighing up the evidence we must consider Iraq's past record.</P>
    <P>Saddam Hussein's regime has a long history of developing and deploying prohibited weapons. Its history of concealment and deceit concerning these programmes is almost as long. In 1984, Iraq became the first country since the foundation of the United Nations to use internationally prohibited chemical weapons against an enemy, as part of its war with Iran. In 1988, Iraq used mustard and nerve gas against its own citizens when it launched a chemical attack on the Kurdish people. There can be no doubt that the Iraqi regime has demonstrated its willingness to acquire and make use of weapons which every other state has willingly renounced.</P>
    <P>Iraq's invasion of Kuwait in 1990 left the international community with no alternative but to act decisively. The Security Council mandated the use of force in order to oblige Iraq to withdraw. It also put in place arrangements designed to ensure that Iraq would be disarmed of the prohibited weapons it had amassed.</P>
    <P>Inspections of Iraq for weapons of mass destruction began more than ten years ago. The Iraqi regime has done everything in its power to delay and frustrate these inspections. As they progressed, it became quite clear that Iraq's efforts to acquire such weapons have been far reaching. In its dealings with the UN inspectors it has been determined to conceal the extent of its programme and to retain as much of its capacity as possible.</P>
    <P>In addition to the chemical weapons which it has acquired and used, Iraq has sought to acquire both nuclear and biological weapons. Inspections succeeded in destroying much of these programmes and the underlying capacity within Iraq to bring them back into being, but many questions remain and there is much which Iraq has never accounted for.</P>
    <P>In their report to the UN Security Council on 27 January, the arms inspectors set out their concerns about what still remains unanswered. Many of their questions have remained unanswered since 1998 and further fresh questions have arisen. These questions should not have come up. Iraq should comply with its obligations to provide a complete account of its arms stocks and weapons programme. If something was overlooked through honest oversight and mistakes, then the Iraqi authorities should have clarified it immediately once it had been raised by the UN inspectors.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="78" /> There is still time for Iraq to face up to its obligations and comply fully with the demands of the Security Council. This means that Iraq must stop treating the inspection process as a negotiation and face up to the reality that the inspection process is an obligation which it must meet in full. There is no room for compromise in this matter. The use and the very possession of those weapons is a violation of international law. Iraq has never even admitted the crimes it has committed in using these dreadful weapons.</P>
    <P>The time for minor concessions has passed. Only through full co-operation with the UN inspectors by Iraq is there a prospect of a peaceful resolution to this crisis. That is what everybody in this House wants to happen. Ireland worked effectively and constructively within the Security Council to ensure the unanimous adoption of resolution 1441, which brought the issue back within the UN framework. In the week before that resolution was adopted there seemed to be a real risk that the United States and others would seek to take unilateral action. This risk was averted, however, and the international community is engaging with the crisis responsibly and collectively. This approach holds out the best possibility of resolving the current crisis without resort to the use of military force. The potential consequences of resorting to force have been repeatedly discussed here. No one wishes to see a conflict. The consequences for the people of Iraq, the wider region and the world in general are dreadful to contemplate and because of this the use of force must be a last resort.</P>
    <P>Regrettably, however, it is plain to all of us that Saddam Hussein responds only to the threat of force. Iraq was placed under sanctions immediately after its invasion of Kuwait but those sanctions failed to compel Iraq to withdraw. The international community was finally forced to resort to military action. Sanctions have been maintained ever since to compel Iraq to meet other obligations, including disarmament. Despite the great suffering this has brought on the Iraqi people, sanctions were not sufficient to compel Saddam Hussein to comply with his obligations. It was only when the further pressure of a credible threat of force was added that the Iraqi authorities agreed to a resumption of inspections. As the Minister for Foreign Affairs has stated, this has been acknowledged by the UN Secretary General and the head of the inspection teams.</P>
    <P>From the outset, Ireland has wished to see the situation resolved peaceably. Sanctions were intended both to put pressure on Iraq to comply with its obligations and to prevent the importation of prohibited materials. The sanctions did not seek to impose restrictions on the importation of humanitarian supplies. Their actual implementation, however, involved a very undesirable result which Ireland has worked to remove. During our time on the Security Council we played an active role in efforts to reform the sanctions so as to minimise the effects on the Iraqi people while maintaining the necessary pressure on the <Col N="79" /> Iraqi regime. Under the arrangements now in place, Iraq is in a position to ensure that under the oil-for-food programme, essential food and medical supplies are available. Regretfully, the Iraqi authorities have often chosen to withhold co-operation even from those arrangements, with dire consequences.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton:</NameTxt>
      <P>There are two aspects of the debate to which I will refer before moving to my main point. The first is the issue of Irish neutrality. Neutrality has been advantageous for Ireland and there is no imminent requirement on us to change it. Making facilities available, in peace time, to the military of other countries is an important decision in itself but it does not necessarily compromise neutrality in wartime, once the facility is capable of being withdrawn.</P>
      <P>The second aspect concerns the divisions in Europe. It would be entirely artificial if there were no divisions on this issue in Europe. The divisions between Governments reflect the divisions that exist among the peoples of all the states of Europe.</P>
      <P>We should be wary of the visceral anti-Americanism of some. Just because America is all powerful, does not mean that America is wrong. We should also recognise that President George W. Bush is, in all probability, a good and moral man who is wrestling with an appallingly difficult choice. To acknowledge that he is a good and moral man is not, however, to say that he is necessarily right in the choices he is making.</P>
      <P>It is said that to go to war against Iraq with the support of a second UN resolution would be all right, but to go to war without it would be wrong. That is not necessarily so. It is important to preserve the system of international legitimacy enshrined in a clear UN resolution, but the NATO war against Serbia over Kosovo did not have the backing of a UN resolution, and the international order did not collapse.</P>
      <P>By focusing on the procedural question of a UN resolution, we allow ourselves to avoid facing the more profound question &ndash; would a war against Iraq, in the next month or two, be reckless or not? The issue is not simply one of right or wrong; there is no easy index one can use to say whether one war is right and another is wrong. The key elements to be considered are proportionality and unpredictability.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A war against Iraq in the next month or so would be out of all proportion with the actual threat posed by Iraq. The risks arising from such a war are far greater than the risks that would arise from postponing it for another six months or so, to see what can be achieved otherwise. There is no parallel with Hitler's Germany in 1938. Germany was a huge power at the centre of Europe, which actively threatened its immediate neighbours. Iraq is poor and does not threaten Europe or America in the same way. Iraq's immediate neighbours are not asking the west for <Col N="80" /> help, in the same way that the Czechoslovakians sought the help of the west in 1938.</P>
    <P>The other issue is unpredictability. Wars which begin for one reason usually end up being fought for an entirely different one. Who could even remember, by 1915, that the First World War had been started the previous August because of a disagreement between Austria and Serbia about extradition and extra-territorial jurisdiction in regard to terrorist offences?</P>
    <P>The 1991 Gulf war, which I supported, is no guide to what will happen now. That war was fought in the open desert where air power was supreme. This one may be fought in the streets and alleyways of Basra, Baghdad, and Mosul. The Russian experience in the city of Grozny is much more instructive about what might happen in this war, than is the war of 1991. Think of the tens of thousands who will die of typhoid, as bombs destroy all sanitation.</P>
    <P>Of course, the morale of the Iraqi military may collapse. Saddam Hussein may be overthrown in the first days, but is that guaranteed? What will happen in other parts of the Middle East during those terrible days? Is there not a risk that events elsewhere in the Middle East might prove even more terrible than those in Iraq itself?</P>
    <P>It is very important to discuss this issue without any sense of moral superiority or anti-Americanism. All the points I make about the imprudence of this war at this time are being made in America itself by loyal Americans. To criticise this war is not necessarily to criticise the notion that America should, in appropriate circumstances, act as the world's policeman; it is simply to question whether this particular policing action in these particular circumstances is appropriate.</P>
    <P>It is a reality that American military power is overwhelming but this is not necessarily bad. America is a democracy and options are debated openly in democracy but democracies can also make mistakes. Saddam Hussein has only made concessions because of the threat of war. It is, therefore, reasonable to maintain the continuing threat of war against Saddam Hussein to guarantee that full disarmament is achieved, but is now the time to turn that threat into a reality or can more be achieved by maintaining the threat without exercising it yet?</P>
    <P>The only circumstances in which Saddam Hussein is likely to use his chemical and biological weapons, if he has them, is if he is attacked, is desperate and has with no way out. It should be remembered he did not use these weapons in 1991 because he had a way out. To wage a war on a basis that leaves Saddam no way out is the best way of ensuring he will use his weapons of mass destruction. Statements about conducting war crimes trials in post-invasion Iraq increase the incentives for all the generals and elite military units to fight to the end using what weapons they have. Going to war now could be the only way of actualising the very threat that the war itself was supposed to avoid. That would be perverse.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="81" /> It is argued that Saddam Hussein is the only leader who has used chemical weapons since World War I, in 1982 and 1988, but does that fact justify going to war now? After all the United States is the only country that has ever used nuclear weapons. The mere fact that the weapons were used in the past in different circumstances does not of itself justify a war in present circumstances. After all the war against Iraq is supposedly designed to &ldquo;pre-empt&rdquo; the use of such weapons. Even if one accepted this doctrine of pre-emption, one must ask why this particular threat needs to be pre-empted at this particular time. After all, there are 12 nations with nuclear weapons programmes, 13 with biological weapons, 16 with chemical weapons and 28 with ballistic missiles.</P>
    <P>Let us not forget that deterrence has worked in the past. Why abandon the old doctrine of deterrence in favour of the new one, adumbrated by West Point, of pre-emption? Let us not forget that, for 40 years, the United States successfully deterred the likes of Joseph Stalin and Mao Tse Tung, two brutal and erratic rulers who massacred millions and who had not only chemical and biological, but also nuclear weapons. If deterrence worked in regard to them, why necessarily must it not work with Saddam Hussein?</P>
    <P>What will happen when the war is over? Iraq is an entirely artificial state, created to fill a gap in the map by tired and indifferent western diplomats in the wake of World War I. How will it be kept together after the war? Will the Sunnis accept majority rule by the Shias? Will it become another Lebanon? Who will administer it?</P>
    <P>The United States has linked its war against Iraq to the al-Qaeda threat. The al-Qaeda network has been seriously disrupted by the demise of its base in Afghanistan and by security services throughout the world, including our own. All that good work can too easily be undone. A war, launched by supposedly Christian powers, against a small supposedly Muslim country is likely to lead to the sort of flood of recruits to al-Qaeda that Bloody Sunday created for the Provisional IRA in 1972.</P>

      <P>The Government needs to take a long, hard look at what it means in human terms to support the drive to war. The Minister needs to admit the consequences of allowing belligerents to use Shannon Airport, of eroding our policy of neutrality and his failure to use the opportunity of the UN Security Council chair to prevent the move towards war in the past year.</P>
      <P>Does the Minister understand what Irish war complicity means as he is not willing to take direction from the Dáil or the people? This is not a debate as we still have a motion in front of us, despite a request for a debate. We do not have a position paper in front of us and, therefore, the Government and the Minister will have to bear responsibility for the outcome of the war that they have decided to facilitate.</P>
      <P>Will the Minister take responsibility for the war's devastating impact on Iraq's 13 million children? Potentially, there will be hundreds of thousands of casualties among children who are at grave risk of starvation, disease, trauma and death because of the first war, the subsequent sanctions and the ongoing bombing raids. More than one million Iraqis, including 600,000 children, have died as a result of conditions created by economic sanctions.

      <P>The Minister is fond of quoting Kofi Annan. He is on record as saying the sanctions against Iraq have not worked as a policy, yet the UK and the US object to the lifting of sanctions. It is little wonder that a climate of hatred is building up against the west that the cur<Col N="83" /> rent aggressive noises are doing nothing to quell. Furthermore, giving equipment rather than money for oil means cash is not available to pay Iraqis and train them to rebuild their country.</P>
      <P>There is no disarming of minds happening, whatever about disarmament in the Minister's litany of quotes. There is no disarming of the hatred that is there. According to UNICEF there will be 16 million people in need of food within weeks of a war breaking out. There will be further seedbeds of hatred against an international, illegal war. Does the Minister agree that military sorties over southern Iraq are illegal at the moment? They are not covered by any UN resolution that is in force. Does the Minister agree that the bombing of radar stations is illegal at the moment? Accordingly, will he require the American military to withdraw from Shannon airport as they are involved in illegal activities?</P>
      <P>We in Ireland are a lucky people. What if the suspicions about Iraq hiding terrorists were to be transferred to this country? When the IRA were carrying out despicable acts, terrorising London, Guildford, Birmingham and Warrington, what if the British Government decided to operate sorties over this country because of suspicions that we were hiding terrorists? How can the Government sit there and expect the Iraqi people to tolerate that type of aggression against their country?</P>
      <P>After 35 years of giving the two fingers to the resolutions of the United Nations there is no talk of Israel coming under that kind of sustained aggression. Ultimately this Government is responsible not just for causing widespread misery but also seriously impacting on the world economy which is clearly marked out by economists who warned about this war.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Defence (Mr. M. Smith):</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pleased to have an opportunity to contribute to this important debate. As the Taoiseach and the Minister for Foreign Affairs have stated on many occasions recently, the Irish people do not want war with Iraq. War inevitably means death, destruction and incalculable suffering. We are a peace loving people, without colonial baggage and have made a name for ourselves as humanitarians and peacekeepers of real substance. This reputation, largely due to the endeavours of our Defence Forces abroad, has been forged from within the United Nations. Our membership of the UN has made us formal members of the international community and as such strong supporters of the system of collective international security laid down in the UN Charter. This has been the position of successive Governments since Ireland joined the UN in 1955. We re-iterated this last year in our programme for Government where the primacy of the United Nations in promoting peaceful international relations is clearly set out. We regard to the UN Security Council as the guardian of international peace and security, and as a Government, it is our duty <Col N="84" /> to discharge our obligations under the UN Charter to accept and carry out the decisions of the Security Council. It is our firm belief that all who believe in an international order based on justice and law must recognise the authority of the Security Council and its decisions on behalf of the UN members. It is precisely through this mechanism that Ireland hopes direct military conflict can be avoided. We do not want war, and passionately believe that force should be the last resort to be employed, only after all other means have been exhausted. However, as members of the international community we can on longer stand by and watch Iraq's continuing contempt for the right-thinking world.</P>
      <P>We would not be at this crossroads of potential conflict was it not for the persistent hostility which Saddam Hussein's regime has shown to the international community. Twelve years ago his megalomania cost his country thousands of lives and set it back years in economic and social terms. After the Gulf War in 1991, the Security Council of the UN sent in arms inspectors to ascertain the extent of Saddam's arsenal of weapons of mass destruction. To the horror of the world, it soon became apparent that the programmes to develop biological, chemical and even nuclear weapons were even more advanced than anyone had feared. Lest there be any doubt about Saddam's willingness to use them, we all remember the chilling pictures of the thousands of his own people massacred with these hideous weapons of mass destruction. Eventually the UN inspectors withdrew frustrated, with the clear impression that these weapons remained extant.</P>
      <P>The economic sanctions imposed by the UN which followed have clearly not caused Saddam to disarm or stop his armament programmes. The sanctions, which the Security Council imposed with reluctance, have been used by the regime to exploit the suffering of their people and as a propaganda tool against the UN. For 12 years now Saddam has defied the international community, but finally patience has run out. In November last, Resolution 1441 was adopted by the Security Council. Ireland was a member at that time and participated actively in the discussions which led to this agreement. One last chance to give up its arsenal of death has been offered to Iraq. By co-operating fully with the returned arms inspectors, a military showdown which Iraq cannot win will be avoided. The international community can no longer allow the shadow of Iraq's weapons of mass destruction hang over the world. The stand-off can be ended and any threat of war lifted by Saddam instructing his agents to comply fully with the decisions of the Security Council.</P>
      <P>Unfortunately, Saddam's record over the years does not give us grounds for optimism. He is a devious bully who would appear to be moved only when he is faced with a credible threat of imminent military force. This is the background to the military build-up that is taking place in the Gulf.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is the Government's clear desire to avoid <Col N="85" /> war. Full compliance with Resolution 1441 holds the key to this. Saddam must disarm forthwith. There is now no other realistic choice facing the Iraqi regime other than to comply with the decisions of the Security Council and indeed of the right-thinking world. The patience of the world has all but run out. Saddam must stop playing games now and even at this late stage allow Hans Blix and his team of inspectors to carry out their work in a comprehensive and full way. Recent days have given us some grounds for hope, as more positive signals have been emanating from Mr. Blix and his team. Although it is not clear if these signs of Iraqi willingness to improve co-operation are sufficiently substantial, it is hoped that his crucial report to the Security Council next Friday will at last show that the Iraqi regime is taking Resolution 1441 seriously.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WillieODea" hpid="Mr. O'Dea Mr. O'Dea">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Dea):</NameTxt>
      <P>In 1991 when Iraq was expelled from Kuwait, the United Nations passed Resolution 687. That resolution solemnly stated that peace, stability and security could only return to the Middle East if Saddam Hussein surrendered all his weapons of mass destruction. Despite his agreement with that resolution and despite a number of subsequent resolutions, Saddam Hussein has continued to defy international law for the past 12 years and continued to treat these resolutions with contempt.</P>
      <P>In November last, the United Nations passed Resolution 1441 which gave Iraq a final opportunity to disarm and threatened serious consequences if it did not disarm. There are not too many law breakers who are given a final opportunity to comply with the law after 12 years of defiance. The people who drafted Resolution 1441 did not define what was meant by serious consequences but I doubt if they had in mind the influx of another few inspectors into Iraq.</P>
      <P>Despite the military build-up in the Gulf, Saddam Hussein is still refusing to comply with his obligations. There is an arcane debate at the moment as to whether or not he is in material breach of Resolution 1441. In my opinion he is in breach but whether he is or not, nobody can deny that he is in flagrant, brazen breach of Resolution 687 and all the resolutions that have flowed from it. The world is at a crossroads and we have a simple choice: compel Saddam Hussein to disarm, either voluntarily or otherwise, or take the path of least resistance and give more inspectors more time indefinitely. In my view the latter option is futile. I have no objection to a delay of a short period as mentioned by Deputies Mitchell and Bruton but this cannot go on indefinitely. Without the co-operation of the Iraqi regime, the inspectors have as much chance of finding weapons of mass destruction in Iraq as one would have of finding a contact lens in a football stadium. Disarmament can only take place if the lead comes from the Iraqi authorities and so far they have failed to take that lead.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Bruton posed the question about how <Col N="86" /> well deterrents worked in the past and why there has been a move from deterrents to pre-emption. The answer to that is very simple. There is one factor now which was not present in the past, the evolution of a global terrorist network with no forwarding address and therefore virtually immune from the threat of retaliation. The very existence of a global terrorist network makes the position of weapons of mass destruction in the hands of any tinpot dictator infinitely more dangerous now than at any time in the past.</P>
    <P>It is irrelevant whether or not there is a link between Saddam Hussein and al-Qaeda. If there was not a link in the past there could be one today or tomorrow. The very existence of these terrorist groups can be used by Saddam Hussein and his likes to attack the west rather than doing so themselves. That is why powers like the United States have moved from the doctrine of deterrence to that of pre-emption.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea:</NameTxt>
      <P>This is not Iraq. We can speak freely in the House. If the world now retreats from the situation the United Nations has adopted under Resolution 1441, the consequences for the United States, the United Nations and the European Union, both short and long-term, will be profound and far reaching. It will mean that the United States's allies and friends can no longer rely on it. It will mean that the enemy of western civilisation will no longer fear it and that chaos, proliferation and radicalisation will be the order of the day.</P>
      <P>Look at the situation in North Korea. That will be replicated several times throughout the globe if western democracies now retreat. It is of paramount importance that any action to force Saddam Hussein to disarm is taken under the aegis of the United Nations. I am a committed multi-lateralist. For political reasons, if nothing else, it is essential to get a further resolution. If the United Nations is now prepared to forget about the serious consequences it threatened last November, and Resolution 1441 remains uncomplied with, then we can forget about the United Nations as the principal forum for enforcing world peace and security. It is goodbye United Nations, hello League of Nations again.</P>
      <P>If the United Nations shows itself as an organisation that does not give a toss whether its resolutions are complied with then one of two things will happen. Either the United States will ignore the United Nations and continue to do so and unilateralism will be the order of the day or the United States will withdraw from the world in so far as it can and a new isolationism will be the order of the day. Neither possibility can be welcome to anybody who has a genuine belief in world peace, stability and security.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I hope the enforcement of Resolution 1441 will not lead to war. I ask people on all sides of this debate to accept my sincerity on that. I realise the consequences of war. War risks destabilisation of <Col N="87" /> the Middle East. It risks increasing support for terrorist groups such as al-Qaeda. Not least, it will result in the death of countless Iraqi civilians. I am not qualified to say how many Iraqi civilians will die in the event of war but even one is more than enough. It is within the power of Saddam Hussein to do what has to be done to bring an end to the sanctions which have caused the suffering so eloquently referred to by Deputy M. Higgins and to avert the threat of war. Deputy Higgins should remember that if we continue to rely indefinitely on inspectors the sanctions he is so worried about will have to remain in place.</P>
    <P>Even at this eleventh hour, the Government is of the view that if Saddam Hussein convinces the inspectors, whose objectivity and honesty we do not doubt, that he has genuinely begun the process of disarmament we will leave no stone unturned to ensure that war does not result in the Middle East.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore:</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to share my time with Deputies Howlin and Connolly.</P>
      <P>Like the Minister of State at the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy O'Dea, I want to see the United Nations being able to enforce its resolutions. I do not want to see it being undermined. One way the United Nations can be undermined is when individual states, or groups of individual states, decide they will prosecute a war anyway and effectively blackmail it into supporting that position.</P>
      <P>On the occasion of this debate we are called to reflect the wishes of the people we represent, many of whom sit in front of their television screens watching in horror at the prospect of war in Iraq. The people I represent, and I share their view, regard Saddam Hussein as a brutal dictator and his regime as a brutal dictatorship. It was that in the 1970s when it was killing off its own internal opposition and people in the west stood by and watched that happen. It was a dictatorship in the 1980s when it was being armed by the very people who are now so keen to prosecute a war against it and it remains a dictatorship now. Iraq may indeed have weapons of mass destruction but I would rather see that adjudicated by Hans Blix and the inspectors reporting to the United Nations than see it unilaterally adjudicated on by those who have already committed themselves to a course of war.</P>
      <P>What we in the House must do tonight is to send out a strong message that we want war in Iraq averted. Prosecuting a war in Iraq will result in the death, destruction and injury of civilians who have already suffered considerably as a result of the sanctions already imposed. It will also unleash the possibility of retaliatory action, either direct retaliatory action, including against those who may be perceived as having assisted in the war effort against Iraq, which is where we come in, or retaliatory action in the longer term in the form of continued terrorism.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A war against Iraq is likely to spawn the kind <Col N="88" /> of anger and motivation which could see another generation of terrorism being unleashed against cities in the United States, the European Union or elsewhere. We have enough experience of the beast of terrorism on this island to know that repressive activity continues and prolongs the terrorist response. Our responsibility is to send the message through our Government that we do not want a war in Iraq. It is regrettable that this message is not being articulated by our Minister for Foreign Affairs. It is more effectively articulated by the Belgian Foreign Minister who said this week in regard to the war and Washington's policy towards Iraq:</P>
    <P>They did not succeed in catching Bin Laden and now they have to find an enemy they can beat. I think it has to do with power, probably, also very likely, with oil, and the humiliation they suffered.</P>
    <P>That is the kind of response that I believe Irish people want to hear from our Government and not the go by the wall response we have been getting from the Taoiseach in Portugal, or on the use of Shannon for the refuelling of aeroplanes or in the form of the interpreting of the United States position that Deputy O'Dea, in particular, seems to have made a speciality. Irish people want to see our Government taking a strong moral position which is opposed to war and which articulates that internationally and in the United Nations.</P>

      <P>This is an important debate and I am sorry we do not have more time for it. It is rare enough that we have foreign policy debates in the Dáil. That is an indication of the culture of this House, which lacks an interNationalist dimension. We seldom formulate a view of Ireland in the world and although we pay much lip service to our role in the United Nations and elsewhere, we seldom debate matters of international importance with strength and conviction.</P>
      <P>I am not a pacifist; I believe there are occasions on which war can be justified. I supported the interventions in Kosovo, which were of a humanitarian nature and were required to save lives. There can be a moral justification on humanitarian grounds for war in certain circumstances. As Deputy Michael D. Higgins so eloquently described in his contribution, we set up an imperfect United Nations structure after decades of dreadful war in the last century with the objective of having an alternative to war as a first resort. It is true that the UN has been cynically abused by many, with power plays and bullying of small countries, but it is still the only world moral authority to protect human rights and to set legal norms and international standards of acceptable behaviour.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Where does Ireland stand now in relation to <Col N="89" /> averting the catastrophe of war in Iraq? Are we acting in a positive way to facilitate alternatives to war? What has the Government done? What has the Minister for Foreign Affairs done in the past number of hours since the announcement of the Franco-German initiative? Where stands the Minister in regard to this? I agree wholeheartedly with much that was said by Deputy John Bruton in regard to the alternatives that must be explored now because of the certainty of the catastrophes that will flow from war.</P>
    <P>The Irish people are asking a simple question. Why the rush to war? Why is the United States setting the pace and demanding the support of its friends. Their friendship is being judged on their absolute willingness to accept the complete diktat of the Unites States on this matter. If it is not accepted then the friendship is severed. Why is Iraq to be attacked this month when it is verifiably weaker than at any time since 1991? Why, when it is clearly weaker and poses less of a threat than at any time in recent years, must the international community rush to war in the next weeks when we know with absolute certainty that there will be awful consequences that are largely unquantifiable?</P>
    <P>The conflict has the potential to become a war with the Islamic world. It will certainly give rise to significant recruitment for international terrorism. The greatest cheerleader for a war in Iraq must be Osama bin Laden who sees the potential for a shift in the opinion of the Islamic world to his perverted view of world affairs. The Middle East will be put into turmoil. Worst of all is the catastrophe that will befall the 26 million people in Iraq, particularly the 13 million children for whom Deputy Michael D. Higgins so eloquently pleaded the case.</P>
    <P>As I said, I am a believer in the use of force to protect human rights. Ireland and its Minister must act in accordance with the wishes of the overwhelming majority of the people who desire to avert war and to be the guardians of international law. We must not be shrinking violets in this regard if we are to uphold the position that was rightly advocated around the world in canvassing a seat on the UN Security Council of being honest brokers and in nobody's pocket.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaudgeConnolly" hpid="Mr. Connolly Mr. Connolly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connolly:</NameTxt>
      <P>The Gulf War of 1991 ended in stalemate between Iraq and the international coalition led by the US and the first President Bush. The Iraqi President, Saddam Hussein, was driven out of Kuwait, which he had invaded six months previously, and the peace agreement required Iraq to destroy its chemical and biological weapons. Teams of UN inspectors regularly searched the country to ensure this, and a strict embargo kept Iraq from selling oil or buying weapons. US and UK aircraft prevented Iraqi aircraft from flying in northern and southern parts of Iraq.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Iraq is one of the world's biggest oil producers. The Saudi tycoons made billions of dollars a year while Iraq's oil was blocked and President Bush <Col N="90" /> made his millions as an oil magnate. The politics of the region are the politics of oil; billions are there to be made and lost by winners or losers. The US and the British wished the embargo to continue while the Russians and French, who wished to profit from buying and selling oil, wanted it lifted. In the late 1990s the international front against Iraq crumbled; each country in the coalition adopted positions to gain the greatest oil profits. Iraq and the US constantly claimed the other was lying, with Iraq periodically blocking inspection teams from certain sites, declaring them to be fake excuses to continue sanctions. The US periodically threatened to restart the war if teams were not allowed widespread access, declaring some weapons were still hidden in the country.</P>
    <P>Despite the best efforts of Bush and his advisers to link Saddam Hussein with Osama Bin Laden and al-Qaeda, using fear of Bin Laden to restart a Gulf war, absolutely no connection was established between Iraq and September 11. However, Bush is planning a war, regardless. The build up of troops is creating a virtual inevitability of war but he is failing to convince the world, notably the NATO alliance, that it is necessary. Germany and France, together with Russia and China, have put forward a plan for Iraq to be policed by UN troops, and that additional arms inspectors should be deployed with broadened roles and a sufficiently extended timescale. That plan should be given a chance, and every avenue possible should be explored to avert war.</P>
    <P>Saddam Hussein is not the only world leader with weapons of mass destruction. Many countries have even more including the US, Russia, China, France, Great Britain, the Ukraine, South Africa, India and Pakistan, and most notably, Israel, which has a small arsenal of nuclear weapons capable of reaching Iraq. However, neither the US nor the UN ever proposed bombing Israel or these other countries &ndash; which points to the existence of double standards. By attacking Iraq, and presenting Osama Bin Laden and aI-Qaeda with the ideal pretext to presume the right to retaliate on a spectacular scale &ndash; one can think of multiple world targets fitting into this category &ndash; Bush and the US are legitimising all the multifarious fundamentalist terror groups to gain further footholds and wreak havoc on vulnerable targets around the world.</P>
    <P>Two bloody wars have failed to oust Saddam and have merely strengthened his hold on power, and it is doubtful if another military conflict would create real peace. The Clinton Administration announced in 1999 that UN inspection teams had destroyed many times more chemical and biological weapons than the 1991 Gulf War. Any new war will not even target weapons stockpiles which are impossible to locate. US air strikes would most likely target facilities already under UN inspection, and bombing would most likely destroy UN monitoring equipment.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="91" /> Iraq's army is a shambles. It is a shadow of the army that invaded Kuwait in 1990 and is so weak it does not pose a threat to neighbouring countries. War will not reduce Saddam's weapons stockpiles and will probably not drive him from power. War will enrich a few people. Stockholders of military equipment manufacturers and Arab sheiks will gain the longer Iraq's oil is barred. War will cause Iraqi civilians to suffer while Saddam hides in his bunker.</P>
    <P>Since 1991, as a result of the US-led economic sanctions against Iraq, 1.5 million Iraqi citizens, including 600,000 Iraqi children have died from lack of food. The military directors of the United States need a new evil empire to justify its existence and test its newest toys. The United States Government was elected by a minority of the electorate but resembles an aristocracy and is run by and for the elite few, a ghoulish cast of war mongers and assorted bloodhounds who are in charge of foreign policy. In Ireland our main difference with the US is with its foreign policy. Let us have none of it.</P>

Does the Minister accept that resolution 1441 does not give permission to the United States or any other country to take action with multilateral support? The Minister also mentioned that the resolution did not, however, provide automatic authorisation for military action, rather did it deliberately place the threat of serious consequences in the context of the circumstances surrounding the reconvening of the council. He said:</P>
      <P>At the same time it did not specify that a further resolution was required to authorise the use of force. This would simply not have been acceptable to either Britain or America, given their veto powers. It was simply not attainable. These two countries have long held the view that earlier Security Council resolutions already mandate the use of force and that no further authorisation is required.</P>
      <P>Does the Minister support that view? Would the Minister support a statement by the EU Heads of Government or Heads of State warning Iraq of the consequences of non-compliance with resolution 1441?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What is the Minister's view of the Franco-German proposal for an increase in the number of inspectors and their support by military forces and overflights? How would the Government intend to implement a no-overflight policy in the event of the United States taking military action <Col N="92" /> against Iraq in the absence of a fresh UN resolution? What plans are in place to ensure the safety of Irish citizens in the Middle East in the event of a conflict in that region?</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen:</NameTxt>
      <P>On a number of occasions I stated the Government's policy regarding that matter and it is clear. The resolution does not provide for automatic military action. It refers to the report of the inspectors having to be referred to the Security Council for consideration. Apart from the legal argument about whether there are mandates for military action in the event of non-compliance in respect of this or previous resolutions, the Government is clearly of the view that there is a political requirement, in the interest of maintaining the unique legitimacy of the Security Council, that a second resolution should be passed in those circumstances. I cannot make it any more clear than that. That is the situation.</P>
      <P>Regarding what Kofi Annan had to say, I obviously quoted him in support of my argument and I agree with his statements. I stated clearly in my speech that the position set out by Kofi Annan is entirely consistent with the position taken by the Government from the outset of the current stand-off. That is our position.</P>
      <P>Deputy Mitchell asked me what the situation would be in the event of military action taking place. In the event of us getting to that point, with or without UN sanction, there would be a debate in the House on that matter. At the moment statements are being enunciated by Members of this House for the purpose of devising a strategy which avoids that situation. When we get to that stage we can have a discussion on the position based on the facts as they exist at that stage. What we are dealing with here is how do we get to a point where war is averted. None of us wants to see a war. The problem is that people have different views on how we might avert war. My role as Minister for Foreign Affairs and representative of the Government is to uphold the policy of recognising the primacy of the United Nations.</P>
      <P>The United Nations has set out the position. We do not have to go back before resolution 1441. We are having enough debate in relation to the resolution as it stands. The UN Security Council, which under international law is the body to establish what is a threat to international peace and security and how it might be averted, has set out in resolution 1441 how it unanimously came to the view as to what should be done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Regarding the rush to war, we must bear in mind that we are talking in the context of a 12 year problem. Resolution 687, which was drawn up as a result of the ceasefires set out clear obligations on Iraq to comply with the terms of that ceasefire. For a series of reasons, about which people can argue, Iraq has not complied. Political and diplomatic efforts have been made and economic sanctions have been applied. People can criticise how the 661 committee organised those and what interpretation it took, and successive Irish Governments had a particular view on all <Col N="93" /> that. However, the present position is that resolution 1441 was a culmination of a 12 year process whereby the Security Council eventually decided that despite the fact that material breaches existed it was prepared to give a final opportunity to the Iraqi regime to resolve this matter in a way in which the enforcement provisions of the United Nations charter would not come into play.</P>
    <P>Deputy Michael D. Higgins ascribes the greater responsibility regarding the present situation to the international community rather than to the Iraqi regime. I am sure he sincerely holds that view, but I disagree. The primary responsibility for the resolution of this problem lies in the hands of those against whom the resolution is directed. They have an opportunity to resolve this point. People say they are sorry to hear this being stated by me <i>ad nauseam </i>but it is the point of departure from which we must embark on a journey of discussion if we are to maintain the international order. The international order under the Security Council states that Iraq must comply, but it has not complied. We are using the inspectors as a means of reporting back to the Security Council whether the co-operation which has been lacking so far can now be forthcoming. The Security Council has indicated clearly and unanimously that in the event of continued non-compliance, based on previous experience, serious consequences will follow.</P>
    <P>There is no question of the Government not having a position. I defy anyone to suggest that the broad position I have articulated has in any way deviated from the position of the UN Secretary General in relation to this matter since resolution 1441 was adopted or that anything I have said is inconsistent with supporting his position. It must be acknowledged we are in a difficult and dangerous situation. Of course there is concern about the consequences and what might happen. I have articulated and recognised this concern. We recognise also that we operate from the principle that collective security arrangements, the international legal order, requires this regime to comply. It is not a question of having had a rush to blood to get them to do it now on the basis of threat of war, it is as a result of 12 years of every effort known to us, short of military action, to get them to comply. It has brought terrible consequences for an innocent Iraqi population. That is true. We did everything we could in our own way during our time in the Security Council and we would claim some credit for Resolution 1409, which changed to some extent how the previous sanctions regime operated.</P>

      <P>This is a proposal we must study and we have to ensure we know exactly what is being suggested. Hans Blix has made the point that it is not more inspectors he needs. He just wants to see a commitment to co-operate sufficiently to deal with the situation. On the question of UN soldiers going in there, that requires the consent of the Iraqi regime, quite apart from whether it will garner sufficient support in the Security Council as a viable way forward. When there was a suggestion of some military people going with the inspectors &ndash; when Resolution 1441 was being discussed and before it was finally adopted &ndash; there were countries in the Security Council who opposed it, including some who come up with that proposal now. I will be in Berlin this week and will discuss the matter with Joschka Fischer and I will then be in a better position to report to the House precisely what they have in mind.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins:</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand what the Minister has said. After the passing of Resolution 1441, three permanent members of the Security Council, China, France and Russia, stated that their interpretation was that the resolution did not automatically allow force. In the course of his two speeches at the end of last year and this year, the Minister has referred to the divided opinion that led to Resolution 1441, two countries which would not accept that they would lose any automatic rights to take military action, namely, Britain and the United States. What is the Minister's opinion? Does he believe that Resolution 678 has built into it a concept of automaticity? I wish to ask another question because it arises from the comments of the Minister of State, Deputy O'Dea. Does the Minister share with him the view that pre-emption is consistent with an interpretation of the UN Charter? Does the Minister believe in the concept of a pre-emptive strike outside of the UN Charter and that it can be squared with international law?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I asked what consideration had been given to it but the Minister referred to it briefly only in his speech. What I cannot get an accurate answer on <Col N="95" /> is whether the Minister has been concerned about the application of the Geneva Convention, the fourth protocol in relation to the protection of civilians and children. In relation to other matters, compliance with our own laws, uniformed presence, the carriage of weapons, the overflying and so on, a matter that has not been addressed is the Ottawa Convention. The statutory instrument that implemented the Ottawa Convention in Ireland in 1996 accepted the principle that unlike all the others, no Government or Minister would give permission for the production, sale, distribution or the carriage of landmines. Is the Minister in a position to say if his vigilance so far can guarantee us that the principles of the statutory instrument of 1996, which implemented the Ottawa Convention of 1993, have been fully complied with in relation to the present threatened situation in Iraq? Has he had discussions with any of the international or voluntary agencies in regard to a humanitarian aid pact?</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen:</NameTxt>
      <P>I will deal with the questions as best I can. On the question of pre-emptive strikes, the use of military force is illegal unless it is used in self defence as recognised under article 51 of the charter or if it is sanctioned by the Security Council.</P>

      <P>We want to see the UN framework maintained. We want to see the Security Council making any decisions on any issue that goes beyond the consideration of the report by inspectors in Resolution 1441. That is our clear position and we have outlined it. We have made the point that others take a different legal interpretation and that they claim otherwise. We have set out our belief on the situation, even though that issue is contested by others.</P>
      <P>In regard to the Geneva Convention, these are detailed questions to which I will give a considered written answer. My reaction to it is that one would expect in the event of a war, which we are trying to avert, that it would be conducted within the international parameters in which war takes places. From our point of view, our focus is on trying to bring about a situation where the international community can come together and put a position to the Iraqi regime which is clear, consistent and provides for them to show their good faith, if they have it, to deal with the situation comprehensively in a way which will allow the international community to put an end to this problem without war.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen:</NameTxt>
      <P>On the sanctions, we have worked during our time and with some moderate success, towards improving the sanctions regime. There still remains a common view &ndash; it is not the view simply of a veto on the US and the British &ndash; that the sanctions regime should remain in place until such time as there is compliance. That is a view that is still held within the Security Council. From our point of view, we are getting to the point where if Iraq complies all those issues are resolved. The question of sanctions automatically becomes resolved if they deal with the issues which have been long outstanding. The sanctions regime was brought forward by the Security Council as action short of military action to indicate its determination to deal with the fact that non-compliance was continuing in respect of Resolution 687 and subsequent resolutions. We do not hold a brief for every decision made by the 661 committee. We made our views known to them on many occasions in respect of narrow interpretations which were taking place regarding dual use. We put our position clearly and consistently and there was no difference between what we were doing and what our predecessors did regarding that matter. All of that can be said clearly.</P>

      <P>I am trying to tease out who is telling the truth. Donald Rumsfeld, the US Defence Secretary, stated that the US is in a state of war with Iraq. The military sorties and the bombing of radar stations, which have been witnessed by UNICEF and are reportedly causing civilian casualties, are illegal in UNICEF's view. Does the Minister concur with that view? Is the use of Shannon Airport, therefore, illegal under Irish law because we are participating, co-operating and complicit in those illegal actions? Will the Minister respond to that question because it is one which will be tested in court and the Government's view should be clear?</P>

We had a debate on it last week and there is no point in me going over it again. We are not participating in a war by providing these facilities. We can provide empirical evidence, supported by the UN Secretary General and others, confirming that this military build up has provided the necessary pressure &ndash; referred to by Dr. Blix regarding his ability to get into and to look at these inspections, quite apart from testing the co-operation or otherwise of the Iraqi regime. The Deputy has a different view on that and there is no point in us going over it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen:</NameTxt>
      <P>Good try.</P>
      <P>I hope I can recall all the questions but I ask Members to forgive me if I do not. In relation to our citizens in that general area, obviously we are working with our ambassadors and embassies, bringing to their attention the dangers and difficulties, which they would know as citizens themselves, and instructing them to make arrangements if they believe they are necessary. We are not at the stage where we are telling people to evacuate or otherwise.</P>
      <P>In relation to my discussions with Ambassador Haass, which covered not only Iraq but Northern Ireland, he made himself available to the press and made clear the views of the US Administration. Those views were similarly expressed to me in the bilateral discussions we had and, as I said in my speech, I outlined our position.</P>
      <P>In relation to Deputy Higgins's question, I have made the point that we have the Security Council resolution and the inspectors who are the interlocutors with the regime and who have been authorised by the Security Council, the sole body to deal with this issue, to bring forward a report which we all hope will meet with the requirements of the situation. In the event that it does not, then the Security Council will have to consider that, make an assessment and come to political judgments. Serious decisions will have to be taken.</P>
      <P>As regards what I will be doing in the interim and at the European Union, I do not believe it is in the interests of the international community to deepen divisions in relation to this matter. As someone put it to me quite well over the weekend, one gets the impression whether people mean it &ndash; I am sure they do not &ndash; that there are some on one side of this argument who will not take &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; for an answer and some on the other side of the argument who will not take &ldquo;No&rdquo; for an answer. In other words, it appears there are some who believe that no matter what is achieved with the Iraqi regime, it will not be sufficient.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Those on the other side of the argument might well be of the view that there are no circumstances in which they will ever be satisfied with the level of co-operation with the Iraqi regime, such as bringing about an enforcement mechanism. I believe that the majority of Europeans are between these two positions. We must ask our European partners on the Security Council, who have a responsibility at this time, to remain within the Security Council framework. They must involve themselves in a dialogue which will find the areas of agreement necessary to ensure the resolution is implemented, uphold the credibility of the United Nations and, as outlined in my speech, get the specifics at this stage so that we can maintain international support and solidarity <Col N="100" /> and the unique legitimacy of the multilateral system through the Security Council.</P>
    <P>In the aftermath of the Blix and El Baradei report on Friday, what precisely will we be asking the Iraqi regime to do, because it is very likely it will not be able to confirm sufficient co-operation so that the dossier can be closed? The responsibility is not for people to search for another way forward, but to stick to what has been agreed, provide confirmation as to what precisely must be done, within what timeframe and find common agreement on what will be the serious consequences if the demands are not met within that timeframe.</P>
    <P>It behoves everyone on the Security Council to work towards a consensus, which will have two benefits. It will provide a clear way forward and a clear and common understanding by the international community as to what is required of the Iraqi regime, having enunciated the principles set out in Resolution 1441 and having tried unsuccessfully up to now to adequately deal with the situation to everyone's satisfaction. It must provide clarity and direction so that the problem can be solved multilaterally. Those who oppose unilateralism must ensure that the multilateral approach is seen to be effective and coherent and has the collective political will to do the job effectively so that the Iraqi regime will not continue to miscalculate and prolong the problem on the basis that the international community will not do what it has promised. I hope we can avoid conflict but there should not be misunderstanding about our resolve to face that prospect and make that grim choice, as the Secretary General said. We must do everything in the meantime to avoid this situation, but the Iraqi regime should not miscalculate our resolve to take action.</P>

      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That Dáil Éireann, recognising that 2003 is the European Year of People with Disabilities, supporting the wonderful national effort that has gone into the preparations for the Special Olympics World Games, conscious of the fact that there is a growing crisis in essential services for people with disabilities throughout Ireland, and noting that no allocation whatever has been made for new services and places in 2003, calls on the Government to immediately:</P>
      <P>&ndash;&nbsp;allocate an additional &euro;35 million for new places in the current year;</P>
      <P>&ndash;&nbsp;arrange to meet the national bodies representing people with disabilities to agree a plan to eliminate waiting lists for all essential services within three years;</P>
      <P>&ndash;&nbsp;publish the Intellectual Disability Database, which contains the most up-to-date information on waiting lists for people with intellectual disabilities;</P>
      <P>&nbsp;and</P>
      <P>&ndash;&nbsp;bring forward the long-delayed Disability Bill, on which agreement has now been reached within the consultation process established by Government.</P>
      <P>While Ireland is a rich country, now one of the richest in the world, a small population of vulnerable citizens face frustration, distress, fear and pain. They face these conditions because of Government choices, and for no other reason.</P>
      <P>When the Book of Estimates was published before Christmas, there was palpable shock in the community of people with a disability. Nothing of significance had been allocated to the services on which many of them and their families depend. Many of these services throughout the country are running in the red, dealing in the main only with emergencies. All of them report long waiting lists for every element of service. It was clear from even a quick look at the Book of Estimates that there was nothing there to enable the waiting lists to be reduced. However, there was at least the consolation that the budget was to come. For at least the past 20 years, every Minister for Finance had made an allocation in the budget to enable new places to be created and some inroads were made in the waiting lists.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In recent years, as a result of a plan drawn up by the former Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Cowen, the amount allocated had been substantial and there was a great deal of hope in the community that the continuation of the plan might result in the numbers on waiting lists declining. There was, therefore, deep shock among people with disabilities throughout Ireland when not one additional cent was allocated in the budget. This was despite pre-budget submissions from individual organisations throughout the country, from the nationally representative umbrella groups like NAMHI, the Federation of Voluntary Bodies, the Disability <Col N="102" /> Federation, the Forum of People with Disabilities and others. Not one cent was allocated in a budget that accounted for more than &euro;31 billion of income and more than &euro;26 billion of current spending. There was not one cent for additional places or services for people with disabilities. In one of the richest <i>per capita</i> countries in the world, people with disabilities were immediately condemned to wait even longer than before for essential services.</P>
    <P>To add insult to injury, the Government spin machines immediately went into overdrive. The Taoiseach said:</P>
    <P>It is terrible. We have done really well by people with disabilities for the last few years, and I am really determined to get back to that, but right now we cannot afford to be generous.</P>
    <P>This patronising and condescending tone was compounded by the announcement in the budget by the Minister, Deputy McCreevy, not about disability or people with disability, but to the dormant accounts fund. He said the fund would be established, using unclaimed dormant account money from financial institutions and that the funds disbursed would be spent on charitable and community projects, with a particular focus on children with learning disabilities.</P>
    <P>Just a few months earlier, the Government produced a Disability Bill which ignored the long-held demand for rights on behalf of the disability movement. It withdrew the Bill under pressure from an outraged movement, then in the budget the Minister for Finance told people with disabilities that the only progress they could expect was through charitable donations from the dormant account fund. The passage in the budget speech, in a way, sums up the Government's attitude to disability. It is prepared to pay lip service and to distribute crumbs from the rich man's table, but when the going gets a bit tougher, people with disabilities know what they can expect from the Government. People with disabilities are the last to benefit when the economy is growing and the first to be sent to the end of the queue when the Government decides that public spending must be tightened.</P>
    <P>We do not know the extent of the crisis faced by people with disabilities because the Government cannot, or will not, publish the data. The last time the intellectual disability database was published was in 2000, even though it was supposed to be available annually. When it was last published, it outlined that 1,711 people currently living at home need a full-time residential service, 861 people need a day service, 1,014 people need a respite service and 462 people have no level of service whatever. Almost 500 people with intellectual disabilities are, in effect, locked in psychiatric hospitals and many of them, as we know, are held in appalling conditions. Life is just as grim for people with physical, sensory and other disabilities. Overall, 70% of people with disabilities are unemployed and, according to Combat Poverty, a household headed by a person with a dis<Col N="103" /> ability is likely to be below the poverty line. There is no right of advocacy, no law relating to access and no means of redress when rights are ignored. What do these statistics mean? Many of those living at home, in increasingly urgent need of residential facilities, are middle aged or older and depend on frail and elderly parents. An elderly man, who was taken into residential care by a Dublin agency last year, had to be treated as an emergency case because his mother, on whom he had depended, had just died at the age of 102.</P>
    <P>Highly disturbed adults with behavioural and emotional problems, with which their families can no longer cope, need to be recognised by the State as citizens with the right to support. The only support they receive, however, is a lengthening queue. Respite care &ndash; a break away from home for a week every now and then &ndash; is often the only support given to families. It can bring enormous relief to families; a chance to gather strength so they can continue to carry out the work of the community. The care of an adult with intellectual disabilities is often accompanied by physical, emotional or behavioural problems, such as violence, incontinence, shouting and the self-infliction of injury. It involves commitment and dedication 24 hours a day, seven days a week. The arrival of disability into a family, in the absence of support from the wider community, can mean heartbreak and despair.</P>
    <P>It is a mystery that any Government can turn a blind eye to such a problem. We need to ask how much money is needed to solve it. In my opinion, if we were to put a reasonable figure on it and to conduct a referendum on that basis, we would secure a resounding majority for action, even if the costs involved necessitated an increase in taxation. Such a measure is not needed, of course, as approximately &euro;120 million in extra current revenue, with perhaps an additional &euro;80 million in capital revenue, would make significant inroads into waiting lists. It would help people to live in dignity and comfort, enable services to be put in place to contribute to life-long education, help train many people for work and give hope for the future. A sum of &euro;120 million spread over three years, for example, is a pittance, given that the annual total budget is &euro;31 billion. The additional expenditure required represents a lot less than 0.5% of our annual budget. When one considers that the public finances are still capable of producing massive current budget surpluses, it is to our shame that we choose to spurn our most vulnerable citizens.</P>

      <P>The website of the European year spells out its objectives and reasons in clear and simple terms. There are 37 million people with disabilities in the European Union; that is one in ten of us. Disabled people are people with equal rights as workers, consumers, taxpayers, politicians, students, neighbours, family and friends. Disabled people are not treated equally, however. A recent European survey showed that there is a serious lack of understanding of the meaning of disability and the amount of people affected by it. Although disabled people should be treated as equal citizens with the power to speak for themselves and not as objects of pity or charity, they are often excluded from society through poor education and unemployment, which lead to poverty. This year represents an opportunity to change the future for disabled people &ndash; a good future for disabled people means a good future for all people.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms B. Moynihan-Cronin:</NameTxt>
      <P>The best way to mark the European year would be for the Government to reverse its extraordinary decision to allocate nothing for new places in this year's budget. It is clear from the website of the European year that people from all over Europe will be encouraged to look at Ireland in admiration because of the extraordinary community effort that has gone into the preparations for the Special Olympics World Summer Games. The Government, including the Taoiseach, has shown considerable generosity of spirit and commitment in relation to the games. It realises that the games will demonstrate to the world that the only limits to achieving full human potential are the barriers we put in place. The corporate, community and individual goodwill that exists towards the games demonstrates that there is huge support for anything that will tear down the barriers. The generosity of the Government in that context contrasts sharply with the mean-spirited way in which it has responded to the range of issues and obstacles being faced by people with disabilities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As a result of the cutbacks we face, service providers are being forced to tell parents of young people with intellectual disabilities of school leaving age that no service can be guaranteed for them this year, the year of people with disabilities. As I have said, the Government has failed to publish an up to date intellectual disability database. The conditions in Drumcar, County Louth that were reported recently will be replicated elsewhere if staff shortages continue to increase. Services for people with physical and sensory dis<Col N="105" /> abilities have been frozen in effect and parents and families of people with disabilities are being relied on increasingly to cope with the additional stresses and costs involved with less and less support.</P>
    <P>The Government is moving away from recognising rights and towards expecting people with disabilities to rely on charity. It should be ashamed. It has promised to bring in a rights based disability Bill, after the fiasco of its last attempt. A consultation process was established and has reached a broad consensus. That consensus repeats what the disability movement has been demanding from our hard-of-hearing Government for several years. It demands a statutory right to an independent, inclusive assessment of needs at the time of onset or diagnosis of the disability, together with a statement of needs arising from that assessment. This has remained a bottom line demand of the disability movement for many years. I hope that, before this debate is over, the Government will finally and without further delay commit to honouring its promises and undertake to bring in the Bill this year.</P>
    <P>This motion does not demand a lot, certainly not more than we can afford. People with disabilities readily acknowledge that resources were made available in the past for vitally needed services. However, it is not acceptable to be told that now they must go to the end of the queue. The best measure of a civilised society is surely to be found in how it protects those who are vulnerable, how it enables those who have barriers to overcome and how it listens to those who have no voice. By that standard and by any measure, even allowing for the investment already made, the Government might say it has a lot done but it has an awful lot more to do.</P>
    <P>Every Deputy in the House knows of people with disabilities and their families. I welcome those with disabilities and their representatives in the Public Gallery. I know that Government Deputies will speak on this motion and say that they support people with disabilities. However, the only support to give is to walk through the lobby tomorrow night and vote for this motion. I commend the motion to the House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms McManus:</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to contribute to this important debate. I thank Deputy Moynihan-Cronin for ensuring this important issue was taken in Private Members' time. When cutbacks are levelled at the disability community by the Government and it is simultaneously trumpeting its promotion of the European Year of People with Disabilities, a debate like this offers an opening for those without power to speak and be heard, people with disability and those who care for them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When I attended the launch of the Year of People with Disabilities, I was struck by the fact that powerlessness can make people brave. So many people turned out and stood their ground in the rain to get a message across to the Govern<Col N="106" /> ment that what was being done was wrong and that cutbacks were affecting them. When the family commitments of these people is considered, because they are living with disability, it is to their credit that they came from Counties Kerry and Donegal &ndash; one woman from Cork got up at 3.45 a.m. to attend. They stood in the rain and cold when they could have been inside enjoying the razzmatazz, listening to the brass bands and enjoying the speeches. For all that, they were insulted by the Taoiseach. I hope there will be an apology during this debate for the ill-grace and bad manners of a Taoiseach who does not understand the pressure these people are under and the point they were making.</P>
    <P>In the Year of People with Disabilities, people with disability are being sold a pup. In a year when Ireland is hosting the Special Olympics, our special Olympians and their companions are facing disappointment, cutbacks and Government failures. As spokesperson on health for the Labour Party, I want to focus on one aspect of that failure. Despite repeated questions inside and outside this House, the scandal persists of the continuing use of psychiatric institutions for the placement of people with a mental disability. Why should this matter? It matters because such placement is totally inappropriate for the needs of those with mental disability and because, as the Amnesty report just published shows, our psychiatric institutions are in real trouble and require reform, funding, resources and staffing.</P>
    <P>I can talk about the reality of what it means to a parent to have a child placed in such an institution but I would prefer to let a parent speak for himself. I quote from a letter I received today describing his experience:</P>
    <P>My youngest daughter Sheila is 40 years old this month. She is autistic. In 1984, the health board placed her in a psychiatric hospital, ignoring my protests and assuring me it was only a temporary measure until a place could be found for her in a suitable facility. Some time in 1985, she was threatened with drowning in a bath. She told me about it. She was terrified to the extent that she would only whisper to me. I complained to a friend who alerted the hospital that I was giving bad news about them.</P>
    <P>I was asked to attend a meeting in the hospital. I was ambushed into a meeting with the person in charge of the hospital and about 30 doctors and nurses as well as the hospital's solicitor. I was not introduced to the gentleman, nor was I allowed to speak. He verbally abused my daughter for more than 30 minutes. I asked him why she was terrified. He did not reply to this. To this day, I do not even know his name. The full implication and purpose of that ambush was to give me a clear message, to keep my mouth shut or it would be worse for my daughter.</P>
    <P>I have never been so intimidated in my life. So when they started forcing my daughter into strait-jackets, I knew, but felt powerless to protest. After some years, thankfully, that practice <Col N="107" /> ceased. All the years she was in that hell-hole, she was abused by the use of very potent and dangerous drugs. No human being could withstand such treatment and in 1999, she fell ill and was taken to the general hospital.</P>
    <P>Her family were called and told she had five hours to live, but live she did and recovered. I blame the excessive use of drugs over a very long period of years for that occurrence. The excessive use of drugs has also distorted her beautiful speech to the extent that I can no longer understand what she is trying to say to me. During the last few years, my daughter has been subjected to an increasing amount of time in the silent room. When I brought her home for good in March of last year, I asked her how much time she spent in the silent room. She glared at me and said: &ldquo;All day, every day.&rdquo;  Why?</P>
    <P>I have no doubt that there is another side to this dreadful story. Many of those who work in our psychiatric institutions are heroic in meeting their duties in difficult and demanding conditions. However, the distress of this parent is real and cannot be disregarded. The Minister for Health and Children needs to explain why this woman and others are still being placed inappropriately even though we now have the necessary resources, which were unavailable to any past Government.</P>
    <P>The plight of the mentally ill and the intellectually disabled in Ireland is a matter of national concern. The Amnesty report published this week highlights the failure of the Government to address issues as fundamental as legislation, resources, staffing and funding to provide a reasonable standard of mental health care, which is all that is sought. It often amazes me how quickly we in this country condemn and express disgust about facilities for the mentally ill in other countries &ndash; in the developing world, for example &ndash; while rarely is condemnation expressed about facilities here in Ireland.</P>
    <P>The Amnesty report should be debated in this House in Government time. It should lead to a new approach to psychiatric illness and mental health. It should end the placement of people with intellectual disability in psychiatric institutions once and for all. However, we know this will not happen. Now that the general election has been won, the Government is paying its bills for the goodies it gave out before the election. It is doing so not by raising taxes or borrowing money but by targeting the weakest and most vulnerable in our society. That is why there is a reduction of overseas aid this year, why we are seeing cutbacks in our health service and why the Government has chosen to make cutbacks in the area of disability.</P>
    <P>The fact that this is the Year of People with Disabilities does not matter a whit, but like the rain falling outside the Mansion House, the fall-out of these cutbacks will be felt by those with disability and those who care for them. At Ques<Col N="108" /> tion Time today, the Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children, Deputy O'Malley, brushed aside concerns about emergency cases of people with disabilities expressed by members of the Opposition. Emergencies will be looked after he reassured us, he is in charge and will make sure of that. The reality is that there is no budget to cope with emergencies when a relative dies or suffers ill health and can no longer care for a disabled family member. What is likely to happen? While a place will be found it may be in a psychiatric hospital. The experience of a parent of a person with autism, quoted in the report by Amnesty International, will be repeated. The report states:</P>
    <P>Living alone I was unable to cope with her full-time and I had to hand her over to the health board and she was placed in a psychiatric hospital. I was assured that the placement was a temporary measure until such time as a place arose in a more suitable centre. That was in 1994 and she was still there until I rescued her in 2002.</P>
    <P>This is happening as we speak. The fumbled and feeble response today by the Minister of State, Deputy Tim O'Malley, convinces me it will continue to happen, possibly to an even greater extent as the numbers grow and the failure by the Government to meet the needs of people with disabilities becomes more acute.</P>
    <P>Let us be under no illusion. There is no inevitability about this state of affairs. The problems at St. Mary's at Drumcar can be resolved and the practice of incarcerating disabled people in psychiatric institutions can be ended. However, the political will and determination is needed to address a scandal that should belong solely in our past, yet which is, disgracefully and unnecessarily, part of the present. Unless there is a sea change in Government policy this will continue.</P>
    <P>It is important to remember that outside this House many people are caring for loved ones who are suffering from disability and who require constant care and sacrifice. They are the unsung heroes who are often unacknowledged. The European Year for People with Disabilities should have been concerned with acknowledging the importance in our society of people with disability and those who care for them. It is a recognition that has been given by local communities with regard to the Special Olympics where enormous efforts are being made to look after people with disabilities who are coming from other countries. Communities are rightly excited by the project of creating hospitality, including a home and accommodation that is secure, friendly, comfortable and welcoming. By contrast, the Government has failed to provide a similar kind of comfort.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JanOSullivan" hpid="Ms O'Sullivan Ms O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Sullivan:</NameTxt>
      <P>I commend my colleague, Deputy Moynihan-Cronin, for proposing this motion on behalf of the Labour Party and for giv<Col N="109" /> ing us the opportunity to place this important issue at the top of our agenda. The purpose of the motion is to ensure it is also placed at the top of the Government's agenda. It seeks to ensure that the Government will release funds to address the urgent problems of people with disabilities, their families and carers. By ensuring this debate we hope there will be a change of heart and that funding will be allocated.</P>
      <P>My colleagues referred to cases brought to their attention concerning families and individuals who have no place to go, are worried about having a place to go or who are inappropriately placed. I wish to draw the attention of the House to the views of two service providers who are dealing with this issue on a daily basis. The Daughters of Charity of St. Vincent de Paul state:</P>
      <P>More than 50% of emergency residential placements are not even on the waiting list but occur generally due to family carer crises, death, serious illness, abuse, etc. The other 50% are addressed in the normal course of events through new development funding. This year, no emergencies will be addressed, thus doubling the number of emergencies. Waiting lists will grow at an increasing rate. Children leaving the school system in July-August requiring day service places will have to stay at home.</P>
      <P>The Minister of State, Deputy Tim O'Malley, will be familiar with the situation at the Brothers of Charity, Bohermore, Limerick. The director of services states:</P>
      <P>There are no new developments. We have a waiting list of 36 people who require residential services; 25 people requiring day services and over 150 children who urgently require educational and health related services. None of these men, women and children will get a service in 2003.</P>
      <P>There is no provision whatsoever to respond to emergencies. Experience tells us that there will be at least three emergencies in the coming year, usually resulting from the death of an elderly parent or carer. No provision has been made for children who finish their schooling and who anticipate a service from the Brothers of Charity.</P>
      <P>This is the reality according to the service providers. We ask the Minister, the Minister of State and their colleagues on the Government benches who will vote on this motion tomorrow, to please address this issue in a caring manner and in a way that understands the reality I and my colleagues have outlined and which those in the Gallery must contend with every day of their lives, 24 hours a day, where they do not have a placement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have been calling for rights-based legislation for some time and the issue has been on the agenda for approximately six years. The Government knows what those lobbying for it want and that the Bill last year was withdrawn because it was not rights based and did not pro<Col N="110" /> vide for an assessment of needs and the right to have them addressed. It also failed to provide that people with disability would have the kind of services they require, whatever their disability, be it physical, sensory or intellectual. The promised legislation must address these aspects. Anything less is unacceptable. The relevant disability law in the United States is a good example of rights-based legislation.</P>
    <P>We are now a rich country and we can afford to look after people in various categories of life. However, surely we cannot afford to neglect those who are most needy. We cannot afford the present situation to continue where parents will die and where, for one reason or another, carers will no longer be able to respond to the needs of their family member. There is no funding and no places are available.</P>
    <P>The Government must address this issue. It is a question of priorities. If the public was to be canvassed on priorities in terms of expenditure, the needs of people with intellectual, physical and sensory disabilities would be among the top, yet it appears that the Government is ignoring this. If the consultancy, advertising and PR budgets of two or three Departments was channelled into this area the necessary funding would be provided, including the sum of &euro;35 million outlined in the motion.</P>
    <P>On behalf of my colleagues and, even more, on behalf of those who deal with this situation on a daily basis, I make a heartfelt plea to the Government to readjust its priorities and provide the required funding. In the past couple of weeks there has been widespread debate on the payment of millions, if not billions, of euro in compensation to those who were neglected in residential institutions and those, such as haemophiliacs, who were also neglected by the State. Let us not make the same mistake in this current era of plenty and wealth. Let us provide for our least privileged citizens, including their basic needs, in terms of the allocation of funding and the enactment of rights-based legislation this year.</P>
    <P>Therefore, if people need something they will have a right to it and they will not have to struggle, lobby, come to the Dáil or attend public meetings to attain that right for the weakest of our citizens.</P>
    <P>I urge the Minister to heed this motion, provide the funding and ensure this struggle does not continue for many families this year so they will not have to face the problem of not knowing what to do with their disabled family members.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB" hpid="Ms Burton Ms Burton">
      <NameTxt>Ms Burton:</NameTxt>
      <P>This motion is really about the credibility of the Government six years into office in light of its record of bungling ineptitude and lack of management skills, despite the large sums of money which the Minister of State will undoubtedly recite for us. We are sick of the apologies and we want competence in the management of resources.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My colleague, Deputy O'Sullivan, spoke about the letter from St. Vincent's on the Navan Road <Col N="111" /> in my constituency. I attended a meeting that the Minister kindly hosted with parents associated with that institution. Some of the most disabled children in the institution were offered enhanced educational services as a consequence of the various court judgments. Because of the absolute failure and incapacity of both the Ministers for Education and Science and Health and Children to come together to look in a holistic way at the needs of the children, parents have been left walking the streets of Dublin 15 and Dublin 7 for the past six months. When this issue has passed, I am sure we will get another apology, but it is essential at this stage to say that it is not simply a question of money, but a question of this tired and jaded Government, six years into office, not having the capacity to produce essential reform.</P>
    <P>If the Minister follows my contribution with another list of the moneys that he has allocated, we will not want to hear it. We want to hear that the children who need both educational and medical services are receiving them and that the Minister and the Department have the capacity to sit down, as many people in small business do, and make a list of what needs to be done. They must establish a timescale and make plans.</P>
    <P>What has happened so far in respect of the institution on the Navan Road is a double disgrace and involves the rights that the parents have identified as being the health-related and educational rights to which their children are entitled. Most of the parents around the rest of the country have not even been informed by the Departments of Education and Science and Health and Children that their children are also entitled to those rights.</P>

      <P>&ndash;&nbsp;recognises the need for the further development of services to people with intellectual, physical and sensory disabilities and those with autism,</P>
      <P>&ndash;&nbsp;approves the Government's commitment to put in place an enhanced level of service provision in line with the programme for Government,</P>
      <P>&ndash;&nbsp;commends the actions taken by this Government and the former Government since 1997 in meeting this commitment, which include the allocation of additional funding of &euro;555 million; and</P>
      <P>&ndash;&nbsp;notes the commitment in An Agreed Programme for Government to   conclude the consultation process and publish an amended Disability Bill in 2003.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am pleased to have an opportunity to speak on issues related to the provision of services for <Col N="112" /> people with disabilities and to outline what the Government is doing to meet the needs which have been identified for this population group. I assure the Deputies that there is an equal amount of compassion on this side of the House regarding the issues of disability, be it of an intellectual, physical or sensory nature. Nobody has a monopoly of compassion in this area.</P>
    <P>The significant progress made in terms of the growth in funding available for the sector in recent years is indicative of the Government's commitment to the ongoing development of Department-funded services for people with disabilities. Since 1997 there has been an unprecedented level of investment in this regard. Additional funding amounting to &euro;555 million has been invested, which has enabled substantial progress to be made with regard to the development of residential, respite, day, therapy and other support services.</P>
    <P>Additional revenue and capital funding of &euro;327 million was provided for intellectual disability and autism services between 1997 and 2002. This revenue has provided approximately 1,700 additional residential places, which are mainly based in the community. This figure also includes new residential respite places created in 1997 and 1998. Between 1999 and 2002, around 465 extra dedicated respite places were provided. In addition, 2,950 new day places were created.</P>
    <P>We have also funded alternative placements and an enhanced level of services for persons with an intellectual disability or autism who were resident in psychiatric hospitals or other inappropriate placements. The number of persons accommodated in psychiatric hospitals in October 2002 was 452, down from 571 in 2001 and 970 in 1996. By any yardstick, that is a fantastic achievement. The new accommodation provided has included community based homes and a number of residential and day complexes.</P>
    <P>Since 1998 approximately &euro;14.6 million has been put into the system to enhance the early intervention, pre-school and multi-disciplinary support services for children with intellectual disabilities and autism. Between 1999 and 2002, the Department provided additional funding of &euro;11.43 million to enable health boards to put in place a range of support services for persons with these disabilities who present with major behavioural problems and therefore require a more intensive level of support.</P>
    <P>The 2001 report from the national intellectual disability database is being finalised. Preliminary information indicates very substantial increases in the numbers of people accessing services, particularly residential and respite services. These figures reflect the impact of the 2000 development programme and indicate that between 1996 and 2001, there was a 10% increase in the number of persons availing of full-time residential places.</P>
    <P>In the area of respite services, the increase has been over 200%. The numbers in receipt of multidisciplinary services have increased by over 300% while the number of children accessing early <Col N="113" /> intervention services has risen by over 200%. In addition to providing funding for new service developments, we have made a significant allocation to meet identified needs in existing services. These needs arise as a result of the changing profiles of persons with an intellectual disability or those with autism in the services &ndash; in particular the residential services &ndash; who are increasingly older and more medically fragile. There are also issues of under-funding of base budgets and a need to consolidate elements of services previously funded from other sources such as fund-raising. My Department has sought over the years to address these issues as resources have permitted and to this end allocated additional revenue funding of &euro;27.2 million between 1998 and 2002. The recent report commissioned by the Brothers of St. John of God in St Mary's, Drumcar, commented on staffing levels as well as other service related issues. I am confident that progress will be made in addressing these issues as a result of the discussions which are under way between my Department, the North-Eastern Health Board and the religious order.</P>
    <P>Approximately &euro;180 million in additional funding has been provided since 1997 to maintain and develop services to people with physical and sensory disabilities. Such services include residential services, respite services, home support services, including personal assistants services, therapy services and day care services. Over &euro;20 million, which represents a significant proportion of the funding, has been provided specifically for home support services. A further &euro;71 million has been provided in once-off grants for capital projects and the provision of technical aids and appliances.</P>
    <P>I met various groups representing people with disabilities and each one is made up of excellent, committed people, many of whom are volunteers. They do fantastic work. All of them acknowledge the progress that has been made over the past several years. I have visited many facilities within the disability sector since being appointed as a Minister of State last year and I intend visiting many more in the coming months. I use this opportunity to record my appreciation of all staff and carers involved in looking after people with disabilities. It can be a difficult job and it is only right that we work closely to provide appropriate standards of care in our services.</P>
    <P>It is essential that the Department can access at a national level data which relates to people with disabilities who use or may need to use the health services. A national database can inform planning, service development, prioritisation of service needs and resource allocation at national, regional and local levels. I take this opportunity to answer allegations that my Department delayed the publication of the 2001 and 2002 annual reports of the national intellectual disability database in order to conceal the true state of waiting lists for services. The annual report is compiled from the regional data sets provided by <Col N="114" /> the Eastern Regional Health Authority and the health boards. A delay in the submission of one regional data set meant it was not possible to compile the information which forms the basis of the annual report. This was the case in 2001 and 2002. The 2001 report is currently being finalised and will be published next month and the 2002 report will follow in early summer.</P>
    <P>There has been no attempt by my Department to delay the publishing of these reports. On the contrary, the Department has made extensive efforts over a considerable period of time to obtain the delayed information in order to facilitate the completion of the reports. Furthermore, the health boards have been informed in their 2003 letters of determination that, given the key role of the national intellectual disability database in planning and monitoring service provision, compliance with the timetable for the compilation and submission of data is vital. They have also been informed that there will be no extension of this timeframe in relation to the export of data to the Department and that they should take whatever measures are required to ensure that this deadline is met.</P>
    <P>In April 2000, information from the national intellectual disability database indicated that in the period 2000-04, 1,711 new residential places and 912 new day places would be required to meet identified needs. In addition to the day places required to meet the needs of those awaiting placement, the extra funding also provided for those requiring a change in day care services. These include young people leaving school and requiring rehabilitative training places or those moving from rehabilitative training to sheltered occupational services, activation or services for older people. Initial indications from the 2001 data reveal that while the impact of the 2000 development programme is reflected in the data, a significant number of persons still seek residential services in particular.</P>
    <P>Deputies have asked why waiting lists continued to grow given the level of investment made in these services in recent years. Significant revenue investment amounting to &euro;188 million has been made since 1997 and is built into the ongoing budget base. Additional funding of &euro;13.3 million has been allocated to services for persons with an intellectual disability or autism in 2003 to meet the full year cost of the 2002 developments and to further enhance the health related support services to children with an intellectual disability or autism. One of the primary factors relates to the demographic profile of this population group which is contributing to growing waiting lists for residential services even though the number of people receiving full-time residential services continues to increase. The increased birth rate in the 1960s and 1970s has resulted in large numbers of adults in their late 20s and early 30s requiring full-time residential services now. People with an intellectual disability are living longer than previously and are using services for several more years than did previous generations. The research <Col N="115" /> literature indicates that the increased longevity in this population is primarily attributed to improved health and well-being, the control of infectious diseases, the move to community living, improved nutrition and the quality of the health services. The changing age structure among those with moderate, severe or profound intellectual disability has had and will continue to have major implications for services in the years ahead.</P>
    <P>This has also been the international experience in service provision to this segment of the population. It would be foolhardy to believe that addressing this identified need will solve all our problems. Recent experience in the United States has shown that while residential capacity increased by 27% between 1987 and 1996, the number of persons requesting services increased by 38%.</P>
    <P>A review of the waiting lists between 1997 and 1999, conducted by the Health Research Board and published in the 1999 annual report from the national intellectual disability database, showed that while 269 people from the original waiting list of 1,439 had received full-time residential services in the period, the waiting list had grown by an additional 238 places. This would indicate that an extra 507 people had joined the waiting list in the period.</P>
    <P>While there are factors which cannot be controlled and which add to the challenge of responding to waiting lists, there are a number of things which can be done. For example, having data of good quality helps to inform decision-making and assists in developing plans to deal effectively with waiting lists.</P>
    <P>In conjunction with the Health Research Board, health boards and the voluntary sector, the Department of Health and Children is currently implementing a national physical and sensory disability database which will provide a picture of the specialised health and personal social service needs of people with a physical or sensory disability within a five-year period.</P>
    <P>With the availability of information from both databases to facilitate planning and monitoring of services delivery, the Government can pursue its proven commitment to the ongoing development of these services. It is my intention to work with officials from my Department and the various service providers, both statutory and voluntary, to get a more comprehensive picture of the overall health expenditure in the whole area of disability. This will enable my Department to determine the effectiveness of current expenditure and identify measures which might increase effectiveness and the relevance of services to people with disabilities and the implications for future funding. I also intend, with the help of my officials, to draw up a blueprint or benchmarking process where we can analyse what is best practice in Europe and see how other European countries look after their people with disabilities.</P>
    <P>The Disability Bill 2001 included important <Col N="116" /> new measures for people with disabilities in relation to the introduction of a new assessment of need system for health and related personal services for people with disabilities. Last year, my Department worked in close co-operation with the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform and it will continue to co-operate closely in bringing forward an amended Disability Bill later this year, as the Government has committed itself to do.</P>
    <P>The Disability Bill was published in December 2001. The initial welcome for the Bill, described the following day by the editor of <i>The Irish Times</i> as a &ldquo;milestone in Irish social history&rdquo;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="JanOSullivan" hpid="Ms O'Sullivan Ms O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Sullivan:</NameTxt>
      <P>That is because they had not seen the contents of the Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T. O'Malley:</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;gave way seven weeks later to a vocal campaign against the Bill. The Bill enjoyed priority status during 2002 and will continue to do so in 2003. The Government recognised the need to engage in further consultations on the Bill following from a vocal campaign opposing this legislation. That is why a decision was taken to initiate the wide-ranging consultation process which is currently ongoing.</P>
      <P>In April 2002, my colleague, the then Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy O'Donoghue, appointed the five members of the consultation team. These included an Assistant Secretary General from the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, a person with a disability, and experts in the social, economic and legal fields. The consultation team has been sitting since May 2002 and has met a number of key stakeholders, including the disability legislation consultation group, DLCG, the social partners, members of the community and voluntary pillar and officials from relevant Departments, including my own.</P>
      <P>The DLCG is a representative group of disability organisations brought together by the National Disability Authority to facilitate the process of dialogue within the sector and with the consultation team. While the timeframe for the consultation process has in large measure been dictated by the timeframe set by the DLCG and the consensus-building process within that group, I understand that the DLCG is expected to present its proposals for disability legislation to the expert consultation team in the near future. Officials from my Department will continue to liaise with their counterparts in the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform over the coming months to provide any assistance necessary in finalising proposals for the new Disability Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government remains committed to disability equality. An Agreed Programme for Government of June 2002 includes a clear commitment to the enactment of an amended Disability Bill in 2003. The post-Programme for Prosperity and Fairness agreement, which is currently under consideration by the social partners and <Col N="117" /> the community and voluntary pillar representatives, reasserts this commitment, promising publication of the Bill in the autumn and its enactment by the end of 2003.</P>
    <P>Deputy Rabbitte and others are being disingenuous when they refer to the &ldquo;long delayed&rdquo; Disability Bill.</P>

I wish them well and will support them in their endeavours.</P>
      <P>While it is recognised that there has been significant investment in disability services in recent years, the overall economic position in 2003 has had implications for all aspects of public investment.

      <P>I welcome the opportunity to <Col N="120" /> contribute to the debate. It is like Groundhog Day as we talk about the same old issues such as waiting lists for services for the disabled. I was amazed at the Minister of State's audacity when he stated he hoped to continue treating people with disabilities in the same way he has done this year.</P>

      <P>The only difference this year is the extent of the crisis was obvious in January. The Government, in theory, allocated &euro;13.3 million in additional funding to the handicapped sector but when that figure is broken down, at least half the money was needed to pay for last year's services. My health authority, the Eastern Regional Health Authority, was allocated &euro;4 million, of which &euro;2.7 million was needed to pay for last year's services. We began the year with less money than last year, which meant a cutback in services.</P>
      <P>Two weeks ago the parents of carers and the disabled were protesting outside the Mansion House. I agree with my colleague's comments regarding the Taoiseach who belittled himself when he reduced the parents' campaign to a numbers game. All that mattered to him was that there were more people inside than outside and once he was on the winning side it did not matter. It demonstrated how little grasp he had of the reason the parents were there and the effort they had to make to get there in the rain. He disgraced himself.</P>
      <P>The parents were protesting because of the cutbacks in services, which will mean that there will be no additional residential, day care or respite care places this year. Inevitably, parents of people with disabilities will die and residential places will still be required when carers give up. Some will get sick or die and not be able to continue caring. This means that those being cared for must be admitted to institutions or, if they are lucky, they will get a respite care place. That is what happening in every health board area. My colleague referred to a 102 year old woman living on the northside of Dublin who looked after her 70 year old son. She finally gave up the ghost and her son had to be admitted to an institution. These are real, live cases.</P>
      <P>What does the lack of provision mean for the families who thought they might be lucky this year and be allocated a residential place? They will not even have a respite place for a weekend. There were no places left at the end of January. What will the position be at the end of the year? This is the reason we are in the House year in, year out discussing a crisis in the provision of services for the disabled.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I refer to the lack of day care places. No additional places will be provided this year for children with disabilities who need educational <Col N="121" /> facilities. Last week 10,000 able bodied students were outside the gates of Leinster House complaining because third level fees may be reintroduced. Imagine what it would be like if they were told there would be no university or training places and to go home because they were on the scrapheap at 18 years of age. That would be a prison sentence for them and their parents for the rest of their lives. That is what the Minister of State is saying to people with disabilities. They are fair game to the Government which will say that to them but would not dare to do so to the students protesting outside last week. That is the reason a rights based Bill is needed for people with disabilities.</P>
    <P>Waiting lists do not describe the human misery that is the result of what the Minister of State defends as provision for the handicapped. We go away at weekends and go on our holidays. In some cases, we go on two or three holidays. Those who care for people with disabilities do not go on holidays. Year in, year out they face the same hard work and commitment. We abuse them because we know they will go on sacrificing and caring until they die. While we go away for weekends and holidays, they will change nappies, liquidise food, tend bed sores and cope with the most appalling behavioural difficulties, yet we betray them by not providing even the most basic facilities.</P>
    <P>We spoke today about Drumcar and its facilities. I used words I should not have used because they would imply that I was criticising those who are providing care in Drumcar, to which I referred as a &ldquo;dumping ground&rdquo;. What I meant was that it was being treated as a dumping ground and it was unfair to ask anybody to care for disabled people from all over the country without the necessary resources. I was wrong to do that.</P>
    <P>The stories emerging about our treatment of the disabled at the beginning of the 21st century are not a lot different and certainly not much better than they would have been at the beginning of the 20th century. Those stories would have shocked us even if they related to the era in which Charles Dickens lived. The problem is that we have become so inured to what is going on in the health service, and to the failure of that service, that we are no longer shocked. We think it is almost acceptable that a woman of 102 cannot even die in peace knowing that her son will be looked after. When that no longer shocks us and when we find it acceptable, we cannot call ourselves a civilised society.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State earlier indicated how much money is being spent on the disabled and the handicapped. He said that we had to have our priorities right and that our priority now must be the economy. He said that when the economy stabilised the disabled would be looked after. The Minister of State is wrong. He and I can wait for the economy come right. If we were in any way <Col N="122" /> civilised and if we had any conception of what we were doing to the disabled and families, they would be the very last people of whom we would request sacrifices.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State is correct, we must prioritise when times are hard. With between &euro;20 million or &euro;30 million, we can turn what is a catastrophe into just yet another crisis for the disabled. I ask the Minister of State to find the money and not allow another year or another week go by without finding that money somewhere in the health service. Surely that amount of money can be spared from the overall budget of &euro;8 billion.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Neville:</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to contribute to the debate and I congratulate the Labour Party and Deputy Moynihan-Cronin for bringing this motion before the House. The Minister of State spoke for more than 30 minutes and outlined the action taken by the previous Government. We want to know what this Government, which came into office last June, intends to do. This debate is not about history; it is about what will happen this year. It is about what will happen the 1,711 people living at home who require full-time residential care. We want to know what will happen the 861 people who require a day service. What proposals does the Minister of State have to deal with the 1,014 who require respite service? There is no money provided to do anything, but these people have real needs and they require services to be provided by the Government.</P>
      <P>When I asked the Minister of State about this matter tonight, he accepted that it was necessary to provide services but obviously that requires funds. The Government's priority is to get the economy on track and the Minister of State said it will provide the same amount of money, if not more, in the coming years when and if the economy comes on track. They did not say that to the unions during the negotiations held in recent months. They rightly negotiated their position and obtained benefits, however limited, and funding. The Minister of State is unable to provide any funding to the disabled.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I received a letter dated 7 February from the leader of the Minister of State's party, the Tánaiste, Deputy Harney, in which she stated that both parties in Government are strongly committed to supporting the health services. It said that &ldquo;Despite the difficult fiscal situation facing us in compiling spending Estimates for 2003, it was agreed nonetheless to provide for a very substantial increase of &euro;523 million in the allocation for health.&rdquo;  That is a further increase in allocation but not a penny to the disabled. She further said: &ldquo;It is up to the Minister for Health and Children, Mr. Micheál Martin, TD to decide how the increased allocation is to be applied within the area of his responsibility.&rdquo;  The Mini<Col N="123" /> ster decided not to give anything to those with disabilities.</P>
    <P>I have known the Minister of State for 20 years and I know he is a decent man. He has been hung out to dry, however, and he has not been given a bob. He has not been treated fairly by his senior Minister.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Neville:</NameTxt>
      <P>The people who are suffering are those with disabilities, who are in distress, and the parents who care for them. About 30 or 40 emergencies will arise each year when a parent is not able to continue caring, usually when they die.</P>
      <P>The Minister of State informed me that &euro;113 million will be given this year to help those with intellectual disabilities and autism, but he also said that sum is to pay for the services for last year. That has nothing to do with 2003 and it is no answer to give to somebody asking what will happen the 30 or 40 people who will become emergency cases this year. The Minister of State said that he is confident that problems could be resolved, but that the overall funding must be examined and that is the priority.</P>
      <P>If a parent dies and there is nobody to take care of a young child, a young adult or a middle-aged or elderly adult, the priority should be to take care of them and the funding should be available. In such circumstances the overall funding should not be the priority. There has been a reduction in funding this year. People who represent those with disabilities are extremely concerned that families will be asked to take their loved ones home because of a cut which will mean less people in the service. That is common sense.</P>
      <P>We spoke about the accommodation of those with intellectual disability in mental hospitals and the matter has also been raised on the Adjournment. For many years the Inspector of Mental Hospitals has been saying that those with intellectual disability should not be in psychiatric hospitals. It is unfair on people with intellectual disability to be in psychiatric hospitals and it is unfair to those suffering from psychiatric illness to be in those circumstances. The Minister of State should not boast about there being only 452 people in psychiatric hospitals because there should not be anyone in such hospitals.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wish to pay a special tribute to the staff in the service. The Minister of State has been involved in the provision of health care; he is aware of the problems and knows that what I am saying is true. I ask him to obtain the &euro;35 million funding. I accept that it is glib to say so, but a jet for the Government costs &euro;100 million. A sum of &euro;35 million is required to overcome the difficulties in <Col N="124" /> the area under discussion. We are not talking about the &euro;93 million surplus that magically arrived at the close of the last financial year. I implore the Deputies on the other side of the House to vote for the allocation of &euro;35 million to solve the problem.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisNaughten" hpid="Mr. Naughten Mr. Naughten">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Naughten:</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to debate this issue tonight and commend Deputy Moynihan-Cronin for raising it. The Minister of State said that the Government will be judged on its record. How will the Minister of State be judged at the end of this year, the European Year of People with Disabilities and the year that the Special Olympics come to Ireland, the first time they have been held outside the United States? Will he be able to hold his head up at the end of the year in regard to the services he has provided in 2003?</P>
      <P>There are more than 3,500 people waiting for residential, respite and day care places and not one place has been provided for in this year's budget although the Department of Health and Children has received a massive increase in investment this year. The Minister of State has lost out in regard to the dividing of that funding. We want a paltry &euro;35 million. For the past five years we have heard <i>ad nauseam</i> from the Government about the boom and the Celtic tiger, yet at the same time parents were crying out for services for people with disabilities. The resources required have not been provided.</P>
      <P>People with disabilities who have been dumped in psychiatric hospitals have been ignored by the Government. When we had a booming economy they were ignored and were inappropriately placed in psychiatric hospitals. Every year the Inspector of Mental Hospitals has maintained that not one of them should be retained in a psychiatric hospital. This is the greatest single abuse of human rights in the developed world and it will come home to roost. The Minister of State talked about going around visiting facilities. I ask him to visit them and to try to defend what he has stated in the House tonight. He cannot defend it.</P>
      <P>Over the past couple of years the Minister for Finance increased the budget for respite grants. There is not much point in providing the money for respite grants if there are no places available for the provision of respite. There will be no additional place this year for the provision of respite. Parents who were given a commitment by service providers that they would get respite this year have now been told that there is no provision available. Many of these people have been on waiting lists for years just to get a short weekend break every now and again, yet the resources have not been provided and the funding is not there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister of State spoke about the disability database. Every September children who have left the education system at 18 years of age are abandoned because the intellectual disability database is not there. The health boards are left to pick up the pieces without resources. The ser<Col N="125" /> vice providers cannot pick up the pieces because they do not have the facilities. Every September Members are contacted by people because there is no provision for a place for their sons or daughters. The same will happen again this September, and the Minister of State's answer is to blame economic circumstances.</P>
    <P>The overall economic position in 2003 has implications for all aspects of public investment, including the disability service. Why have disability services been cut back? The reason is they are the soft option. They are the voiceless element of our society and can be ignored so that the Government can go on and invest in other places.</P>
    <P>Where has the money gone? The Government says that it had money in the bank at the end of the year and is investing that money in buying a Government jet. We are looking for &euro;35 million to put into intellectual disability services. We have a national pension reserve fund into which the Minister for Finance put a large amount of money at the end of the year to support employment in the EU, the US and Japan. Why could some of that not have been used through public private partnership to invest in the disability sector? The sector is being ignored because of a lack of ingenuity on the part of the Government. If it does not have money to put into capital investment in the sector it should use the national pension reserve fund.</P>
    <P>The only response the Government has given in regard to elderly parents living in fear of what will happen to their sons or daughters if they die is that there is no space in the inn.</P>

      <P>This is a matter of the utmost urgency for the most vulnerable children in our society &ndash; I will not say the most vulnerable children in our education system because these children are not in our education system. They are not going to school.</P>
      <P>Hundreds of children as young as 12 are roaming the streets all day every day and no one is authorised to intervene. It has been estimated that 3,400 children drop out of school before junior certificate each year. Many of these children will grow up without basic literacy and numeracy skills and with no respect for law or society. These children are in a legal vacuum at present.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Until the Education (Welfare) Act became law, school attendance was the responsibility of school attendance officers, mainly in Dublin and Cork cities, and of the Garda Síochána in other parts of the country. The Education (Welfare) Act transferred this responsibility to the National Educational Welfare Board which was established last year. That board expected to receive a <Col N="126" /> budget of &euro;13 million for 2002 to 2003 which would allow it to appoint 110 welfare officers and ten support staff, to be extended year by year to cover the whole country. The initial phase would involve the transfer of existing school attendance officers to become education welfare officers. The actual allocation is only &euro;3.2 million. Basically, the board has been given statutory responsibility but has not been given the funds to carry out this responsibility.</P>
    <P>This is the background to the impasse between the board and the union representing school attendance officers. There is an urgent need for the Minister of State to take a hands-on approach to ensure that this impasse is broken. As it stands, the officers have no statutory powers so while the dispute goes on children roam the streets with impunity. Cases taken to the Children's Court have had to be struck out. This situation cannot be allowed to continue. Huge problems are being stored up for the future. Many of us have heard some of these children being interviewed. We are talking about children as young as 11 or 12 who are not concerned that they are not at school and are happy to roam the streets. Nobody has the power to intervene.</P>
    <P>The Fianna Fáil-Progressive Democrats programme for Government states:</P>
    <P>We will ensure that reducing absenteeism and early-school leaving is a core priority over the next five years. The National Educational Welfare Board will begin its work this year and will, in the first instance, prioritise areas with high levels of disadvantage, especially areas contained within the RAPID programme.</P>
    <P>Will the Minister of State honestly tell me what level of service can areas with high levels of disadvantage hope for this year or next year? I am sorry the Minister for Education and Science is not here. The Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children, Deputy Callely, is here and he is aware from his constituency, as I am from mine, of the number of children not attending school on a regular basis.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister of State at the Department of the Environment and Local Government, Mr. Gallagher, who will respond, to spare us the talk about disadvantage and to do something practical about this issue. I hope the Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Dempsey, will do something practical about this because we have heard a great deal of talk about disadvantage from him.</P>
    <P>I have correspondence from educationalists in my constituency that states that children as young as four and five are chronic non-attenders at school. The report Empty Desks: Positive Approaches to Maximising Attendance in Primary Schools states in regard to absenteeism in a section of my constituency that &ldquo;45% of the children miss a minimum of 10% of their primary schooling.&rdquo; Surely, if that is the case, welfare officers need to be appointed.</P>
    <P>This particular area is a RAPID area. The pro<Col N="127" /> gramme for Government and replies to parliamentary questions have indicated that RAPID will be prioritised. With the funding allocated and the problem encountered by the board, when can children in these areas, and subsequently children in other parts of the country, have this essential service? </P>
    <P>I urge the Minister for Education and Science to get off the fence on this issue. He should provide adequate funding to the National Educational Welfare Board and ensure that he breaks the impasse that has left children wandering the streets of our cities while no one has the authority to intervene. Something needs to be done urgently on this issue which has been ongoing for months. Funding is a big part of the problem. It is not acceptable that children who should be at school are not attending.</P>

      <P>Ba mhaith liom mo bhuíochas a chur in iúl don Teachta O'Sullivan as ucht na ceiste seo a ardú ar an Athló. Gabhaim leithscéal thar ceann an Aire Oideachais agus Eolaíochta os rud é nach bhfuil sé ar a chumas bheith i láthair anocht.</P>
      <P>I wish to thank Deputy O'Sullivan for allowing me the opportunity to outline the position on behalf of the Minister for Education and Science. All provisions of the Education (Welfare) Act 2000 came into force on 5 July last. This Act repeals the previous school attendance legislation and provides for a new infrastructure to encourage and support regular school attendance. Under the Act, the National Educational Welfare Board has been established as the single national body with responsibility for school attendance matters.</P>
      <P>School attendance officers, and related senior grades, who were employed by local authorities under the previous legislation, became staff of the board on the 5 July as provided for in the Act. There are 36 such officers in all. Prior to the transfer date there were detailed discussions with the IMPACT union representing these staff in relation to the employment of these officers as educational welfare officers in the new service but agreement was not reached. These staff currently retain the same terms and conditions of employment and are expected to carry out the same duties as heretofore in so far as these are not inconsistent with the new legislation, pending completion of the negotiations. The board met staff in early September 2002 to discuss the transition and written guidance was issued to each staff member in response to a request from the staff in this regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is the wish of the board that these staff are appointed educational welfare officers. In this regard, negotiations between the board, the IMPACT union which represents the staff con<Col N="128" /> cerned and the Department of Education and Science have been under way for some time and have included use of the services of the Labour Relations Commission.</P>
    <P>As the Minister for Education and Science has indicated, the negotiations in relation to this matter are ongoing. The welfare board and the Department of Education and Science are anxious that these negotiations conclude successfully in order that this educational welfare service is expanded nationally on a phased basis.</P>
    <P>It is also important to point out that the educational welfare service is only one part of the Government's policy to tackle disadvantage in society. The Department of Education and Science also has other initiatives, such as the school completion programme, which complements the work of the educational welfare board in dealing with young people at risk of early school leaving. This school completion programme has built on best practice established in pilot schemes such as the stay in school retention initiative and the eight to 15 year old, early school leaver initiative in supporting the retention of young people in school. The work of this and other programmes are therefore ongoing in the area of early school leaving.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, the Minister for Education and Science would like to assure the Deputy that the Department of Education and Science will co-operate fully, with the National Educational Welfare Board to try to ensure the completion of the current negotiations with the staff in order to facilitate the expansion of this national service.</P>

      <P>A report in <i>The Irish Times</i> of Saturday last indicated that the expert group on the future of radiotherapy services will recommend that the service be provided only in Dublin, Cork and Galway. This leak, like all others, had an objective. One could speculate that it came from Government sources to test the water in regard to public reaction in the south-eastern, western and mid-western regions. The report quotes a spokeswoman for the Minister as saying that the Minister had yet to receive the report. It should be noted that she did not say that he did not know what was contained in the report. She further stated that the Minister expected the report within weeks. The article stated that it is expected that the Minister will act on the recommendations of his expert group.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There can be no doubt that the submission of the expert group report to the Minister has been deliberately stalled. Equally, it is valid to speculate that the completion of the expert group report could be influenced by the intensity of the <Col N="129" /> public reaction to the leak. I call on the Minister for Health and Children to immediately instruct that the completed report of the expert group be submitted to him and that he publish it. Whatever the recommendations, it is imperative that the stalling exercise comes to an end and that the people of Waterford and the south-east region know where they stand. Anger and frustration are caused where there is prolonged stalling of publication and people know they are being treated like idiots.</P>
    <P>When I last raised this issue on the Adjournment, I pointed out that due to a lack of radiotherapy facilities at Waterford Regional Hospital some breast cancer patients were opting for mastectomies because they could not get access to such treatment in Waterford. Cancer specialists from both the south-east and mid-west regions have stated that this is the case. It is absolutely unacceptable that in any civilised society women should opt for mastectomies rather than spending long periods away from home. This is only one group among the 50% of cancer patients who require radiotherapy.</P>
    <P>Radiotherapy treatment is usually administered for short daily periods over a number of weeks. Treatment can be accessed by travel to and from a centre if it is situated near at hand. If there is a considerable distance involved, patients either have long daily journeys or have to stay near the centre. The latter is cruel and inhumane at a time when patients are at their most vulnerable and need their families and friend around them.</P>
    <P>Whatever the recommendations of the expert group report, there is a fundamental need for a regional cancer treatment centre in the south-east. Waterford Regional Hospital provides chemotherapy as well as surgery in the treatment of cancer. Without radiotherapy the treatment options are reduced. Some 75% of cancer patients should receive radiotherapy, but in the south-east only 48% receive it. The expert group report must be published. If it recommends a radiotherapy unit for Waterford Regional Hospital, then our work to press the Government for early delivery will begin. If it does not, then the campaign must employ other ways of reaching an early successful conclusion. Either way, the stalling of the publication of the report of the expert group on the future of radiotherapy services is acting as a road block to progress.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="130" /> As the Deputy is aware, the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Martin, established the expert review group on radiotherapy services to examine the appropriate future development of radiotherapy services. The group comprises a multidisciplinary team of experts in radiation oncology, surgical oncology, nursing, epidemiology and palliative care. The group has conducted a national assessment of needs for radiotherapy services having regard to the demography and epidemiology of cancer and the gaps in current service provision.</P>
    <P>The group's report will address the following key issues: access to radiotherapy services, in terms of information, financial access and organisational components of access; the need to provide a high quality, evidence-based service; the need to take account of current and new developments in health technology; the requirements of the system in terms of human resources; international norms in relation to service provision, planning and staffing; and the organisational development of the services in terms of structures and processes which need to be place in a radiotherapy facility. I understand that the work of the expert review group on radiotherapy services is nearing completion and will be submitted to the Minister for Health and Children shortly.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Murphy:</NameTxt>
      <P>Tens of thousands of acres of land are going to be put beyond agricultural use by the introduction of special protection areas for the hen harrier. Despite the fact that Dúchas flagged this last May issuing indigenous maps of the potential areas, and that it will issue a final map by the end of March, the Minister for Agriculture and Food, in replying to a parliamentary question on 4 February, said the proposals are at a preliminary stage and that the usual consultation process, in which his Department will be included, will take place in due course. In a letter of the same day it was made clear that Deputy Ó Cuív, the Minister with responsibility for rural affairs, has no responsibility for the impact this designation is going to have on family farms and rural life.</P>
      <P>For the Minister's information, Dúchas guidelines are already being operated. To quote from a Dúchas letter dated 14 May: &ldquo;Any wind farm development in afforested areas of uplands would be liable to impact the hen harrier.&rdquo;  Dúchas is advising the forestry service of the risks of allowing the planting of open moor and bogland in these areas.</P>
      <P>Planning departments are already using these restrictions to restrict the development of wind farms, forestry and housing. These restrictions are being implemented despite the fact that the Minister for the Environment and Local Government, in a parliamentary reply on 4 February, admitted that studies are ongoing into the effect of wind farm development on hen harriers.</P>
      <P>There are no known consequences for hen harriers from wind farms at this stage. Hen harriers hunt below the minimum height of turbine rotary blades and, therefore, the potential for impact is considered negligible.</P>
      <P>I call on the Minister to instruct Dúchas to withdraw its guidelines to the forestry service and to the planning departments until it publishes the results of its studies. These studies, when completed, must be transparent. If farmers are going to be deprived of income or if their holdings are going to be substantially devalued as a result of designation, they are entitled to know why. The process that leads to designation needs to be examined. All that happens now is that Dúchas writes to the landowner stating that his or her holding is going to be included in an SPA and that the landowner can only appeal this decision on scientific grounds. We are dealing with some of the smallest and least well-off farmers who do not have the resources to make an appeal based on scientific grounds.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This brings us to the area of compensation. The Minister for the Environment and Local Government stated in reply to a parliamentary question, that his Department is not aware of any evidence of these designations having a dramatic impact on land values. Is the Minister seriously contending that 50 acres of land with ten wind turbines or 50 <Col N="132" /> acres of forestry is the same value as 50 acres of scrub or bog? The Minister goes on to say: &ldquo;The designation of SPAs does not, in itself, give rise to any entitlement to compensation. Compensation is payable when actual financial losses occur.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Designation limits the land's development potential for the future, not just now. If designated, the likelihood is that a farmer will be unable to put wind farms or forests on the land or plough and re-seed it in years to come. There is no question but that the Minister is wrong and that the question of compensation for potential earnings is valid. The Minister is less sure of his ground when he says: &ldquo;Planning permissions may be refused because of designations without normally giving rise to planning compensation.&rdquo;  The word &ldquo;normally&rdquo; needs to be clarified.</P>
    <P>Everyone recognises that agriculture is in crisis. People are fleeing the land. Alternative farm enterprises like wind farms and forestry are giving hope and a lifeline to many marginalised family farms. We know and accept that under European law SPAs must be created to protect wildlife. However, by being sensible about this and its implementation and by preventing blanket designation it may be possible, if the Minister instructs the various civil servants to take a practical approach, for rural families and wildlife to coexist in rural areas.  </P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoynihan" hpid="Mr. M. Moynihan Mr. M. Moynihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Moynihan:</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to ask the Minister for the Environment and Local Government about the proposals by Dúchas to designate special protection areas for the hen harrier in north-west Cork, the details of the original proposal, the research to date, the exact area proposed, the effect and restrictions this will place on the land and the plans, if any, to compensate landowners.</P>
      <P>Special protection areas come under various EU directives. Not all EU directives benefit people living in rural Ireland and some are to their detriment. What are the effects of this proposal? What are the financial implications for farmers? Will compensation be paid? What restrictions will apply to agricultural land? What restrictions will apply to the siting of wind farms in the designated areas and what is the position regarding afforestation?</P>
      <P>Various stories are circulating in the parts of the country where these investigations are being carried out by Dúchas. People are hearing rumours and they are concerned. For a long time people have feared that bodies such as Dúchas will come to their rural communities, designate the area and walk away, leaving the people to pick up the pieces. Many of these fears are well founded and are based on the experience of many years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="133" /> Much of the disadvantaged land which is being examined by Dúchas in its campaign to preserve the hen harrier is land where wind farms could be sited effectively. Under the Kyoto agreement the State has an obligation to reduce emissions and wind farms are part of our effort to produce clean and efficient energy in the future. How can we sit with these proposals if we are to take away the very areas of the country best suited to wind farms?</P>
    <P>Many people in my own constituency have been looking at wind farms as alternative sources of income as their income from agriculture declines. If various parts of Cork North-West or any other part of the country are to be designated by Dúchas as special protection areas to ensure the survival of the hen harrier, what about the survival of landowners, small farmers and those who have lived in these areas for so long? While I accept that some of the EU directive will be implemented, what detrimental effect will it have on the areas preserved? I hope the Minister of State will lay before the House the entire facts of the situation and that we can move forward.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatTheCope" hpid="Mr. Gallagher Mr. Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gallagher:</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputies Murphy and Moynihan for giving me the opportunity to outline the position on the designation of special protection areas. Article 4 of the European Directive on the Conservation of Wild Birds, 79/409/EEC, requires member states, including Ireland, to designate special protection areas for wild birds. Under the directive, the selection of sites for designation is based on scientific criteria.</P>
      <P>The Department's heritage service is currently considering the suitability of nine upland areas for designation as special protection areas in respect of the hen harrier, one of the species for which SPAs are to be designated under the directive. The hen harrier is one of our four rarest birds of prey. The breeding population is largely concentrated in the south-west as outlined by the Deputies. About half the population of harriers has been lost in the past 30 years.</P>
      <P>The nine areas being examined include five wholly or partly in County Cork: Ballyhouras, Counties Cork and Limerick; Nagles, County Cork; Kilworth, County Cork; Boggerag-Derrynasaggart, County Cork; and Stack's-Mullaghareirks, Counties Kerry, Cork and Limerick.</P>
      <P>Preparatory scientific work to confirm the suitability of all nine sites and define their boundaries is currently under way and none of the areas being considered has been formally proposed for designation. When the preparatory scientific work is complete, decisions will be taken as to what sites should be formally proposed for designation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If any sites are formally proposed as SPAs, my Department will follow full notification and con<Col N="134" /> sultation procedures, as was undertaken in relation to other SPA proposals in November 2002 when my Department published proposals to designate the Shannon Callows as an SPA and in March 2002 when proposals to designate 34 new SPAs or extensions to existing sites were published.</P>
    <P>The consultation procedures operated by my Department's heritage service involves notification in writing of all known affected landowners in the areas proposed for designation. In addition and against the possibility that ownership of all land holdings cannot be ascertained by my Department, advertisements are placed in local newspapers and on local radio notifying interested parties of the intention to designate these areas. Notices are also displayed in Garda stations, local authority offices, local offices of the Department of Social and Family Affairs, local offices of the Department of Agriculture and Food and local Teagasc offices. The consultation procedures also encompass notification of relevant local authorities, Departments and other interested bodies.</P>
    <P>A period of three months is allowed for making objections. Where my Department does not propose, following initial assessment, to recommend the amendment of an SPA envisaged in an objection, the appeals advisory board is available to assist in the assessment of objections by carrying out a further review of cases referred to it and making an independent recommendation to the Government. The board comprises balanced representation from landowner-user organisations and conservation bodies under an independent chairperson. Special protection areas also attract higher levels of payment to farmers who join the rural environment protection scheme, which is administered by the Department of Agriculture and Food.</P>
    <P>In general, existing farming activities are likely to be fully compatible with the conservation requirements of hen harriers and other bird species for which SPAs are designated. In these circumstances there will be no need to place restrictions on traditional farming activity. I reaffirm, however, that I am committed to paying fair and reasonable compensation to landowners for any actual loss shown to have been incurred as a result of restrictions that may be imposed on existing activities consequent on designation of their lands.</P>
    <P>In relation to the planning process, planning authorities are required to provide in their development plans for the appropriate protection of natural conservation areas, including SPAs. In particular, they must consider whether a development is likely to have a significant effect on an SPA and, if so, to require an environmental impact assessment to be carried out. Where a significant effect on the natural environment is not envisaged, the planning application may be pro<Col N="135" /> cessed without the requirement of an environmental impact assessment.</P>
    <P>My Department is at present revising its planning guidelines for wind farms which were published in 1996 and has invited public input into this process. I consider that this process should <Col N="136" /> permit us to refine policy guidance in relation to the co-existence of wind farming and bird life, and we will welcome views on this.</P>

      <askee>Minister for Health and Children</askee>
      <Quest>if he is satisfied that the general public have adequate and unimpeded access to the health services; if he proposes to address the issue; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin):</NameTxt>
      <P>Entitlement to health services in Ireland is primarily based on residency and means rather than income. Any person, regardless of nationality, who is accepted by the health boards as being ordinarily resident in Ireland is entitled to either full eligibility, category 1, or limited eligibility, category 2, for health services.</P>
      <P>Persons in category 1 are medical card holders and they are entitled to a full range of services including general practitioner services, prescribed drugs and medicines, all in-patient public hospital services in public wards including consultant services, all out-patient public hospital services including consultant services, dental, ophthalmic, aural services, appliances and a maternity and infant care service.</P>
      <P>Persons in category 2, non-medical card holders, are entitled, subject to certain charges, to all in-patient public hospital services in public wards including consultant services and outpatient public hospital services including consultant services. The current public hospital statutory inpatient charge is &euro;40 per night, up to a maximum of &euro;400 in any 12 consecutive month period. Attendance at accident and emergency departments is subject to a charge of &euro;40 where the patient does not have a referral note from his-her doctor. This charge applies only to the first visit in any episode of care. A maternity and infant care service is provided during pregnancy and up to six weeks after birth.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In July 2001 the medical card was extended to everybody over the age of 70. The extension of medical cards to the over 70s is wholly consistent with Government policy aimed at improving the position of the elderly. I should also mention that for those who do not qualify for a medical card, there are a number of schemes which provide assistance towards the cost of medication. Under the long-term illness scheme, persons suffering from a number of conditions can obtain without charge the drugs and medicines for the treatment of that condition. Under the drug payment scheme, a person and his-her dependants do not <Col N="138" /> have to pay more than &euro;70 in any calendar month for approved prescribed drugs, medicines and appliances.</P>
    <P>Under the Health Act 1970, the determination of eligibility for health services is the responsibility of the chief executive officer of the appropriate health board and neither I nor my Department have a function in the matter. I would like to add that health boards have discretion, in cases of exceptional need, to provide assistance to individuals where undue hardship would otherwise be caused. The Deputy may wish to note that the existing arrangements for eligibility for health services will be simplified, clarified and expanded.</P>
    <P>Recommendations from the review of the medical card scheme carried out by the health board chief executive officers under the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness are being implemented including streamlining applications and improving the standardisation of the medical card applications process to ensure better fairness and transparency; providing clearer information to people about how and where to apply for medical cards; and proactively seeking out those who should have medical cards to ensure they have access to the services that are available.</P>
    <P>In 2001, I launched the national health strategy which is a comprehensive strategic plan for the health system for this decade. One of the key concerns of the health strategy is to promote fair access to services, based on objectively assessed need. In line with this objective my Department is drawing up legislative proposals to provide a clear statutory framework in relation to eligibility for health and personal social services.</P>
    <P>The strategy recognises that both public and private patients have an entitlement to access needed care within a reasonable period of time. The challenge is to ensure that a fair balance is achieved and that those who depend on the public system are not disadvantaged. Significant measures are being taken to improve equity of access for those in need of health care. Funding of &euro;43.8 million has been made available for the waiting list initiative over the last three years and again for 2003. The number of adults waiting more than 12 months for admission to hospital as in-patients fell by 15% between June 2002 and September 2002. The number of children waiting more than six months for admission to hospital as in-patients fell by 24% between June 2002 and September 2002. Clearly the prioritisation of those waiting longest is beginning to yield results.</P>
    <P>The national treatment purchase fund was established in April 2002 with an allocation of &euro;10 million for acute hospital treatment and &euro;5 million for orthodontic treatment. The fund is used to purchase treatment for public patients from private hospitals in Ireland or from international providers where it is not possible to provide treatment within a reasonable period in Ireland. More than 1,900 patients were treated in 2002. In 2003, the throughput has been estimated at 7,200.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="139" /> A total of 968,000 &ndash; provisional figures &ndash; patients were treated last year as either in-patients or day patients in acute hospitals. This is an increase of 5% over the 2001 figure. The Deputy may wish to note that since 1997 the number of patients treated in our acute hospitals has increased by approximately 23%. An additional &euro;65 million was provided in 2002 to begin the first phase in the provision of 3,000 additional acute beds by 2011 and 520 beds were funded to the end of 2002, that is 70 in excess of the strategy target of 450.</P>
    <P>We are all aware that poverty can make it more difficult to access or afford appropriate health care and tackling health inequalities is inextricably linked with tackling poverty issues. One of the objectives of the strategy is to reduce health inequalities and work is progressing in this regard. The homelessness preventative strategy was launched in 2002 and implementation of that strategy along with Homelessness &ndash; An Integrated Strategy 2000 and the Youth Homelessness Strategy 2001 is ongoing. Enhanced services for asylum seekers and prisoners were also provided in 2002. Funding of &euro;1.9 million was allocated for the implementation of the Travellers health strategy and implementation of the national drugs strategy 2001-08 is ongoing. In devising the actions to tackle health inequalities for the health strategy, the Department worked closely with the group working to review the targets for health for the national anti-poverty strategy.</P>
    <P>I remind the Deputy that an additional allocation of &euro;694 million has been made available for the health service in 2003 bringing the total spend for this year to &euro;8.9 billion. This represents 74% of the net total increase in public expenditure in the Estimates and demonstrates the Government's determination to continue to prioritise health.</P>

      <P>The operation of the primary childhood immunisation programme is a matter in the first instance for the individual health boards which enter into contracts with general practitioners for the delivery of the service. Information received from health boards indicate that they have experienced difficulties in establishing the current position in relation to the number of children revaccinated, following the administration of oral polio vaccine, OPV, after the expiry date, as not all GPs have provided the required information.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My Department has written to the health board chief executive officers in relation to this matter <Col N="140" /> on numerous occasions since this issue arose and has requested that any discrepancy between the number of children in their health board area where records indicate they received OPV more than one month after the expiry date and the number of children who were subsequently revaccinated be comprehensively explained.</P>
    <P>As indicated in my letter of 22 January 2003 to the Deputy, health boards have indicated that the apparently high number of children yet to be revaccinated may not in fact be as high as current records show for the following reasons: GPs may have revaccinated children but have not advised the health boards; GPs may on rechecking their records have established that vaccine was not in fact administered after the expiry date but may have failed to advise the relevant health board; parents may have decided not to have their children revaccinated; some children may have moved from the region; GPs may have decided against revaccination; and GPs may not have advised parents that vaccine was given more than one month after the expiry date and that revaccination is recommended.</P>
    <P>The health boards have assured my Department that they have contacted all relevant GPs and advised them of the recommendation to revaccinate. However, they have advised that in all instances the clinical responsibility for these patients rests with the GPs in question.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>During 2002, my Department issued 288 sanctions for new works on capital projects under the <Col N="141" /> national development plan. These related to health capital projects, excluding ICT, across all health boards and all care programmes. The sanctions ranged from individual major new projects, or stages of same, to approval in each health board of funding for minor capital items such as replacement equipment or health and safety works. The sanctions in 2002 were in addition to a wide range of capital developments sanctioned in previous years by my Department and which were still under way or being completed in the course of last year.</P>
    <P>The total amount of expenditure reimbursed by my Department to health agencies under the health capital programme of the national development plan in 2002 was &euro;507.115 million. This included expenditure relating to new works sanctioned last year, and to projects approved in previous years and continuing in 2002. I am pleased with the progress which has been made since the launch of the NDP in 2000. On completion of the projects under way, significant progress will have been made in addressing the major historic deficiencies which have existed in health infrastructure. I am also keenly aware of the need to continue progress and investment in this area across all care programmes to ensure an equitable and efficient health service for all.</P>

      <P>Health boards are responsible for the provision of general practitioner services to medical card holders under the general medical services scheme. The current arrangement in respect of the part of south west Donegal mentioned by the Deputy is that there are four GPs currently providing services to persons with GMS entitlements in the area with a one in four out of hours rota operating. This is consistent with the level of service provided elsewhere in County Donegal where the GP out of hours co-operative is not in operation. The provision of general practitioner services to non-medical card holders is a private arrangement between the patient and the individual GP concerned. In September 2001, a general practice out of hours co-operative, NoWDOC, was established from three locations in north and west Donegal by the North-Western Health Board with funding from my Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A comprehensive review of this service, which covers a population of 97,000, was undertaken by the board in 2002. Additional funding of &euro;436,000 was provided to the board this year in respect of primary care out of hours developments. This <Col N="142" /> funding will be utilised by the North-Western Health Board to support the implementation of the recommendations of the review and the expansion of the service to the south-west Donegal area. I have been informed by the board that this proposed expansion will further enhance GP out of hours-weekend services through the provision of nurse triage services, dedicated drivers and equipment in support of local general practitioners who will primarily deliver the service.</P>

      <P>The overall economic position in 2003 has had implications for all aspects of public investment, and this is reflected in the Estimates and budget adopted by the Government for 2003.

This funding is being applied largely to maintaining existing levels of service across all service programmes including services for people with an intellectual disability.</P>
      <P>Between 1997 and 2002, an extra &euro;188 million revenue and &euro;139 million capital funding was provided, making a total additional investment of &euro;327 million for the maintenance and development of services to persons with an intellectual disability and those with autism. In the current year, further additional funding of &euro;13.3 million has been allocated to services for persons with an intellectual disability or autism to meet the full year cost of the 2002 developments and to further enhance the health related support services to children with an intellectual disability or autism. This funding brings the total extra investment in these services to &euro;340 million over seven years. Of this total amount, more than &euro;200 million has been built into the ongoing budget base. This funding has brought about very significant and unprecedented developments in the services.</P>
      <P>Between 1997 and 2002, approximately 1,700 extra residential places were provided, with most of these based in the community. This figure includes new residential respite places, which were developed in 1997 and 1998. Between 1999 and 2002, approximately 465 dedicated respite places were also provided. In addition, the period, 1997-2002, saw the provision of approximately 2,950 new day places.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Despite this significant investment, demographic factors are contributing to growing waiting lists for residential services in particular, even though the number of people in receipt of ser<Col N="143" /> vices, including full time residential services, continues to increase. The increased birth rate in the 1960s and 1970s has resulted in large numbers of adults in their late 20s and early 30s requiring full-time residential services. In addition, people with an intellectual disability are living longer than previously, adding to the need for services compared to previous generations. This has also been the international experience in service provision to this population. While it is regrettable that the level of investment in these services achieved in recent years could not be maintained in 2003, my Department will work closely with the health boards and other service providers in relation to service provision this year.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin):</NameTxt>
      <P>The social services inspectorate was established in April 1999, initially on an administrative basis but, in the longer term, it is proposed to establish it on a statutory basis. The main function of the inspectorate is to support the child care services by promoting and ensuring the development of quality standards. The SSI will monitor all personal social services operated by the health boards but, initially, it is concentrating on the child care area and in particular on the inspection of health board operated residential child care facilities.</P>
      <P>The health strategy, Quality and Fairness, has set 2003 as the target date for the establishment of the SSI on a statutory basis. It also states that the remit of the SSI will be extended to cover residential care for older people and people with disabilities. Establishing the SSI on a statutory basis will strengthen its role and will provide it with the necessary underpinning of independence in the performance of its functions. It will also serve to increase public confidence in state and voluntary social services. Work on the drafting of a statutory instrument to enable the SSI to be established on a statutory footing is under way. The extension of the remit of SSI will be undertaken as resources allow.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are no plans to extend the functions of the SSI to cover the inspection of mental health institutions. All mental health hospitals and services are inspected annually by the Inspector of Mental Hospitals under the provisions of sections 247 and 248 of the Mental Treatment Act 1945. When the provisions of the Mental Health Act 2001, are fully operational, this function will fall to the Inspector of Mental Health Services who, under the provisions of section 51 of that Act, will be required to review all mental health services <Col N="144" /> in the State each year and to furnish an annual report in writing to the Commission on Mental Health to be published along with the commission's annual report.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin):</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 108, 132, 149, 150, 164, 182, 360, 429, 430 and 431 together.</P>
      <P>I am aware that the hospital system in general is experiencing increased pressure on available beds due to a number of factors, including the growth in population, the availability of in-patient beds and the increasing number of elderly people who have a higher than average length of stay. The pressure on the hospital system, and in particular on hospitals providing accident and emergency services, is more severe over the winter months.</P>
      <P>The Government has taken a number of measures designed to enhance accident and emergency services. A &euro;41 million investment package was provided in the winter of 2000-01 aimed at alleviating service pressures and maintaining services to patients, particularly in the acute hospital sector. This investment package provided, <i>inter alia,</i> for the recruitment of an additional 29 accident and emergency consultants. Seventeen of these posts have been filled and the recruitment process is continuing in respect of the remaining posts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Funding has also been provided in recent years to the ERHA and the health boards to support a further range of initiatives aimed at improving services in accident and emergency departments of acute hospitals. These include &euro;6.59 million towards the development of accident and emergency facilities at St. James's Hospital; development of accident and emergency department at the Mater Hospital; development of new accident and emergency department at St. Vincent's Hospital, Elm Park; development of new accident and emergency department at the Children's Hospital, Temple Street; planning of a new accident and emergency department for Cork University Hospital; development of accident and emergency department at Galway University Hospital; development of accident and emergency department at Castlebar General Hospital; development of accident and emergency department at Tullamore General Hospital; appointment of a design team for the development of a new accident and emergency department at Roscommon County Hospital; upgrading of accident and emergency facilities at Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital, Drogheda and Our Lady's Hospital, <Col N="146" /> Navan; extension to the accident and emergency department at St. Columcille's Hospital; development of pilot services for deep venous thrombosis in Beaumont Hospital; provision of a chest pain service at St. James's Hospital; the recruitment of discharge planners and patient liaison personnel at accident and emergency sites in the eastern region; and the provision of minor injuries units in Beaumont, Mater, James Connolly Memorial, St. James's and Tallaght Hospitals.</P>
    <P>Other initiatives which are designed to improve the operation of accident and emergency departments are outlined in the national health strategy, Quality and Fairness &ndash; A Health System for You. These include the establishment of further minor injury units to ensure appropriate treatment and management of non-urgent cases; the use of chest pain clinics, respiratory clinics and in-house specialist teams to fast-track patients as appropriate; the re-organisation of diagnostic services to ensure increased access to, and availability of, services at busy times in accident and emergency departments; the appointment of advanced nurse practitioners, ANPs, emergency, in acute hospitals; the use of admission protocols to ensure that emergency patients will be the only group of patients admitted to hospital through accident and emergency departments; the appointment of additional personnel to liaise with patients while they await diagnosis and treatment at accident and emergency departments; the introduction of information systems that record comprehensive, comparable and reliable data on activity in accident and emergency departments.</P>
    <P>Such information will provide staff with a valuable tool in structuring services to meet the needs of patients. In addition, at my request, Comhairle na nOspidéal has undertaken a detailed review of the structures, operation and staffing of accident and emergency departments. The report entitled, Report of the Committee on Accident &amp; Emergency Services, not only deals with the staffing of accident and emergency departments at consultant level but also links reform of accident and emergency departments with the need to look critically at hospital processes and patient flows through the hospitals. The report provides valuable advice on the structure of our emergency services and the necessary linkages which will be required to eliminate delays in emergency departments.</P>
    <P>Last year I established an accident and emergency forum to identify urgent measures which could be taken in order to enhance accident and emergency services in acute hospitals, consistent with the commitment in the health strategy. The work of the forum helped to build on the existing and proposed policy framework for accident and emergency services as set out in the strategy. A number of short, medium and long-term actions aimed at alleviating service pressures were identified and these are now being advanced by the national partnership forum through the involvement of partnership groups at local level.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="147" /> The provision of accident and emergency services must also be seen in the context of a range of additional initiatives which are being taken by this Government to significantly enhance the treatment capacity of the hospital and community sectors. Following a comprehensive review of acute hospital bed capacity needs, the Government decided, in the context of the health strategy, to provide an additional 3,000 beds in acute hospitals over the next ten years. My Department provided funding to the Eastern Regional Health Authority and the health boards for the commissioning of 520 of these additional beds in 2002. This exceeds the target of 450 public beds as announced in the health strategy, Quality and Fairness &ndash; A Health System for You.</P>
    <P>Additional sub-acute capacity has also been provided. For example, in the eastern region community nursing units, each with a 50 bed capacity, have opened in Lusk, Maynooth and Dalkey. Revenue funding has been provided to the ERHA to ensure that all of these additional beds will be commissioned in the current year. A major refocus on primary care services, marked by the introduction of new models of care involving core multi-disciplinary primary care teams, which will work with a wider network of health and social care professionals and which will offer 24 hour cover to patients, has taken place. This will also help to reduce demand from, and treat appropriately, patients who would otherwise have to attend at an accident and emergency department.</P>
    <P>This sector will therefore take on a pivotal role in helping to reduce pressures in accident and emergency departments. My Department provided funding of &euro;17.29 million for development of this service in 2002. The standards applying to the training of postgraduates are being reviewed on an ongoing basis. As changes to these standards have implications for service delivery I established the inter agency health care forum, IAHCF, to allow those who set standards and those who deliver service to discuss emerging issues. The IAHCF meets quarterly to discuss various issues of concern, including the implications of the implementation of new training standards. The forum is chaired by the chief medical officer at my Department. Comhairle na nOspidéal, the health boards, the Medical Council, the postgraduate medical and dental board and the training bodies are also represented at the forum.</P>
    <P>In June 2002, the Irish surgical postgraduate training committee, ISPTC, of the Royal College of Surgeons of Ireland published guidelines for the recognition of training posts in accident and emergency departments of acute hospitals providing such services. These guidelines state that:</P>
    <P>The [Accident and Emergency] Department must be under the clinical and administrative control of one or more Emergency Medicine Consultants devoting the whole or major part (eight or greater sessions) of their clinical time <Col N="148" /> to the day to day supervision and training of the junior medical staff.</P>
    <P>The RCSI has indicated that these guidelines represent an &ldquo;ideal situation&rdquo; and is willing to meet with service providers to agree interim arrangements which will allow hospitals to continue to provide accident and emergency services while arrangements are being put in place to meet the standards required. Discussions on the guidelines are also taking place between Comhairle na nOspidéal, the Medical Council and the RCSI.</P>
    <P>The provision of accident and emergency services at Mallow and Ennis General Hospitals is a matter in the first instance for the Southern and Mid-Western Health Boards respectively. I understand that the interim arrangements which I have referred to are being fully adhered to by the Mid-Western Health Board and that the Southern Health Board is awaiting the outcome of the discussions on the guidelines which are taking place between the comhairle, the Medical Council and the RCSI before finalising its proposals in relation to accident and emergency services at Mallow.</P>
    <P>I am aware of the accident and emergency pressures which are being experienced on Dublin's north side. A number of initiatives are being taken to alleviate this situation including the provision of 35 additional beds at Beaumont Hospital and capital funding in excess of &euro;1 million for the extension and refurbishment of facilities at the Mater Hospital's accident and emergency department. In early 2002 action was taken by nursing staff employed in accident and emergency departments in hospitals providing such services. The Labour Relations Commission put forward proposals aimed at resolving the dispute. These included the undertaking of a full security assessment of accident and emergency departments of hospitals providing such services.</P>
    <P>The establishment of a national accident and emergency nursing staffing structures review group to carry out an immediate examination of existing structures and staffing levels in accident and emergency departments and a review of the bed management function in acute hospitals providing such services. I am pleased to advise that the staffing review is nearing completion, a review of security practices was conducted and its recommendations are being implemented while the report of the bed management function has recently been completed. This report, while critical of certain aspects of bed management, found, in general, evidence of good bed management practices throughout the country. The report is designed to ensure the development of enhanced and uniform bed management practices across the hospital system. Its recommendations are being considered by the management and staff sides in the context of the continuing implementation of the LRC proposals.</P>
    <P>Finally I assure the Deputies that I remain committed to ensuring that accident and emergency departments are in a position to respond effectively to demand. I am confident that <Col N="149" /> hospital management and staff in hospitals providing accident and emergency services will continue to work together to respond to any difficulties presenting and to ensure that a high quality service is provided to patients in the best conditions possible.</P>

      <P>As the Deputies will be aware, I established the expert review group on radiotherapy services to examine the appropriate future development of radiotherapy services. The group has conducted a national assessment of needs for radiotherapy services having regard to the demography and epidemiology of cancer and the gaps in current service provision.</P>
      <P>The group's report will address the following key issues: access to radiotherapy services in terms of information, financial access and organisational components of access; the need to provide a high quality, evidence based service; the need to take account of current and new developments in health technology; the requirements of the system in terms of human resources; international norms in relation to service provision, planning and staffing; and the organisational development of the services in terms of structures and processes which need to be place in a radiotherapy facility.</P>
      <P>I understand that the work of the expert review group on radiotherapy services is at the final editing stage and will be submitted to me shortly. All health boards have been afforded the opportunity to meet and make submissions to the group. The provision of additional radiotherapy services will be considered in the context of the report of the expert working group. Following consideration of the report, I will submit proposals for consideration by Government.</P>

      <P>Prospectus Strategy Consultants was contracted in June 2002 to complete an audit of structures and functions of the health system. The terms of reference included consideration of the structures and functions of both health boards-authority and other specialist, advisory, regulatory and executive agencies under my aegis. The terms of reference also require Prospectus to make recommendations to improve corporate governance arrangements in the health system generally. This includes consideration of interactions between all agencies who play a pivotal role in the system, including the Department of Health and Children.</P>

      <Col N="151" /> The project is being overseen by a steering group. A first draft of the report was provided to the steering group on the 23 December and further work is being completed by the consultants. The steering group has not yet received a final draft of the report. I can advise the Deputy that work is at an advanced stage. A final draft will be available in the coming weeks. On completion, I will bring the report to the Government for decision. Once decisions have been made by Government, I anticipate that the report will be published in full and made available generally.</P>

      <P>The total amount of expenditure reimbursed by my Department to health agencies under the health capital programme of the national development plan in 2002 was &euro;507.115 million. The voted capital provision for my Department in 2002 reflects the Government's strong commitment to much needed investment in the health services under the NDP. The funding provided allowed for the development of a range of facilities in all health care programmes including acute hospitals, services for the disabled, services for older persons, mental health, community health, and child care. The expenditure also allowed important capital initiatives to be undertaken in the areas of information and communications technology and in supporting the development of facilities in third level institutions for the nursing degree programme.</P>

Since the beginning of the out of hours co-operative initiatives in the year 2000, my Department has invested almost &euro;50 million in their development. This includes funding of &euro;7.5 million which is being provided in the current year to cover the full year costs of co-operatives that started in 2002, and also to allow for the expansion of others in 2003. The allocation of this development funding will be determined shortly, following a series of meetings being convened by my Department with each of the health boards wishing to expand their out of hours co-operatives in the current year.</P>

      <Quest>when he expects to receive the report of the commission on assisted reproduction; if he will consider asking the commission to expedite its report, having regard to the increased concerns regarding human cloning; if he has proposals to control human cloning; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>
      <QRef>[3430/03]</QRef>
    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin):</NameTxt>
      <P>The subject of cloning is one that raises a wide range of very sensitive and complex issues with associated legal, ethical, social and medical implications. While there is no legislation regulating this area, medical practice is governed by guidelines issued by the Medical Council. These provide that the creation of embryos for experimental purposes or the deliberate and intentional destruction of human life already formed is professional misconduct.</P>
      <P>I am conscious of the degree of concern among the public about the absence of a statutory framework to regulate cloning and a range of other issues associated with the area of assisted human reproduction, including research on embryos. I would like to take this opportunity to reiterate the Government's total opposition to human cloning and our belief that it is appropriate to await the outcome of the commission's report before bringing forward policy proposals to regulate all matters arising in the sphere of assisted human reproduction, including human cloning, in a comprehensive, appropriate and informed way.</P>
      <P>With a view to addressing concerns in this area, a commission on assisted human reproduction was established in March 2000 with the following terms of reference: &ldquo;to prepare a report on the possible approaches to the regulation of all areas of assisted human reproduction and the social, ethical and legal factors to be taken into account in determining public policy in this area.&rdquo;  The commission has met on 16 occasions to date. The first meeting was held on 26 July 2000 and the most recent on 16 January 2003. I understand that the commission has adopted an interdisciplinary approach to its work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Initially, each discipline &ndash; medical, legal scientific and social, prepared a report outlining the <Col N="153" /> current position within that discipline in relation to assisted human reproduction. Working groups were then formed to examine specific topics and issues that needed to be addressed. The working groups meet on a regular basis to discuss their tasks and to progress the work of the commission. I have been informed that the work group structure facilitates close attention to a relatively limited range of topics by a highly specialised group. It also facilitates the detailed exploration of a range of ethical and social implications that arise from assisted human reproduction.</P>
    <P>The commission organised a one day conference for commission members and an invited audience of approximately 30 in Dublin Castle in September 2001. The conference dealt with the social, ethical and legal factors inherent in assisted human reproduction. It provided an opportunity for an exchange of views between experts in the various fields from Ireland, the UK, France and Germany. When the commission was set up, I indicated that it would be required to seek submissions from the public and to consult appropriate interests. In order to inform itself on the current state of public opinion in Ireland on assisted human reproduction, the commission placed an advertisement in the newspapers inviting interested members of the public, professional or voluntary organisations and other parties who wished to do so to make written submissions before Wednesday, 31 October 2001. The commission received more than 1,600 submissions.</P>
    <P>I understand that the commission has engaged in a number of information gathering exercises that include: (i) survey of assisted human reproduction services provided in specialised clinics &ndash; a survey instrument was drafted by the commission with a view to establishing the extent of the provision of assisted human reproduction services in Ireland; (ii) survey of GPs &ndash; the commission issued a survey instrument to a random sample to 50% of GPs in all health board areas. I understand that a high proportion of those surveyed responded; (iii) survey of obstetricians and gynaecologists &ndash; the commission also issued a survey instrument to obstetricians and gynaecologists to elicit information on their level of involvement in assisted human reproduction services.</P>
    <P>The commission has also recently decided to have a survey of public attitudes-opinions on a range of questions related to assisted human reproduction carried out. The Deputy will also be aware that I performed the official opening of the commission's public conference in Dublin Castle last week. These are two more strands of the commission's ongoing consultation.</P>
    <P>Given the difficult nature of the issues to be examined, it is not possible to be definitive about the length of time it will take the commission to complete its work but I am satisfied that it is making significant progress and will continue to work as expeditiously as is feasible. The publication of the commission's report will provide the basis for informed public debate before the finalisation of any policy proposals. I assure everybody that <Col N="154" /> there will be no undue delay in relation to bringing forward the necessary policy proposals.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TimOMalleyPD" hpid="Mr. T. O'Malley Mr. T. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children (Mr. T. O'Malley):</NameTxt>
      <P>The overall economic position in 2003 has had implications for all aspects of public investment, and this is reflected in the Estimates and budget adopted by the Government for 2003. Within this overall framework, however, some two-thirds of the additional funding available for non-capital investment in services has been allocated to the health services. This funding is being applied largely to maintaining existing levels of service across all service programmes including services for people with an intellectual disability.</P>
      <P>Between 1997 and 2002, an extra &euro;188 million in revenue and &euro;139 million in capital funding was provided, making a total additional investment of &euro;327 million for the maintenance and development of services to persons with an intellectual disability and those with autism. In the current year, further additional funding of &euro;13.3 million has been allocated to services for persons with an intellectual disability or autism to meet the full year cost of the 2002 developments and to further enhance the health related support services to children with an intellectual disability or autism. This funding brings the total extra investment in these services to &euro;340 million over seven years. Of this total, more than &euro;200 million has been built into the ongoing budget base. This funding has brought about very significant and unprecedented developments in the services.</P>
      <P>Between 1997 and 2002, approximately 1,700 extra residential places were provided, with most of these based in the community. This figure includes new residential respite places which were developed in 1997 and 1998. Between 1999 and 2002, approximately 465 dedicated respite places were also provided. In addition, the period, 1997-2002, saw the provision of approximately 2,950 new day places. Between 2000 and 2002 the Kerry Parents and Friends Association has received &euro;8.5 million revenue funding and &euro;2.2 million capital funding. In 2000 it also received a once-off grant of &euro;190,000 to assist with a cumulative revenue deficit. Funding for 2003 has not been finalised.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Despite this significant investment, demographic factors are contributing to growing waiting lists for residential services in particular, even though the number of people in receipt of services, including full time residential services, con<Col N="155" /> tinues to increase. The increased birth rate in the 1960s and 1970s has resulted in large numbers of adults in their late 20s and early 30s requiring full-time residential services. In addition, people with an intellectual disability are living longer than previously, adding to the need for services compared to previous generations. This has also been the international experience in service provision to this population. While it is regrettable that the level of investment in these services achieved in recent years could not be maintained in 2003, my Department will work closely with the health boards and other service providers in relation to service provision this year.</P>

    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin):</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy will be aware the health strategy includes a commitment that significant improvements will be made in the medical card income guidelines in order to increase the number of persons on low income who are eligible for a medical card and to give priority to families with children and particularly children with a disability. However, increased investment in this or any other developmental aspect of the strategy agenda, is dependant on the availability of the necessary additional resources. Following the spending Estimates and budget adopted by the Government, this unfortunately will not be possible in 2003.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The present GMS scheme costs have increased by about 30% over the 2002 original Estimates <Col N="156" /> and, on that basis, this will cost &euro;230 million extra. Under the Health Act 1970, the determination of eligibility for health services is the responsibility of the chief executive officer of the appropriate health board and neither I nor my Department has a function in the matter. The Deputy is no doubt aware that, since July 2001, all those aged 70 years or over are automatically eligible for a medical card. I would like to add that health boards have discretion, in cases of exceptional need, to provide assistance to individuals where undue hardship would otherwise be caused.</P>
    <P>It should be remembered that health board chief executive officers have discretion in relation to the issuing of medical cards and also that a range of income sources are excluded by the health boards when assessing medical card eligibility. Many allowances such as carers' allowance, child benefit, domiciliary care allowance, family income supplement and foster care allowance are all disregarded when determining a person's eligibility. The chief executive officers of the health boards have been reminded by my Department that medical card holders should not be disadvantaged as a result of budgetary increases in social welfare allowances.</P>
    <P>I should also mention that for those who do not qualify for a medical card, there is a number of schemes which provide assistance towards the cost of medication. Under the long-term illness scheme, persons suffering from a number of conditions can obtain without charge the drugs and medicines for the treatment of that condition. Under the drug payments scheme, a person and his-her dependants do not have to pay more than &euro;70 in any calendar month for approved prescribed drugs, medicines and appliances. The health strategy emphasises fairness and the objective of reducing health inequalities in our society. The area of reducing waiting times for public patients is prioritised with the expansion of bed numbers and the introduction of the national treatment purchase fund.</P>
    <P>In addition, there are clear commitments to targeting vulnerable and disadvantaged groups including continued investment in services for people with disabilities and older people; initiatives to improve the health of Travellers, homeless people, drug misusers, asylum seekers-refugees and prisoners; and implementation of the NAPS targets relating to health. Following an extensive consultation process with disadvantaged groups carried out under the auspices of the working group on NAPS and health, NAPS health targets have been included in, Building an Inclusive Society: Review of the National Anti-Poverty Strategy, under the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness, published by the Government earlier this year.</P>
    <P>Key health targets are to reduce the gap in premature mortality and low birth weight between the highest and lowest socioeconomic groups by 10% by 2007 and to reduce differences in life expectancy between Travellers and the rest <Col N="157" /> of the population. Policy measures for implementing these targets as outlined in the Framework Document for the NAPS review and the report of the working group on NAPS and health, have been taken on board in the national health strategy.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 117, 147, 352 and 365 together.</P>
      <P>As Minister, my responsibilities centre on the provision of a high quality health service and this includes ensuring, in so far as is possible, that adequate and accessible pharmacy services are generally available. In January 2002, following advice from the Attorney General, I revoked the Health (Community Pharmacy Contractor Agreement) Regulations 1996. These regulations had set out the criteria and procedures for the granting of community pharmacy contracts by the health boards. As a result of the revocation of the regulations, there are now no restrictions on granting new contracts in terms of location, population or viability of existing pharmacies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, the opening and operation of retail pharmacies in Ireland continues to be governed by the Pharmacy Acts 1875-1977, subject to conditions imposed by non-pharmacy legislation such as the planning Acts. As regards the sale of a pharmacy business, this is a matter for the owner concerned. The pharmacy review group, chaired by Professor Michael Mortell, was established by me in November 2001 to examine the pharmacy issues raised in the OECD report on regulatory reform in Ireland. The group has based its approach on the principles set out for evidence-based policy formulation by the Mandelkern <Col N="158" /> group &ndash; the Mandelkern group on better regulation final report, 13 November 2001.</P>
    <P>These include public and interest group consultation; analysis of the existing position; and analysis of possible options. The group has consulted widely and, in particular, with consumer interests. The report of the pharmacy review group was submitted to me on 31 January 2003. I am currently examining the recommendations contained in the report and it is my intention that it will be published as soon as possible. I hope the Deputies will appreciate that it would be inappropriate for me to comment on the detailed recommendations in the report in advance of its publication.</P>

Many of these issues involve improvements to the services provided for public patients which will require increased productivity, operational change, team working, flexibility etc. In accordance with a recent Labour Court recommendation any increase in consultants' salaries will only arise following successful negotiation of a new contract. The scale of any such increase will have to be determined by an appropriate body, at which point provision will need to be made for the funding required.</P>

      <P>It is the policy of my Department to provide new nursing units or similar facilities for older persons so that patients can access care as close as is reasonably possible to their local communities. The proposed development in Tralee will be tailored to meet the particular needs of its potential clients and will comprise of a 50 bed nursing unit, various treatment-remedial departments, and back-up administrative and services facilities. Based on the brief prepared by the project team, the most recent cost of the proposed project is of the order of &euro;8.5 million at a September 2002 price base date. Certain revenue costs have also to be taken into account for the new facility. The capital cost of the project will be met from the national development plan.</P>
      <P>My Department is reviewing, from a national point of view, the NDP for the health sector generally in light of the outturn position for 2002. This process involves providing for existing capital contractual commitments and commencing where possible the planning or construction of new projects nationally in 2003 or beyond. It is in this context that capital developments for the Southern Health Board region, including the proposed new unit at Tralee, are being examined. My Department fully appreciates the importance of progressing this development and will continue to liaise closely with the Southern Health Board in relation to the board's overall capital needs and priorities, with a view to appointing a design team for this project at the earliest possible date.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin):</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy will be aware, BreastCheck, the national breast screening programme commenced in March 2000 with phase one of the programme covering the Eastern Regional Health Authority, Midland Health Board and North-Eastern Health Board areas. Screening is being offered free of charge to all women in those areas in the target age group 50 to 64 years of age. The target population consists of approximately 136,000 women and it represents about 50% of the national target population. To end November 2002, 106,585 women had been called for screening and 79,906 women have been screened, representing an uptake of 75%.</P>
      <P>Yesterday, I announced the extension of BreastCheck to a further three counties. I am committed to the national extension of BreastCheck. Approximately, 19,000 women in the 50-64 age bracket in Counties Wexford, Kilkenny and Carlow will be invited for screening. Approximately 9,500 per annum will be invited once the programme is fully operational in these counties. It is expected that approximately 60 additional cancers will be diagnosed and treated annually. In relation to the further expansion of the programme, the board of BreastCheck has submitted a business plan to my Department.</P>
      <P>Two static units are proposed in host hospitals, one in Cork and the other in Galway at which breast surgery would be performed for women in the south, west, mid-west and north west. A number of key issues have been raised by health boards and health professionals in relation to the national roll out of BreastCheck which need to be addressed in advance of further expansion. I will be meeting with BreastCheck shortly to discuss these issues. The objective is to prepare an effective and cohesive model which is in the best interests of the women concerned and which builds on the quality standards of BreastCheck and the symptomatic services.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin):</NameTxt>
      <P>In early 2002 action was taken by nursing staff in <Col N="161" /> accident and emergency departments of hospitals providing such services. Proposals put forward by the Labour Relations Commission &ndash; LRC &ndash; aimed at resolving the dispute included an independent review of the bed management function in acute hospitals providing accident and emergency services. The review was commissioned by the Health Service Employers Agency &ndash; HSEA &ndash; and the unions representing nursing staff in accident and emergency departments. Its purpose was to help to establish some of the causes of weakness in the system and to provide guidance on how these difficulties might be addressed. The CAPITA report referred to by the Deputy is the product of this independent review and was completed on 27 January 2003. </P>
      <P>While the report is critical of certain aspects of bed management it found, in general, evidence of good bed management practices around the country. The report is designed to ensure the development of enhanced and uniform bed management practices across the hospital system. Its recommendations are at present being considered by the management and staff sides in the context of the continuing implementation of the LRC proposals. </P>
      <P>Improved bed management is one of a range of measures being taken to improve accident and emergency services arising from the LRC proposals. Management structures and procedures have been strengthened; a staffing review is nearing completion while a review of security practices was conducted and its recommendations are being implemented.</P>
      <P>In addition to the LRC initiatives the Government has taken a number of measures designed to further enhance services. A &euro;41 million investment package was provided in the winter of 2000-01 aimed at alleviating service pressures and maintaining services to patients, particularly in the acute hospital sector. This investment package provided, <i>inter alia,</i> for the recruitment of an additional 29 accident and emergency consultants. Seventeen of these posts have now been filled and the recruitment process is continuing in respect of the remaining posts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Funding has also been provided in recent years to the ERHA and the health boards to support a further range of initiatives in accident and emergency departments. These include: &euro;6.59 million towards the development of accident and emergency facilities at St. James's Hospital; development of new accident and emergency department at St. Vincent's Hospital, Elm Park; development of new accident and emergency department at The Children's Hospital, Temple Street; development of accident and emergency department at Galway University Hospital; development of accident and emergency department at Castlebar General Hospital; development of accident and emergency department at Tullamore General Hospital; appointment of a design team for the development of a new accident and emergency department at Roscommon County Hospital; upgrading of accident and emergency facilities at <Col N="162" /> Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital, Drogheda, and Our Lady's Hospital, Navan; development of accident and emergency department at the Mater Hospital; extension to the accident and emergency department at St. Columcille's Hospital; provision of a chest pain service at St. James's Hospital; the recruitment of discharge planners and patient liaison personnel at accident and emergency sites in the eastern region; the provision of minor injuries units in Beaumont, Mater, James Connolly Memorial, St. James's and Tallaght Hospitals; and the development of pilot services for deep venous thrombosis in Beaumont Hospital.</P>
    <P>Other initiatives which are designed to improve the operation of accident and emergency departments are outlined in the national health strategy &ndash; Quality and Fairness &ndash; A Health System for You. These include: the establishment of further minor injury units to ensure appropriate treatment and management of non-urgent cases; the use of chest pain clinics, respiratory clinics and in-house specialist teams to fast-track patients as appropriate; the re-organisation of diagnostic services to ensure increased access to, and availability of, services at busy times in accident and emergency departments; the appointment of advanced nurse practitioners, ANPs &ndash; emergency &ndash; in acute hospitals; the use of admission protocols to ensure that emergency patients will be the only group of patients admitted to hospital through accident and emergency departments; the appointment of additional personnel to liaise with patients while they await diagnosis and treatment at accident and emergency departments; the introduction of information systems that record comprehensive, comparable and reliable data on activity in accident and emergency departments. Such information will provide staff with a valuable tool in structuring services to meet the needs of patients. </P>
    <P>In addition at my request, Comhairle na nOspidéal has undertaken a detailed review of the structures, operation and staffing of accident and emergency departments. The report entitled Report of the Committee on Accident &amp; Emergency Services not only deals with the staffing of accident and emergency departments at consultant level but also links reform of accident and emergency departments with the need to look critically at hospital processes and patient flows through the hospitals. The report provides valuable advice on the structure of our emergency services and the necessary linkages, which will be required to eliminate delays in emergency departments.</P>
    <P>Last year I established an accident and emergency forum to identify urgent measures which could be taken in order to enhance accident and emergency services in acute hospitals, consistent with the commitment in the health strategy. The work of the forum helped to build on the existing and proposed policy framework for accident and emergency services as set out in the strategy. A number of short, medium and long-term actions <Col N="163" /> aimed at alleviating service pressures were identified and these are now being advanced by the National Partnership Forum through the involvement of partnership groups at local level.</P>
    <P>The provision of accident and emergency services must also be seen in the context of a range of additional initiatives which are being taken by this Government to significantly enhance the treatment capacity of the hospital and community sectors. Following a comprehensive review of acute hospital bed capacity needs, the Government decided, in the context of the health strategy, to provide an additional 3,000 beds in acute hospitals over the next ten years. My Department provided funding to the Eastern Regional Health Authority, ERHA, and the health boards for the commissioning of 520 of these additional beds in 2002. This exceeds the target of 450 public beds as announced in the health strategy Quality and Fairness &ndash; A Health System for You.</P>
    <P>Additional sub-acute capacity has also been provided. For example, in the eastern region community nursing units, each with a 50-bed capacity, have opened in Lusk, Maynooth and Dalkey. Revenue funding has been provided to the ERHA to ensure that all of these additional beds will be commissioned in the current year. A major re-focus on primary care services, marked by the introduction of new models of care involving core multidisciplinary primary care teams, which will work with a wider network of health and social care professionals and which will offer 24 hour cover to patients, has taken place. This will also help to reduce demand from, and treat appropriately, patients who would otherwise have to attend at an accident and emergency department. This sector will therefore take on a pivotal role in helping to reduce pressures in accident and emergency departments. Over &euro;17 million was invested in the development of this service in 2002.</P>
    <P>Finally, I can assure the Deputy that I remain committed to ensuring that accident and emergency departments are in a position to respond effectively to demand. I am confident that hospital management and staff in hospitals providing accident and emergency services will continue to work together to respond to any difficulties presenting and to ensure that a high quality service is provided to patients in the best conditions possible.</P>

      <P>The target set out in the national health strategy states that by the end of 2004 all public patients requiring admission to hospital will be scheduled to commence treatment within a maximum of three months of referral from an out-patient department. Intermediate targets have been set to achieve this aim to ensure that the focus is being turned towards the long waiters. Waiting list data in respect of the quarter ending December 2002 is being collated at present by my Department. </P>
      <P>Considerable progress has been made in reducing waiting times for public patients in 2002. The total number of children waiting for more than six months for in-patient treatment has fallen by 24% between June and September 2002. The total number of adults waiting for more than 12 months for in-patient treatment in the nine target surgical specialties covered by the waiting list initiative has fallen by 15% between June and September 2002. </P>
      <P>While the waiting list initiative will continue to fund additional elective activity, the dedicated national treatment purchase fund is being used to target those waiting longest for treatment. Funding of &euro;43.8 million has been provided in 2003 for the waiting list initiative and a further &euro;30.75 million has been provided for the national treatment purchase fund. To date approximately 2,300 long waiters have received treatment under the national treatment purchase fund.</P>

    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin):</NameTxt>
      <P>The Crisis Pregnancy Agency was established on 2 October 2001, under the Health (Corporate Bodies) Act 1961. The agency is a planning and co-ordinating body, rather than a provider of services. The task of the agency is to draw up a national strategy to address crisis pregnancy and to oversee its implementation, in consultation <Col N="166" /> with Government and other non-statutory agencies. The agency became fully operational in 2002, however, as the agency is not a service provider, it will not be providing a service directly to the public.</P>
      <P>The prevention of crisis pregnancy in the first instance is a primary goal of the agency. Preventative issues concerning the education of young adults, as well as services appropriate to their needs and lifestyles will be addressed. The agency will work to develop strategies to make women more aware of their options, should they have a crisis pregnancy, and to improve the supports and assistance available to women in this situation, so that they will feel that they will have genuine alternatives to abortion. Women who have had an abortion, either recently or some time ago, have particular needs also and this is another area which the agency has been asked to address. The agency will work towards ensuring quality services are developed, where women are treated with compassion and understanding and that both their emotional and physical health needs are attended to.</P>
      <P>I appointed Ms Olive Braiden as chairperson on 3 October 2001. Eight board members were subsequently appointed. The board meets on a monthly basis and also works through a number of sub-groups. A director and two senior managers &ndash; administration and programmes and communications &ndash; were recruited in May 2002. A research officer, health promotion and education officer and an administration officer as well as administrative support staff are also in place. To complete the agency's staff complement a second research officer will be recruited in 2003.</P>
      <P>The statutory instrument under which the agency was created provided for the establishment of a 20-person consultative committee which would provide expert advice to the board of the agency. This committee was established in November 2002 under the chair of Dr. Linda Hogan and has various statutory and non-statutory organisations represented on it. </P>
      <P>A strategic framework, which will identify the various strands of the strategy to address crisis pregnancy in Ireland, is currently being drafted. Work will then commence on the development of the agency's strategy to address crisis pregnancy with a view to having it completed by the end of the year. It is hoped to incorporate an action plan for the coming years in the strategy. This will provide the agency with a framework to implement its strategy in a planned and structured manner. This will form a key part of the agency's work in 2003.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In May 2002, the agency invited funding proposals from service providers. The merit of each proposal was assessed and the agency allocated &euro;900,000 in 2002 to carry out innovative work in the areas of information provision and capacity building. This funding has knock-on costs of &euro;1.898 million for 2003. Funding proposals for capacity building in the provision of the coun<Col N="167" /> selling services will be evaluated in March, and new funding proposals will then be invited.</P>
    <P>A major information programme was developed by the agency in 2002 to promote information on support services in crisis pregnancy. Entitled the Positive Options Campaign, it focuses on making women more aware of their options, should they have a crisis pregnancy, and improving the supports and assistance available to women in this situation. The project has been developed in co-operation with Cherish, Cura, Dublin Well Woman, Irish Family Planning Association, Life, Pact and Treoir. </P>
    <P>Phase one of the positive options campaign included media placement, an SMS pilot, an information leaflet, posters, a web portal and dedicated crisis pregnancy web pages on service provider sites. Additional elements, such as supports for ethnic groups, a telephone information line and Aertel pages are currently being assessed. Further initiatives will include intensive advertising of each campaign element and targeted promotions within particular settings such as the workplace and third level colleges.</P>
    <P>A research programme also commenced in 2002. The main priorities for this area include the development of an initial framework, an audit of existing research and an analysis of research gaps.</P>
    <P>The National University Ireland, Galway, has been engaged to carry out a major piece of research into current counselling services in Ireland. This research will be completed by April 2003 and will inform the future direction of counselling services. Other developments in 2002 included an audit of the services provided nationally.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, the establishment of the Crisis Pregnancy Agency is intended to play a major role in the development of co-ordinated, responsive and appropriate services. The agency hopes that, over time, it will be possible to reduce the incidence of unwanted pregnancies among Irish women and ensure that women who find themselves in this situation will have available to them the widest possible range of assistance to help them deal with their situation.</P>

Its purpose was to update legislation concerning the involuntary detention of persons for psychiatric care and treatment and to establish mechanisms by which the standards of care and treatment provided in the mental health services would be supervised and regulated. When fully implemented, the Mental Health Act 2001 will bring Irish mental health law fully into conformity with the European Convention on Human Rights and into line with international best practice in the field.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While the Act does not expressly provide a statutory right to mental health care, it contains many positive provisions which improve the rights of patients. These provisions have been warmly welcomed by Amnesty International in its report, published yesterday. In the report, Amnesty notes that the Act expressly provides for the right to information about the circumstances of a detention and any proposed treatments. It also provides that a patient must be informed about their right to a review of their <Col N="169" /> detention, their right to legal representation and the right to legal aid where appropriate.</P>
    <P>The main vehicle for the implementation of the Mental Health Act 2001 will be the Mental Health Commission. The commission's primary function is to promote and foster high standards and good practices in the delivery of mental health services and to ensure that the interests of detained persons are protected. The establishment of the commission in April 2002 is also welcomed by Amnesty in its report.</P>

      <askee>Minister for Health and Children</askee>
      <Quest>if his attention has been drawn to the enormous concerns on the parts of thousands of parents and their children who are unable to access urgently required orthodontic treatment; and his proposals at this stage to improve the availability of the service.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin):</NameTxt>
      <P>The provision of orthodontic services is a matter for the health boards in the first instance. I am aware of concerns about orthodontic services and consequently I have taken a range of measures to improve them nationally.</P>
      <P>The grade of specialist in orthodontics has been created in the health board orthodontic service. The introduction of this pivotal grade will have a tremendous impact on the future delivery of orthodontics in the public service: ultimately, it will address the issues of recruitment and retention of qualified clinical personnel in the service.</P>
      <P>This year, my Department and the health boards are funding 13 dentists from various health boards for specialist in orthodontics qualifications at training programmes in Ireland and at two separate universities in the United Kingdom. These 13 trainees for the public orthodontic service are additional to the six dentists who commenced their training last year and one dentist whose specialist training is nearing completion. Thus, there is an aggregate of 20 dentists in specialist training for orthodontics. Additional funding of &euro;0.640 million and &euro;0.894 million was provided for these training programmes in 2002 and 2003 respectively. These measures will complement the other structural changes being introduced into the orthodontic service, including the creation of an auxiliary grade of orthodontic therapist to work in the orthodontic area.</P>
      <P>In the short-term, I have funded an orthodontic initiative to ease current pressures on the system. Additional funding of &euro;6.729 million was approved for orthodontic services in 2001 of which &euro;4.698 million was to fund an initiative on orthodontic waiting lists. This is enabling health boards to recruit additional staff, engage the services of private specialist orthodontic practitioners to treat patients and build additional orthodontic facilities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Last June, my Department provided additional funding of &euro;5 million from the treatment pur<Col N="170" /> chase fund to health boards specifically for the purchase of orthodontic treatment. This funding is enabling boards to provide both additional sessions for existing staff and purchase treatment from private specialist orthodontic practitioners.</P>
    <P>Finally, the chief executive officers of the health boards-authority have informed me that at the end of the September 2002 quarter, there were 18,511 patients receiving orthodontic treatment in the public orthodontic service. This is an increase of approximately 1,216 patients in orthodontic treatment when compared with the number of patients receiving treatment in December 2001. I expect that the number of patients receiving orthodontic treatment in the public orthodontic service will continue to increase as the measures that I have taken impact further on the service.</P>

      <P>The World Health Organisation's 2001 Report, Mental Health: New Understanding, New Hope was aimed at raising public and professional awareness worldwide of the burden of mental illness and its costs in human, social and economic terms.

    </Speaker>
    <P>Steady progress has been made in this country over recent years in many of the areas covered by the World Health Organisation's recommendations, for example in the shift from institutional to community-based care, and in the reform of mental health legislation. The Government is committed to continuing this progress and to <Col N="171" /> increasing its efforts in the area of mental health, as resources become available.</P>
    <P>The health strategy, &ndash; Quality and Fairness, contains a commitment to the development of a new national policy framework for mental health, work on which is expected to begin later this year. The recommendations of the World Health Organisation will be among the matters to be considered in the formulation of the new framework.</P>

      <P>Arising from the Health Strategy Quality and Fairness &ndash; A Health System for You, one of the key actions for dealing with public hospital waiting lists was the establishment of the national treatment purchase fund &ndash; NTPF. The NTPF was set up in April 2002 and referred its first patients for treatment at the end of June. Health boards and hospitals have been asked to identify public hospital patients waiting longest on in-patient lists, so that they can be offered treatment under this initiative. The NTPF is initially concentrating on adults who have been waiting on in-patient lists over twelve months and children waiting over six months. The patient's consent to being treated under this scheme is also sought. Capacity is sourced by the NTPF and patients are referred for treatment. </P>
      <P>Should any travelling difficulties be experienced by patients receiving treatment under the NTPF initiative within Ireland, the local liaison officer within the appropriate hospital-health board should be contacted and he-she will be able to assist. If patients are required to travel outside of Ireland for treatment, the NTPF will arrange for transport to and from the airport. The patient will be met at the airport and brought to the treating hospital. The costs associated with all travel requirements to the UK will be borne by the NTPF.</P>

      <P>In November, 2001, I appointed Mr. Paul Gardiner, senior counsel, to produce a situation report about the position in Ireland and in the United States in respect of a possible investigation into the actions of the multinational phar<Col N="173" /> maceutical companies whose products are implicated in the HIV and hepatitis C infection of persons with haemophilia.</P>
      <P>As part of his investigations, Mr. Gardiner liaised with solicitors acting for the Irish Haemophilia Society. He travelled to the United States and spoke to a number of relevant experts, including the lead counsel in the HIV haemophiliac litigation in the United States. Mr. Gardiner also received legal advice from a major New York law firm in relation to the matters relevant to his investigations.</P>
      <P>Mr. Gardiner furnished a report to me which consisted of a 60 page opinion and a number of appendices, one of which comprised more than 50 pages of legal advice from the US lawyers. The report drew attention to the fact that there is no guarantee that the US authorities would provide judicial assistance to an Irish tribunal, either in relation to enforcing the discovery of documents or compelling the attendance of witnesses.</P>
      <P>I have briefed my Cabinet colleagues on the content of the report and I have provided the Irish Haemophilia Society with a copy of it.</P>
      <P>Following further consultations with Mr. Gardiner late last year, I believe it would be possible to mount a useful investigation which would access publicly available material and seek the assistance of persons and bodies willing to cooperate with such investigation. I am in ongoing consultation with the Irish Haemophilia Society and I hope to present proposals to Government in the not too distant future.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin):</NameTxt>
      <P>The aims of the primary care strategy, Primary Care: A New Direction, are to provide: a strengthened primary care system which will play a more central role as the first and ongoing point of contact for people with the health-care system; an integrated, inter-disciplinary, high-quality, team-based and user-friendly set of services for the public, and enhanced capacity for primary care in the areas of disease prevention, rehabilitation and personal social services to complement the existing diagnosis and treatment focus.</P>
      <P>This strategy sets out an implementation plan with an incremental approach which recognises the breadth of the change that will be required in order to support the roll out of the new primary care model over the next decade. Since the launch of this strategy in November 2001, a number of essential implementation steps have been taken.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In April 2002 I established the primary care task force within my Department. It has responsibility for driving the implementation of the <Col N="174" /> changes and developments set out in the model. The task force initially prioritised the selection of locations for a number of primary care implementation projects and in October 2002 I gave approval to the first ten such projects &ndash; one in each health board area. These projects will build on the services and resources already in place in the ten locations involved, so as to develop, over the coming months, a primary care team in line with the inter-disciplinary model described in the strategy. I have committed a total of &euro;8.4 million to these projects over 2002 and 2003.</P>
    <P>The primary care task force is working with the health boards and other interests to support the implementation projects in achieving the goal of establishing a primary care team in each of the locations involved. This will include the provision of personal and organisational development support through the Office of Health Management. There will also be consultation with those directly involved with the projects on a number of operational issues which will need to be addressed as these initial projects are established. I established a national primary care steering group in June 2002. It is chaired by Professor Ivan Perry, professor of epidemiology and public health at University College, Cork. The role of this group is to give national leadership and guidance in relation to several key elements of the implementation plan. Furthermore, a number of sub-groups have been established to give detailed consideration to particular aspects of the implementation agenda and to make recommendations which can then be translated into action by the appropriate bodies and agencies. At regional level the health boards are also putting in place representative structures which mirror the approach being taken at national level.</P>
    <P>The preparation of needs assessments is also being progressed by the health boards. At the request of the primary care task force, the health board chief executive officers have established a national group to co-ordinate this process. The group will agree definitions, standards and the process for the completion of the needs assessments in line with the commitment contained in the primary care strategy. The initial macro-level assessments are due for completion shortly, to be followed by the development of models that can be used at local level for primary care team and network populations.</P>
    <P>A national conference on the primary care strategy was held in Galway in October 2002. This was the first conference organised at a national level to discuss, in partnership with the key stakeholders and organisations, the implementation of the strategy. It provided a valuable opportunity for participants to identify and discuss many of the issues which will arise as the implementation of the strategy proceeds.</P>
    <P>In November 2002 I provided funding of &euro;360,000 for the establishment of three research fellowships in primary care, in the university departments of general practice. The fellowships, which will be funded through the Health <Col N="175" /> Research Board and available to the professions who will work in the new primary care teams, will enable the researchers to work on topics relevant to the implementation of the primary care strategy.</P>

      <P>The social services inspectorate &ndash; SSI &ndash; was established in April 1999, initially on administrative basis, but it is proposed to establish it on a statutory basis. The main function of the inspectorate is to support the child care services by promoting and ensuring the development of quality standards. The SSI will monitor all personal social services operated by the health boards, in the longer term, but initially it is concentrating on the child care area and in particular on the inspection of health board operated residential child care facilities. The inspection of residential facilities for children with disabilities was excluded from the remit of the SSI under the Child Care Act 1991. This exclusion was however revoked in the Children Act 2001.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A steering group chaired by the Department of Health and Children and comprising representatives of the Department, the chief executive officers of the health boards, the Eastern Regional Health Authority and the chief inspector of the SSI oversees the operation of the SSI. The process of inspection has been agreed. A national set of standards against which all children's residential homes, both statutory and non-statutory, are being inspected was published in September 2001. An examination of these standards will begin within the next few weeks with a <Col N="176" /> view to ensuring that they encompass the particular needs of children with disabilities.</P>
    <P>The health strategy &ndash; Quality and Fairness &ndash; has set 2003 as the target date for the establishment of the SSI on a statutory basis. It also states that the remit of the SSI will be extended to cover residential care for older people and adults with disabilities. Establishing the SSI on a statutory basis will strengthen its role and will provide it with the necessary underpinning of independence in the performance of its functions. It will also serve to increase public confidence in state and voluntary social services. Work is in progress on the drafting of a statutory instrument to enable the SSI to be established on a statutory footing.</P>

      <P>The question of waiting times associated with the cervical cytology service in the National Maternity Hospital is a matter for the Eastern Regional Health Authority. Accordingly, my Department has asked the regional chief executive to investigate the matter raised by the Deputy and to reply to him directly. I should point out that I am committed to facilitating boards in achieving a reduction in the waiting times for cervical smear test results. In this regard, my Department has, over the last few years, allocated additional funding to provide for the establishment of new posts, purchase of new equipment and the introduction of new technology in the cervical cytology laboratories. In 2003, an extra &euro;1.4 million has been provided to assist ongoing developments in the cervical cytology and colposcopy services.</P>
      <P>I recently approved the piloting by the phase one cervical screening programme of a proposed contingency plan to assist in overcoming capacity problems in the cervical cytology laboratories. This plan involves the contracting out of cervical smears to an external laboratory subject to compliance with the requirements set out in the 1999 document, Quality Assurance Guidelines for the Irish national cervical screening programme.

      <P>There were a total of 92,996 personnel in whole-time equivalent terms &ndash; 90,301 excluding home helps &ndash; recorded in the annual health service personnel census at end-2001. The census in respect of end-2002 is currently being complied by my Department. The Deputies may wish to note that since 1997, there has been an increase of in excess of 28,000 &ndash; 42% &ndash; in the approved employment ceiling for the health services bringing the authorised employment ceiling to 96,000 &ndash; excluding home helps. The contribution of the health service to the planned reduction in public service employment through natural wastage over the next three years is currently being examined by my Department. In implementing this measure a key priority will be to minimise the impact on front-line service delivery.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children (Mr. T. O'Malley):</NameTxt>
      <P>The provision of health-related services is a matter for the Eastern Regional Health Authority and the health boards in the first instance. Accordingly, the Deputy's question has been referred to the chief executive officer of the South-Eastern Health Board with a request that he examine the matter and reply directly to the Deputy as a matter of urgency. However, I understand that all health boards are experiencing difficulties in the recruitment of therapy posts and particularly in filling senior vacancies. Furthermore, I wish to advise the Deputy that my Department commissioned a report on current and future supply and demand in the labour market for certain professional therapists from Dr. Peter Bacon and Associates. The Bacon report, which was published in July 2001, concluded that a major expansion is essential in the number of speech and language therapists requiring a very significant increase in training places to meet the long-term needs of the health service. To advance this core recommendation of the report, an interagency working group, comprising officials from the Department of Health and Children, the Department of Education and Science and the Higher Education Authority, was established to seek proposals from third level institutions to ensure the rapid provision of the additional therapy training places. On 29 May 2002, the former Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Woods, announced the provision of 175 extra professional therapy training places for students to tackle the acute shortage of physiotherapists, occupational therapists and speech and language therapists in the health service. This initiative almost doubles the number of therapy places available at present and it is expected that the first intake to the extra places for speech and language therapy will commence in the 2003-2004 academic year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Other key recommendations of the report include: provision of sufficient clinical placements within the health service through the establishment of a national network of clinical placement <Col N="179" /> co-ordinators; need for fast-track qualification and review of the existing training system; concerted recruitment from overseas; establishment of the planned system of statutory registration consistent with the requirement for a patient-centred health service; career structure, workload, working practices and skills-mix issues encompassed in the context of the report of the expert group on various health professions published April 2000.</P>
    <P>In addition to the Bacon report I have asked the Eastern Regional Health Authority and the health boards to explore other approaches which might result in the maintenance of an existing level of service provision, or an enhancement, in line with agreed service developments using the resources allocated to the services. The Northern Area Health Board has also undertaken a concerted overseas recruitment drive for various allied health professionals, including speech and language therapists, on behalf of all health boards. Procedures are being streamlined to minimise the length of time taken to validate foreign qualifications consistent with the over-arching need to ensure that all therapists working in the health sector are appropriately trained and qualified.</P>

      <Quest>if his attention has been drawn to the recent survey undertaken by the Eastern Regional Health Authority which showed that four in ten people, particularly the elderly, women and the less well off, said that the cost of health care prevented them from using services; his views on whether it is satisfactory that people should be prevented from using health services due to costs; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin):</NameTxt>
      <P>I presume the Deputy is referring to the customer services review commissioned by the Eastern Regional Health Authority which was undertaken to establish people's experiences and expectations of health services. The survey sample interviewed 1,500 members of the general public and the views of individuals from minority ethnic groups were also sought. The majority of service users were satisfied with general practice &ndash; 95% &ndash; in-patient hospital services &ndash; 90% &ndash; out-patient hospital services &ndash; 93% &ndash; and hospital accident and emergency departments &ndash; 74%.</P>
      <P>Entitlement to health services in Ireland is primarily based on residency and means rather than income. Any person, regardless of nationality, who is accepted by the health boards as being ordinarily resident in Ireland is entitled to either full eligibility, category 1, or limited eligibility, category 2, for health services.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Persons in category 1 are medical card holders and they are entitled to a full range of services <Col N="180" /> including general practitioner services, prescribed drugs and medicines, all in-patient public hospital services in public wards including consultants services, all out-patient public hospital services including consultants services, dental, ophthalmic and aural services and appliances and a maternity and infant care service.</P>
    <P>Persons in category 2, non-medical card holders, are entitled, subject to certain charges, to all in-patient public hospital services in public wards including consultants services and out-patient public hospital services including consultants services. The current public hospital statutory in-patient charge is &euro;40 per night, up to a maximum of &euro;400 in any 12 consecutive months. Attendance at accident and emergency departments is subject to a charge of &euro;40 where the patient does not have a referral note from his/her doctor. This charge applies only to the first visit in any episode of care. A maternity and infant care service is provided free of charge during pregnancy and up to six weeks after birth.</P>
    <P>Under the Health Act 1970 the determination of eligibility for health services is the responsibility of the chief executive officer of the appropriate health board and neither I nor my Department has a function in the matter. The Deputy is no doubt aware that, since July 2001, all those aged 70 years or over are automatically eligible for a medical card. I would like to add that health boards have discretion, in cases of exceptional need, to provide assistance to individuals where undue hardship would otherwise be caused. The national health strategy includes a whole series of initiatives to clarify and expand the existing arrangements for eligibility for health services, including recommendations arising from the review of the medical card scheme carried out by the health board chief executive officers under the PPF which include: streamlining applications and improving the standardisation of the medical card applications process to ensure better fairness and transparency; providing clearer information to people about how and where to apply for medical cards; and proactively seeking out those who should have medical cards to ensure they have access to the services that are available which the health board chief executive officers are currently implementing.</P>
    <P>I should also mention that for those who do not qualify for a medical card, there are a number of schemes which provide assistance towards the cost of medication. Under the long-term illness scheme, persons suffering from a number of conditions can obtain without charge the drugs and medicines for the treatment of that condition. Under the drug payment scheme, a person and his or her dependants do not have to pay more than &euro;70 in any calendar month for approved prescribed drugs, medicines and appliances.</P>
    <P>The national health strategy emphasises fairness and the objective of reducing health inequalities in our society. The area of reducing waiting times for public patients is prioritised with the expansion of bed numbers and the intro<Col N="181" /> duction of the national treatment purchase fund. In addition, there are clear commitments to targeting vulnerable and disadvantaged groups including; continued investment in services for people with disabilities and older people; initiatives to improve the health of travellers, homeless people, drug misusers, asylum seekers-refugees and prisoners; and implementation of the NAPS targets relating to health.</P>
    <P>Following an extensive consultation process with disadvantaged groups carried out under the auspices of the working group on NAPS and health, NAPS health targets have been included in Building an Inclusive Society: Review of the National Anti Poverty Strategy under the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness, published by the Government earlier this year. Key health targets are to reduce the gap in premature mortality and low birth weight between the highest and lowest socio-economic groups by 10% by 2007, and to reduce differences in life expectancy between Travellers and the rest of the population. Policy measures for implementing these targets as outlined in the framework document for the NAPS review and the report of the working group on NAPS and health, have been taken on board in the national health strategy.</P>
    <P>The medical card scheme together with full access at little or no cost to public hospital services for all those entitled to avail of health services in Ireland are calculated to ensure that cost is not an issue with regard to health particularly for older people and those least well off. However, the principle that those who can make a contribution to health service costs should do so has been accepted by successive Governments over a long period to help maximise the availability of publicly funded health services.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 146 and 176 together.</P>
      <P>I am fully committed to supporting and maintaining the operation of our voluntary private health insurance market on the principles of community rating, open enrolment and lifetime cover. I am further committed to making regulatory provision for a scheme of risk equalisation as a necessary support to community rating going forward.</P>
      <P>The current position is that my Department has completed the preparation of a draft scheme to be submitted for approval by each House of the Oireachtas at an early date. In advance of this, arrangements are proceeding to introduce a short Bill that will make further provision relating to the Health Insurance Authority and to risk equalisation.</P>
      <P>As regards the view expressed concerning failure to utilise powers, I consider that view to be uninformed and incorrect. The Deputy will be aware that plans for the regulation of our health insurance market have been the subject of fundamental differences with BUPA and have attracted close interest on the part of the EU Commission.</P>
      <P>My Department has, at all times, kept the Commission advised of proposed regulatory arrangements. While the Commission has formally accepted, in principle, Ireland's entitlement to have specific legal provisions in the interest of the common good in voluntary health insurance, it has emphasised the need for proportionality in any measures that may be taken. Furthermore, ongoing representations and complaints by BUPA have caused the Commission to revisit the matter on a number of occasions, including quite recently.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The latest position is that, arising from BUPA's complaint, the EU's Competition Directorate General is currently considering a detailed submission made by my Department. This submission makes the case in relation to the necessity for risk equalisation in a market operated on the basis of community rating, open enrolment, and lifetime cover, and that it does not constitute State aid under EU competition rules. I anticipate that the outcome of the Directorate General's <Col N="183" /> current deliberations will be advised to my Department during March.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin):</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 151, 169 and 351 together.</P>
      <P>On 3 January 2002 the IBTS introduced an additional test for hepatitis B, called hepatitis B core antibody test, which detects hepatitis B at very low levels. This additional test allowed the IBTS to accept donations from donors who had jaundice before their 13th birthday and brought Ireland into line with practice throughout Europe and the USA. Up to this point any donor who presented with a history of jaundice had been deferred from donating indefinitely. After the introduction of this additional test the IBTS decided to write to all those donors on its donor database who had been deferred because of a history of jaundice in childhood. This necessitated a mailshot to 8,000 donors who had been deferred for jaundice.</P>
      <P>Each donor was sent an explanatory letter outlining the rationale behind the introduction of the test and attached to the letter was a questionnaire seeking additional information concerning the clinical details of his-her jaundice and his-her current state of health so that this could be reviewed to decide if that particular donor was now eligible to donate. It should be stressed that the letter was in no way an invitation to donate, rather it was informing donors of the change to IBTS guidelines and of the possibility that they could be re-instated onto the IBTS active donor panel.</P>
      <P>The letter stated, <i>inter alia:</i></P>
      <P>
        <i>
        </i>We have reviewed our records and note that you informed us that you had jaundice in the past. We would be most grateful if you would complete the enclosed questionnaire so that we can advise you if you are eligible to donate. Please do not come to your local blood clinic with this questionnaire as you will not be able to donate until we have reviewed your questionnaire and amended your donor record if appropriate. We will write to you and let you know if you are eligible to donate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As can be seen clearly from this excerpt the letter to the donors was eliciting further information about the clinical details of their jaundice and their current state of health and it was not an invitation to donate, nor could the donor donate on <Col N="185" /> presentation of the letter or questionnaire at their local clinic. Therefore, as the letter was requesting further medical information there was no danger to the blood supply as the recipients of the letter could not have donated without further medical assessment.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately, two donors who were hepatitis C positive received these letters. This had not been intended &ndash; these two donors had been included in the file of donors with a history of jaundice in addition to being on file as hepatitis C positive. The IBTS had not picked up this discrepancy when checking their file of 8,000 donors with a history of jaundice. The IBTS apologised for this error and any hurt this may have caused. When this error came to light the IBTS amended its coding system so that in future donors who were hepatitis C positive would be deferred with a code that is used exclusively for this purpose.</P>
    <P>In 2002 there was an 8.6% increase in donations over 2001. This resulted in an uninterrupted supply to hospitals for elective surgery, treatment of patients with cancer and trauma etc. This change to the guidelines and other initiatives has enabled the IBTS to recruit donors who would previously have been ineligible to donate and has facilitated the IBTS in responding to the emerging threat of variant CJD.</P>
    <P>The IBTS has in place a number of checks to ensure that people with hepatitis C do not donate blood. This includes a detailed questionnaire which must be filled in by potential donors and a PCR test, which is the most sensitive test available for detecting hepatitis C, which is carried out on all blood samples donated. In addition, the IBTS has widely distributed an information leaflet, particularly aimed at people with hepatitis C and their families entitled Eligibility to Donate Blood.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin):</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 152 and 342 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The use of fluoride technology is known to <Col N="186" /> manifest a positive oral health outcome. Local and national surveys and studies conducted since the introduction of fluoridation in this country attest to the reduced dental decay levels of children and teenagers in fluoridated areas compared to those residing in non-fluoridated areas. The safety and effectiveness of water fluoridation has been endorsed by a number of international and reputable bodies such as the World Health Organisation, the Centre for Disease Control and Prevention, the United States Public Health Service and the United States Surgeon General.</P>
    <P>Despite these endorsements, I decided to establish the Forum on Fluoridation to review the fluoridation of public piped water supplies in Ireland. The forum's report was recently launched and its main conclusion was that the fluoridation of public piped water supplies should continue as a public health measure.</P>
    <P>The forum consisted of people with expert knowledge spanning the areas of public health, biochemistry, dental health, bone health, food safety, environmental protection, ethics, water quality, health promotion and representatives from the consumer and environmental areas. This diversity of professional backgrounds and representation was reflected in the comprehensive way the forum conducted its work and research.</P>
    <P>The forum also concluded that: water fluoridation has been very effective in improving the oral health of the Irish population, especially of children, but also of adults and the elderly; the best available and most reliable scientific evidence indicates that at the maximum permitted level of fluoride in drinking water at one part per million, human health is not adversely affected; and dental fluorosis, a form of discolouration of the tooth enamel, is a well-recognised condition and an indicator of overall fluoride absorption, whether from natural sources, fluoridated water or from the inappropriate use of fluoride toothpaste at a young age. There is evidence that the prevalence of dental fluorosis is increasing in Ireland.</P>
    <P>The forum took an evidence based approach to its examination of water fluoridation. After examining the question of fluoride and bone health, the forum reported that epidemiological studies have shown that long-term exposure to fluoride does not adversely affect bone strength, bone mineral density or the incidence of fractures.</P>
    <P>The report of the fluoridation forum made 33 recommendations covering a broad range of topics such as research, public awareness, and policy and technical aspects of fluoridation. Following publication of the report, I have asked my Department to establish an expert body as recommended by the forum. This expert body will oversee the implementation of the wide-ranging recommendations of the forum and advise me on all aspects of fluoride going forward. In particular, ongoing research related to fluoride will continue to be evaluated by the expert body and expanded to deal with new emerging issues.</P>

      <P>The White Paper on Private Health Insurance set out the Government's proposals regarding the corporate status of the Voluntary Health Insurance board. This provided for the establishment of the VHI as a company under the Companies Acts, with full commercial freedom of operation, in the ownership of the Minister for Finance. The possibility of third party investment and eventual full sale of the State's interest in VHI, if deemed desirable by the Government, were also addressed in the White Paper.</P>
      <P>Further to the White Paper, corporate financial and legal advisers were engaged to examine the strategic options for the VHI and they have reported. The advices provided by the consultants are currently under consideration in my Department. The VHI board has indicated that, in principle, it favours being privatised and this has been noted in the context of the consideration to be given to VHI's future.</P>
      <P>Ultimately, proposals by the Government for a change in VHI's corporate status will require legislation and will therefore arise for consideration and discussion in the Houses of the Oireachtas.</P>

The group has conducted a national assessment of needs for radiotherapy services having regard to the demography and epidemiology of cancer and the gaps in current service provision.</P>
      <P>The group's report will address the following key issues: access to radiotherapy services in terms of information, financial access and organisational components of access; the need to provide a high quality, evidence based service; the need to take account of current and new developments in health technology; the requirements of the system in terms of human resources; international norms in relation to service provision, planning and staffing; and the organisational development of the services in terms of structures and processes which need to be place in a radiotherapy facility.</P>
      <P>I understand that the work of the expert review group on radiotherapy services is at the final editing stage and will be submitted to me shortly. All health boards have been afforded the opportunity to meet with and make submissions to the group. The provision of additional radiotherapy services will be considered in the context of the report of the expert working group. Following consideration of the report, I will submit proposals for consideration by Government.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin):</NameTxt>
      <P>My Department collects information on bed closures in acute hospitals from the health agencies on a quarterly basis. The most recent complete figures available to my Department relate to the first nine months of 2002. This data shows that in the region of 3,200 bed days were lost due to isolation measures being implemented in acute hospitals mainly as a result of the winter vomiting virus. This figure represents approximately 0.1% of the overall bed days available for the first nine months of the year.</P>
      <P>The small round structured virus, SRSV, more commonly known as the winter vomiting bug, is a form of gastro-enteritis. It is highly infectious and can spread from person to person hence it is difficult to contain and is spread extremely quickly, especially in institutions. The virus infection is essentially a community infection, which becomes concentrated in health facilities. Outbreaks of illness due to the virus have become part of the winter landscape of European hospitals. About 40% of the virus outbreaks occurred in healthcare settings in Ireland in 2002.</P>
      <P>Where outbreaks have occurred, hospitals have put full infection control measures in place in line with best practice guidelines. In an effort to prevent further outbreaks health boards are appealing to members of the public who have symptoms of vomiting or diarrhoea not to visit hospitals or nursing homes, and particularly accident and emergency departments, for 72 hours after their symptoms have stopped. There have also been outbreaks of the virus in other health facilities such as nursing homes and crèche facilities.</P>
      <P>The National Disease Surveillance Centre has issued guidelines for institutions relating to hygiene and infection control. An expert group, the national viral gastro-enteritis committee, has been established to deal with the practical aspects relevant to the management of outbreaks of this infection and to develop interim guidelines relating to the rapid diagnosis and management of outbreaks. These guidelines are expected to be available shortly.</P>

It has also examined existing levels of service provision for those affected by cerebral damage. The group has had a presentation made to it by parents of children affected by cerebral damage on the day-to-day implications of providing care for them at home. Most recently it has examined prevention strategies and the effect of reforms introduced in the United Kingdom on the handling of claims for compensation for injuries resulting from the provision of clinical care. I hope that the group will be in a position to present its final report in the middle of 2003.</P>

      <P>As the Deputy may be aware there is a commitment in the national health strategy to provide 1,370 additional assessment and rehabilitation beds, plus 600 additional day hospital beds with facilities encompassing specialist areas such as falls, osteoporosis treatment, fracture prevention, Parkinson's disease, stroke prevention, heart failure and continence promotion clinics. In addition, the strategy proposed the provision of an extra 800 extended care-community nursing unit places per year over a seven year period which will include provision for people with dementia.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy may also be aware, public private partnerships, PPPs, are currently being piloted in the health sector. PPP is based on the concept that better value for money for the Exchequer may be achieved through the exploitation of private sector competencies to capture innovation and the allocation of risk to the party best able to manage it. Initially, the focus will be mainly in the area of community nursing units, CNUs, for older people. It is anticipated that 17 new CNUs will be created when the initial pilot programmes are complete, providing up to a maximum of 850 new beds in Dublin and Cork. The services offered in these units will include: assessment-rehabilitation; respite; extended care; convalescence and, if the PPP pilot demonstrates success, it is the intention to use it as a means of providing additional community nursing units in other locations throughout the country.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 174 and 436 to 440, inclusive, together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The development of services for the management and treatment of attention deficit disorder-attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, ADD-<Col N="195" /> ADHD, was considered by the working group on child and adolescent psychiatric services established by the Department of Health and Children in June 2000. In its report, presented in March 2001, the working group stated that the prevalence of ADD-ADHD in Ireland can be estimated at somewhere between 1% and 5% of school age children, that is, aged five to 15 years, which is in line with the research findings in other European countries. The group recommended the enhancement and expansion of the overall child and adolescent psychiatric service as the most effective means of providing the required service for children with this condition.</P>
    <P>All aspects of the presentation, diagnosis, treatment and management of children suffering from ADD-ADHD were considered by the working group in the course of its deliberations. In its report, the different components of treatment required were set out and the importance of adequate linkages with other services, such as the education services and the community health services, were emphasised.</P>
    <P>The working group found that the internationally acknowledged best practice for the provision of child and adolescent psychiatric services is through the multi-disciplinary team. It noted that many of the child and adolescent psychiatric teams currently in place throughout the country do not have the full complement of team members required and it recommended that priority should be given, in the first instance, to the recruitment of the required expertise for the completion of existing teams.</P>
    <P>In 2002, additional revenue funding of &euro;6.061 million was allocated to provide for the appointment of additional consultants, for the enhancement of existing consultant-led multi-disciplinary teams and towards the establishment of further teams. A further &euro;1.64 million was allocated in 2003. Each health board now has funding for a minimum of three consultant-led child and adolescent multi-disciplinary teams.</P>
    <P>The Health Strategy Quality and Fairness &ndash; A Health System For You includes a commitment to the implementation of the recommendations of the working group's report. Funding was made available by my Department in 2000 to ADD-ADHD parent support groups through the national lottery and other sources. I am not aware of any plans to develop an information website in this area.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children (Mr. Callely):</NameTxt>
      <P>The provision of health-related services for older people and for those with disabilities is a matter, in the first instance, for the Eastern Regional Health Authority and the health boards. My Department has, since 1997, allocated significant levels of funding to services for older people and across the disability sector, resulting in substantial advances in the quality and quantity of the health-related services being provided.</P>
      <P>Additional funding of &euro;27 million has been allocated to services for persons with disabilities, in 2003, to meet the full year costs of 2002 developments and to enhance further the services in the sector. This funding is in addition to the very significant revenue investment, amounting to &euro;288 million which has been made in these services in recent years and which is built into the ongoing budget base. Approximately &euro;100 million in additional ongoing revenue has been provided with regard to the maintenance and development of services to people with physical and sensory disabilities. Such services include, residential, respite, home support services which includes personal assistance services, therapy services and day care services. A significant proportion of this funding, over &euro;20 million, has been provided specifically for home support services. A further &euro;81 million has been provided in once-off grants for capital projects and issues such as the provision of technical aids and appliances.</P>
      <P>In the case of older people, from, and including, the year 2000, approximately &euro;230 million of additional funding has been provided to the health boards for a range of services for older people, including the home help service, community support structures, and the support of carers' support for the Alzheimer Society of Ireland and various voluntary groups, improvement in staff ratios, and improvements to the nursing home subvention scheme.</P>
      <P>Although the Deputy does not specifically mention the North Eastern Health Board, I will set out some details of additional funding allocated to this board. In relation to services for older people, over &euro;12 million additional funding has been supplied in the years 2000-03 to the board to cover a range of services.</P>
      <P>In relation to services to people with a disability, between 2000 and 2003, inclusive, additional ongoing revenue funding of almost &euro;17 million has been provided to the North Eastern Health Board for the provision of health related services for people with disabilities and those with autism.</P>
      <P>I understand that the North Eastern Health Board is undertaking a review in relation to the prioritisation of hours available for home help services and, in tandem, the development of agreed criteria with the intention of ensuring that priority is given to the most vulnerable groups, people with disabilities and older people.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TimOMalleyPD" hpid="Mr. T. O'Malley Mr. T. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children (Mr. T. O'Malley):</NameTxt>
      <P>The overall economic position in 2003 has had implications for all aspects of public investment, and this is reflected in the Estimates and budget adopted by the Government for 2003. Within this overall framework, however, some two thirds of the additional funding available for non-capital investment in services has been allocated to the health services. This funding is being applied largely to maintaining existing levels of service across all service programmes including services for people with an intellectual disability.</P>
      <P>Between 1997 and 2002, an extra &euro;188 million revenue and &euro;139 million capital funding has been provided, making a total additional investment of &euro;327 million for the maintenance and development of services to persons with an intellectual disability and those with autism. In the current year, further additional funding of &euro;13.3 million has been allocated to services for persons with an intellectual disability or autism to meet the full year cost of the 2002 developments and to further enhance the health related support services to children with an intellectual disability or autism. This funding brings the total extra investment in these services to &euro;340 million over seven years. Of this total amount, over &euro;200 million has been built into the ongoing budget base.</P>
      <P>This funding has brought about very significant and unprecedented developments in the services. Between 1997 and 2002, around 1,700 extra residential places have been provided, with most of these based in the community. This figure includes new residential respite places which were developed in 1997 and 1998. Between 1999 and 2002, about 465 dedicated respite places were also provided. In addition, the period from 1997 to 2002 saw the provision of around 2,950 new day places.</P>
      <P>Despite this very significant investment, demographic factors are contributing to growing waiting lists for residential services in particular, even though the number of people in receipt of services, including full-time residential services, continues to increase. The increased birth rate in the 1960s and 1970s has resulted in large numbers of adults in their late 20s and early 30s requiring full-time residential services. In addition, people with an intellectual disability are living longer than previously, adding to the need for services compared to previous generations. This has also been the international experience in service provision to this population.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="198" /> While it is regrettable that the level of investment in these services achieved in recent years could not be maintained in 2003, my Department will work closely with the health boards and other service providers in relation to service provision this year.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 178, 362 and 404 together.</P>
      <P>The predominance of drug treatment in the mental health services was first highlighted by the Inspector of Mental Hospitals in his Annual Report for 2000, when he commented that it was often the only form of treatment available. There is an increasing desire among professionals and patients alike that supportive and complementary treatments such as psychotherapy should be more widely available. Supportive and general psychotherapeutic skills are now taught in post-graduate psychiatric medical training. Many psychiatric nurses are also trained in various forms of counselling and use these skills in their work with patients.</P>
      <P>While traditionally the provision of care was dominated by the doctor-nurse model, it has been recognised for some time that other skills such as those of psychologists, social workers, occupational therapists etc. are a necessary component of service delivery and that, without them, adequate treatment and management in the broader sense is difficult. Service providers aim to provide mental health services through consultant-led multi-disciplinary teams. However, significant recruitment difficulties exist in relation to the paramedical professions at present. Measures are being taken to recruit such staff from outside the mental health services and to increase the number of training places available.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="199" /> The right to care and treatment in the least restrictive setting is one of the principles of mental health care delivery, as outlined in the Guidelines on Good Practice and Quality Assurance in Mental Health Services, published by my Department in 1998.</P>

    <P>Uptake, particularly in relation to MMR, falls short of the national target of 95%. I am concerned about the unsatisfactory immunisation uptake rates in childhood immunisations because of the risk of un-immunised children contracting the potentially serious diseases concerned. The outbreak of measles in 2000, which resulted in three deaths and approximately 2,000 cases, is evidence of the consequences of insufficient immunisation uptake.</P>
    <P>The health board chief executive officers established a national immunisation steering committee to address a wide range of issues relating to the childhood and other immunisation programmes including the identification of issues that are hampering the achievement of uptake targets. The steering committee was assisted by four working groups, which examined the following areas in relation to immunisation: (a) communication, (b) material management, (c) IT systems and (d) planning and organisation.</P>
    <P>I launched the report of the steering committee on 22 April 2002. This report is the first step towards improving immunisation uptake and also enhancing and developing the key systems which underpin the immunisation programmes. In July 2003, a national immunisation implementation group was established and is responsible for co-ordinating the planning and implementation of immunisation programmes in order to improve uptake. This group reports to the national steering committee. Some &euro;2.116 million is being made available at national level in 2003 in respect of specific projects and measures which are being designed to improve immunisation uptake particularly in areas of low uptake. Health boards were requested to submit proposed projects-measures to the national immunisation implementation group by the end of January 2003. The chief executive officers are currently considering the proposals and will shortly submit them to my Department.</P>
    <P>Based on information available from the National Disease Surveillance Centre there has been a significant increase in recent weeks in the number of reported measles cases. In the first four weeks of 2003, 96 cases have been reported compared with ten cases in the same period in 2002. Specific outbreak management measures have been put in place in the two regions concerned &ndash; the Eastern Regional Health Authority and the Midland Health Board. In addition, chief executive officers in all health boards and the ERHA have been asked to ensure that specific immunisation measures are prioritised in all regions in order to prevent a serious outbreak.</P>
    <P>On a positive note, since the introduction of the national immunisation programme against group C meningococcal disease in October 2000 there has been a dramatic reduction in this disease in Ireland. The aim of this programme was to immunise all children and young people up to the age of 22 against the disease. Data provided by the NDSC indicates that in 2002, 14 cases of group C disease were notified compared to 139 cases in 2000, a reduction of 90%. The most dramatic reductions were seen in the age groups targeted by the meningitis C vaccine, ranging from a 100% reduction in five to nine year olds to an 86% reduction in the one to four years age group. This represents a very significant reduction and highlights the importance and success of the campaign.</P>
    <P>There is concern among some parents in relation to the measles, mumps and rubella, MMR, vaccine. Negative coverage on this issue has added to the confusion of parents in deciding whether or not to vaccinate their children. In April 2002, I launched the MMR vaccine discussion pack, An Information Guide for Health Professionals and Parents. The pack was produced by the NDSC and the department of public health, Southern Health Board, and was published by the Health Boards Executive on behalf of the health boards. The pack sets out the facts in relation to the most common concerns about MMR in a way that will help health professionals and parents to explore these concerns together, <Col N="201" /> review the evidence in relation to MMR and provide the basis for making an informed decision. The information is presented in such a way as to allow full discussion between health professionals and parents on each issue. The pack also contains an information leaflet for parents. The layout of the pack is in question and answer format and addresses such issues as the alleged link between MMR and autism and Crohn's disease, the safety and side effects of the vaccine, the purpose of a second dose of vaccine, combined vaccine versus single doses and contraindications to the vaccine. The pack will be of great assistance to health professionals and will enable them to respond to the very real concerns of parents.</P>
    <P>I would like to take this opportunity to again urge all parents to have their children immunised against the diseases covered by the childhood immunisation programme in order to ensure that both their children and the population generally have maximum protection against the diseases concerned. This is particularly important at present in light of the increase in reported measles cases.</P>

      <P>A prohibition on smoking in all places of work, including licensed premises, is being introduced from 1 January 2004. This prohibition is based on recommendations contained in the &ldquo;Report on the Health Effects of Environmental Tobacco Smoke, ETS, in the Workplace&rdquo; prepared by an independent scientific working group commissioned by the Office of Tobacco Control and the Health and Safety Authority which was published on 30 January 2003.</P>
      <P>The primary purpose of the prohibition is to protect the health and safety of workers and the public from toxic environmental tobacco smoke. The owner, occupier or person in charge of a licensed premises is legally responsible for ensuring compliance with health and safety requirements as well as a range of other legislation relating, for example, to fire safety, food hygiene and the control of the sale of alcohol and tobacco products to underage persons.</P>
      <P>I expect that the vast majority of customers will comply with the new health and safety measures when introduced. Monitoring of the levels of compliance can be carried out by authorised officers from the Health and Safety Authority, the Office of Tobacco Control and the health boards.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin):</NameTxt>
      <P>The provision of orthodontic services is a matter for the health boards in the first instance. I am pleased to advise the Deputy that I have taken a number of measures to improve orthodontic services in the North Western Health Board, NWHB, area and on a national basis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The grade of specialist in orthodontics has been created in the health board orthodontic service. This year, my Department and the health boards are funding 13 dentists from various health boards &ndash; including one from the NWHB &ndash; for specialist in orthodontics qualifications at training programmes in Ireland and at two separate universities in the United Kingdom. These 13 trainees for the public orthodontic service are additional to the six dentists who commenced their training last year and one dentist whose specialist training is nearing completion. Thus, there is an aggregate of 20 dentists in specialist training for orthodontics. Additional funding of &euro;0.640 million and &euro;0.894 million was provided <Col N="203" /> for these training programmes in 2002 and 2003 respectively. These measures will complement the other structural changes being introduced into the orthodontic service, including the creation of an auxiliary grade of orthodontic therapist to work in the orthodontic area.</P>
    <P>In the short term, I have funded an orthodontic initiative to ease current pressures on the system. Additional funding of &euro;6.729 million was approved for orthodontic services in 2001 of which &euro;4.698 million was to fund an initiative on orthodontic waiting lists. This is enabling health boards to recruit additional staff and engage the services of private specialist orthodontic practitioners to treat patients. The NWHB was allocated an additional &euro;0.273 million in 2001 for orthodontic services of which &euro;0.178 million was for the orthodontic initiative. This enabled the board to, amongst other things, recruit an additional two orthodontic specialists. Furthermore, the chief executive officer of the NWHB has informed me that the board is currently developing the infrastructure of its orthodontic service.</P>
    <P>Last June, my Department provided additional funding of &euro;5 million from the treatment purchase fund to health boards specifically for the purchase of orthodontic treatment. This funding is enabling boards to provide both additional sessions for existing staff and purchase treatment from private specialist orthodontic practitioners. The NWHB was allocated an additional &euro;0.285 million from this fund for the treatment of cases in this way. This scheme has also enabled the board to make arrangements for the treatment of cases by private specialist orthodontic practitioners from Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>The number of cases on orthodontic waiting lists by county is not routinely collected by my Department. Therefore, the chief executive officer of the NWHB has been requested to provide the information requested directly to the Deputy.</P>
    <P>The chief executive officer of the NWHB has informed me that at the end of the September 2002 quarter, there were 2,508 patients receiving orthodontic treatment in the board's area. This is an increase of approximately 409 patients in orthodontic treatment when compared with the number of patients receiving treatment in December 2001. I expect that the number of patients receiving orthodontic treatment in the public orthodontic service will continue to increase as the measures that I have taken impact further on the service.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin):</NameTxt>
      <P>The report of the chief medical officer for 2001 acknowledges that there has been significant development in the infrastructure of cancer services in recent years and that much has been done in tackling issues such as regional variations in service provision. Since the implementation of the national cancer strategy commenced in 1997, there has been a cumulative investment of approximately &euro;400 million in the development of appropriate treatment and care services for people with cancer. Cancer services throughout the country have benefited from this investment which far exceeds the £25 million requirement which was initially envisaged under the national cancer strategy. Amongst a range of other initiatives, this investment has enabled the funding of 80 additional consultant posts in key areas such as medical oncology, radiology, symptomatic breast disease, palliative care, histopathology and haematology, together with support staff.</P>
      <P>This year a total of &euro;29 million was provided to ensure that we continue to address increasing demands in cancer services throughout the country in such areas as oncology-haematology services, oncology drug treatments and symptomatic breast disease services.</P>
      <P>I accept that further development in cancer services are required. Cancer remains a very significant public health priority. It accounts for 25% of all deaths and one in three will develop cancer in their lifetime. The ageing of the population means that we are going to see more and more people with cancer presenting for treatment into the health services. For these reasons, we need to continue to develop and improve our services to ensure that those with cancer get high quality, effective and evidence based care.</P>
      <P>In recognition of the need to further develop cancer services, the national health strategy identified the need for the preparation of a new national cancer strategy. The National Cancer Strategy 2003 is being developed by the National Cancer Forum in conjunction with the Department of Health and Children. This strategy will build on the progress that has been made during the implementation of the first national cancer strategy and set out the key investment areas to be targeted for the development of cancer services over the coming years and will make recommendations in relation to the organisation and structure of cancer services nationally.</P>

      <Quest>the steps he proposes to take to reduce heart disease among manual workers in view of the findings of the recent report of his Department's chief medical officer that such workers are three times more likely to die from this condition than professionals; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin):</NameTxt>
      <P>Mortality rates for heart disease are substantially higher for the Irish population than the European Union average. In Ireland it is also clear that the burden of morbidity and mortality of cardiovascular diseases is unevenly distributed within our population. It is a fact that those whose level of economic prosperity is less than that of the wider community in which they live, suffer disproportionately in relation to cardiovascular disease and early death when compared to the community as a whole and, in particular, to those sections of the community who enjoy greater economic prosperity.</P>
      <P>In order to address the prevalence of cardiovascular disease in Ireland the Government endorsed the Cardiovascular Health Strategy &ndash; Building Healthier Hearts, in 1999. The strategy contains 211 evidence-based recommendations. Its overall aims are to: reduce the risk factor profile in the general population; detect those at high risk; deal effectively with those who have clinical disease; and ensure the best survival and quality of life outcome for those who recover from an acute attack.</P>
      <P>I have allocated &euro;54 million to date to the implementation of this strategy and significant progress has been achieved across a wide spectrum of services including health promotion, primary care, pre-hospital care, hospital services and cardiac rehabilitation. In total, 800 professional staff have been recruited directly through the cardiovascular health strategy.</P>
      <P>The heart health task force is currently finalising a report on progress, achievements and benefits to date arising from this implementation process and I expect to launch the report in March 2003.</P>
      <P>Tackling cardiovascular health inequality requires a societal approach, recognising that health services provide only one element within a broader context. The implementation of the national health promotion strategy 2000-2005 as well as the cardiovascular health strategy address the determinants of cardiovascular health through intersectoral collaboration. The target group for all cardiovascular health inequality actions are those in society most at risk of cardiovascular disease.</P>

      <P>The funding allocated by Government to the health services in 2003 is designed to maintain the existing level of service in overall terms. The economic outlook for 2003 is reflected in the approach taken by the Government to spending Estimates and the budget. Of the overall level of investment in public services in 2003, some two thirds has been allocated to the health services.</P>
      <P>Service plans have been prepared by each health board and the ERHA on the basis of the letter of determination issued by my Department. Discussions with each agency on their service plan have just concluded and the focus within each board and the ERHA is now on actioning the various measures proposed and on managing activity, employment and finances over the course of the year.</P>
      <P>While the measures proposed in each case vary from agency to agency on the basis of local needs and priorities, the overall pattern is one of consolidation in 2003, following a number of years of rapid expansion and development of services.</P>
      <P>Overall, the aim is to maintain service levels at their approved level for 2002. While some service plans do propose adjustments in relation to the overall volume of employment, these are generally concerned with better management of leave and locum arrangements and absenteeism levels, reducing the reliance on agency staffing in particular. While more efficient management of leave arrangements over the summer period may lead to some bed closures, it is also the case that some 200 additional beds will be commissioned and brought into operation during 2003.</P>
      <P>My Department will continue to work with the boards and ERHA in monitoring the overall position during the year.</P>

    <P>My Department is acutely aware that there are serious short comings in the present range of services available for this care group in a number of health board areas. In accordance with the action plan set out in the health strategy, Quality and Fairness &ndash; A Health System For You, this is one of the issues to be pursued in the planning of infrastructure development in the health system.</P>
    <P>The Eastern Regional Health Authority has dedicated units for the treatment of young chronic sick, YCS, clients in the Royal Hospital Donnybrook and Peamount Hospital. Most health boards do not, however, have dedicated units for YCS and YCS are accommodated in acute hospitals, district hospitals, nursing homes for the elderly and their own homes. Placements in acute hospitals are inappropriate as they block beds needed for the waiting list initiative and nursing homes for the elderly are inappropriate for younger YCS clients.</P>
    <P>A number of health boards are examining the possibility of developing residential units for YCS, either by the health board itself or in partnership with voluntary agencies such as the Cheshire Foundation of Ireland.</P>
    <P>My Department understands that the Eastern Regional Health Authority recently completed a review of services for young chronic sick in conjunction with the three area health boards and the voluntary agencies and its findings are currently being circulated. A copy will be forwarded to the Deputy as soon as possible. The review makes recommendations around developing, enhancing and augmenting the services for young chronic disabled clients, including proposals for the development of a range of appropriate accommodation options and associated care and support, tailored to meet their needs. This action is aimed at maintaining disabled persons in the community as well as the creation of new places for the young chronic sick.</P>

      <P>I am very much aware of the high cost of insurance in the State and I am concerned about the difficulties this is causing for many people including young drivers. On 25 October last, I announced my programme for fundamental insurance reform. The programme reflects the commitments given in An Agreed Programme for Government and comprises a comprehensive set of inter-related measures designed to improve the functioning of the Irish insurance market. The key measures include: establishment of a ministerial committee, chaired by myself, to oversee implementation of the reform programme, including the 67 recommendations in the Motor Insurance Advisory Board, MIAB, report; publication of the action plan to give effect to the MIAB recommendations within a target timeframe; establishment of the Personal Injuries Assessment Board, PIAB, on an interim basis, pending preparation of the necessary legislation to put the PIAB on a statutory footing; and publication of the report of the Implementation Group on the PIAB.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="209" /> While EU law precludes the imposition of price controls on insurance, I have made it clear that I expect a <i>quid pro quo </i>from the industry in response to my reform programme.</P>

      <P>The employees of the company to which the Deputy refers were paid their full statutory redundancy lump sum entitlements by my Department from the social insurance fund in 2001 shortly after being made redundant.</P>
      <P>The proposed higher levels of statutory redundancy payments are subject to ratification by the social partners. It is my firm intention to bring these proposed statutory redundancy lump sum and rebate payments into effect at the earliest possible date, in anticipation of a favourable outcome to the ratification process.</P>
      <P>The problems facing the workers of the company in question concern a dispute between the employees and the company regarding <i>ex gratia </i>redundancy payments in excess of the statutory entitlements. This has been the subject of a Labour Court recommendation, with both sides of the dispute having been heard. I understand that the company has not paid the <i>ex gratia </i>amounts recommended by the Labour Court. While the court's recommendations are not binding on the parties concerned, the parties are expected to give them serious consideration, setting out as they do the court's opinion on the dispute and the terms on which it believes the dispute should be settled.</P>

    <P>Several of the recommendations in the report from the motor insurance advisory board, MIAB, relate to equal status, whether in the general context of compliance with the Equal Status Act 2000, or in a more specifically targeted sense, in terms of, for instance, the prohibition on discriminatory action in relation to age. As a core function of the Equality Authority is the elimination of prohibited discrimination in the areas covered by the Equal Status Act 2000, the MIAB report was referred to the authority for appropriate action.</P>

In the case of a person who has been refused motor insurance by the insurance industry, or received a quotation that is tantamount to refusal he or she may refer their case to the declined cases committee, which was established to assist individuals who are unable to obtain motor insurance cover. The committee is comprised of representatives from authorised motor insurance companies under the chairmanship of the Irish Insurance Federation. The federation would be the source of further information on this matter.</P>

      <askee>Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment</askee>
      <Quest> if her attention has been drawn to the fact that only 7.4% of jobs supported by the IDA were located in the south-east region in 2001 while 10.8% of the national population resides in the region, according to the 2002 census (details supplied); her plans to rectify this anomaly; and if she will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>
      <QRef>[3704/03]</QRef>
    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Ms Harney Ms Harney">
      <NameTxt>Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Ms Harney):</NameTxt>
      <P>IDA is actively marketing the region and its strengths to potential overseas investors through its network of overseas offices. The south-east region recorded a 3% increase in IDA supported employment in 2002 compared to a drop of 2.2% nationwide. This is an extremely good result for the region when one takes into account that 2002 was a difficult year for IDA, given the downturn in the technology sector and the after effects of 11 September that year.</P>
      <P>While the performance of individual regions and areas will vary from year to year versus the national success in attracting foreign direct investment, total employment in IDA supported companies in the south-east has increased by 10.4% for the period 1999 to 2002. In this period ten new projects have been announced that have a potential for 1877 extra jobs, of which 802 have already come on stream, 43% of jobs. The remainder will be rolled out over the next three years. I am pleased that the south-east has been successful in attracting a number of modern industries to the region. The most notable have been Genzyme with its biotechnology facility in Waterford, Alza-Johnson &amp; Johnson, a pharmaceutical project in Cashel, as well as PFPC in Wexford and Deutsche Bank in Kilkenny. These companies are excellent reference sellers for IDA in attracting further overseas investment to the south-east. In addition to these new investments there has been a number of notable expansions in the region from companies such as Guidant, AOL, Sunlife and Lake Region.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I might mention that IDA strategy in the south-east includes working closely with existing clients in the regions to develop their mandate in Ireland and to win more value-added activities from their parent corporations. An example of this is the research and development activity carried out in 2002 by Bausch &amp; Lomb, on the development of a drug delivery system called Envision TD, which will help cure blinding back of the eye illness and which resulted in the creation of 30 quality research jobs in the company. Other policies pursued by IDA in the south-east include working closely with third level institutions in the region to increase both the quality and quantity of graduates being produced and participating in all the county development boards as well as other fora to agree and implement actions that further enhance the region's attractiveness to investors by providing some distinct competitive advantages. In this regard the recent announcement that Waterford Institute of Technology has been awarded a significant grant by Science Found<Col N="215" /> ation Ireland to establish a national telecommunications software centre on WIT campus is most welcomed by IDA.</P>
    <P>Providing the right property solution is a critical ingredient in successfully attracting overseas industry. In this regard IDA has been very active with the development of its new Waterford business and technology park on 70 acres. The first 30,000 sq.ft high quality building is now completed and a further 20,000 sq.ft building is currently at the planning stage. Other IDA activity in the south-east that I might mention includes a new 70 acre business and technology park in Carlow, the upgrading of IDA's 65 acre business and technology park in Wexford plus two recently completed buildings on IDA lands in New Ross and Enniscorthy; the 50 acre business and technology park in Kilkenny will see the construction of a new high quality building and a new 30 acre site in the IDA business park in Dungarvan is due to be developed by the summer 2003.</P>
    <P>IDA has selected Waterford as one of its three strategic locations nationally by adding extra resources to the south-east. In the past year IDA moved part of its ICT and engineering division to its regional office in Waterford, which will help to increase the profile of the region with potential investors. Along with the existing regional staff the ICT and engineering division is now located at the business and technology park on the Cork Road, Waterford.</P>
    <P>I am confident that the measures I have outlined above, which have been adopted by IDA Ireland and which are essentially day to day operational matters for the agency and not matters in which I have a function, as well as the ongoing commitment of the Government to regional development, will continue to bring positive results to the south-east.</P>

      <AskConj>asked the </AskConj>
      <askee>Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment</askee>
      <Quest> the number of software and e-business companies who were taken to or referred to County Kerry by the IDA in 2002. </Quest>
      <QRef>[3766/03]</QRef>
    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Ms Harney Ms Harney">
      <NameTxt>Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Ms Harney):</NameTxt>
      <P>One software company which includes e-business visited Kerry in 2002. However it should be noted that 2002, with the downturn in the technology sector and the knock-on effects of 11 September was a particularly difficult year to attract this type of investment. Existing overseas investment in the software-e-business sector in Kerry include Fleet Street Travel which is located in Tralee, Actna Ireland which is located in Castleisland and Rosenbluth International which is located in Killarney. In terms of foreign direct investment Kerry has been traditionally best served by manufacturing, particularly in the engineering and consumer products sectors.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While responsibility for promoting and marketing individual areas and regions as potential <Col N="216" /> locations for overseas investment is a matter for IDA, ultimately decisions regarding locations for foreign direct investment, including what areas to visit as potential locations, are taken by the individual investors. One of the key initial requirements of such companies in determining where they will visit, and consequently where they will potentially locate, is high quality office accommodation located in a suitable environment, which is most often a business and technology park.</P>
    <P>In an effort to further enhance the attractiveness of Kerry as a location for this type of investment IDA has commenced site development works in 2002 on their Business &amp; Technology Park at Tiernaboul, Killarney, County Kerry. The site area totals 4.66 hectares, 12 acres approximately This site development work involves significant landscaping and site clearance work, all of which will result in the upgrading of the overall appeal of the location. The work undertaken will cost in the region of &euro;1 million. In addition the Kerry advance factory group has commenced building work on an advance unit, BES factory, on the estate. This 24,000 sq.ft advance technology building will be completed in mid-2003 and will then be available for IDA to market resulting in an alternative property solution to present investors.</P>
    <P>Tralee's Kerry technology park, located on an adjoining campus to the institute of technology, offers potential investors high quality office accommodation in a suitable environment for these sectors.</P>
    <P>While it is ultimately the client company who makes the decision where it will visit and locate, I am confident that once all of this work is completed Kerry should be in a position to compete more strongly for inward investment in the ICT, software and international services sectors.</P>

      <P>Recommendation No. 18 in the motor insurance advisory board, MIAB, report published last year, recommends that insurers desist from any practice of requiring collateral business to be placed with the company before a motor quotation is supplied and that this practice be reviewed by the Competition Authority should it persist.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the action plan drawn up by the high-level implementation group for the implementation of the MIAB recommendations, the action to be taken by the insurance industry, together with the target timescale, is as follows: collateral business as a precondition for motor quotes will not be <Col N="217" /> required as from 1 August 2002; in accordance with recommendation No. 18, the Competition Authority should be informed of cases where this practice still persists.</P>

      <NameTxt>Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Ms Harney):</NameTxt>
      <P>For the purposes of copyright, video recordings are categorised as films. The first ownership of copyright in films is normally vested in the producer of the film and in its director or, where such individuals act as producer and director in the course of employment, in their employer. Generally, from a copyright standpoint, authorisation is not required for the filming of a person. However, the making, distribution or making available of certain films may give rise to civil or criminal liability under other areas of the law dealing, for example, with privacy matters or the suppression of child pornography. The Copyright and Related Rights Act 2000 contains no specific disqualification of works in these categories from copyright protection, and since making or dealing in a film consisting, for example, of child pornography is clearly contrary to the criminal law, copyright protection of such works would appear to be of no value to its maker.</P>

      <P>The current age requirement governing general service enlistment in the Permanent Defence Force is set at over 17 years and under 25 years of age on the date of enlistment. These limits are determined on the basis that the essential functions of the Permanent Defence Force require that its members be composed of able-bodied personnel of an age group which is commensurate with the functional requirements of the organisation.</P>
      <P>In the context of the White Paper on Defence, the Government decided that an updated Defence Forces personnel management plan would be prepared, setting down policies and goals to ensure that personnel policies and practices keep pace with current best practice. In line with this requirement, a draft integrated personnel management system is under consideration by my Department's civil-military strategic management committee.</P>
      <P>The upper age limit for enlistment in the Permanent Defence Force is an issue which is being considered in the context of the integrated personnel management system.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 220 and 221 together.</P>
      <P>The Office of Public Works received the interim report, on possible flood alleviation measures on the River Tolka catchment in the County Meath area, earlier this month. Officials from the Office of Public Works have had meetings with Meath County Council in order to agree a programme of works which could be undertaken by the Office of Public Works on behalf of the County Council. Agreement has now been reached on a package of works which it is estimated will cost in the region of &euro;300,000. The Office of Public Works will be undertaking emergency works from next week in the form of maintenance cleaning of the channel to remove debris and accumulated silt. More detailed works, which involve the construction of walls and embankments and the underpinning of bridges, will form part of a public consultation procedure by Meath County Council as required by Part 8 of the Planning and Development Regulations.</P>
      <P>Not all of the recommendations contained in the interim report are being carried out at this time. Given the requirements for site investigations, detailed design of the works, public consultation and public procurement procedures, and environmental considerations it would take quite a considerable time to implement all the recommendations of the interim report. The concern of Meath County Council and Office of Public Works has been to devise a package of works which can be carried out before next winter and which will provide a substantial degree of protection should similar flood events recur. I am conscious also that the full report on the River Tolka catchment is due to be completed in May and will provide additional information on which decisions in relation to the entire Tolka catchment can be made.</P>
      <P>I hope to meet the Meath County Council representatives in the near future to discuss the matter.</P>

      <Quest>the reason a person who buys a residential site in a residential housing estate in order to build a residence for themselves would have to pay over ?6,000, that is, 6% of the residential site in stamp duty, when the person next door has to pay no stamp duty due to the fact that a developer is building the house next door as distinct from this individual who is struggling to build their own house; his views on whether this is direct discrimination against the person struggling to help themselves by building their own home; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy):</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 222 and 223 together.</P>
      <P>Stamp duty is paid on the transfer of land and other property. As in the case of a person buying a site for the purpose of building his or her home, a person who already owned a site would have faced a stamp duty liability if it was originally transferred to him or her by way of sale. Therefore the treatment in both cases is the same.</P>
      <P>If it is the Deputy's contention that such a person is discriminated against compared to a person buying a new house from a property developer, again this is not the case. The developer would, when purchasing the land upon which the house is built, have had a stamp duty liability, and as in the case of other costs, this could be expected to increase the selling price of the house accordingly. To create an exemption from stamp duty in the circumstances outlined by the Deputy would be to discriminate against those who are not in a position to build their own homes.</P>
      <P>As regards VAT, the sale of undeveloped land is not subject to VAT, while the sale of developed land is subject to VAT at 13.5%. Development in relation to land means the construction, demolition, extension, alteration or reconstruction of any building on the land or the carrying out of any engineering or other operation in, on, over or under the land to adapt it for materially altered use.</P>
      <P>It would be possible for an individual to purchase undeveloped land free of VAT and later develop it, and VAT at 13.5 % would only apply to the construction costs assuming such work was carried out by a contractor. If an individual constructed their own house, then VAT would apply on the materials at the relevant rate. The different VAT treatment of land arises from the fact that it is either developed or undeveloped. It would appear that in this case the purchaser has purchased developed land and that the sale of this land is correctly subject to VAT. There would be no legal basis for relieving the sale of developed land from VAT under either EU or national VAT law.</P>
      <P>Given the reasons I have outlined, I do not intend making any changes in this area.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy):</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 224, 225, 237 and 238 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is a fundamental requirement for the above relief that the applicant must meet the medical criteria specified in the regulations and be in possession of a primary medical certificate to that effect issued by the appropriate senior area medical officer, who is an official of the local health board. Where the issue of the required certificate <Col N="226" /> is refused this can be appealed to the disabled drivers medical board of appeal, an independent body whose decision is final.</P>
    <P>The Revenue Commissioners are unable to consider an application for the relief without the issue of a valid primary medical certificate.</P>
    <P>The word permanent in the disabled drivers and disabled passengers (tax concessions) scheme relates to disablement which is lasting or intended to last indefinitely. The medical criteria for the purposes of the tax concession under this scheme are set out in the disabled drivers and disabled passengers (tax concessions) regulations 1994. Six different types of disablement are listed under the regulations and a qualifying person must satisfy one or more of them. The six types of disablement are as follows: persons who are wholly or almost wholly without the use of both legs; persons who are wholly without the use of one leg and almost wholly without the use of the other leg such that the applicant is severely restricted as to movement of the lower limbs; persons without both hands or without both arms; persons without one or both legs; persons wholly or almost wholly without the use of both hands or arms and wholly or almost wholly without the use of one leg; persons having the medical condition of dwarfism and having serious difficulties of movement of the lower limbs.</P>
    <P>An interdepartmental group was set up in 1997 to review the disabled drivers and disabled passengers scheme. The group examined all aspects of the scheme, including the qualifying medical criteria.</P>
    <P>I have been informed there are up to 360,000 persons in Ireland who could be regarded as disabled to some degree or other. These include both persons with medical conditions other than those covered by the scheme, and those with medical conditions covered by the scheme. The substantial tax benefits of the disabled drivers and disabled passengers scheme make for considerable interest in and desire to be admitted to the scheme.</P>
    <P>The cost of reliefs excluding annual road tax costs is estimated to be in the region of &euro;34 million in 2002, as compared to &euro;5.1 million in 1994. I have received the report of the interdepartmental review group on the disabled drivers and disabled passengers (tax concessions) scheme and it is currently being considered. Any recommendations contained in this report in relation to the medical criteria and other conditions of the scheme will receive full consideration.</P>
    <P>No changes will be made to these regulations until this deliberative process is completed.</P>

      <Quest>the reason for the 18 month waiting list for appeals under the disabled drivers and disabled passengers regulations; his views on whether contributory factors are that he needs to extend the number of personnel serving on the medical board from three to at least nine as all three must be presently available at each appeal and the fact that the remuneration for a three hour appeal session is ?80 and does not give much encouragement to doctors to serve on the appeal board system; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <P>The disabled drivers medical board of appeal operates independently. However, I am informed that there is currently a backlog of appeals to be dealt with by the board. I understand that the length of time a person waits to be assessed by the board can vary from 12 to 18 months. This is an indication of the level of demand for tax relief under the scheme. In addition, the backlog seems to be exacerbated by the fact that many of those who appeal to the board are aware that they do not meet the medical criteria specified in the regulations but still insist on exercising their right of appeal.</P>
      <P>I received the report of the interdepartmental review group on the disabled drivers and disabled passengers (tax concessions) scheme. Any recommendations contained in this report in relation to the medical board of appeal receive full consideration.</P>

      <P>The Civil Service is an equal opportunity employer. The Civil Service Commissioners are responsible for the recruitment of civil servants. Recruitment to posts within the service is on the basis of qualifications and the ability to carry out the responsibilities of the grade or post. Any person who satisfies the stated eligibility requirements may apply for open recruitment positions in the Civil Service. These requirements are set out in the relevant statutory competition regulations.</P>
      <P>When considering an applicant's suitability for appointment to a post in the Civil Service, the Civil Service Commissioners are very conscious of their responsibilities and legal obligations. Having a criminal record need not necessarily prevent a person being appointed to a position in the Civil Service. Each such application is examined on a case by case basis. In addressing the issue of a criminal conviction, the commissioners would have regard to such matters as the nature and sensitivity of the post being filled, the classification of the offence, the sentence passed or served, the elapsed time since completion of the sentence and whether the person has re-offended in the interim period.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="228" /> If the Commissioners take a decision to proceed with the appointment of a person with a criminal conviction, no background information relating to this is supplied to the employing Department-office. Such information is treated as confidential. The commissioners would not appoint if they had any reservations.</P>
    <P>There are no statistics available on the number of ex-offenders who have been employed in the past five years in the Civil Service.</P>

      <Quest>the cost of introducing automatic indexation to the thresholds for stamp duty for residential property; the total cost of stamp duty; and if he will make a statement on the desirability of such a change.</Quest>

    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy):</NameTxt>
      <P>At present, the various thresholds for stamp duty on the transfer of residential property are reviewed on a periodic basis instead of being automatically indexed. There are a number of questions which would impact on the cost of changing from the current periodic review basis to one based on indexation, including the index used, and the likely changes that would have otherwise been made over the reference period had the move to indexation not been made.</P>
      <P>The most commonly quoted indexation measure in the economy is the consumer price index. If the CPI had been used in recent years for such indexation, it would not have kept pace with the rate of house price inflation. For example, in 1996 stamp duty was payable on the transfer of a house valued £5,000 or more, and at 6% where the value of the house was £60,000 or more. Had these values been then index-linked to the CPI, this would mean that a house today valued more than &euro;7,950 would be liable for stamp duty, and this would be at a rate of 6% if it were over &euro;95,307. Currently, no stamp duty is paid on a second hand house if it is valued less than &euro;127,000, or &euro;190,500 for first-time buyers. Thus under that scenario, there would have been a gain rather than a cost to the Exchequer from such CPI indexation.</P>
      <P>It should be remembered that adjusting the various stamp duty thresholds on residential property is an economic policy instrument which the Government may use to achieve various required outcomes, in matters such as supply of rented accommodation, home ownership, employment in the building industry and the raising of tax revenue for Exchequer purposes. Fixing the thresholds to the level they were on a particular date, allowing only their increase with reference to inflation, would remove flexibility in an important area of policy, and tie Government hands when an alternative threshold may more effectively match the needs of the time.</P>
      <P>As regards the total cost of stamp duty, it is assumed that the Deputy may be referring to the cost of stamp duty to those who pay it. This is equivalent to the yield from the duty and the total yield from stamp duty in 2002 has been estimated at &euro;1.14 billion, of which &euro;349 million is estimated to be in respect of residential property.</P>
      <P>For these reasons I would not be in favour of the introduction of such a change as that referred to by the Deputy.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy):</NameTxt>
      <P>The current VAT treatment of charitable organisations is based on EU VAT law, with which Irish VAT law must comply. Under the Sixth VAT Directive, a wide range of charitable and voluntary activities are deemed to be exempt for VAT purposes. This means that the organisations involved do not charge VAT on their services but, as a necessary corollary, they are unable to recover the VAT they bear on the goods and services that they purchase in the course of their activities. There are no provisions for refunds of VAT under the EU Sixth VAT Directive.</P>
      <P>Charities already enjoy relief from most taxes. Furthermore, in the Finance Act 2001 I provided for a new scheme of tax relief for donations to charities. This is a generous scheme which has, I understand, already been of significant benefit to them. I would also say that even if VAT relief were possible, the cost to the Exchequer would be substantial, especially in the light of the existing valuable tax concessions to such charities.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy):</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 241 and 242 together.</P>
      <P>The question of how nations handle unsustainable sovereign debt has become a pressing issue for the international community. At present, there is no formal agreed mechanism to deal with default by a sovereign state. In recent years this problem has intensified as private capital flows have increased relative to official flows.</P>
      <P>The problem is exacerbated by the great variety of debt instruments involved, and the range of legal jurisdictions in which debt is issued. The Chapter 11 type concept sometimes proposed as a solution is borrowed from US law and it applies there to companies and not to public bodies, such as local authorities, let alone to sovereign states.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In September 2002 the International Monetary and Financial Committee, IMFC, requested the <Col N="233" /> IMF to work to develop a sovereign debt restructuring mechanism, SDRM, proposal for consideration at the April 2003 meetings. Proposals are awaited and while Ireland and other EU states are very interested in the suggestions coming forward, many lenders, particularly private lenders, and other states are initially negative. Reforming the sovereign debt restructuring framework is a formidable task that, even with agreement, would take many years to develop and implement. There are also a host of technical and institutional issues still to be examined. There are numerous concerns about the consistency of any proposal with national laws.</P>
    <P>Furthermore, NGOs and others have also raised fundamental questions about the role to be played by the SDRM. Some of these call for a forum that could act as an arbitrator on grounds of sustainability, or on the political or moral validity of certain claims due. While we would wish for all countries to make wise use of borrowed money, it is by no means true that all do. External assessment of whether projects were initially appropriate raises problems not alone for lenders seeking repayment, but also with the issue of national sovereignty for the borrowers, with the selection of any such assessors, and with any assessment criteria to be used. Ireland has been a consistent supporter of bottom-up development and is a firm believer that the ultimate solution to the development problems lies in the hands and direction of the developing countries themselves.</P>
    <P>Any new arrangement would also need to ensure that the already limited flow of funds to developing countries did not diminish, if private lenders decided that any new procedure made lending there more risky. Thus for any such proposal to be workable, the agreement and participation of the private sector is essential. Given that they have so far been very cautious about involvement in any multilateral initiatives aimed at crisis prevention and-or resolution, considerable assurances will be necessary to secure their willing involvement in any SDRM type process.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TomParlonPD" hpid="Mr. Parlon Mr. Parlon">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Finance (Mr. Parlon):</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy will be familiar with the background to this issue. A spillage of PCBs from the brewery into the River Breagagh occurred in 1980. Most of this spillage was recovered immediately through the prompt action of Guinness (Ireland) Limited. At that time Office of Public Works had no involvement with the Breagagh or Nore rivers and was not, therefore, <Col N="234" /> involved in the clean up of the spillage or any subsequent remediation measures.</P>
      <P>OPW's first involvement came much later as part of the preparation for the Kilkenny flood relief scheme. Office of Public Works had a survey carried out in 1997 to test for the presence of PCBs in the Breagagh and Nore rivers. This identified some areas where PCBs were present in the riverbed at locations where Office of Public Works intended to carry out dredging as part of the flood relief scheme.</P>
      <P>Guinness (Ireland) Limited agreed to carry out a further clean up operation to remove any remaining traces of PCBs. This was done in consultation with Kilkenny County Council and borough council, Office of Public Works, Environmental Protection Agency, Dúchas and SEHB. The work was managed by Project Management Ireland Limited and was completed early in 2002. The clean up was carried out, in agreement with the EPA, to a Dutch standard for presence of PCBs, and the material was removed for incineration abroad.</P>
      <P>The completion of this work left the way clear for Office of Public Works to proceed with the flood relief scheme. The dredging of the riverbed is an essential part of the scheme in order to improve the flow of water in times of flood. The scheme involves removal of material from the riverbed and spreading it at three locations &ndash; Dukesmeadow, Bishopsmeadows and Ossory Road. To date the majority of the material removed has been spread at Dukesmeadow.</P>
      <P>Given the history of the PCB spillage and in order to reassure residents at Dukesmeadow, Office of Public Works agreed to sample the spoil and test it for PCBs. Twelve samples were taken and traces of PCBs above the clean up level were found in two of these. These results were immediately made available to the Dukesmeadows residents' association in December 2002 and Office of Public Works agreed to carry out further analysis of the test results to assess the significance of the findings.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This issue is being taken very seriously by Office of Public Works. A group has now been set up comprising representatives of Office of Public Works, Kilkenny County Council, borough council, EPA, SEHB and Project Management Limited, to deal with this issue. This group will meet on a regular basis until this issue is resolved. It is important to note that it is not planned to remove any further material from the river before July of this year. The immediate concern is to deal with the spoil that has already been removed. In consultation with the EPA and SEHB, Office of Public Works is undertaking immediately a further comprehensive testing and analysis of the spoil deposits. The results of this work will be available in approximately six weeks and decisions can then be made in light of the results of the tests. Further tests will also be carried out in the riverbed where it is proposed to remove further material. Office of Public Works and the contractor for the flood relief scheme are <Col N="235" /> currently carrying out a risk analysis for all areas where work is currently taking place in the river to agree what actions need to be taken from a health and safety point of view.</P>
    <P>Based on the information available to date, the EPA can confirm that the present spoil deposits do not pose any immediate threats to public health. PCBs are harmful if ingested or if they come into direct contact with the skin. The possibility of airborne PCBs does not arise given the nature of the spoil deposits. In addition, PCBs are relatively heavy and tend to sink in water and stick to soil or gravel. Office of Public Works is taking steps to ensure that the spoil sites are adequately secured.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that this issue is being well managed by Office of Public Works in conjunction with all the other relevant bodies. Office of Public Works has been quite open with local residents on this matter as on all other matters of concern arising from the flood relief scheme and this policy will continue. I am confident that Office of Public Works will take whatever action is required, in consultation with all the relevant agencies, when the results of the additional tests become available. The immediate priority is, of course, to allay public concerns about PCB deposits and deal with any public health issues that arise while not losing sight of the objective of completing the flood relief scheme for the benefit of the people of Kilkenny.</P>

Any recommendations contained in this report in relation to the medical criteria and other conditions of the scheme and whether to extend the scheme or otherwise will receive full consideration.</P>
      <P>Any consideration will, among other factors, have to take account of any cost implications. I have been informed there are up to 360,000 persons in Ireland who could be regarded as disabled to some degree or other. These include both persons with medical conditions other than those covered by the scheme, and those with medical conditions covered by the scheme. The substantial tax benefits of the disabled drivers' and disabled passengers' scheme make for considerable interest in and desire to be admitted to the scheme.</P>

      <P>My Department funds four maintenance grant schemes for third level and further education students. These are the higher education grants scheme, the vocational education committees' scholarships scheme, the third level maintenance grants scheme for trainees and the maintenance grants scheme for students attending post leaving certificate courses. The higher education grants scheme is administered by the local authorities. The other three schemes are administered by the vocational education committees.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>Consideration has been given to a proposal that a transfer of responsibility for the operation of the maintenance grants schemes to a single agency or body, such as the Department of Social and Family Affairs, might be administratively more appropriate. This view has been endorsed by the Cromien report of October 2000 on the review of my Department's operations, systems and staffing needs and by the report of the action <Col N="241" /> group on access to third level education which was published in July 2001.</P>
    <P>An Agreed Programme for Government of June 2002 contains a commitment to introduce the payment of maintenance grants through a unified and flexible grant payment scheme. The Deputy will be aware that the time frame for delivering on the commitments in the agreed programme is the term of office of the Government.</P>
    <P>The Deputy will also appreciate that there are major implications, for example, for the local authorities and vocational education committees, in any proposals to change the administration of the maintenance grants schemes. It is my intention, therefore, that there will be full consultation with all interested parties and that no irrevocable decisions will be taken in relation to any future arrangements prior to such consultation taking place.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Mr. N. Dempsey):</NameTxt>
      <P>My Department's policy in relation to the retention of young people who are at risk of early school leaving is to support young people in school and to support schools to adapt to the needs of the young people experiencing difficulties. It also involves the development of a range of appropriate interventions in the community to support pupils, who are still of compulsory school going age and are outside the formal school system, with a view to supporting their progression over time back to mainstream education.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In 2002 my Department introduced the school completion programme, SCP, which is a new and <Col N="242" /> expanded programme to deal with early school leaving. The school completion programme incorporates the elements of best practice established by the eight to 15 year old early school leaver initiative, ESLI, and the stay-in-school retention initiative at second level, SSRI, the pilot phases of which came to an end in August and July 2002, respectively.</P>
    <P>The objective of the school completion programme is to provide a range of interventions in areas of disadvantage that support the retention of young people in education. It is based on an integrated approach involving primary and post-primary schools, parents, communities and relevant statutory and voluntary agencies. Some 82 project sites in 21 counties involving approximately 109 post-primary schools and 295 primary schools have been selected to participate in the project strand of the school completion programme over the next three years. Selection of project sites for the expansion of the programme was based on detailed analysis of pupil retention rates at second level using the Department's post-primary pupils database. This analysis also identified the main feeder primary schools for each project. Some 53 SSRI schools, which were not selected for inclusion in the project strand, will continue to be funded under the stay in school retention strand of the programme over the next three years up to 31 August 2005.</P>
    <P>Significant additional funding was made available under the National Development Plan 2000-2006 with the assistance from the ESF Fund for the expansion of these initiatives. Some &euro;22.428 million was allocated to the school completion programme in 2002. In addition, there are five youth encounter projects, three in Dublin and one each in Cork and Limerick, which are supported by my Department to provide educational facilities for young people aged between ten to 15 years who have become alienated from the conventional mainstream education system. Many of the pupils are persistent truants and have become, or are at risk of becoming, involved in minor crime and delinquency. The primary objective of the youth encounter projects is to rehabilitate the pupils and to return them to mainstream education in the shortest time possible. The projects liaise closely with specified schools in their catchment areas involving schools at primary and post-primary level. A total of &euro;776,000 was allocated in 2002 to the youth encounter projects.</P>
    <P>My Department also supports youthreach, which is a programme of second chance education for young people in the 15-20 age group who have left school early with minimal or no qualifications. Some 3,000 places have been approved in the education sector through the VECs and this is complemented by places funded by FÁS in community training workshops and in mainline FÁS training centres. The youthreach programme in the education sector cost &euro;39.5 million in 2002. There are over 80 youthreach centres located throughout the country.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. N. Dempsey Mr. N. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Mr. N. Dempsey):</NameTxt>
      <P>Early school leaving is the most significant cause of keeping people caught in cycles of disadvantage and is a key indicator for subsequent difficulties including long-term unemployment, homelessness, substance abuse and criminal activity. Tackling the problem of early school leaving is a key priority of this Government and requires movement on a number of fronts, including legislative and curricular reforms and preventative interventions.</P>
      <P>My Department's strategies to tackle the problem of early school leaving have included widening the educational experience available to students, which aim to achieve a greater level of inclusiveness in curricular provision and meet the needs of the diversity of pupils in our second level schools, by expanding funding for programmes such as the junior certificate schools programme, JCSP, the leaving certificate vocational programme, LCVP, vocational preparation training, LPT and the leaving certificate applied, LCA.</P>
      <P>Following on from studies in England, Scotland, Canada, USA and Holland into early school leaving and educational disadvantage and the 1997 report of the National Economic and Social Forum, the eight to 15 early school leaver initiative was introduced. The purpose of this initiative was to pilot and evaluate a range of structured pilot projects in urban and rural disadvantaged areas which test models for the development of an integrated area based co-ordination of services for young people at risk of early school leaving. In September 1998, 17 specific projects in 14 areas commenced.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My Department has now expanded and assimilated schemes directly targeting those in danger of dropping out of the education system. A new programme, called the school completion programme builds on two earlier schemes, the early school leaver initiative and the stay in school retention initiative. The school completion programme recognises that a wide variety of home, community and school-based factors can contribute to low school attainment and early school leaving and consequently, strategies designed to address the needs of young people at risk of early school leaving must include a range of actions that impinge on these aspects of young people's lives; these strategies must therefore be holistic and child-centred by nature. Some 82 project sites in 21 counties involving both primary and post-primary schools have been selected to participate <Col N="244" /> in the project strand of the school completion programme. Selection of project sites for the expansion of the programme was based on detailed analysis of pupil retention rates at second level using the Department's post-primary pupil database. The selection of schools to participate has been based on overall enrolment figures and the number of pupils failing to remain in school up to the completion of the senior cycle with particular emphasis on schools which lose pupils before completion of the junior cycle.</P>
    <P>The home school community liaison scheme was commenced in 1991 in second level schools situated in urban areas affected by significant social and economic disadvantage. The scheme enables schools to allocate a teacher full time to home school community liaison activities. It aims at the promotion of active co-operation between home, school and relevant community agencies in advancing the educational interests of the children. Since its inception, the scheme has been extended significantly. In 1999, the scheme was extended to second level disadvantaged schools.</P>
    <P>The Education Welfare Act 2000 and the establishment of the National Educational Welfare Board is also an important plank in the campaign to keep students at school. The focus is on a welfare approach, with a clearly set out recording and reporting system, rather than the old style prosecutorial system. The educational welfare officers employed by the board will be deployed to assist all recognised primary and post-primary schools. The Act requires schools to report suspensions that last at least six days to the educational welfare officer. The automatic involvement of the educational welfare officer in these situations will provide a key means for the early identification and support of children at risk of dropping out of the school system.</P>
    <P>In addition, there are five youth encounter projects, three in Dublin and one each in Cork and Limerick, which are supported by my Department to provide educational facilities for young people aged between ten to 15 years who have become alienated from the conventional mainstream education system. Many of the pupils are persistent truants and have become, or are at risk of becoming, involved in minor crime and delinquency. The primary objective of the youth encounter projects is to rehabilitate the pupils and to return them to mainstream education in the shortest time possible. The projects liaise closely with specified schools in their catchment areas involving schools at primary and postprimary level. I believe that the my Department's strategies in this area should lead to more and more young people staying on and completing second level education and, in that way, most effectively assist in redressing early school leaving, together with the integrated services approach which will help to support young people at risk in their school, home and community.</P>

      <P>Children with dyslexia who are attending primary schools on an integrated basis can be supported by the learning support teacher service or the resource teacher service. In many cases, the level of need will be such as to be capable of being addressed by the learning support teacher service. At present, there are 1,531 learning support teachers in the primary system. In more serious cases, the support of the special resource teacher service may be required. At present there are approximately 2,300 resource teachers in the primary system. In all cases, the model and level of support made available is based on the professionally assessed needs of the individual child and reflects the recommendations of the special education review committee which estimated that not more than 2% of the overall pupil population would be found to fall into this category.</P>
      <P>All children with special needs in the primary system, including children with dyslexia, have an automatic entitlement to a response to their needs, irrespective of their level of need or location. The model and level of support provided is based on the professionally assessed needs of the individual child. All primary schools have been advised of the procedures to be followed in seeking resource teacher support for children with special needs. Applications for such support are responded to on a term basis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="246" /> At present, there are approximately 62 full-time resource teacher posts and 44 full-time learning support teacher posts in place in schools in County Meath. Precise details of the number of pupils being catered for by these teachers are not readily available. However, as a general rule it would be expected that learning support teachers would have an average case-load of 30 pupils and that the case-loads of resource teachers would not exceed 12 pupils. The numbers of pupils being catered for by individual teaches will vary depending on the level of need involved and whether the posts are devoted to individual schools or shared between schools. In the current academic year 86 primary teachers and 86 post-primary teachers are attending a national programme of training in learning support (formerly remedial education) in six centres in universities and colleges of education.</P>
    <P>Guidelines for learning support teachers were issued in 2000. An intensive training programme based on the guidelines is under way and learning support teachers will receive this training. Phase 1 training has been completed. Phase 2 training is being delivered at present.</P>

      <P>The pupil teacher ratio at primary level has improved significantly in recent years. The ratio has fallen from 22.2:1 in 1996/97 to 19.0:1 in the 2001/2 school year. The projected ratio for the current school year is 18.4:1.</P>
      <P>The mainstream staffing of a primary school is determined by reference to the enrolment of the school on the 30 September of the previous school year. The number of mainstream teaching posts sanctioned is determined by reference to a staffing schedule which is finalised for a particular school year following discussions with the education partners.</P>
      <P>The staffing schedule for 2003-4 school year will issue shortly to the boards of management of all primary schools and will also be posted on my Department's website.</P>

      <Quest>if his attention has been drawn to the fact that many primary schools do not have sufficient resources to give support to children with dyslexia and, as a result, parents are having to pay very high private fees for additional support; and if he will review the basis on which support is made to primary schools to provide service to children with dyslexia.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. N. Dempsey Mr. N. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Mr. N. Dempsey):</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 276 and 277 together.</P>
      <P>All children in the primary system who have been assessed as having special educational needs, including children with dyslexia, have an automatic entitlement to a response to their needs irrespective of their level of need or location. The nature and level of the support provided is based on the professionally assessed needs of the individual child.</P>
      <P>Children with dyslexia are generally catered for on an integrated basis in ordinary primary schools where they can be supported by the learning support teacher service or the resource teacher service. At present, there are approximately 2,300 resource teachers and 1,531 learning support teachers in the primary system. Where the condition is of a more serious nature, provision can be made in one of the four special schools or 23 special classes attached to ordinary primary schools and dedicated to the needs of children with dyslexia. Decisions on placements are based on the professionally assessed needs of the individual child and parental wishes in relation to their children.</P>
      <P>All special schools and special classes dedicated to children with dyslexia operate at a reduced pupil teacher ratio of 9:1 and pupils attending such facilities attract a special increased rate of capitation funding. My Department also provides funding to schools for the purchase of specialised equipment such as computers to assist children with special needs with their education, including children with dyslexia. Grant aid is also provided to the Dyslexia Association of Ireland to support its work with persons with dyslexia.</P>
      <P>The report of the task force on dyslexia contains over 60 individual recommendations ranging across a wide variety of issues from identification and assessment, to models of service delivery, specialist training for service providers and issues relating to structural reforms. Since the task force reported, a number of initiatives have been taken in the area of dyslexia. These include the introduction of the first ever on-line training course for teachers catering for pupils with dyslexia, the appointment of ten new learning support trainers to the primary curriculum support programme specifically to provide in-depth support for the implementation of learning support guidelines for children with dyslexia, and a reduction from 11:1 to 9:1 in the pupil teacher ratio applicable to special classes catering for children with dyslexia.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In addition to the above measures, a key focus of my Department has been on advancing the fundamental structural and legislative measures <Col N="252" /> which are necessary to underpin the development and delivery of services for persons with special needs, including children with dyslexia. A key development on the structural front has been the Government's decision to approve the establishment of the National Council for Special Education. The national council, which will have a local area presence, will play a key role in the development and delivery of services for persons with special needs, including children with dyslexia. It will have a research and advisory role and will establish expert groups to consider specific areas of special needs provision. It will also establish a consultative forum to facilitate inputs from the education partners and other interested parties. Arrangements for the establishment of the council are now well advanced. A chief executive officer designate has been appointed and an order to establish the council will shortly be brought before the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>I will also be bringing forward legislation, based on the Education for Persons with Disabilities Bill 2002, aimed at establishing the rights and entitlements of persons with special needs, including dyslexia, to an appropriate education service and providing the necessary framework for effective service delivery. My objective is to secure the passage of this legislation through the Oireachtas before the summer recess.</P>

The association has recently submitted an application for additional funding to support a programme aimed at further developing services for persons with dyslexia. My Department's inspectorate will shortly undertake a review of this programme and my officials will be in contact with the association to make the necessary arrangements. A decision on the funding application will be made following this review.</P>

As a result of this the Secretary General of my Department wrote to the Garda informing it of these allegations. In November 2002 the Secretary General received a response from the Garda which stated that it was not aware of any complaint against the person concerned that would warrant a criminal investigation. If the Deputy has any information regarding this person, I suggest that he should make it available to the Garda Síochána.</P>

This audit was part of a detailed audit programme of young offender centres which commenced in 1992. Certain matters which came to light during the course of the audit of Trinity House were reported to the Garda in December 1992 and to the Revenue Commissioners in July 1993. The internal audit unit of my Department provided details and supporting documentation of the irregularities identified to the Garda authorities. As a result of irregularities which came to light at an early stage in the audit of Trinity House, a member of staff of the school was suspended from duty on 17 November 1992. The detailed Garda investigation into alleged fraud at Trinity House failed to disclose any primary evidence to support a criminal charge.</P>

      <P>The mainstream staffing of a primary school is determined by reference to the enrolment of the school on 30 September of the previous school year. The number of mainstream teaching posts sanctioned is determined by reference to a staffing schedule which is finalised for a particular school year following discussions with the education partners. The number of mainstream teachers in these two schools is determined by reference to this schedule, in the normal fashion. Both schools are included in the Giving Children an Even Break programme, and accordingly are eligible to be considered for a range of additional supports, including teacher posts and financial supports to be targeted at disadvantaged pupils. My Department will forward directly to the Deputy a precise breakdown of the staffing in each school.</P>

      <P>The Giving Children an Even Break programme was launched in 2001 to deal with educational disadvantage in primary schools. The schools targeted under the programme were identified through a comprehensive and objective survey of all primary schools carried out in March and April 2000 by the Educational Research Centre in Drumcondra on my Department's behalf. Giving Children an Even Break subsumes the previous process of designation of schools that serve areas of educational disadvantage. My Department's approach is now refined to ensure that the individual at risk pupils are targeted. Rather than the old method of designating additional schools, my Department provides support that is commensurate with the levels of concentration in schools of pupils with characteristics that are associated with educational disadvantage and early school leaving.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are separate urban and rural dimensions to the programme. Schools categorised as urban with the highest concentrations of at risk pupils are supported, where necessary, over the three year period through staff allocations to implement a pupil-teacher ratio of 20:1 in the jun<Col N="258" /> ior classes, infants through second class, and a pupil-teacher ratio of 27:1 in senior classes, third through sixth classes. Schools participating in Giving Children an Even Break are eligible to receive a range of additional supports including teacher posts and financial supports to be targeted at disadvantaged pupils. The additional supports to be provided reflect the level of concentration of pupils from educationally disadvantaged backgrounds in each school invited to participate in the programme.</P>
    <P>The school referred to by the Deputy is included in the urban dimension of Giving Children an Even Break. It benefits from supplementary funding to provide additional educational supports for the children concerned. The school was not considered eligible for additional teaching staff based on the level of concentration of at risk pupils in the school, as reflected in the Educational Research Centre survey outcome. Schools that expressed concern about the outcome of the survey in respect of their school were advised to make representations to my Department outlining their circumstances. These representations, which included representations from the school referred to by the Deputy, were referred to the Educational Research Centre for consideration. My Department has received a report from the Educational Research Centre and following consideration of the representations received the school referred to by the Deputy has been informed that there will be no alteration in the existing level of support provided under Giving Children an Even Break.</P>

      <P>The five child detention schools under the aegis of my Department provide residential accommodation for children under 16 years who have been convicted of offences or remanded in custody by the courts. Children may be committed to the schools for a period ranging from one to four years. Children on charges before the courts may be remanded in custody to the schools either on remand only or remand for assessment. Remand periods range from days to weeks.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The schools provide programmes of residential care, education and rehabilitation for the children. As part of the rehabilitation and reintegration process, children may have authorised leave from the school for the purposes of home leave or for educational and training purposes. During this time, they are still under the terms of <Col N="259" /> their sentence and are away from the school under strict conditions. The schools are obliged to ensure that a place is available for them when they return, or if they breach the conditions of their leave and are required to return to the school earlier than planned. If places temporarily vacated by children on such leave were automatically filled on a short-term basis, it would lead to a revolving door situation which is contrary to the principles of care, education, training and rehabilitation.</P>

      <P>The five child detention schools under the aegis of my Department provide residential accommodation for children under 16 years who have been convicted of an offence or remanded in custody by the courts. There are 130 places available for use in these schools, of which 99 places were occupied on 7 February last. The latter figure includes 11 places which are occupied by young people on authorised leave or who have absconded from the schools. These 11 places are not available for use as the young person is still under the terms of their sentence and usually their absence from the school is for a short period. Therefore, 31 places are currently unoccupied.</P>
      <P>Children convicted of offences may be committed to the schools for a period ranging from a year to four years. The average stay ranges between 12 and 18 months. Children on charges before the courts may be remanded in custody on remand only, or on remand for assessment. Remand periods range from days to weeks. The average duration of remand periods ranges between four and 13 weeks. Work is currently under way on a programme of capital developments at the child detention schools. This programme provides for the major refurbishment and replacement of existing facilities that are considered inadequate in the context of building regulations, health and safety standards and current minimum standards for residential child care. I have no plans to build new child detention schools at present.</P>

      <P>My Department does not provide <Col N="261" /> direct financial assistance for the provision of student accommodation. In recognition of the difficulties students can experience in obtaining accommodation and following consultation with third level colleges, a special tax incentive was introduced to encourage the provision of dedicated student residential accommodation in section 50 of the Finance Act 1999. The tax incentive is available for expenditure up to 31 December 2004 where an application for planning permission is received by a planning authority by 30 September 2003. The opportunity exists, therefore, to create significant additional accommodation for third level students.</P>
      <P>Properties qualifying for relief under the scheme are campus areas of the educational institution or areas within an 8 km radius of the main campus which are approved by the educational institution as being an area within which a qualifying development may take place. The rent a room relief scheme was introduced in the Finance Act 2001. It allows home owners to rent out a room in their homes and have rental income up to &euro;7,620 a year tax free. The scheme encourages householders to rent rooms to students.</P>

My Department is conducting a review of student support provisions aimed at ensuring that the benefits of the substantial investment being made are maximised. This review will cover a broad range of topics relating to the schemes of student support including the level of maintenance grants, eligibility, income limits with respect to the grants, the free fees initiative and will consider various options taking into account international experiences in this field.</P>

This review will cover a range of topics relating to the schemes of student support, including the level of maintenance grants, eligibility, income limits with respect to the grants, the free fees initiative and will consider various options taking into account international experiences in this field, including the issue of loans.</P>
      <P>Officials of my Department are conducting the review. However, some issues require the engagement of external expertise. In this regard, the Economic and Social Research Institute is undertaking work on a number of issues relevant to the review. Relevant recently published reports will also inform the work of the review group.</P>

Applications in respect of a third tranche of funding under the measure are currently with An Bord Iascaigh Mhara and Údarás na Gaeltachta following a public call for projects. Such projects are assessed and prioritised by the agencies. Decisions on grant aid are made by the aquaculture selection committee for the Border, midlands and western region or the aquaculture selection committee for the southern and eastern region, as appropriate. These procedures were put in place in 2000 in the context of ensuring that procedures for approval of projects are fair, unbiased and take account of regional development priorities.</P>

      <P>As the Deputy may be aware, Westport Harbour Commissioners and Mayo County Council have submitted a joint application for grant aid funding in respect of the integrated development plan for Westport Harbour. The application is made under the disengagement sub-measure of the seaports measure of the Border, midlands and western regional operational programme 2000 to 2006. The payment of &euro;94,276 made by my Department to Westport Harbour Commissioners in December 2002 was in respect of expenditure incurred on the preparation and the implementation of the integrated development plan up to November 2002 and related to: professional fees in relation to the preparation of the integrated development plan and a feasibility study; project development costs including part of the salary of a marine engineer, boat hire costs and general administration expenses; and infrastructure work in the harbour, improvements to the navigational channel and lighting. Under the public financial procedures a liability is considered to be mature when the goods or services have been provided satisfactorily and the supplier has submitted the account subject to any credit terms.</P>

      <P>Under the local authority swimming pool programme, 2000-2002, which is administered by my Department, there are four stages in a swimming pool project following the submission of a feasibility study. These, in order of progress, are preliminary report, contract documents, tender and construction. My Department's technical advisers, the Office of Public Works, evaluate each stage and local authorities cannot proceed to the next stage of a project unless prior approval issues from my Department. Grant aid is allocated only when tenders have been approved for the project and will be capped at the time of allocation.</P>
      <P>Under the swimming pool programme, grants of up to &euro;3,809,214 are available towards both the refurbishment of existing pools and the provision of new pools, subject in both cases to the total grant not exceeding 80% of the eligible cost of the project or, in the case of projects located in designated disadvantaged areas, 90% of the eligible cost. Support is available towards the cost of the swimming pool, toddler pool, sauna and steam room.</P>
      <P>The feasibility study submitted by Bray Town Council in respect of the proposal for a new swimming pool in Bray is currently with the Office of Public Works for assessment. The proposal will be considered further on completion of this assessment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children (Mr. T. O'Malley):</NameTxt>
      <P>Substantial progress has been made in recent years in ensuring that those in need of mental health services receive care and treatment in the most appropriate setting. That progress is acknowledged in the Amnesty International report published yesterday. However, much remains to be done. I am committed to the provision of quality care in the area of mental health and I will be endeavouring to secure additional funding for this sector in the coming years.</P>
      <P>While the Deputy is correct in stating that funding allocated to mental health amounts to 7% of the total health budget at present, he has failed to acknowledge the real progress that has been made in recent years. In the period 1999-02 an additional &euro;70.7 million was invested in the mental health services. In the current year, additional revenue funding of &euro;7.6 million will be provided for ongoing developments in mental health services, to develop and expand community mental health services, to increase child and adolescent services, to expand the old age psychiatry services, to provide liaison psychiatry services in general hospitals and to enhance the support provided to voluntary agencies.</P>
      <P>Approximately &euro;190 million in capital is being provided over the lifetime of the national development plan to fund the development of acute psychiatric units linked to general hospitals, as a replacement of services previously provided in psychiatric hospitals. Substantial progress has already been made.</P>
      <P>There are now 18 general hospital psychiatric units operational, a further three units will become available to their mental health services in the near future, two are under construction and several others are at various stages of planning. In relation to community residences, there are approximately 400 community psychiatric residences in the country providing over 3,000 places. This compares to 111 residences, providing less than 1,000 places in 1984. In relation to day hospitals-day centres, there are approximately 200 providing over 3,500 places. This compares with 39 such centres providing approximately 1,200 places in 1984.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The new Mental Health Commission, established in April of last year under the provisions of the Mental Health Act 2001 has an important role to play in improving the quality of our mental health services. The primary functions of the commission are to promote and foster high standards and good practices in the delivery of mental <Col N="269" /><Col N="270" /> health services and to ensure that the interests of detained persons are protected. The Mental Health Commission is now working with officials from my Department to put in place the structures required for its new role. The commission will appoint an inspector of mental health services later this year. The inspector will be required to visit and inspect all approved centres at least once a year. The inspector's annual report and review of the mental health services will be published and laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas along with the commission's annual report.</P>
    <P>The health strategy Quality and Fairness &ndash; A Health System for You includes a commitment to prepare a new national policy framework for the further modernisation of mental health services, updating the 1984 policy document Planning for the Future and taking account of significant initiatives and policy developments which have occurred in the interim. Work on this new policy framework is expected to begin later this year.</P>

This report advises that current ventilation technologies are inadequate to give workers full protection from the hazards of tobacco smoke and that exposure can best be controlled by banning smoking in places of work. Acting on this advice I published draft regulations to provide for a prohibition on the smoking of tobacco products in all places of work which will come into operation on 1 January 2004. I have met with representatives of the trade union movement concerning these new measures and I will be meeting with representatives of other interested groups with regard to implementation of the proposed regulations over the coming weeks.</P>

      <P>I propose to answer Questions Nos. 325, 353, 355, 391, 392 and 410 together.</P>
      <P>As the Deputies are aware, I established the expert review group on radiotherapy services to examine the appropriate future development of radiotherapy services. The group has conducted a national assessment of needs for radiotherapy services having regard to the demography and epidemiology of cancer and the gaps in current service provision. The group's report will address the following key issues: access to radiotherapy services, in terms of information, financial access and organisational components of access; the need to provide a high quality, evidence based service; the need to take account of current and new developments in health technology; the requirements of the system in terms of human resources; international norms in relation to service provision, planning and staffing; and the organisational development of the services in terms of structures and processes which need to be place in a radiotherapy facility.</P>
      <P>I understand that the work of the expert working group is at the final editing stage and will be submitted to me shortly. All health boards have been afforded the opportunity to meet with and make submissions to the group. The provision of additional radiotherapy services will be considered in the context of the report of the group. Following consideration of the report, I will submit proposals for consideration by Government.</P>

      <P>The previous programme for Government, An Action Programme for the Millennium, contained a specific commitment to support the establishment of a heart and lung transplant facility in Ireland.

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children (Mr. T. O'Malley):</NameTxt>
      <P>The social services inspectorate was established in April 1999, initially on administrative basis, but it is proposed to establish it on a statutory basis. The main function of the inspectorate is to support the child care services by promoting and ensuring the development of quality standards. The SSI will monitor all personal social services operated by the health boards, in the longer term, but initially it is concentrating on the child care area and in particular on the inspection of health board operated residential child care facilities.</P>
      <P>The inspection of residential facilities for children with disabilities was excluded from the remit of the SSI under the Child Care Act 1991. This exclusion was however revoked in the Children Act 2001. A steering group chaired by the Department of Health and Children and comprising representatives of the Department, the chief executive officers of the health boards, the Eastern Regional Health Authority and the chief inspector of the SSI oversees the operation of the SSI. The process of inspection has been agreed. A national set of standards against which all children's residential homes, both statutory and non-statutory, are being inspected was published in September 2001. An examination of these standards will begin within the next few weeks with a view to ensuring that they encompass the particular needs of children with disabilities.</P>
      <P>The national health strategy, Quality and Fairness, has set 2003 as the target date for the establishment of the SSI on a statutory basis. It also states that the remit of the SSI will be extended to cover residential care for older people and adults with disabilities. Establishing the SSI on a statutory basis will strengthen its role and will provide it with the necessary underpinning of independence in the performance of its functions. It will also serve to increase public confidence in state and voluntary social services. Work is in progress on the drafting of a statutory instrument to enable the SSI to be established on a statutory footing.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TimOMalleyPD" hpid="Mr. T. O'Malley Mr. T. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children (Mr. T. O'Malley):</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 343, 390 and 400 together.</P>
      <P>I am aware of the concerns regarding the provision of services to persons with an intellectual disability and those with autism.</P>
      <P>Between 1997 and 2002, an extra &euro;188 million in revenue and &euro;139 million in capital funding has been provided, making a total additional investment of &euro;327 million for the maintenance and development of services to persons with an intellectual disability and those with autism. In the current year, further additional funding of &euro;13.3 million has been allocated to services for persons with an intellectual disability or autism to meet the full-year cost of the 2002 developments and to further enhance the health related support services to children with an intellectual disability or autism. This funding brings the total extra investment in these services to &euro;340 million over seven years. Of this total, over &euro;200 million has been built into the ongoing budget base.</P>
      <P>This funding has brought about very significant and unprecedented developments in the services. Between 1997 and 2002, around 1,700 extra residential places have been provided, with most of these based in the community. This figure includes new residential respite places which were developed in 1997 and 1998. Between 1999 and 2002, about 465 dedicated respite places were also provided. In addition, the period from 1997 to 2002 saw the provision of around 2,950 new day places.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Despite this very significant investment, demographic factors are contributing to growing waiting lists for residential services in particular, even though the number of people in receipt of services, including full-time residential services, continues to increase. The increased birth rate in the 1960s and 1970s has resulted in large numbers of adults in their late 20s and early 30s requiring full-time residential services. In addition, people with an intellectual disability are living longer than <Col N="279" /> previously, adding to the need for services compared to the need in previous generations. This has also been the international experience in service provision to this population.</P>
    <P>The overall economic position in 2003 has had implications for all aspects of public investment, and this is reflected in the Estimates and budget adopted by the Government for 2003. Within this overall framework, however, some two thirds of the additional funding available for non-capital investment in services has been allocated to the health services.</P>
    <P>This funding is being applied largely to maintaining existing levels of service across all service programmes, including services for people with an intellectual disability. While it is regrettable that the level of investment in these services achieved in recent years could not be maintained in 2003, my Department will work closely with the health boards and other service providers in respect of service provision this year.</P>

      <P>As the Deputy is aware, the ombudsman in his report on the nursing home subvention scheme asserted that, under the 1970 Health Act, any person in need of nursing home care has a statutory entitlement to the provision of this service by a health board.</P>
      <P>As my Department advised the ombudsman in its response to the draft Report of the Ombudsman, its view is that the Health Act 1970, as amended, distinguishes between eligibility for a service and entitlement to a service, although the two terms are often used interchangeably. This view is supported by legal advice available to my Department.</P>
      <P>The health strategy acknowledges the need to clarify and simplify eligibility arrangements and sets down a commitment to introduce new legislation to provide for clear statutory provisions on entitlement for health and personal social services. As part of the implementation process, a review of all existing legislation is ongoing in my Department. The outcome will inform the approach to the drafting of a new legislative framework on entitlements. I expect that this review will be completed in the current year and that proposals for reform will be submitted to Government.</P>

Nurses working in the public health service undertaking specific specialist courses, including the higher diploma in gerontological nursing, now receive full pay while doing so and have their course fees paid. The person being sponsored is required to give a commitment to continue working in the public health service in the specialised area for 12 months following completion of the course.</P>
      <P>Issues relating to the continuing education of nursing staff employed in the private health service are outside the ambit of my Department. It would be a matter for private health service employers to introduce their own recruitment and retention initiatives.</P>

      <P>The advisory forum on cardiovascular health recommended that a working group be set up and chaired by Comhairle na nOspidéal with representatives from the Department of Health and Children and the advisory forum to plan the future consultant cardiologist requirements needed to implement the recommendations of the cardiovascular health strategy. This group produced an interim report in May 2001 recommending an immediate requirement of 25 additional consultant cardiologist posts. Three consultant cardiologist posts were recommended for the Southern Health Board area, one at Cork University Hospital, one at Tralee General Hospital and one at the Mercy Hospital. The full report from the group will be produced in the near future. Nationally, we are on target to advance the filling of 17 of these posts in 2003. Within the resources available and taking account of competing priorities, my Department will continue to attach priority to advancing the recruitment of the remainder of these posts including those recommended for the Southern Health Board.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Southern Health Board is committed to developing cardiology services at Tralee General Hospital as identified and outlined in the board's Building Healthier Hearts five year action plan. To date, &euro;503,778 has been invested over the first three years of the strategy to improve cardiology services at Tralee General Hospital. Funding of &euro;1.330 million was allocated to the Southern Health Board under the cardiovascular health strategy for 2003. The board has indicated that it intends to use this funding for the continued implementation of the cardiovascular health strategy in the region including the further development of cardiology services with priority given to funding the cardiology posts at Cork University Hospital and the Mercy Hospital. This would regularise the temporary appointments in these hospitals. The Southern Health Board's <Col N="283" /> action plan for cardiovascular health has identified the developments necessary to enable Tralee General Hospital provide for cardiac services. Funding has been provided as part of the cardiovascular health strategy to further develop a cardiac rehabilitation service at the hospital and to recruit specialised staff for the coronary care unit.</P>

      <P>As the Deputy is aware, sections 22.3 and 22.4 of the Nursing Home (Subvention) Regulations 1993 allow health boards the discretion to contract beds in private nursing homes and to pay more than the maximum rates of subvention in such cases. However, the application of these provisions is a matter for each health board in the context of meeting the requirements of the subvention scheme within the board's revenue allocation as notified annually in the letters of determination. This is in keeping with the provisions of the Health (Amendment) (No. 3) Act 1996. I am aware that there are currently over 500 people waiting for assessment for enhanced subvention in the Southern Health Board. In recognition of the particular difficulties being experienced with the operation of the scheme in the Southern Health Board area, my Department made significant additional resources of over &euro;4.24 million available to the board in 2002 to respond to extra pressures on the scheme. A further &euro;1 million was made available this year. It is my Department's intention to remain in contact with the Southern Health Board to ensure that any difficulties in relation to the operation of the nursing home subvention scheme are minimised.</P>

      <P>The hospital system in general is experiencing increased pressure on available beds due to a number of factors, including the growth of population and the increasing number of elderly people who have a higher than average length of stay. The pressure on the hospital system, and in <Col N="284" /> particular on hospitals providing accident and emergency services, is most severe over the winter months. In early 2002 action was taken by nursing staff in accident and emergency departments of hospitals providing such services. Proposals put forward by the Labour Relations Commission aimed at resolving the dispute included an independent review of the bed management function in acute hospitals with accident and emergency departments. The review was commissioned by the Health Service Employers Agency and the unions representing nursing staff. Its purpose was to help to establish some of the causes of weakness in the system and to provide guidance on how these might be addressed.</P>
      <P>The CAPITA report referred to by the Deputy is the report of this independent review and was completed on 27 January 2003. While the report is critical of certain aspects of bed management it found, in general, evidence of good bed management practices around the country. The report is designed to ensure the development of enhanced and uniform bed management practices across the hospital system. Its recommendations are at present being considered by the management and staff sides in the context of the continuing implementation of the LRC proposals. The need for extended bed management cover will fall to be considered in this context.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 369 and 396 together.</P>
      <P>I am aware that the homeless are a high risk group in relation to a number of health conditions, including mental illness. The main difficulty in relation to adult homelessness has been in the Dublin area and, in order to address this, the Eastern Regional Health Authority has appointed a director of homelessness who is working closely with the three area health boards in implementing the provisions of &ldquo;Homelessness &ndash; An Integrated Strategy&rdquo; published in May 2000. The work of the three area health boards includes measures to improve mental health services for people who are homeless. Since 2000 the Department of Health and Children has allocated &euro;18.34 million to health boards to deal with homelessness with an additional &euro;2.66 million allocated for 2003.</P>
      <P>The recently published health strategy Quality and Fairness &ndash; A Health System for You, includes a commitment to prepare a new national policy framework for the further modernisation of mental health services. Work on the framework is expected to commence later this year. All aspects of mental health service provision, including services for the homeless, will be examined and the need for additional research in this field will be among the matters for consideration.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>As the prison population has expanded in recent years, the services of the Central Mental Hospital have come under increasing pressure, resulting in delays in the transfer of mentally ill prisoners to the hospital. The shortage of in-patient psychiatric beds for prisoners has been commented upon by the European Committee for the Prevention of Torture and Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment. In response to the concerns expressed by the CPT and with a view to eliminating delays in the provision of in-patient psychiatric care to prisoners, the Government has established a special committee to draw up a service level agreement on the admission of mentally ill prisoners to the Central Mental Hospital. This committee comprises representatives of my Department, the Prison Service, the East Coast Area Health Board and the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform. I understand that the committee's work is nearing completion. Over &euro;500,000 has been spent on refurbishment of the Central Mental Hospital since 1999. However, there is an acceptance by all parties that a more substantial redevelopment is required. In December 2000, the East Coast Area Health Board, in conjunction with the Eastern Regional Health Authority, the Department of <Col N="287" /> Justice, Equality and Law Reform and my Department established a group to review the future role of the Central Mental Hospital.</P>
    <P>The review group's report was submitted to the Eastern Regional Health Authority and the Department of Health and Children in 2002. The report includes plans to modernise, refurbish and extend the existing building and to provide a new residence on the campus. Overall capacity would increase from 90 to 120. I have accepted, in principle, the main thrust of the report of the review group and a special project team representative of all the main stakeholders, including the Prison Service, has now been established to progress the matter as quickly as possible.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children (Mr. T. O'Malley):</NameTxt>
      <P>A working group was established by my Department in June 2000 to review child and adolescent psychiatry and to finalise a plan for its future development. The first report of the working group on child and adolescent psychiatric services was presented to the Minister on 1 March 2001. The report contains recommendations on the development of services for the management and treatment of attention deficit hyperactivity disorders and hyperactivity kinetic disorder, ADHD-HKD, and proposals for the development of child and adolescent psychiatric in-patient units. The working group recommended that a total of seven in-patient psychiatric units for children ranging from six to 16 years should be developed throughout the country. Project teams have been established in respect of the proposed units in Cork, Limerick, Galway and one in the Eastern Regional Health Authority area at St. Vincent's Hospital, Fairview. The recently published health strategy Quality and Fairness &ndash; A Health System for You includes a commitment to the implementation of the recommendations of the working group's report.</P>
      <P>The development of child and adolescent psychiatric services has been a priority in recent years. In 2002, additional revenue funding of &euro;6.061 million was allocated to provide for the appointment of additional consultants to enhance existing consultant-led multi-disciplinary teams and towards the establishment of further teams. A further &euro;1.64 million was allocated in 2003. Each health board now has funding for a minimum of three consultant-led child and adolescent multi-disciplinary teams.</P>

      <P>I have made inquiries with An Bord Altranais and have been informed that European Directive 77/452/EEC describes the titles and qualifications in the various EU countries that are deemed to have been harmonised to minimum EU standards. Evidence of possession of the title or qualification is sufficient for automatic recognition without further action on application to the competent authority which, in the case of the Republic of Ireland, is An Bord Altranais. Directive 77/453/EEC describes the nature and content of the minimum acceptable training programme. The central components of this are a general school education of ten years duration attested by a diploma, certificate or other formal qualification awarded by the competent authorities or bodies in the member state, or a certificate resulting from a qualifying examination of an equivalent standard of entrance to a nurse training school. Full-time training of a specifically vocational nature which must cover the subjects of the education and training set out in the annex to the directive and comprise a three year course or 4,600 hours of theoretical and practical instruction. No less than one third of the programme should be devoted to theoretical instruction and no less than half the programme devoted to clinical instruction. The annex to the directive provides a detailed breakdown of the theoretical and technical instruction areas within nursing, basic sciences and social sciences. It also provides for the different aspects of clinical instruction required. This directive applies to EU standards for nurse education and training. The competent authorities within member states are empowered to ensure that all nurse education and training programmes within the jurisdiction meet and achieve these minimum standards. An Bord Altranais, as the competent regulatory authority in the Republic of Ireland, uses Directive 77/453/EEC to inform its strategy for assessing applications for registration from non-EU applicants who qualified as nurses in countries outside of the European Union. The assessment also includes reference to relevant post-registration education and relevant post-registration clinical practice. Further information on this matter is available directly from An Bord Altranais.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin):</NameTxt>
      <P>I have expressed my concerns about the issue of alcohol misuse by young people and by society in general on a number of occasions. My Department is already involved in a wide range of partnerships with other Departments and bodies in an effort to tackle this issue. Education programmes have been developed so that young people may be more informed and better equipped to make informed decisions when faced with the issue of alcohol. Children are targeted through the social, personal and health education curriculum's substance misuse prevention programmes &ldquo;Walk Tall&rdquo; and &ldquo;On My Own Two Feet&rdquo;. In accordance with action 43 of the national drugs strategy, the Department of Education and Science in partnership with the health promotion unit of my Department and the health boards, has issued guidelines for developing a school substance abuse policy to all primary and post-primary schools. The national youth health promotion programme with support from the health promotion unit, initiated a national project which provided opportunities for young people aged 14 to 16 years to explore their relationship with alcohol. The health promotion unit of my Department is currently engaged in a three year alcohol awareness campaign entitled &ldquo;Less is More; It's Your Choice&rdquo;. Some phases of the campaign have focused on those who buy or supply alcohol to those underage with a poster and radio messages with the theme of keeping children safe from drink. Also targeted are third level students in the restaurants of colleges with some facts on alcohol and a reminder that alcohol can affect one's finances, studies and health. Youth leaders and health professionals in each of the health board areas are being asked to identify best practice initiatives within communities that promote awareness of alcohol to young people.</P>
      <P>In the college setting, universities and third level institutions came together to formulate a response to a growing concern about alcohol promotion practices and on-campus, high-risk drinking among students and the impact on student academic achievement and student attrition. A framework for the development of a college alcohol policy was developed and each third level institution can adopt the guidelines to reflect the needs and aspirations of their own campus environment.</P>
      <P>One of the recommendations of the strategic task force on alcohol which I established last year concerns limiting the exposure of children and adolescents to alcohol marketing. Officials from my Department will shortly commence preparatory work in relation to this recommendation. The primary aim of this measure will be to protect young people, especially children, from over exposure to alcohol advertising.</P>

      <P>The provision of a school health service for children in primary schools, one element of which comprises vision screening, is the statutory responsibility of the health boards. This service was the subject of a review by the chief executive officers of the health boards which resulted in the launching of &ldquo;Best Health for Children&rdquo; report in 1999. The core programme for child health surveillance set out in the report provides for vision screening in national schools in senior infants, second class and sixth class. The report emphasises the need for adequate training of key professionals, provision and maintenance of appropriate referral and timely and effective treatment services as essential components of the school health service. Additional funding in the region of &euro;2 million was allocated to the health boards and the Eastern Regional Health Authority, ERHA, in 2001 and 2002 to assist in the implementation of the recommendations set out in the &ldquo;Best Health for Children&rdquo;. Further funding of &euro;700,000 was allocated to the boards and the ERHA in 2003 in order to facilitate, in particular, the development and implementation of a national standardised training and development programme in child health screening for health board doctors and public health nurses.</P>
      <P>A national conjoint child health committee, established by the chief executive officers of the health boards, is currently overseeing and monitoring the implementation of the recommendations. Children referred from the school health vision screening service to specialist ophthalmology services provided within the public health service are treated without charge.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="291" /> The provision of health related services, including respite care, to people with disabilities and older people is a matter for the Eastern Regional Health Authority and the health boards in the first instance. Significant levels of additional funding have been provided since 1997 for the maintenance and development of health related services for people with intellectual, physical or sensory disability, those with autism and older people. This additional funding has enabled substantial advances to be made in terms of the quality and quantity of health related services to these care groups. In terms of services for people with intellectual disabilities and those with autism, between 1999 and 2002, around 465 additional dedicated respite places were provided. With specific regard to the services that are available for people with physical and sensory disabilities, I wish to advise the Deputy that additional revenue and capital funding of approximately &euro;195 million has been provided to the Eastern Regional Health Authority and the health boards for the maintenance and development of health related services, including respite care. Between 1997 and 2001, 95 additional respite places were created specifically for this care group. It is acknowledged that funding and places are required and it is my intention that as funding becomes available, further resources will be allocated for the continued development of services for these care groups. Specifically relating to people with physical and sensory disabilities, future resource allocation will be guided by the information available from the national physical and sensory disability database, which will provide an accurate picture of the health service requirements in that sector. In relation to services for older people, health boards have gradually increased the number of respite beds available in their geriatric and district hospitals over the past number of years and new units planned for future years will all have a complement of respite beds.</P>
    <P>In relation to my own Department, in recognition of the valuable service rendered by informal family carers additional financial allocations have been made available to the health boards and the Eastern Regional Health Authority, for the purpose of supplying specific help to such carers by way of respite and assistance in the home. The amounts so provided were &euro;1.27 million in 1999, &euro;1.27 million in 2000, &euro;2.54 million in 2001, and &euro;1.03 million in 2002, totalling over &euro;6 million in the period 1999-2002.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children (Mr. T. O'Malley):</NameTxt>
      <P>Domiciliary care allowance, DCA, is a monthly allowance administered by health boards and may be paid in respect of eligible children from birth to the age of 16 who have a severe disability requiring continual or continuous care and attention which is substantially in excess of that normally required by a child of the same age. The condition must be likely to last for at least one year. Eligibility is determined primarily by reference to the degree of additional care and attention required by the child rather than to the type of disability involved, subject to a means test. While no condition is debarred, conditions such as asthma, diabetes or epilepsy are not normally considered <Col N="293" /> unless there is a very high degree of additional care and attention required. It is a matter for the senior area medical officer or other designated medical officer in the relevant community care area to decide whether or not a child qualifies for DCA on medical grounds. The assessment of and entitlement to the domiciliary care allowance in any individual case is a matter for the relevant health board. My Department has therefore asked the chief executive officer, South-Eastern Health Board, to investigate the matter raised by the Deputy and reply to him directly.</P>

      <P>Each health board is obliged to ensure that an equitable, accessible and comprehensive family planning service is provided in its area. The Department issued guidelines to the health boards in 1995 on the provision of family planning services to all persons in their area who need such services. These services are provided primarily through general practitioners, non-governmental organisations and, to some extent, maternity hospitals/units.</P>
      <P>Significant additional funding has been provided for the development of family planning and pregnancy counselling services since 1995. The additional amount allocated to the health boards for 2002 was &euro;0.922 million. An additional &euro;5.73 million has been provided between 1999 and 2002. In addition, the Eastern Regional Health Authority allocates approximately &euro;0.890 million annually to pregnancy counselling agencies operating on a national basis.</P>
      <P>In recent years health boards have been asked to concentrate on particular measures aimed at reducing unwanted pregnancies in the 15-34 age group, and they have since been engaging in a number of initiatives. The Crisis Pregnancy Agency, which has received an allocation of &euro;5.791 million for 2003, will also be working with the health boards and other agencies, in this regard.</P>

      <P>Substantial progress has been made in recent years in ensuring that those in need of mental health services receive care and treatment in the most appropriate setting. In this regard, health boards have developed, and are continuing to develop, a modern comprehensive community-based mental health service.

When the Act is fully operational, the Mental Health Commission will be required to operate a scheme to provide legal aid to patients whose detention is being reviewed by a mental health tribunal, thus providing legal advocacy to patients.</P>
      <P>Some groups in the voluntary sector including the Irish Advocacy Network, have been providing advocacy services to patients and families of the mentally ill for some time. The expertise of the voluntary agencies in this area will be of great benefit in the further development of such services in the coming years. Some &euro;251,000 was provided by my Department to health boards and voluntary agencies for the development of independent advocacy services in 2002.

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 413 and 432 together.</P>
      <P>Entitlement to health services in Ireland is primarily based on means. Under the Health Act 1970, determination of eligibility for medical cards is the responsibility of the chief executive officer of the appropriate health board other than for persons aged 70 years and over, who are automatically eligible for a medical card. Medical cards are issued to persons who, in the opinion of the chief executive officer, are unable to provide general practitioner medical and surgical services for themselves and their dependants without undue hardship.</P>
      <P>Persons aged 16 to 25, including students, who are financially dependent on their parents are entitled to a medical card if their parents are medical card holders. Those who are dependants of non-medical card holders are not normally entitled to a medical card except where they have an entitlement under EU regulations or where they are in receipt of a disability allowance. Students who are financially independent of their parents are entitled to apply for a medical card in their own right and are assessed on the same criteria as all other applicants. The decision on whether or not a person is regarded as a dependant or as being financially independent is made by the chief executive officer of the health board on the basis of the circumstances of each individual case. It is open to all persons to apply to the chief executive officer of the appropriate health board for health services if they are unable to provide these services for themselves or their dependants without hardship. There have been no consultations between my Department and the Department of Education and Science on this issue.</P>

      <P>The two Departments in question have, in recent years, made considerable progress in improving the situation of informal family carers. The Department of Social and Family Affairs provided assistance through the medium of the carer's allowance and, in particular, by gradually easing the qualification criteria for receipt of the allowance. In relation to my own Department, in recognition of the valuable service rendered by informal family carers, additional financial allocations have been made available to the health boards and the Eastern Regional Health Authority for the purpose of supplying specific help to such carers by way of respite and assistance in the home. The amounts so provided were &euro;1.27 million in 1999, &euro;1.27 million in 2000, &euro;2.54 million in 2001, and &euro;1.03 million in 2002, totalling over &euro;6 million in the period 1999-2002. Additional funding amounting to &euro;7.527 million has also been allocated for home help development in the period 1999-2002 and &euro;11.79 million has been allocated, in respect of the same period, for community supports. Both of these provisions have substantially improved the position of carers.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin):</NameTxt>
      <P>The Eastern Regional Health Authority and each of the seven health boards are responsible for the provision of ambulance services in their functional areas. Policy on the development of emergency medical services in Ireland is set out in a number of documents, including the health strategy, Quality and Fairness &ndash; A Health System for You, the strategic review of the ambulance service, 2001, and Building Healthier Hearts, the Government's cardiovascular health strategy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There have been significant developments in the ambulance service in recent years including a major upgrading in training and standards; the equipping of emergency ambulances with defibrillators and the training of ambulance personnel in their use; the development of a suite of standard operating procedures, SOPs, which draw on current best evidence in key area of concern to those working in the emergency ambulance service and provide a clear approach to assess<Col N="302" /> ment and treatment and are an important step in developing the focus on clinical effectiveness; and progress in upgrading the ambulance fleet and equipment. Improvements in communication equipment and control operations have also been a feature of developments. Many of the developments have occurred in the context of rapidly increasing demands and expectations, and continuing technological and medical advances. As a consequence of these developments the emergency ambulance service now provides a more significant level of service in the pre-hospital emergency care setting.</P>
    <P>The increasing emphasis on the clinical aspects of the emergency medical technician's role in emergency medical care is very much in evidence in the development of the emergency medical services worldwide. As these services continue to evolve and become more sophisticated the need for high quality education for EMTs increases. Educational programmes are being developed as part of a quality assurance and quality improvement process which provide personnel with appropriate knowledge and skills to ensure maintenance of accepted standards of care practice. These programmes are being developed by the pre-hospital emergency care council, whose primary function is to develop appropriate standards in pre-hospital emergency care. It is in this context that the council is pursuing the development of professional and performance standards for the ambulance services, and for ambulance service personnel, in addition to the accreditation of institutions providing training for EMTs. As part of the educational process, ambulance crews are trained to a high level of professional competence to enable them to fulfil their role in dealing with all emergency responses in the pre-hospital care setting.</P>
    <P>The cardiovascular health strategy clearly highlights the importance of patient-centred pre-hospital care involving not only the ambulance service but general practitioners, first responders and the public at large, who all have a role to play in providing the right care at the right time. In line with this approach, services are being developed to provide an appropriate level of care in the community to deal with cardiac emergencies.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied with the progress made to date in the development of this vital service. I recognise that more needs to be done and in this regard I would like to assure the Deputy that my Department will continue to pursue policy initiatives aimed at improving key aspects of the emergency medical services in order to ensure that those calling on the service receive timely and appropriate care.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 418 and 421 together.</P>
      <P>Since 1997, there has been an increase of more than 28,000 or 42% in the approved employment ceiling for the health services, bringing the authorised employment ceiling to 96,000, excluding home helps. The chief executive officer of each health board, who has responsibility for recruitment of staff and defining service priority in his or her region, has latitude in line with the service planning process to prioritise services and to vary the staffing mix as appropriate.</P>
      <P>The national task force on medical staffing is currently completing its first report, which will make recommendations on, among other issues, the number of consultants and non-consultant hospital doctors that will be required in the coming years to provide a high-quality, consultant-based service. These recommendations will be made in the context of the requirement under the European Working Time Directive that doctors should work an average of no more than 48 hours per week by 1 August 2009. The task force's report will take account of the health strategy, which indicates that there will be a significant increase in the number of consultants, the report of the Forum on Medical Manpower and the report of the national joint steering group on the working hours of NCHDs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In March 2001, Peter Bacon and Associates published Current and Future Demand Conditions in the Labour Market for Certain Professional Therapists, which was a workforce planning study of certain health and social care professionals. Significant progress has been made in boosting the number of therapy training places in line with the recommendations of that report. In May 2002 I announced, in conjunction with the Minister for Education and Science, an additional 175 therapy training places in physiotherapy, occupational therapy and speech and language therapy. In July 2002 a comprehensive report on the nursing and midwifery resource, Towards Workforce Planning, was published. Recruitment and retention of nurses and midwives has been an issue of concern in recent years. Developments in relation to the education of nurses have coincided with a dramatic increase in the number of places available for nursing students. This year, 1,640 nursing training places are available, 58% higher than the number available in 1998. In addition, there are now more than 800 places available on specialist postgraduate courses <Col N="304" /> including accident and emergency, coronary care and oncology. A comprehensive package of incentives, including payment of fees and other financial supports, are available to nurses undertaking these courses.</P>
    <P>It is my intention that the appropriate measures will be taken, in line with the recommendations contained in the three reports that I have mentioned, to ensure an adequate supply of medical, nursing and health and social care professionals for our health services into the future.</P>

      <P>The health strategy outlines a programme of investment and reform of the health services up to 2011. As part of the preparatory work for the strategy, my Department, in conjunction with the Department of Finance and in consultation with the social partners, conducted a comprehensive review of acute hospital bed capacity needs. On foot of the subsequent report, Acute Hospital Bed Capacity &ndash; A National Review, the Government decided, in the context of the strategy, to provide an additional 3,000 beds in acute hospitals over the next ten years. This represents the largest ever concentrated expansion of acute hospital capacity in Ireland. In 2002, I announced the first phase of these additional beds with the commissioning of an extra 709 beds in acute hospitals. I am pleased to inform the House that 520 of these beds are in operation and the remaining beds will be brought into use shortly. My Department is currently addressing the national speciality and regional issues associated with the allocation of the remainder of the 3,000 acute beds. Based on provisional figures provided to my Department by health agencies for the first eleven months of 2002, there was an average of 12,219 acute hospital in-patient beds available.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>A major development programme in two phases, phases 2 and 3A, has been approved and is under way at Naas General Hospital. Construction of phase 2 commenced on site in November 1999. Phase 3A, which includes additional accommodation and enabling works for future phases, phases 3B and 3C, commenced on site as a variation to the phase 2 contract in April 2002. The additional phase 3A accommodation includes a pathology department, further out-patients <Col N="306" /> department facilities and administration accommodation. The planned completion date for phases 2 and 3A is September 2003, with a staged handover of departments that began in August 2002.</P>
    <P>Accident and emergency facilities are currently provided from temporary accommodation and include six treatment cubicles and a single bay resuscitation room. The new facility, which is programmed for handover in March 2003, will include a triage area, eight treatment cubicles, eight observation beds, two bay resuscitation rooms, x-ray room, plaster room, bereavement room and office accommodation. It is anticipated that phases 3B and 3C will be procured on a phased basis with construction planned for commencement in late 2003 with completion in 2004 to 2006. This will include the provision of an extra 62 beds in new accommodation at the hospital. The new facilities for Naas General Hospital will include the following:</P>

    <P>Catering Department</P>
    <P>Mortuary and Post Mortem Facilities</P>
    <P>Waste Management Department</P>
    <P>It is proposed to re-schedule the provision of the hospital sterile supplies department as a separate construction contract. The estimated total cost of the project at 1996 costs was &euro;50 million approximately. This cost excluded inflation to completion and the extra 62 beds and their necessary ancillary support accommodation. The current projected total cost of the entire planned development is &euro;110 million approximately. Spending to date is generally on target with the revised programme agreed with the contractor following the variation to increase the scope of the contract.</P>
    <P>Following a comprehensive review of acute hospital bed capacity needs, the Government decided, in the context of the health strategy, to provide an additional 3,000 beds in acute hospitals over the next ten years. My Department provided funding to the Eastern Regional Health Authority and the health boards for the commissioning of 520 of these additional beds in 2002. This exceeds the target of 450 public beds as announced in the health strategy. In addition, <Col N="307" /> indicative funding has been notified to the ERHA and the health boards for the commissioning of a further 189 beds in the current year. On 23 November 2002 the new ward accommodation provided under phase 2 of the project was successfully opened. The next phase of the development includes provision for a further two wards with a total of 62 beds. Pending completion of this phase, 31 acute beds have been retained in the old hospital building following the commissioning and transfer of services into the new ward block.</P>
    <P>The additional accommodation in the new ward block together with 31 beds in the old hospital has brought the bed complement of Naas General Hospital to 193, including 30 acute psychiatric beds. This is an increase of approximately 60 in the number of beds available and allows for a very substantial increase in the inpatient capacity of the hospital in a very short time period. It is planned to reopen a further 31 beds in the old hospital pending completion of phase 3. A decision will be made on re-opening these beds very shortly based on the availability of staff, the successful operation of the already expanded facilities at the hospital and demand for additional beds. Operation of the additional 62 beds in the old hospital is being funded under the national bed capacity initiative.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin):</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy is aware, the provision of orthodontic treatment to eligible persons is the responsibility of the health boards in the first instance. Entitlement to secondary care orthodontic treatment is determined by reference to orthodontic guidelines, a set of objective clinical criteria applied by health board orthodontists when assessing children's priority of need for treatment. The orthodontic guidelines were issued by my Department in 1985 and are still in use. The orthodontic guidelines are used to ensure that orthodontic resources are prioritised for and applied equitably to the most severe cases. When a health board orthodontist decides that a child is in clinical need of orthodontic treatment in accordance with the criteria, he or she is then placed on a treatment waiting list. The guidelines are intended to enable health boards to identify in a consistent way those in greatest need and to commence timely treatment for them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="308" /> It is widely recognised that decisions made in the private sector regarding orthodontic treatment are based primarily on subjective need and are not based on any evidence linking the orthodontic condition to any aspect of dental ill health. On the other hand, decisions made in health boards are based on prioritised guidelines ensuring that cases are selected for treatment based on the objective severity of the condition.</P>
    <P>I am pleased to advise the Deputy that I have taken a number of measures to improve orthodontic services on a national basis. The grade of specialist in orthodontics has been created in the health board orthodontic service. This year, my Department and the health boards are funding thirteen dentists from various health boards &ndash; including the Eastern Regional Health Authority &ndash; for specialist in orthodontics qualifications at training programmes in Ireland and at two separate universities in the United Kingdom. These 13 trainees for the public orthodontic service are additional to the six dentists who commenced their training last year and one dentist whose specialist training is nearing completion. Thus there is an aggregate of 20 public service dentists currently in training for specialist in orthodontics qualifications. Additional funding of &euro;0.64 million and &euro;0.894 million was provided for these training programmes in 2002 and 2003 respectively. These measures will complement the other structural changes being introduced into the orthodontic service, including the creation of an auxiliary grade of Orthodontic Therapist to work in the orthodontic area.</P>
    <P>In the short-term, I have funded an orthodontic initiative to ease current pressures on the system. Additional funding of &euro;6.729 million was approved for orthodontic services in 2001, of which &euro;4.698 million was to fund an initiative on orthodontic waiting lists. Under the initiative, the ERHA was allocated &euro;2.044 million. This enabled the authority to recruit additional staff, including two consultant orthodontists, and to develop new treatment facilities at Loughlinstown and at the regional orthodontic unit located at St. James's Hospital. My Department has also funded a six-chair orthodontic suite for the Northern Area Health Board, expected to be operational in spring 2003.</P>
    <P>In June 2002, my Department provided additional funding of &euro;5 million from the treatment purchase fund to health boards specifically for the purchase of orthodontic treatment. This funding is enabling boards to provide both additional sessions for existing staff and purchase treatment from private specialist orthodontic practitioners. The ERHA received &euro;1.815 million from the fund for the treatment of cases in this way. Finally, the chief executive officers of the health boards have informed me that at the end of the September 2002 quarter, there were 18,511 patients receiving orthodontic treatment in the public orthodontic service. This is an increase of approximately 1,216 patients in orthodontic treatment when compared with the number of patients <Col N="309" /> receiving treatment in December 2001. I expect that the number of patients receiving orthodontic treatment in the public orthodontic service will continue to increase as the measures that I have taken have a further impact on the service.</P>

Following a recent recruitment competition, staff have been selected and offers of employment have been made. The remaining beds will be commissioned as these staff commence duty.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin):</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 426 and 427 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under the Health Act 1970, determination of eligibility for medical cards is the responsibility of the chief executive officer of the relevant health board. Persons aged seventy and over are automatically eligible for a medical card without reference to their means. In all other cases, the means of the applicant and his or her spouse is taken into account. Medical cards are issued to persons who, in the opinion of the chief executive officer, are unable to provide general practitioner medical and surgical services for themselves and their dependants without undue hardship. Income guidelines are drawn up to assist in the determination of a person's eligibility and these are revised annually in line with the consumer price index. However, the guidelines are not statutorily binding and even in cases where a per<Col N="310" /> son's income exceeds the guidelines, a medical card may still be awarded if the chief executive officer considers that his or her medical needs or other circumstances would justify this.</P>
    <P>Information on the numbers of medical cards issued or withdrawn is not routinely collected by my Department. The matter has been referred to health boards for investigation and direct reply to the Deputy. I am unaware of any change in the protocol being used at health board level to assess eligibility of any category of patient. Persons suffering from specified conditions, including acute leukaemia, who are not already medical card holders may obtain without charge drugs and medicines for the treatment of that condition under the long-term illness scheme. There are no plans to amend the long-term illness scheme to include persons with other forms of cancer.</P>
    <P>Since the implementation of the national cancer strategy, over &euro;130 million has been invested in the development of appropriate treatment and care services for people with cancer. Since 1997, approval has issued for 80 additional consultant posts with support staff. This sum includes an additional &euro;29 million allocated in 2003 for cancer services. This investment will ensure that we continue to address increasing demands in cancer services in such areas as oncology and haematology services, oncology drug treatments and symptomatic breast disease services.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin):</NameTxt>
      <P>The most recent statistics on HIV and AIDS in Ireland published by the national disease surveillance centre, NDSC, are those in relation to the period from January to June 2002. These show that a total of 157 new cases of HIV were diagnosed in Ireland in the first six months of 2002. A total of 110, 70%, of these were diagnosed among heterosexuals. Men who have sex with men, MSM, accounted for 18, 11%, of the newly diagnosed cases. Among injecting drug users, IDUs, there were 14 new cases of HIV. A total of 97, 62%, of all new diagnoses were female. Of the 110 new cases in the heterosexual category 86, <Col N="311" /> 78%, were female. Prevalence among IDUs has reduced from greater than 50% of overall figures in the 1980s to 12.7% of overall figures in 2001. However, recent figures reflect an upward trend in HIV diagnoses in the heterosexual category.</P>
      <P>Since July 2001, data has also been collected by geographic origin. Among the 110 heterosexual cases diagnosed between January and June of last year 80, 73%, were of sub-Saharan African origin. Of the cases born in sub-Saharan Africa, 77% were female. Routine linked antenatal HIV testing, which was introduced in 1999, identifies women with HIV at an early stage in pregnancy and reduces the risk of their baby's acquiring HIV. Since the introduction of this testing programme the perinatal transmission rate, where the positive HIV status of the mother is known antenatally has been less than 2%. The report of the national AIDS strategy committee, which was published in 2000, makes a range of recommendations for dealing with HIV and AIDS over the coming years. My Department, through the national AIDS strategy committee and its sub-committees on education and prevention, surveillance, care and management, is currently working to implement these recommendations.</P>
      <P>The education and prevention sub-committee of NASC is, as part of its work programme for this year, developing a knowledge, attitudes and belief survey in relation to HIV and other sexually transmitted infections. This sub-committee is also currently looking at the development of culturally appropriate awareness materials in respect of HIV and AIDS. Health boards undertake information and awareness activities at regional level and among the issues addressed is the prevention of STIs, including HIV. Health boards work in conjunction with and fund voluntary organisations who work with people who are HIV positive. A number of health boards are also in the process of developing sexual health strategies. These strategies will guide the future direction of services and programmes in their areas.</P>
      <P>The health promotion unit of my Department is also involved in and supports a range of initiatives aimed at preventing and raising awareness of STIs. These initiatives include a national public awareness advertising campaign to promote sexual health which is aimed at men and women in the 18 to 35 age group. The campaign, which has been running for several years in third level colleges, bars, clubs and youth clubs, has recently been revised by the health promotion unit and now targets an increased number of venues. In addition, the unit produces a range of awareness-raising leaflets on HIV and other STIs and safe sex practices. These are available through health promotion departments in each health board area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>More than &euro;4 million in additional funding has been provided to health boards since 1997 to address the problems of HIV and AIDS and other STIs. This has resulted in a substantial <Col N="312" /> increase in the facilities in place. At present there are six consultants specialising in the treatment of HIV, AIDS and STIs. Five of these are in Dublin, one of whom deals with children, and one in Cork. Funding has been provided to the Western Health Board for the appointment of a new infectious diseases consultant.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin):</NameTxt>
      <P>In 2001, I launched the national health strategy, a comprehensive strategic plan for the health system. The strategy is a seven to ten year plan and several key actions will take the full ten years to implement &ndash; for example, the primary care strategy. A detailed progress report on developments in 2002 was given at the reconvened national consultative forum held on 11 November last and a report on progress has also been made available to the Cabinet committee on the health strategy. An additional &euro;694 million has been allocated to the health service for 2003, bringing the total health spend for this year to &euro;8.9 billion, including capital.</P>
      <P>In relation to the health strategy, this provision will enable further advancement in a range of specific areas. Action 78 relates to the provision of additional acute hospital beds for public patients. An extra &euro;53 million in 2003 has been provided for the completion of the programme of 709 additional beds in acute hospitals. The overall investment in bed capacity over 2002 and 2003 is therefore &euro;118 million, including capital. Action 55 relates to a programme of investment to provide the necessary capacity in primary care, acute hospitals and other services. Additional funding of &euro;514 million has been made available to improve health infrastructure further and allow for progress on projects. Action 81 relates to the reduction of waiting times for public patients. A total of &euro;31 million has been made available in 2003 for the treatment purchase fund in addition to substantial base funding of &euro;43 million for the waiting list initiative.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Action 61 relates to the further development of organ transplant services. This year, an additional &euro;4.5 million has been made available for the lung transplant programme at the Mater Hospital, Dublin. Actions 76 and 77 relate to the develop<Col N="313" /> ment of primary care. An additional &euro;10 million has been provided for the development of primary care including GP co-ops and primary care units in 2003. In relation to homelessness &ndash; Action 21 &ndash; a total of &euro;4.2 million in additional funding has been provided, consisting of &euro;2.7 million targeted at adult homelessness and &euro;1.5 million targeted at youth homelessness. A further &euro;6 million has been provided for the development of childcare services, including family support services, under Action 27. An additional &euro;7.6 million will be invested in mental health services this year under Action 25. An additional &euro;28.4 million has been provided for 2003 to improve services for people with disabilities and to develop further the availability of appropriate care in an appropriate setting under Actions 54 and 55.</P>
    <P>An additional sum of &euro;29 million has been allocated for cancer services this year. This investment will enable us to continue to address increasing demands in cancer services in such areas as oncology and haematology services, oncology drug treatments and symptomatic breast disease services under Action 12. Additional funding of &euro;7 million has been provided for the further implementation of the cardiovascular strategy under Action 5. Further funding of &euro;12.6 million has been made available in 2003 for services for older people under Actions 26 and 55. Additional funding of &euro;2.4 million has been provided for palliative care under Action 31.</P>
    <P>My Department is currently engaged in discussions with the health boards on their service plans for 2003 which detail, <i>inter alia,</i> their plans for the continued implementation of the strategy this year. In relation to Action 89 of the health strategy, it is hoped that the negotiation of a new consultants' contract will commence soon. Much of the foundation for these talks has been put in place, with my Department successfully negotiating the introduction of a revised grievance and disputes procedure with the consultants' representative bodies. In addition, discussions regarding a revised administrative leave scheme for consultants have been productive, although this has yet to be finalised.</P>
    <P>It is my Department's intention that the talks on a new contract will take cognisance of the recommendations made in the report of the Forum on Medical Manpower, the Hanley report on NCHD working hours, the forthcoming report of the task force on medical staffing and other recent reports. The implementation of these recommendations will lead to increased productivity, greater flexibility in work practices, enhanced team working and improved accountability of consultants in their provision of public health services. Particular emphasis will obviously be placed on the intention, outlined in the health strategy, to provide a more equitable system of health care for public patients. This will necessitate improved access for public patients, the restructuring of services to provide greater focus on the public patient and the improvement in the development of services for public patients. <Col N="314" /> There is no doubt that implementation of the strategy involves challenges for everyone in the health system. Its implementation must be underpinned by strong management of our economy. That is our best guarantee that the health strategy will be delivered.</P>

      <P>I have responsibility for specifying the standards with which motor vehicles must comply for entry-into-service and in-use purposes in Ireland. All new cars sold in the European Union must have whole vehicle type approval, WVTA. WVTA requires cars to meet the requirements set out in a series of separate directives, of which there are currently 46, which set out mandatory safety and environmental protection standards. The standards specified in these type approval directives have been adopted at EU level following extensive consultation with vehicle manufacturing interests and with member states. Vehicles with such approval cannot be refused access to the market in the EU.</P>
      <P>It is a condition for the registration of a new car by the Revenue Commissioners that the application for registration includes a certificate of conformity from the car manufacturer declaring that the vehicle complies with all relevant type approval directives. The EU type approval process includes mechanisms for dealing with irregularities and defects in type approved vehicles. There are remedies available under contract and consumer protection legislation whereby an aggrieved vehicle owner may pursue complaints against the seller of a defective motor vehicle. In addition, the Society of the Irish Motor Industry operates a free service for investigating unresolved complaints against members through its motor industry tribunal. The Road Traffic (Construction, Equipment and Use of Vehicles) Regulations 1963 to 2003 set out mandatory requirements relating to the construction and use of vehicles. Enforcement of these regulations is a matter for the Garda Síochána.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. Brennan Mr. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Transport (Mr. Brennan):</NameTxt>
      <P>My Department received a complaint in August 2000 from a private bus operator that Bus Éireann was competing, contrary to section 25 of the Road Transport Act 1958, with new licensed services that the operator had introduced in July 2000. Bus Éireann is exempt from licensing under the Road Transport Act 1932. However, the company is bound under section 25(1) of the Transport Act 1958 to seek the consent of the Minister if it wishes to initiate or alter services so as to compete with a licensed service. Following consideration of the complaint, I concluded that Bus Éireann had initiated passenger road services from Cavan to Dublin from Monday to Friday at 6 a.m. and 7 a.m. and a service from Cavan to Dublin on Sunday at 7 p.m. which competed with a licensed passenger road service under licence No. 00021 for services on the Cavan to Dublin route departing Cavan at 6.30 a.m. Monday to Friday in respect of the stop at Cavan only; and with a licensed passenger road service under licence No. 00022 for services on the Killeshandra to Dublin route departing Cavan at 7 p.m. on Sunday in respect of the stops at Cavan and Virginia only. I also concluded that Bus Éireann did not seek or obtain ministerial consent to operate the services complained of and that it was therefore in breach of section 25 of the 1958 Act.</P>
      <P>Preliminary notice of the findings of the investigation was forwarded to the company in May 2001. Following receipt and consideration of further documentation from the parties concerned and advice from the Attorney General's office, my Department wrote to Bus Éireann in January 2002 advising it that it appeared to be in breach of section 25 of the 1958 Act and that consideration was being given to issuing a direction to Bus Éireann under section 25(3) of the Transport Act 1958 requiring it to cease its above mentioned services, and inviting the company's observations. Following further consideration of the matter, Bus Éireann was advised in November 2002 of my decision that the company had been found to be in breach of section 25(1) of the Transport Act 1958 and was directed to cease the provision of services at the stops and times in question by 31 December 2002. The company's attention was also drawn to the option of seeking ministerial consent to initiate services in competition with those of a licensed operator.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It was assumed that giving the company over six weeks in which to withdraw services would provide sufficient notice to enable Bus Éireann to advise members of the public and indeed to make an application for consent to operate the services if it so wished. It would appear that the company did not provide adequate notice to passengers and details have been requested from Bus Éireann of the notice provided to passengers and <Col N="316" /> local staff. In early January, the company formally requested consent under section 25 of the 1958 Act to operate services from the stops in question. My Department has considered the application for consent from Bus Éireann and legal advice from the Attorney General's office and is finalising its recommendations to me in relation to this matter. In accordance with legal advice from the Attorney General's office, both Bus Éireann and the licensed private operator will be asked to provide observations on my Department's recommendations. Any observations received will be considered in reaching a final decision on the request for consent.</P>

      <P>I am not in favour of closing rail lines. In this context, my Department has engaged consultants to undertake a strategic review of the Irish railways to provide the Government with a basis for establishing a strategic policy framework for the future development of the rail passenger and rail freight sector in Ireland. The review will provide a framework for future rail development in Ireland over the next 20 years, having regard to the spatial planning context provided by the various land use and transportation studies undertaken around the country; the extensive public transport investment programme under the national development plan; relevant findings and conclusions of the publication, Iarnród Éireann &ndash; The Way Forward; and the desirability of rail freight services, to include consideration of existing freight capacity and its potential for development.</P>
      <P>I am of the view that an effective rail freight system is important to sustained national economic development. I have already conveyed my views to the chairman of CIE that no decisions should be taken on the withdrawal of freight services until the review has been published. The board of CIE at its meeting of 6 November 2002 agreed to postpone any decisions in this regard. I expect to publish the strategic rail review shortly.</P>

I refer the Deputy to my reply to Question No. 80 of Wednesday, 5 February 2003, which sets out the position regarding the holder of a provisional licence being accompanied by a person who holds a driving licence for the category of vehicle being driven.

      <P>As I stated in my reply to Question No. 950 of 29 January 2003, issues relating to the current tax incentive schemes for park and ride facilities are primarily a matter for the Minister for Finance. Statistics from local authorities on the take-up of these tax incentives are currently being compiled by my Department and will be examined in conjunction with the Department of Finance. Any changes to the tax incentive scheme would be a matter for the Minister for Finance. It is recognised that park and ride is a key element of an integrated transport system and, to this end, the Government provided specific funding for rail-based park and ride in 1999 and 2000. Park and ride facilities have also been incorporated into the planning of the Luas system. The size of the city limits the role for bus-based park and ride in Dublin. However, the pilot project being undertaken by the office of the director of traffic will be monitored to assess the potential for further projects in the future.</P>

      <P>The Luas line from Sandyford to St. Stephen's Green is being constructed in accordance with a light railway order granted by my predecessor following a public inquiry into proposals for the line. The inquiry examined all issues related to the construction of a light railway along the line, including the safety implications. I am assured by the Railway Procurement Agency, the body responsible for managing the Luas project, that all conditions associated with the order are being complied with in full. The necessary capital funding, as identified by the RPA, for completion of the line is in place.</P>

      <P>On 19 November 2002 the Government approved the establishment of the Office of the National Taxi Regulator and a Taxi Advisory Commission, initially on a non-statutory basis, pending the development of legislative proposals. The preparation of the necessary legislation is proceeding as a matter of urgency in my Department and I expect to be in a position to submit the heads of a Bill to Government soon. I also expect that recruitment of a regulator and associated administrative staff will proceed shortly, following discussions with the Department of Finance. I am also examining proposals for interim measures to ensure that issues relating to standards and implementation of the findings of the taxi hardship panel are addressed in advance of the appointment of a full time regulator.</P>

      <P>On 17 December 2002 the Government approved the implementation on a phased basis of the recommendations of the taxi hardship panel in accordance with An Agreed Programme for Government. Any payments to be made as a result of this implementation will not represent compensation but rather compassionate payments in respect of extreme personal financial hardship <Col N="319" /> arising from the liberalisation of the taxi market. The design and administration of a scheme to implement the recommendations of the panel will be carried out by the Office of the National Taxi Regulator as this will ensure that applications are dealt with on a confidential and objective basis.</P>
      <P>The regulator, when appointed, will be in charge of the determination of criteria and conditions for the making of payments, having regard to the categorisation and specific recommendations identified in the report of the panel. The regulator will also invite applications and determine appropriate levels of payments within the amounts determined to be appropriate in the report. In pursuing this task, it is envisaged that the regulator will consult with relevant Government Departments and agencies.</P>

      <P>The Minister shall review the operation of this Act, within two years of the coming into operation of this section, with a view to assessing whether there is a need to add to the discriminatory grounds set out in this section.</P>
      <P>A similar provision was subsequently included in the Equal Status Act 2000.</P>
      <P>As part of the review of the 1998 Act, a discussion paper was produced by my Department and a round table conference involving the social partners, relevant Departments, the Equality Authority, the Office of the Director of Equality Investigations and the Labour Court was held in September 2001.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="324" /> At the conference some participants argued that the Employment Equality Act, 1998, should be amended to include the new ground of criminal conviction-ex-prisoner-ex-offender as well as three other new grounds &ndash; socio-economic status, including social origin or social origin as a separate ground, trade union membership and political opinion. It was acknowledged that these new grounds are complex in terms of definition and that the practical implications of including the proposed new grounds would require detailed examination.</P>
    <P>It has been decided to carry out a survey of international experience of legislation in the above mentioned areas. The research has recently been completed and will be published shortly. The findings of this research and the information obtained through my Department's consultations will inform any future policy decisions.</P>
    <P>The second programme of the Law Reform Commission for the period 2000 to 2007 proposes, as part of an examination of the law on privacy, to consider longevity of criminal records and expunging of certain offences from the records. I will consider any recommendations which the Law Reform Commission may make on the matter and bring forward any necessary legislative proposals in the normal way.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. McDowell Mr. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. McDowell):</NameTxt>
      <P>While I have general responsibility for the liquor licensing laws in my capacity as Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, certain other Ministers, and their respective <Col N="327" /> Departments, have responsibilities in relation to particular aspects. For example, the Minister for Health and Children has responsibilities for public health policy, while road safety legislation comes within the ambit of the Minister for Transport. The granting of intoxicating liquor licences and their renewal is generally a matter for the courts, while enforcement of legislative provisions is the responsibility of the Garda.</P>
      <P>With regard to young people, the licensing laws contain a comprehensive set of provisions designed to tackle the problem of underage drinking. The primary purpose of these provisions is to make it as difficult as possible for persons under 18 years of age to procure alcohol. The main legislative provisions relating to underage drinking are set out in Part IV of the Intoxicating Liquor Act 1988. The Intoxicating Liquor Act 2000 provided for a considerable strengthening of the law in relation to the supply or sale of alcohol to underage persons, including temporary closure of licensed premises convicted of selling or supplying alcohol to such persons.</P>
      <P>As regards the violence and crime associated with excessive drinking, the Garda already have extensive powers under existing legislation to deal with public order offences. The Criminal Justice (Public Order) Bill 2002, will, when enacted, give the Garda significant additional powers in dealing with drunkenness and disorderly conduct. I also intend to bring proposals to Government as soon as possible to strengthen legislative provisions in relation to drunkenness, as well as violent, and disorderly conduct on licensed premises, in line with the recommendations of the Commission on Liquor Licensing in its most recent report.</P>
      <P>Alcohol consumption here has increased significantly over the past decade. We have reached the stage where there is a much greater awareness of the extent of alcohol related problems in our society. The licensing laws have an essential role to play in combating alcohol related harm, including underage consumption of alcohol. However, action is required on a much broader front. The drinks industry, the licensed trade, sporting organisations, the media and not least parents have important roles to play in addressing the problems that we face in this area.</P>

      <P>I am kept informed on an ongoing basis by the Garda authorities on the problem of joyriding.</P>
      <P>In response to the problem, operational strategies have been put in place by local Garda management in areas that have been identified as potential hot spots for joyriding. Specialist patrols and vehicles are concentrated in these areas to deal with public order and joyriding incidents.</P>
      <P>The Garda are constantly liaising with community groups and a number of projects are in operation which have proved valuable in dealing with offenders.</P>
      <P>The Garda and local authorities are working together in relation to estate management and reducing the opportunities for joyriding. For example, physical changes such as barriers and speed ramps are being used to reduce access to areas frequented by youths engaged in these activities.</P>
      <P>I am assured by the Garda authorities that they are satisfied the provisions of the Road Traffic Acts, 1961 to 2002, are adequate to deal with situations where persons use or take possession of mechanically propelled vehicles without the consent of the owner.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. McDowell):</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 473 and 474 together.</P>
      <P>As I informed the House in response to Question No. 854 on 29 January last, under the Guardianship of Infants Act 1964, as amended, an unmarried father may become a guardian of his child by means of a statutory declaration made jointly with the mother. Alternatively, he may apply to the court to be appointed a guardian of his child. Even where the unmarried father is not a guardian of the child he may apply to the court, under section 11(4) of the Guardianship of Infants Act, for custody or access. In determining whether an unmarried father should be appointed guardian or granted custody or access, the court has to regard the welfare of the child as the first and paramount consideration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I repeat my belief that, where possible and subject to the child's welfare, it is desirable that chil<Col N="329" /> dren should have the benefit of an upbringing which involves both parents.</P>
    <P>Information available to my Department on the position in other European countries indicates that, as in Ireland, particular regard must be had to the welfare of the child in deciding on questions of custody and access. In regard to the situation of non-marital children, it appears to be common in European countries that automatic parental responsibility rests only with the mother but that the father can acquire parental responsibility by agreement with the mother or by order of a court. The position in many European countries appears to be broadly similar to here in that respect.  </P>

      <P>The primary legislative framework for the protection and improvement of water quality is provided by the Local Government (Water Pollution) Act 1977, amended and extended by the Local Government (Water Pollution) (Amendment) Act 1990. These Acts include a general prohibition on the polluting of waters, provisions concerning licensing of discharges to waters and to sewers, the establishment and application of water quality standards, the making of water quality management plans by local authorities, the making of nutrient management plans by farmers etc., the civil liability of polluters, the making of by-laws by local authorities to regulate agricultural activities and related matters. They also provide for the making of water quality management plans by two or more local authorities on an integrated basis, that is to include surface and ground waters, including estuarine and tidal waters, and this provides the basis for river basin district management plans. Some measures required in each river basin district may be provided through by-laws to be made by local authorities.</P>
      <P>In addition, a number of the current functions of the EPA and other public authorities in relation to aspects of water management will also assist implementation of the directive.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A new water services Bill is at an advanced stage of preparation. In the context of consolidating and modernising the existing statutory framework for water services provision, the Bill will provide for improved management of national water services infrastructure through a strategic planing process which will contribute to the achievement of the objectives of the framework directive. Specifically, the Bill will secure the transposition of the cost recovery requirements in respect of non domestic users of water services required by article 9 of the directive, although <Col N="333" /> this will essentially involve a restatement of the existing statutory position.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 484, 501 and 504 together.</P>
      <P>The termination of the new house grant scheme, which was announced on 14 November 2002, arose from the necessity, in the context of the 2003 Estimates, for the Government to ensure a sustainable match between expenditure and resources, and to concentrate housing programmes on areas of greatest impact and social need.</P>
      <P>Regulations setting out the circumstances on which new house grants would be paid after 14 November 2002 came into force on the day of the announcement. My Department published an advertisement in the national press on 15 November 2002 setting out the conditions for new house grant payment as stipulated in the statutory regulations. A further reminder was published in the press on Friday 29 November 2002. Both press advertisements clearly stated that the closing date for receipt of applications was 4 December 2002. This information was also available on my Department's website at www.environ.ie.</P>
      <P>As applications received after 4 December 2002 did not respect the well publicised deadline they cannot be admitted.</P>
      <P>It is not proposed to review the basis on which the scheme was terminated or to reintroduce the grant.</P>

      <P>Reports from local government auditors are not intended to provide the principal basis on which the allocation by my Department of grants to local authorities is made. In general, grants are allocated to local authorities on the basis of specific schemes or programmes proposed by them. In the case of general purpose grants from the local government fund, the 2003 allocations were determined on the basis of an across the board percentage increase to all local authorities, a cash increase of differing amounts to all authorities, a contribution in respect of the operational costs of new water services schemes and an amount determined by reference to the needs and resources model. Amongst other things, the model takes account of various expenditure and income details submitted by local authorities. In the case of income, this may include revenue from parking fees and fines, although the particular amounts of such revenue need not be specifically identified.</P>

      <P>Primary responsibility for the management of any waste lies with the holder or producer of the waste. The Waste Management Act 1996 prohibits any person from holding, transporting, recovering or disposing of waste in a manner which causes or is likely to cause environmental pollution defined in section 5 to include action which would to a significant extent endanger human health.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The European Communities (Protection of Workers)(Exposure to Asbestos) (Amendment) Regulations 2000 implement article 7 of Council Directive 87/217/EEC on the prevention and reduction of environmental pollution by asbestos by amending the requirements of the plan, provided for in article 12 of Directive 83/477/EEC, which must be prepared prior to any demolition work involving asbestos. The effect of the amending regulations is to ensure that the demolition of buildings, structures and installations containing asbestos and the removal therefrom of asbestos or materials containing asbestos fibres or dust do not cause significant environmental pollution; the regulations also provide for the protection of workers on the site. This plan must be made <Col N="338" /> available on request to, <i>inter alia,</i> an inspector of the Health and Safety Authority.</P>
    <P>In addition, the Air Prevention Act 1987 provides a basis for a local authority to monitor the nature, extent and effects of such emissions, including asbestos emissions, as the local authority may consider necessary for the performance of its functions under the Act or as they may be directed by the Minister to carry out.</P>
    <P>The movement of hazardous waste including asbestos waste, within the State is subject to a notification procedure, involving the provision of consignment notes to local authorities of dispatch and destination. The Waste Management (Movement of Hazardous Waste) Regulations 1998 also transpose EU requirements regarding the labelling of waste containers and the mixture of wastes. Article 7 of the Waste Management (Hazardous Waste) Regulations 1998 prohibits emissions of asbestos fibres or dust during transport of such waste.</P>
    <P>The EPA is responsible for waste licensing, and is empowered under relevant waste management licensing regulations to attach conditions to licences to give effect to provisions of EU directives, including Council Directive 87/217/EEC on the prevention and reduction of environmental pollution by asbestos.</P>
    <P>An information leaflet entitled Asbestos in your Home, Briefing Sheet 29, is available from ENFO, my Department's public information service on environmental matters. This includes advice on the maintenance of asbestos materials, and their removal and disposal. The leaflet advises the public to contact the Health and Safety Authority to obtain information in relation to the handling and use of asbestos. Relevant advice on the disposal of asbestos would also be available on request from local authorities and the Environmental Protection Agency.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment and Local Government (Mr. Cullen):</NameTxt>
      <P>The administration of the disabled persons grant scheme is a matter for individual local authorities, in this case, North Tipperary County Council. The council wrote to my Department recently outlining their financial position on the scheme arising from increased demand and making proposals for changes in its funding and implementation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is a matter for local authorities to decide on the level of funding to be provided for the dis<Col N="339" /> abled persons grant scheme in their areas from within the combined capital allocation notified to them by my Department for house purchase and reconstruction loans and disabled persons and essential repairs grants. My Department also recoups to local authorities two thirds of their expenditure on the payment of individual grants. The balance must be funded at local authority level from a local authority's own resources. While it is open to a local authority to seek a higher allocation from my Department in the event of increased demand, increased expenditure by a local authority on this scheme would also involve an upward revision of the authority's provision from its own resources.</P>
    <P>The significant improvements made in recent years to the maximum grant and level of recoupment available have resulted in increased levels of activity with expenditure on the scheme increasing from &euro;15.8 million in 1999 to &euro;41.7 million in 2001. The figures for 2002 are currently being compiled. In line with this increase in the Department's capital provision for the scheme, recoupment costs have also increased significantly from &euro;6.3 million for 2,512 grants in 1998 to almost &euro;31.5 million for 5,070 grants in 2002. In the case of north Tipperary County Council alone recoupment has risen from &euro;137,000 for 48 grants in 1998 to &euro;688,000 for 98 grants in 2002. This very significant increase in the level of funding provided is a clear indication of the Government's commitment to the disabled persons grant scheme. However, local authorities have the responsibility of managing the scheme within the funding possibilities afforded to them.</P>
    <P>The contents of the letter from north Tipperary County Council are being examined in my Department and a reply will issue as soon as possible. The operation of the disabled persons grant scheme is being reviewed in the Department and the Council's proposals for its modification will be considered in this context.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment and Local Government (Mr. Cullen):</NameTxt>
      <P>Article 4 of the European Directive on the Conservation of Wild Birds (79/409/EEC) requires member states, including Ireland, to designate special protection areas, SPAs, for wild birds. Under the directive, the selection of sites for designation is based on scientific criteria. Recent proposals in this regard were notified in November 2002, when my Department published proposals to designate the Shannon Callows as a SPA, and in March 2002, when proposals to designate 34 new SPAs or extensions to existing sites were published.</P>
      <P>The consultation procedures operated by my Department's heritage service involves notification in writing of all known affected landowners in the areas proposed for designation. In addition, and against the possibility that ownership of all land holdings cannot be ascertained by my Department, advertisements are placed in local newspapers and on local radio notifying interested parties of the intention to designate these areas. Notices are also displayed in Garda stations; local authority offices; local offices of Department of Social and Family Affairs; local offices of Department of Agriculture and Food and local Teagasc offices. The consultation procedures also encompass notification of relevant local authorities, Departments and other interested bodies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A period of three months is allowed for making objections. Where my Department does not propose, following initial assessment, to recommend the amendment of a cSAC envisaged in an objection, the Appeals Advisory Board is available to assist in the assessment of objections by carrying out a further review of cases referred to it and making an independent recommendation to the <Col N="342" /> Minister for the Environment and Local Government. The board comprises balanced representation from landowner-user organisations and conservation bodies under an independent chairperson.</P>
    <P>In view of the above, I consider that the consultation process in relation to proposed designation of SPAs is adequate and appropriate.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs (Mr. N. Ahern):</NameTxt>
      <P>The students summer jobs scheme was first introduced in 1993 to provide income support for less well off students who were disqualified under social welfare legislation from receiving unemployment assistance during the summer months. The scheme allowed students to take up part-time work useful to their community and to receive payment for this work.</P>
      <P>When the scheme was introduced unemployment levels in Ireland were among the highest in the EU and students found it difficult during the holiday period to obtain work. In the past five years, however, the take up has been dropping significantly, from 13,500 in 1998 to 4,600 in 2002. This decline reflects the greater and wider availability of alternative and well paid summer jobs in recent years. In view of the above and in light of the financial pressures on my Department, it has been decided to discontinue the students summer jobs scheme. I have, however, requested the area based partnerships to consider alternative measures to assist students from disadvantaged areas in finding suitable summer employment.</P>
      <P>The number of places available on the scheme, that is, jobs offered by sponsors, in the past five years and the number of students who availed of those places is indicated in the following table.</P>

      <P>My Department shares joint responsibility for two of the measures in the INTERREG III Ireland-Northern Ireland Programme, Priority 1, measure 4 on rural development with my Northern Ireland counterpart, the Department of Agriculture and Rural Development, Northern Ireland, and on Priority 3, measure 1 concerning the development of cross-Border community infrastructure with my Northern Ireland counterpart the Department of Social Development, Northern Ireland.</P>
      <P>There are no projects agreed with our counterparts on either measure as they are not yet open for application. The strategic focus of the rural initiative measure is on the development of integrated area based strategies to address rural disadvantage. The measure is aimed at area based cross-Border regeneration groups which can be developed, managed, administered and delivered jointly in 4/5 small geographically defined areas of rural disadvantage. The implementation of the measure involves a two stage process, the first being a call for potential cross border partnerships to come forward with proposals for their areas with the successful partnerships then going on to develop the strategies for their areas. The second stage of the process will involve the partnerships making a call for projects in their respective areas.</P>
      <P>Officials of my Department and of the Department of Agriculture and Rural Development in Northern Ireland are working closely to progress the measure and on developing eligibility &ndash; selection criteria to guide the partnerships. These are in the process of being finalised and it anticipated that the call for partnerships will be made within the coming weeks.</P>
      <P>Priority 3, measure, 1 which relates to the development of cross-Border community infrastructure, is not yet open to applications as the arrangements for implementation of the measure have not been finalised.</P>

      <P>The local drugs task forces, LDTFs, were established in 1997 in the areas experiencing the worst levels of drug misuse, particularly heroin. Currently, there are 14 local drugs task forces &ndash; 12 in Dublin, one in Cork, and one in Bray which was designated an LDTF area in 2000. All LDTFs, with the exception of Bray, have prepared two local action plans and funding has been allocated for the implementation of projects within these plans. The projects draw on the funding allocated as they become operational.</P>
      <P>The first set of tables below shows each task force area broken down by project under the first round of funding. The second set of tables shows the allocation for individual projects in each LDTF area under the second round of funding.</P>
      <P>The Deputy should note that allocations to LDTF projects are for a 12 month period. Once evaluated, successful projects are mainstreamed by enabling their on-going provision by statutory agencies. In this context, 122 projects from the first plans were mainstreamed at the start of 2001 at a cost of approximately &euro;11 million.</P>
      <P>The remainder of the projects were either once-off, had delayed starts or are still on interim funding awaiting decisions on mainstreaming.</P>
      <P>The bulk of the projects from the second round of plans will be due for evaluation in 2004.</P>

      <P>My Department has responsibility for the administration of the scheme of community support for older people which provides funding for initiatives to improve the security and social support of vulnerable older people. Under the terms of the scheme, grant aid is available towards the once-off costs of purchase and/or installation of small-scale physical security equipment and socially monitored alarm systems.</P>
      <P>The names and addresses of all organisations funded under the scheme up to 2001 are available in the Oireachtas Library for the information of members. Details of organisations funded in 2002 will be made available shortly. Invitations to apply for funding under this scheme in 2003 will be advertised in the national and local papers later in the year.</P>

      <P>The sale of residence provisions, which were introduced in October 1991, are designed to allow certain people who receive a means tested payment from my Department to sell their principal residence and either buy or rent alternative accommodation or move into a private nursing home.</P>
      <P>These provisions apply to recipients of blind person's pensions, disability allowance and to people aged 66 years or over who receive a means tested payment from my Department and may be availed of in order to live with a recipient of carer's allowance or carer's benefit, where the carer's allowance or carer's benefit recipient is that pensioner's carer, or move to sheltered or special housing in the voluntary, co-operative, statutory or private sectors. This includes people who avail of the financial contribution scheme operated by the local authorities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="356" /> Under these arrangements the balance of the gross proceeds of the sale of the principal residence is exempt from the means test for these payments, subject to a ceiling of &euro;190,461. To qualify for a fuel allowance, the applicant must be in receipt of a qualifying payment and live alone or with: a dependent spouse-partner and-or dependent children; a person who gives the applicant full time care and attention in the case of disabled or semi-invalided persons; a person getting short-term unemployment assistance; or a person who would qualify for payment in their own right and the applicant and the members of the household must be unable to provide the applicant with his-her heating needs. To fulfil this condition, the household must satisfy a means test.</P>
    <P>In the case of contributory pensions such as old age contributory, retirement and invalidity pensions, a person may have a combined household income of up to &euro;50.79 per week or savings-investments of up to &euro;41,901.35 over and above their pension and qualify for fuel allowance. Means in excess of this amount, including money received from the sale of property, are assessed for the purposes of the fuel allowance.</P>

      <P>Details relating to a person's nationality are generally requested and verified when a claim for an unemployment payment is made. Based on these details the following information is available.</P>
      <P>The number of non-European Economic Area nationals in receipt of unemployment assistance and unemployment benefit at 31 January 2003 is 3,162. This represents 1.9% of the live register which stands at 170,701 in that week. Of these, 2,345 were male, 74%, and 817 female, 26%. The numbers with child dependants was 1,809, 57%, and the total number of child dependants was 3,721.</P>
      <P>While persons from non-European Economic Areas are generally not regarded as being available for work due to conditions attaching to entry to Ireland there are some instances in which they may be entitled to sign on the live register. This can arise if they are made redundant or have work hours reduced before expiry of their work permit. Additionally persons admitted to Ireland as programme refugees are permitted to sign on the live register.</P>

      <askee>Minister for Social and Family Affairs</askee>
      <Quest>if she will give detailed consideration to correspondence (details supplied) and in particular the anomalies raised therein as a result of the recent decision to cap rent allowances; if she will take steps to deal with same; and if she will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan" hpid="Mary Coughlan Mary Coughlan">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Social and Family Affairs (Mary Coughlan):</NameTxt>
      <P>Two matters are raised in the correspondence in question. The first concerns the fact that, in general, rent supplement is not payable under the supplementary welfare allowance scheme in cases where the rent incurred is over the maximum allowed by the health board. The requirement for individuals to find accommodation appropriate to their circumstances within the rent limits set by the health board is a standard requirement which has not been changed. The level of rent a person may incur and the amount of supplement payable under the supplementary welfare allowance scheme towards that rent have always been subject to such limits.</P>
      <P>The maximum level of rent, which a person may incur is determined by each health board in respect of its functional area and is set by reference to local property considerations. The decision to continue the existing maximum rent levels until 31 December 2003 was made on the basis of current conditions in the property market. My Department is not aware of any case where the application of a rent cap has resulted in individuals being made homeless.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The second matter raised concerns the fact that, in general, a reduced rate of rent supplement is payable in cases where a person has income over and above the basic rate of sup<Col N="359" /> plementary welfare allowance appropriate to their circumstances. Rent supplements are subject to a means test and are normally calculated to ensure that a person, after the payment of rent, has an income equal to the rate of supplementary welfare allowance appropriate to his-her family circumstances, less a minimum contribution of &euro;12 which recipients are required to pay from their own resources. Many recipients pay more than &euro;12 because they are required to contribute towards their rent any additional assessable means over and above the appropriate supplementary welfare allowance rate.</P>
    <P>Special arrangements are in place to encourage people to take up open-market employment or community employment places, under which they can retain some or all of the additional income that they earn. The position in relation to rent supplement for people who take up places on approved schemes, such as community employment, is that they may retain part of their rent supplement, subject to a gross household income limit of &euro;317.43 per week and certain other conditions. The supplement may be retained on a tapered basis over a four year period. The amount of rent supplement payable is based on the amount of supplement in payment prior to commencing on the scheme. Some 75% is retained in year one, 50% in year two and 25% in years three and four.</P>
    <P>All participants on community employment schemes are entitled to either the gradually reducing amount that can be retained under the transitional arrangements described above or the amount that is normally paid under the standard rules of supplementary welfare allowance, whichever is the greater.</P>
    <P>The standard assessment provides for an income disregard of up to &euro;50 per week in respect of part-time earnings. Therefore, anyone participating in a community employment scheme and who qualifies for a rent supplement would benefit by at least &euro;50 per week.</P>
    <P>The issue of child care costs arises mainly in the context of people taking up employment. However, while arrangements are in place, as described above, to ensure that people taking up employment are better off working, the legislation governing the payment of rent supplement does not provide for the disregard of child care costs in the means test.</P>

      <P>The person concerned, who was in receipt of disability benefit, applied for invalidity pension in April 2002 and, following a medical assessment, was disallowed on the basis that she was not considered to be permanently incapable of work.</P>
      <P>She appealed this decision to the social welfare appeals office and in the context of her appeal she was examined by another medical assessor, who was also of the opinion that she did not satisfy the medical eligibility criteria for invalidity pension.</P>
      <P>The appeals officer has invited her, however, to furnish any further evidence she wishes to submit in support of her invalidity pension appeal and a form was sent to her for this purpose on 6 February 2003.</P>
      <P>In a related development, payment of the person's disability benefit was disallowed from 2 February 2003 on the basis of a finding by the medical assessor that she was capable of work. She has very recently submitted a further appeal against this decision. The appeals office proposes to deal with the two appeals together.</P>

      <P>The maximum level of rent, which a person may incur under the supplementary welfare allowance scheme, is determined by each health board in respect of its functional area and is set by reference to local property considerations. If an individual is unable to secure accommodation at or below the applicable maximum rent level it is open to the health board to provide a payment above the maximum level as an exceptional measure for a limited period. This measure is designed to provide the person concerned with an opportunity to secure alternative accommodation at the applicable rent level.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="361" /> In the area in question the maximum rent that a single parent with one child may ordinarily incur and still qualify for a rent supplement is &euro;953 per month. The health board would have been aware of the availability of properties at that level when they determined their maximum rent levels in 2002. The decision to continue the existing maximum rent levels until 31 December 2003 was based on data furnished by the Central Statistics Office which indicated that rent levels had stabilised and in some cases had fallen. The effects of the rent cap are being monitored on an ongoing basis by my Department. In addition, all aspects of the current system of rent supplements are being reviewed in the context of a review of the supplementary welfare allowance scheme which is currently under way in my Department.</P>

      <P>To benefit under the dental benefit scheme, an insured worker must be treated by a dentist who has an agreement with my Department to provide treatments under the scheme on a contract basis and at fees specified in the agreement. Under these arrangements and with limited exceptions, treatments are provided to the patient either free of charge or at a reduced fee and the Department pays the balance of the cost directly to the dentist at the agreed rates. A person who is treated by a dentist who is not currently participating in the scheme is not entitled to benefit under these arrangements and any costs incurred cannot be refunded under the scheme. This was made clear from the outset through newspaper advertisements which advised workers to check that their dentist was continuing to operate within his contract with the Department and, where appropriate, to use my Departments LoCall service (1890-400-400) to get details of dentists adhering to the agreed fees for treatment.</P>
      <P>Detailed proposals aimed at ending the dispute have been worked out in negotiations over the past two weeks and these are now being considered by the Irish Dental Association.</P>
