      <P>I seek the adjournment of the Dáil under Standing Order 31 to discuss the following matter of national importance, namely, the urgent need, in light of the decision by Glanbia plc. not to proceed with the reconstruction of its plant at Roosky, County Roscommon with the loss of 340 jobs, for the Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment and the Minister for Agriculture and Food to clarify their roles in the reconstruction of the plant at Roosky. There is also a need for the Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment to outline her plans for industrial investment in the area following these job losses and the loss of 300 jobs in Atlantic Mills in Clondra and the postponement of an investment by Cardinal Healthcare Limited which would have created 1,300 jobs in the locality.</P>

      <P>The Dáil shall sit tomorrow at 10.30 a.m. and shall adjourn not later than 4 p.m. There shall be no Order of Business and, accordingly, the following business shall be transacted in the following order: No. 23, statements on audit of health structures, Prospectus report, and the commission into health funding, Brennan report, to conclude at 1.30 p.m. if not previously concluded; and No. 24 &ndash; statements on the World Trade Organisation talks, Cancún, to conclude at 4 p.m. if not previously concluded.

      <P>We do not know what the committee did. It may have decided to reject the order. As usual, we have been given no indication of the committee's wishes or conclusions on the matter. At meetings of the Whips, we have been seeking to find a methodology to ensure some form of report is made available to the House from a committee when matters are referred back. The question before us now is whether it is to be taken without debate but when the formal matter comes before the House we should be given some type of report.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Whips have discussed this issue on numerous occasions and it was indicated to us at the Whips meetings that there would be some developments in this area. All that is required when an issue is referred to a committee and returned to the House by the committee, is that there should be some indication of the committee's opinion. That is a simple thing and it should be done. In that way it will not be necessary to discuss it at this level in future. Is it possible to get a resolution of this matter?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Eamon Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Transport legislation is a bit like waiting for Dublin buses in that one does not see anything for years and then three or four Bills arrive at the same time. It is unacceptable that, having barely finished Second Stage of this important Bill, we are putting it through Committee and Remaining Stages in two and a half hours today. This legislation will have huge significance throughout the country and it is not appropriate to rush it through the House so quickly when we have just completed Second Stage.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Stagg</NameTxt>
      <P>Unusually, I rise to support a guillotine on a Bill. The Labour Party believes there is a degree of urgency with this legislation. It has been well debated so we support the guillotine.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I object to this procedure of arranging debates but giving no opportunity to ask questions of either the Taoiseach or the Tánaiste or to have Question Time or divisions. It is particularly disconcerting that such an important document as the health strategy will be debated in the House without any opportunity to ask the Minister questions about the proposals. Many people are surprised that there can be serious reform without touching the size of the <Col N="977" />bureaucracy and that this will deliver more efficiency. There should be a serious committee-style debate in which Deputies have an opportunity to ask Ministers about the proposals rather than have this bland, anodyne arrangement of statements being read into the record, which will not improve our understanding of or our capacity to reform the health services.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>When Deputy Bruton and I raised this matter on 19 June, the Minister for Defence, Deputy Michael Smith, who was taking the Order of Business said: &ldquo;Deputy Richard Bruton and Deputy Rabbitte were both Ministers in the rainbow Administration which sat on Fridays when there was no Order of Business. . . &rdquo;. I have had this matter researched and discovered there was an Order of Business on Fridays until 1999. I do not know if the Tánaiste remembers the dim, distant, dismal days when she sat on these benches making this type of argument&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="DinnyMcGinley" hpid="Mr. McGinley Mr. McGinley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGinley</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>She is not the only one in a fog. Can the Tánaiste assure the House that this will be the last term in which the Government will seek to use Fridays for a sanitised sitting of the Dáil in which there is no Order of Business, no questions posed and no opportunity for divisions? It is merely a stratagem of the Government to give the impression of adding to the number of sitting days. It is not acceptable practice that Members should come to this Chamber on Thursday mornings and order the business for the following Friday in this fashion and that even the minimal opportunity to raise questions on the Order of Business is denied them. That was not the practice up to 1999.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnGormley" hpid="Mr. Gormley Mr. Gormley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gormley</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the previous speakers that there is a lack of accountability on Fridays. Last week I raised with the Government the fact that there are only three hours to debate an extremely important issue, namely, the health crisis. The Chief Whip seemed to find this amusing but the electorate will not find it amusing, particularly people who are waiting for beds or who cannot get treatment. It is important to send the signal that we are taking this issue seriously and giving a mere three hours to the Prospectus and Brennan reports does not send a positive signal to the electorate. It means, of course, that smaller parties, including the Green Party, will get less than eight minutes to make a contribution. That is not satisfactory. I ask that the time allocation be extended this evening and tomorrow. We need it to discuss these issues.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is also important that more time is given to the Cancún debate. Young people have a great interest in the issue of globalisation but we are giving a mere two and a half hours to this debate. <Col N="978" />If we are to reassert the primacy of politics and not give more power to the WTO, we need to debate this issue at length. People need to see that we take globalisation seriously but allocating two and a half hours to the debate will not achieve that.</P>

      <NameTxt>Caoimhghín Ó Caoláin</NameTxt>
      <P>The three-hour opportunity to discuss both the Prospectus and Professor Niamh Brennan's reports tomorrow morning is inadequate. It does not facilitate full participation and will exclude many Members of the House who will not have an opportunity to speak. That is regrettable. The importance of both reports, as well as the forthcoming Hanly report, occupies not only the thoughts of many Members of the House but is also the critical focus of the wider community and the media. What has been arranged is not a debate but statements on these matters. There will be no actual debate or exchange of views and no opportunity to question the Minister on the detail of the reports and his intentions. It is most regrettable.</P>
      <P>I appeal to the Tánaiste to allow for an extension of time to accommodate greater participation and an opportunity to engage with the Minister, which is the critical element missing in what is proposed. Regarding the World Trade Organisation conference in Cancún in Mexico in September, these are linked in a single proposition, but I am equally concerned that two and a half hours will not allow for full participation, which we critically need. If we are extending time into Friday sittings surely the <i>raison d'être</i> for that is to accommodate greater participation. The World Trade Organisation talks in Cancún will be a critical element in the development of the central focus of the WTO at this time. There is a disparate range of opinion. The Tánaiste's analysis is not reflective of&mdash;</P>

      <P>It is inappropriate to contain items Nos. 23 and 24 when No. 24 concerns a matter which we have had on the Order of Business, that is, the promise by Government of a debate and negotiation on the basis of a question and answer session, which is not provided for under No. 24. I would like the Tánaiste to address that. Three Ministers will go to Cancún, and how are we to know that there is consistency between the positions of those Ministers? </P>

      <P>&mdash;the EU, as the Deputy is well aware. Friday sittings provide an opportunity to have a focused debate on various matters, <Col N="980" />particularly reports that are not directly related to legislation. Over the next two years there will be major legislation to put into effect some of the proposals that are mentioned in these reports and there will be ongoing opportunities for Deputies to participate. The commitment for tomorrow is to give Opposition spokespeople and the Government an opportunity to make some overview comments on these two reports. There will be other reports such as the Hanly report and a Deloitte &amp; Touche report into certain aspects of the health service, and after the consultation period of three months the Minister for Health and Children will come back to the House with proposals. On Friday sittings, they provide a single focus on the topics that are agreed for that day.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to raise two issues on the Order of Business. First, Deputies will be aware that the talks on farm prices and the CAP review ended in Brussels early this morning, coming after a year in which farm incomes fell by 8%. We are now faced with the prospect of dairy incomes falling by as much as 25% over the next few years. I ask that the Tánaiste make arrange<Col N="983" />ments for the Minister for Agriculture and Food, Deputy Walsh, to come into the House, perhaps next week, to allow Deputies to question him about the arrangements.</P>
      <P>The second issue I would like to raise concerns the Government's legislative programme. At this stage, in almost the last week of the session, fewer than a third of the Bills which the Government promised have yet been published. Even in the Tánaiste's Department, that of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, the Companies Audit Bill, which originated in a review back in 2000, has not yet been completed. There is also the personal injuries tribunal legislation on which a report was presented in April 2002, following a long gestation period, and so far we have seen only the heads of Bills on this very important subject that is leading to the loss of jobs every day of the week. Has the Tánaiste plans to consult her Spanish counterparts to bring in expertise to remove the logjams in Departments because it appears we are unable to move forward legislation in a timely way. I am aware the Spanish have been very helpful to the Minister in advising&mdash;</P>

      <P>I am being told from those behind me that they would shock even our parliamentarians. On the farm talks the Minister is on his way home and the intention would be to have a debate tomorrow or, if not, at an early opportunity next week on the outcome of those farm talks. The Government is happy to make time available for that purpose and it may well be that we could do that tomorrow, or this evening, because there is a great deal of interest in the matter in which case we would obviously have to change the order. It is important to have an early debate on those matters.</P>

      <P>Does the Tánaiste consider it appropriate, before the House rises, to have a debate on developments at the Flood tribunal? The tribunal is a creature of this House as distinct from the Government. I am not saying that either my party or anyone else, including the Government, is in a position to make decisions but it would be appropriate that we discuss what appear to be very serious developments. I ask for this in the light of the letter from Mr. Justice Flood&mdash;</P>

      <P>I am not reopening it either, Sir. He asked that the letter be circulated immediately to the Opposition. When I got the letter I noted it was dated 16 June, some eight days previously, I wish to make the point to the Tánaiste, that the Opposition has acknowledged there is an objective problem arising from Mr. Justice Flood's letter. The Opposition also is concerned about two other issues &ndash; the duration and legal costs, in particular, of the various tribunals&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>The Tánaiste</NameTxt>
      <P>The Attorney General was in The Hague last week and the letter was brought to the attention of the Government on Tuesday and was immediately made available to the Opposition. If there were a few days in between one cannot read anything into that. The Taoiseach has already indicated that he wants to engage in discussion with the Opposition parties. As Deputy Rabbitte said, the tribunal is a creature of the Oireachtas, not of the Government. Clearly any move to change anything would be done only on the basis of agreement with Opposition parties. Before having a debate where there might not be any disagreement between us, I should say those who think an effort is being made to sweep certain things under the carpet are wrong. It might be more useful when we receive a reply from Mr. Justice Flood on the costs issue, which is not yet forthcoming, if the Taoiseach was to engage in discussions with Opposition parties before deciding whether a debate is warranted.</P>

      <P>On a point of order, I wish to bring to the Chair's notice again that his ruling, that it is a matter for the Whips, has no basis or standing on precedent or under Standing Orders. The only person in the House who can, with authority, suggest that the Whips might deal with a matter is the Taoiseach, the Tánaiste or whoever is leading the Government. The Chair has no power whatever to make any such suggestion but he does it constantly. I have reminded the Chair of it and I ask him to desist.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 2:</P>
      <P>In page 8, between lines 32 and 33, to insert the following subsection:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(2) In addition to its principal function set out in <i>subsection (1),</i> the Commission shall have the function of making recommendations to the Minister as to steps to be taken in respect of the position of persons who have experienced hardship by reason of the deregulation of the small public service vehicle market.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>It is unsatisfactory to deal with legislation in this manner. Only this morning did we receive a copy of the amendments in the order in which they are being taken. All of us who are involved with the transport portfolio were at a transport committee meeting this morning from 9.30 a.m., which has only just finished. It is difficult to do our business if we are not given adequate notice of amendments and their groupings.</P>
      <P>Amendment No. 3 proposes to insert &ldquo;to review the payment structure of the Taxi Hardship Panel&rdquo; because it is necessary to ensure that the payments by the hardship panel, inadequate as they are, are not forgotten about in the context of the future of the taxi industry. We have already seen attempts by the Minister to completely overlook the strong report of the EU petitions committee, which was extremely damning of the payments proposed by the hardship panel. It advised the Minister to consult the transport committee, to revisit the payment schedules and come up with new proposals. It also made it clear that the manner in which the payments were to be made, as proposed by the hardship panel, was not satisfactory and that the Minister should approach these cases of personal and severe financial hardship on a case by case basis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Unfortunately, the Minister made it clear to the transport committee that he has no intention of paying heed to the recommendations of the petitions committee. There is no question that there is a large number of cases in which people invested in taxi plates and are now lumbered with a significant debt. They are finding it difficult to make a living because of the huge increase in the numbers of taxis and virtually impossible to meet the repayments on their large loans. This applies particularly to people who bought plates in the years immediately preceding the overnight deregulation. Some of them have debts of &euro;100,000 and are making repayments of in excess of &euro;900 per month. It is impossible for families such as these to survive. There are enormous fin<Col N="993" />ancial and personal pressures on many such taxi drivers. What the Minister proposes in respect of the hardship payments is totally inadequate to deal with those very real cases of hardship.</P>
    <P>Another category of people depended on the income from a taxi plate for their pension, including older taxi plate holders and widows in particular. In these cases, the proposals of the hardship panel are completely inadequate. It is crazy that, if a person has a minor pension or any other income, he or she is precluded from making a claim for payment.</P>
    <P>The offer of &euro;6,000, or even &euro;12,000 or &euro;15,000 at the top of the range, is cold comfort to people who find themselves in this situation because of overnight deregulation. Where once they had an asset that was worth &euro;100,000, its value was wiped out overnight and the asset is essentially worthless. The levels of payment proposed go nowhere towards alleviating the personal financial hardship these people are now suffering. I am disappointed the Minister has taken such a cavalier approach to the report of the petitions committee. It is completely unsatisfactory.</P>
    <P>There is deep anger among members of FAIR because of the manner in which the Minister has treated that organisation. The meetings he and his officials have had with FAIR have been completely unsatisfactory and members have found that they must bypass the Minister for Transport because he has let them down so severely, and they have recently approached the Taoiseach. </P>
    <P>It is ironic and shameful, given that Ireland will hold the EU Presidency in the early months of next year, that the Government ignores recommendations of a major body of the European Parliament. This irony has not been lost on the women of FAIR and they fully intend to take their protests to the streets during Ireland's Presidency if the matter is not resolved before then. </P>
    <P>This amendment proposes to give a specific role to the commissioner to do what the petitions committee has recommended, to review the payment structure of the taxi hardship panel. It is an important task for the new person who will, hopefully, take up office over the next few months. It is appropriate that we pay due regard to the recommendations of the petitions committee and revisit the payments because they are inadequate. This should be a key responsibility of the commissioner.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatBreen" hpid="Mr. P. Breen Mr. P. Breen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Breen</NameTxt>
      <P>I support this amendment to review the payment structure of the taxi hardship panel. Many taxi drivers have been affected by the overnight deregulation of the business. I know two taxi drivers in Clare who paid in excess of &euro;150,000 for taxi plates and they are experiencing terrible hardship. They invested &euro;100,000 or more because they thought they were buying into a good business and suddenly their assets became almost worthless. Some of these people are paying back loans of in the region of &euro;100,000, on a worthless asset, over a 20 year period. In regard to the payments proposed by the Minister under <Col N="994" />the taxi hardship panel dealing with claims, the payments which have been mentioned are quite small, given that the European Parliament Petitions Committee found that the Government had a moral and political responsibility to provide redress to families who had to bear some financial loss in this situation.</P>
      <P>The European Parliament Petitions Committee is very powerful. It does not visit Ireland very often, but visited two months ago to address two issues. One concerned the Taxi Hardship Panel.</P>
      <P>I urge the Minister to reconsider and to provide the funding necessary for people who have been severely affected. I am talking of widows, for example, who leased their taxi plates to provide them with income, and of elderly retired taxi drivers who did the same. Such people have been badly affected. In order to protect them, this amendment should be incorporated into the Bill. We cannot simply forget about them. We need to be a voice for them.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the amendment tabled by my colleague Deputy Shortall on the hardship imposed on the taxi drivers arising from the unplanned implementation of deregulation. The cost and the value of taxi licences have fallen from perhaps &euro;100,000 to &euro;6,300 currently. Many people entered freely into an agreement to purchase licences on the basis of commitments given and following discussions with public servants, who said clearly that there was a planned approach in operation. They said there was a points system in the allocation of additional taxi plates.</P>
      <P>Two people in particular who were told of a planned approach are representative of hundreds in this regard. This approach was a very positive change to the situation that existed up to 1999. Up to then, commitments had been given by Fianna Fáil councillors in Dublin Corporation to the taxi licence owners that they would be protected. They were told deregulation would not take place and to put their trust in the councillors. In the 1997 general election we had nothing but posters of &ldquo;Ivor the Great&rdquo;, urging people to support Ivor Callely and to support Fianna Fáil councillors, who would supposedly then stand by the people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A complete about-turn was then made. People were told, following discussions, that there would be a planned approach and that it would be three years before one's turn would come to be allocated a taxi licence. When people asked what they should do in the meantime, they were told <Col N="995" />that since they would be in the running for a licence within three years, they should buy taxi plates as people would normally do, in the marketplace. Many people did that, paying £80,000 at the time for the taxi plate, in some cases remortgaging their homes to raise the money. Even now, people are facing repayments on loans of up to &euro;120,000.</P>
    <P>The issue was brought to the European Parliament Petitions Committee, which appointed a fact finding delegation which visited Ireland and met the Minister for Transport, Deputy Brennan, and his officials. The Minister gave a specific commitment that he would meet the Joint Committee on Transport to discuss the points made by FAIR and by the committee itself. The Minister cannot say that it is only the Opposition which is pursuing this issue. The Minister's committee members said that the compensation money being offered is totally inadequate. The committee urged that further consideration be given to provide redress to the families involved. There was a clear understanding that the Minister would act with the committee to try to deal with the situation.</P>
    <P>There is hardship out there for many taxi drivers, male and female, and their families. What is being proposed as a mechanism to deal with hardship is totally inadequate. It is my understanding, and that of many of the people affected, that the Taxi Hardship Panel was told in broad terms by the Minister of a ballpark figure for compensation, which it was to use as best it could. Speaking for the people I represent, the sum is totally inadequate.</P>
    <P>The Minister and the Government have mechanisms for redress when it suits them. They can look after their friends in high places, people of influence, people who perhaps have supported Fianna Fáil, when these people come forward with their concerns. That is politics, and if people come forward with a concern, an inequality, one hopes the Minister of the day will respond. There is a cry from the heart from FAIR, from the people involved in the taxi business. They are asking the Minister to respond in a favourable manner. We are not talking about taking money from a bottomless pit and throwing it at people. There are hundreds of people currently in a pathetic condition who need the Minister's support. I trust the Minister will accept the amendment and deal with the situation in a properly planned manner.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. Brennan Mr. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Shortall for tabling this amendment and I thank Deputies Naughten and Breen for tabling theirs too. Both of these amendments provide that the Commission for Taxi Regulation will be given a specific role in the proposed structure for making payments to individual taxi licence holders who may have suffered extreme personal hardship arising from loss of income as a direct result of the liberalisation of the taxi market.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="996" />The House will be aware that the Government established a panel to report in general terms on the nature and extent of any such hardship. The Government has accepted the panel's report and has approved implementation of its recommendations on a phased basis. I intend to put arrangements in place very shortly to facilitate the submission of applications for payments under this scheme and to make payments at an early date. I have explained to all the groups representing taxi operators and to FAIR that I will proceed with the implementation of the scheme as quickly as possible.</P>
    <P>I accept that there is genuine hardship. I have met FAIR on two occasions and I know its members have had other meetings. I have great admiration for their determination and understand their case. I would like to continue to work with them in future to see how we can progress this as best we can.</P>
    <P>Three people were selected to spend six months examining the issue, Kevin Bonnar, the former Secretary General of the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Bill Attlee, the former leader of SIPTU, and Ann O'Riordan of Microsoft. They spent six months on the project at the end of which they brought forward a report to Cabinet. They were given no instructions, formally or informally. They were given an open mandate to assess hardship and to come forward with some solutions. They came forward with a report, which I placed before Government, which approved it and instructed me to proceed with making payments as quickly as possible.</P>
    <P>I do not doubt that Deputy Shortall means well in tabling the amendment but I must point out the result were I to accept it. The amendment states that the regulator, when appointed, should examine the situation and make recommendations to me. With the best will in the world and moving as quickly as possible to get the Bill through the Houses, to advertise for the regulator, get the Civil Service Commission to interview all the applicants, appoint the regulator, establish the office and have the system up and running, I cannot see payments being made on foot of a regulator's recommendations for perhaps two years.</P>
    <P>I would like to make payments immediately because there is hardship. I have said to FAIR that we will keep a close eye on the situation in terms of the number of applications received and will continue to talk to the group as payments are made to see what is possible within the report accepted by the Government. The Deputy should not press the amendment because to accept it would result in it not doing what she intends. I accept her bona fides in wanting to improve the payments but the amendment could have the opposite result.</P>
    <P>I do not know who the regulator will be because the Civil Service Commission will appoint him or her. Who knows what view he or she will take. He or she may take a stricter view than the committee comprising Kevin Bonnar, <Col N="997" />Bill Attlee and Ann O'Riordan. That proposal would come to Government and we would be on the merry-go-round again. The amendment could have the opposite effect to what Deputy Shortall intended. If it is included in the Bill, it will certainly make payments impossible for a long time.</P>
    <P>The petitions committee about which Deputy Seán Ryan inquired made a number of recommendations. It asked the Oireachtas Committee on Transport and the Minister to review the situation, that urgent provision be made for redress for families on a case by case basis and that the regulator be appointed without delay. The third recommendation is our business today. Regarding the first recommendation, I know the Committee on Transport has done that and I continue to have discussions with FAIR and other interest groups about how we will go forward.</P>
    <P>Regarding redress on a case by case basis, I am finalising negotiations with a group called ADM which already works for a number of Departments and makes grant payments under a wide range of headings. Assuming I can conclude these negotiations within days, ADM will set about receiving forms and moving as quickly as possible to make payments. It will also on my instructions keep a close eye on what is possible on a case by case basis within the context of the report and the categories we have. We will also keep a close eye on the situation and continue to meet and talk to the interested parties because this is the best way forward.</P>
    <P>Were I to accept the amendment, which requires the regulator to be appointed and him or her to examine the situation and make proposals to the Minister on which I would make a decision, it would set us back a long time with no guarantee that a regulator would take a different view than people of the standing I have mentioned, Kevin Bonnar and Bill Attlee.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RoisinShortall" hpid="Ms Shortall Ms Shortall">
      <NameTxt>Ms Shortall</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is twisting my words and intentions. He knows perfectly well that I have already suggested to him that he make interim payments based on the hardship panel's report because people are suffering hardship and need alleviation in the short-term. We should proceed with those interim payments and then ask the commissioner to review the position and make recommendations on further assistance that needs to be provided.</P>
      <P>The Minister is being quite disingenuous about taxi drivers. He speaks of his admiration for the FAIR group and says he understands its case. What does that mean? If he understood its case, he would do something about it. Does he accept that it has a strong case? That is what he implies when he says he understands its case. He is the person in a position to do something about it. He can review the situation and heed the recommendations of the petitions committee. It is in his hands, so he should stop making these meaningless statements that he understands FAIR's case if he is not prepared to do anything about it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="998" />I fully intend to press this amendment because what the Minister proposes is inadequate. The Committee on Transport spoke with Kevin Bonnar who was unable to support his recommendations. It is quite clear the figures were plucked out of the sky. He could not put to us the basis on which he and his colleagues had come up with the figures. When we put individual cases of extreme hardship to him, he had nothing with which to respond. He and his colleagues had set these figures. They appear to have been given some ballpark figure within which to work and then divided that amount among the number of applicants. That appeared to be the approach taken. There was no realistic assessment of the extent of hardship people had suffered.</P>
    <P>The Minister said he would keep a close eye on the matter, but that means nothing. He knows perfectly well that he plans to make the payments and close the book on the matter in the hope that that will be the end of it. Promising to keep a close eye offers nothing to the people concerned which is precisely why, in addition to making these interim payments, we should specify that the commissioner has a specific role in the ongoing review of the hardship these people suffer and should make recommendations to the Minister. That is why I intend to press this amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisNaughten" hpid="Mr. Naughten Mr. Naughten">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Naughten</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Shortall makes a valid point and I endorse her comments. We want the interim payments to be made and the level and extent of the payments that would then be paid to taxi drivers reviewed. If the Minister has a difficulty with amendment No. 2, there is an alternative in amendment No. 3. The principle behind both is to ensure that the situation is reviewed.</P>
      <P>I will give the Minister an example of what is involved. A level of payment is provided for those of pensionable age but anyone in receipt of an old age pension is not eligible for it. The only way a former taxi driver would not be in receipt of a contributory old age pension would be if he or she had worked in the black market and had not paid tax and PRSI or if he or she was exempt from paying PRSI because his or her level of income was below the threshold. If that is the case there is no real loss of income but they will be compensated. The contents of the hardship panel report do not tally with the reality. The Department of Finance treated a licence as an asset regarding capital gains and inheritance tax. One arm of the State believes it is an asset while another, the Department of Transport, believes it is not and that there should not be compensation. Someone is right because the Government cannot be in a win-win situation. It is a disappointment that the Minister is ignoring the recommendation of the European Parliament petitions committee.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The estimated level of compensation would be &euro;16 million but the budget set aside in the current year is only &euro;2 million. If that is the case, will only part payments be made or will that be the total <Col N="999" />of payments made to those who have experienced hardship?</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. Brennan Mr. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no reason the advisory council, when it is established, or the regulator, when he or she is appointed, cannot make recommendations to me if they chose to do so or if they wanted to comment on the progress, management or structure of the payments. I would have no difficulty with their making recommendations in the middle of this process, I would take them on board as far as possible.</P>
      <P>In case there is any misunderstanding, I have had no communication from Kevin Bonnar, Bill Attley and Ann O'Riordan to say they do not stand over their report, they support it fully. I do know how satisfied individual members of the committee were with the quality of answers but most of us who appear before committees probably do not meet the high standards that committee members would like. I have heard no suggestions that the three people involved do not stand over the official report that was supplied to and accepted by the Government.</P>
      <P>The &euro;2 million is the budget for the year and it does not rule out, if we could get through the process more rapidly, my securing additional funding this year to make payments if that is required.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisNaughten" hpid="Mr. Naughten Mr. Naughten">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Naughten</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. Brennan Mr. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not say it is in the Depart<Col N="1000" />ment of Finance but if we get through the process more rapidly I would have little difficulty in meeting the proposed payments.</P>
      <P>I am happy to work with FAIR and everyone else so I do not need lectures from Deputy Shortall about sympathy &ndash; I am entitled to express it if I wish and I do not need my bona fides challenged in that way. I am dealing with the situation as best I can and I have sympathy.</P>
      <P>I have worked hard with the taxi drivers to introduce the Taxi Regulation Bill and worked hard with the industry to help modernise it. I understand that after deregulation the industry was a jungle and I am constantly meeting its representatives to discuss all the issues in the Bill &ndash; the most recent meeting with the unions involved was three days ago &ndash; because I want to move forward as best I can. We have shared objectives across the board and even on this issue I am happy to continue discussions to see how to proceed. That is all I can do.</P>
      <P>I can only deal with what is written in the amendments in black and white, it does not mention interim payments, it states that the regulator should be given the power to make recommendations in regard to payments and that would delay the entire process unacceptably. It does not stop the regulator making recommendations when he or she takes office. For that reason I cannot see any point in accepting the amendment.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 4:</P>
      <P>In page 9, subsection (2), before line 1, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;<i>(c)</i> to promote access to small public service vehicles by persons with disabilities and to make recommendations to the Minister and the Minister for Finance in that regard, in particular recommendations regarding favourable tax treatment of accessible vehicles,&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>We need to specify in the legislation the importance of ensuring accessibility in the taxi industry. Too often in the past, lip service was paid to accessibility. While there may have been intentions to ensure that all taxis would be wheelchair accessible, the reality in recent years has been that the number of wheelchair accessible taxis has declined because many drivers entering the business and using such taxis found it uneconomic to continue and pulled out to seek employment elsewhere. There are fewer wheelchair accessible taxis now than there were prior to deregulation.</P>
      <P>We need to put up in lights that this area is one of the main responsibilities of the commissioner. We must learn from the experience of other countries where it is accepted that it is not commercially viable to invest in a fully accessible vehicle and ply one's trade on the roads. Without intervention, one finds that the numbers do not stack up and drivers opt to leave the business. For this reason, it is important to examine the mechanisms employed in other countries to encourage wider use of wheelchair accessible vehicles.</P>
      <P>The experience abroad has been that many Governments decided to treat the need to ensure wide access to public transport, including taxis, as a priority and put their money where their mouth was, so to speak, by introducing various schemes to encourage the provision of accessible vehicles. These have included offering tax relief and, in several countries, operating a system in which vehicle registration tax and value added tax are waived in respect of wheelchair accessible taxis. This area needs to be closely examined and responsibility for doing so should rest with the commissioner.</P>
      <P>I understand there are no clear specifications for wheelchair accessible taxis. We tend to regard so-called people carriers as wheelchair accessible, which is not the case as they are not supplied with ramps. In addition, some of the ramps used in dedicated vehicles are not suitable for the kind of wheelchairs introduced in recent years. We need precise specifications for wheelchair accessible taxis and the type, size and width of ramps. The matter should be examined by the commissioner and laid down in regulations. It is for this reason I put down the amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="1003" />
    <Speaker pid="EamonRyanGP" hpid="Mr. Eamon Ryan Mr. Eamon Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Eamon Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>As a number of amendments are being taken together, I presume I may speak to amendment No. 8 in my name. I agree with the previous Deputy that clarity is needed on this issue. I was amazed and disappointed that the Minister, in his Second Stage speech, failed to address the commitment given by the previous Government on this issue. I remind him that when deregulation of the taxi market was being introduced, the then Minister with responsibility for transport made a clear commitment on behalf of the Government that from the end of 2003 a process would begin whereby all taxis in the Dublin area would be wheelchair accessible. Is this commitment, which I am sure was not given lightly, still valid?</P>
      <P>While I admit the process will not start immediately or be completed overnight &ndash; it may take several years &ndash; nevertheless, the Government made a clear commitment to initiate it by the end of the year. This is not an impossibility. The system operates in Belfast as well as in London and across the United Kingdom.</P>
      <P>My view on introducing a provision requiring all taxis to be wheelchair accessible is open to challenge. Although such a requirement would not be appropriate for rural markets where the economics and nature of journeys are different, in a market such as Dublin, in addition to having significant benefits for people confined to wheelchairs or with other mobility impairments, it would provide a boon to full-time taxi drivers.</P>
      <P>The use of purpose-built vehicles, the only way to achieve complete accessibility, would impose higher initial costs for taxi drivers, but would, in the long run, remove part-time drivers and cowboys from the industry. If the number of taxi drivers continues to increase and we fail to introduce an entry requirement, we will have no full-time professional taxi drivers left. The entry requirement should be a willingness to purchase purpose-built vehicles, which are safer for drivers and passengers, carry more passengers and are more comfortable and suitable as public transport vehicles.</P>
      <P>I agree with Deputy Shortall's comment that the Government needs to give tax breaks for such vehicles in recognition that they are proper public transport vehicles, either by waiving VRT or providing other incentives to encourage their use.</P>
      <P>Regardless of what the Minister may say, if we fail to live up to the Government commitment towards full wheelchair accessibility, the current position, in which it is next to impossible for a person in a wheelchair to order a taxi or hail one on the street, will continue. Last week, during a protest in front of the Oireachtas, a Government backbench Deputy witnessed a taxi, supposedly a wheelchair accessible vehicle, stopping to pick up a fare and driving off having realised the intending passenger was a wheelchair user. This practice is widespread in Dublin.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister has an opportunity to instruct the regulator to move towards 100% accessibility. I realise the regulator will not be able to do this on <Col N="1004" />a national basis, which is the reason my proposal to ensure the highest possible level of accessibility for people with a disability included the caveat, &ldquo;having regard to the urban or rural nature of the relevant local authority area&rdquo;. Will the Minister clarify whether the commitment given by the Government when deregulation was introduced was just one of the many broken promises it made during its previous term of office or one which it intends to live up to?</P>
    <Speaker pid="EoinRyan" hpid="Mr. Eoin Ryan Mr. Eoin Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Eoin Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I have chosen to speak on the issue of wheelchair accessibility, which everyone favours, because it is the subject of conversation among taxi drivers and others. Deputy Shortall asked for clarity, which is important. If one talks to drivers, they will say the problem lies in the cost of wheelchair accessible vehicles. In the current circumstances, in which a significant increase in the number of additional plates and drivers has led to a decline in incomes in the industry, it is difficult for taxi drivers to afford wheelchair accessible vehicles.</P>
      <P>Accessibility is an important issue and I am interested in the Minister's views on it. While all of us are in favour of it, at the same time, it will be difficult to ask drivers to buy accessible cars given current market conditions. It is a matter of economics.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatBreen" hpid="Mr. P. Breen Mr. P. Breen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Breen</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the comments of the previous speakers. The cost factor is the main problem for most taxi drivers. The position is far from satisfactory. In my area, for instance, not one wheelchair accessible taxi operates from Shannon Airport, an international airport and gateway for US and continental flights. There is not one wheelchair accessible taxi operating out of the airport and this is a pity. I recently saw a wheelchair accessible taxi outside a house in Ennis that had a first aid sign on it. The business is obviously uneconomic and unsatisfactory.</P>
      <P>I agree with previous speakers in saying the regulator will have to tackle this. This is an appropriate time to discuss this given that the Special Olympics are currently running. The Government needs to look at waiving VRT or giving some tax break to wheelchair accessible taxis. I support the amendments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanRyan" hpid="Mr. S. Ryan Mr. S. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I fully support the amendment and hope the Minister will be proactive and positive on it rather than saying that it is up to the commission or advisory council to make recommendations. A strong line must be taken by the Minister to do something about this anomaly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a perception that deregulation has worked. The increase in the number of taxis has been positive for people waiting on taxi ranks. The Minister will be well aware of the negative effects of deregulation. There are always losers as well as winners in deregulation. There is not the slightest doubt the section of the population losing out from this deregulation is people with disabilities. In a planned approach to the provision <Col N="1005" />prior to deregulation, there was a specific commitment to have wheelchair accessible taxis. It was well known that there was to be a certain number of taxis and it was going to be increased. Deregulation was supposed to solve all the problems. There was a specific commitment that all taxis would be wheelchair accessible. What has happened since then? Drivers are looking at the cost of purchasing wheelchair accessible taxis and, post deregulation, there is no compulsion or attraction for them do so and people with disabilities are losing out.</P>
    <P>Something has to be done. A structure has to be put in place to ensure the percentage is increased and there is reasonable access for people with disabilities. We can deal with this if the Minister takes on board the principle and spirit of this amendment. I would be disappointed if he were to say that while he is in favour of it and sees the merits in it, that it up to the commission where there is a role for the advisory council and for those that look after people with disabilities. The Minister is at the helm and he must keep the ball rolling. The only way to do this is to put incentives in place; Deputy Shortall has outlined the incentives. I look forward to a positive outcome for this amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanCroweSF" hpid="Mr. Crowe Mr. Crowe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crowe</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the amendments. At the time of deregulation there was an opportunity to address this area but, for whatever reason, this was not done. If one talks to hospital staff one will hear of the problems they have in trying to find a wheelchair accessible taxi to bring someone home from hospital. A friend who had a stroke had to wait for five hours for a taxi home; even wheelchair accessible taxis would not take him. There is a problem regarding wheelchair accessible taxis that will not take people in wheelchairs because of the delay in putting a ramp down and allowing the person to board, or for whatever reason.</P>
      <P>We need to encourage more taxi drivers to have wheelchair accessible taxis. The proposals regarding changes in the tax treatments for such taxis have merit. If one goes to a disability conference one will hear of the same problems. In this day and age people should not have to wait for hours for a basic service like transport. There are already problems with buses &ndash; surely there is some way in which we can overcome the problems with taxis. We have it within our ambit to make changes and I appeal to the Minister to support the amendments.</P>

      <P>It is appropriate, as suggested by Deputies Shortall and Eamon Ryan, that the overall objective established by the Oireachtas for the commission should make specific reference to the need for that office to promote access to small public service vehicles by persons with disabilities. This theme is supported by the inclusion of section 34 that contains specific provisions allowing the commission to regulate to facilitate access. For this reason, I support the <Col N="1006" />first element of Deputy Shortall's amendment. I propose to include an appropriate amendment to the Bill to facilitate this issue, namely, amendment No. 6. I suggest this amendment should meet the general thrust of Deputy Shortall's and Deputy Eamon Ryan's proposals. Given the broad powers invested in the commission in section 34 in respect of standards, I do not believe it is appropriate to engage in the more prescriptive approach adopted in Deputy Eamon Ryan's amendment.</P>
      <P>However, I have some difficulty in accepting the second element of Deputy Shortall's proposed amendment No. 4. In the first instance, the Bill provides the commission with many opportunities to express its view on issues pertaining to its functions. Second, the council is being given a broad role in its presentation of advice to both the Minister and the commission. There are clear structures in place for both the commission and the council to offer advice on any issue that would affect the licensing and operation of small public service vehicles. I also refer the Deputy to a proposal I am presenting to the committee regarding complaints. This makes specific reference to hires. I ask Deputies to consider what I am saying in the context of accepting the spirit and wording of the first part of Deputy Shortall's amendment.</P>
      <P>Section 34 (2)(<i>f</i>)(i) establishes a clear and precise requirement on the commission to promulgate standards that address the needs of people with disabilities generally. The paragraph already includes a specific reference to wheelchair users. While I accept the bona fides of the Deputies, I do not see the additional wording as offering any particular value.</P>
      <P>I have some sympathy with Deputy Eamon Ryan's amendment No. 41 that relates to section 39. However, the section provides a broad empowerment for the commission to regulate for the acceptance of a hire. The section should not provide for the kind of prescriptive provision suggested in the amendment. Like everyone in this House, I am aware that we need to do much more in this area. The current legal requirements on the acceptance of a hire do not incorporate a provision regarding hires initiated through the contact of a radio company. I present that as one area where the commission will be in a position to apply new requirements because of the broad powers vested in the office through this section.</P>
      <P>The total number of wheelchair accessible taxis nationally at 21 November 2000 was 840. At the end of March 2003, it had increased to 1,188. While the percentage of taxis that are wheelchair accessible has fallen, the overall number of such taxis has increased. Both Deputy Shortall and I are correct in our assertions in that regard.</P>
      <P>Deputy Eoin Ryan inquired about An Agreed Programme for Government. The programme states:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We will work in a fair and equitable way to ensure taxi supply matches demand. We will continue the process of making taxis wheel<Col N="1007" />chair accessible. We will appoint a national regulator for the future regulation of licensing standards and the quality of service.</P>
    <P>There should be no difference between us on this issue. The provision of 100% access to taxis by people with disabilities should not even be negotiable. We must deliver on it. The taxi council will take office, probably within the next two to three weeks while a regulator will take office shortly. On their appointment, I propose to charge them, as their first task, to look at this issue, to hold discussions with the disability groups and chart the road forward. Everybody in a wheelchair must have access to a taxi. The council is very representative. Its nominees are drawn from interest groups, including taxi bodies, consumer and tourism groups, the Garda Síochána and so on. They will be in a good position to decide on how best to give effect to this requirement.</P>
    <P>The Chairman of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Transport, Deputy Eoin Ryan, referred to some of the practical difficulties, which we should not ignore. However, we must see if they can be addressed. Deputy Shortall referred to purpose built vehicles and I would like to see us reach that stage. However, I should not second guess the structure being put in place with the broad agreement of the House. It is robust in scope and includes a taxi council, representative of all interests, and an independent regulator. They will both have a clear mandate from me to first deal with disability on the basis that everyone in a wheelchair must have access to a taxi. While we should urge them to proceed on this basis as quickly as possible, we should not be too prescriptive.</P>
    <P>I agree with the first clause of amendment No. 4 in the name of Deputy Shortall and in view of this, I have introduced amendment No. 6. The Bill should include a specific provision that the regulator's job is to promote access to small public service vehicles by persons with disabilities. I have used the same wording as in amendment No. 4. The second part of the Deputy's amendment seeks to provide that the regulator shall make recommendations to the Minister and the Minister for Finance on issues including the taxation treatment of accessible vehicles. This is a policy issue and it is inappropriate to provide for it by way of amendment.</P>
    <P>The taxi council will be strongly led &ndash; I have already identified a strong chairperson who I believe will be universally accepted &ndash; and I have every reason to believe that the council and a strong regulator will be well able to put whatever proposals they wish on these issues to me or the Minister for Finance. If they consider that a certain tax treatment is required, I would expect them to make a relevant proposal to the Minister for Finance. It does not strengthen the case to enshrine it in legislation and it makes it more difficult for me to accept the amendment, even though I fully support its spirit. I would ask <Col N="1008" />Deputy Shortall to consider my acceptance of the first part, but not the second.</P>

      <P>Amendment No. 6 provides for functions that should have been provided for in the first instance. Nevertheless, I appreciate the Minister's decision to proceed on that basis. I disagree that amendment No. 8 in my name is overly prescriptive. It sets out the level of prescription required and, in this regard, I am concerned that amendment No. 6 and other such amendments, which simply provide for the promotion of access, may not be adequate.</P>
      <P>I welcome the Minister's assertion that 100% accessibility to taxis by people with disabilities is something we all wish to achieve and that it will be the first item on the agenda of the council and the commission. This is a tricky issue because circumstances differ around the country and there are different ways of achieving this objective. This is why I do not wish to be totally prescriptive in calling for it to be achieved overnight.</P>
      <P>The Government has made a commitment that this process will have started in the Dublin area by the end of this year. Dublin is probably the one city in the country in which it would be easiest to introduce a 100% requirement for wheelchair accessibility. Section 10 provides that the Minister can issue policy directives. Will he confirm if it is his intention, if necessary, to issue a policy direction to the council or commissioner to achieve the Government's commitment. Will he wait for the council to report back or should he send the issue directly to the commissioner?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. Brennan Mr. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I would not shrink from issuing a policy directive to the regulator or the council &ndash; in this case the regulator &ndash; if that was required. Given that both bodies will be established within a couple of weeks, we should let them proceed. It is the clear policy of the Government that every person in a wheelchair must be able to access taxis and I am prepared to allow them to decide how best to proceed. Provided this basic principle is adhered to, a number of models can be applied. I would like to see them proceed as quickly as possible. I will consider whether it is appropriate to give a policy direction, although I probably will not need to. Section 9 will ensure that the regulator must proceed on this basis because the law will impose a requirement in that regard. However, I will give further consideration to the Deputy's concerns.</P>

      <P>The second part of amendment No. 8 deals with the setting of environmental standards regarding fuel consumption and air emission by taxi vehicles. I was a member of the strategic policy council on Dublin City Council for a number of years where the air quality issue <Col N="1009" />in the city centre was a cause of major concern. The Minister will be aware that the air quality outside the House, around College Green and the city centre area, especially in Westmoreland Street, is consistently above the levels recommended by European standards. This is especially the case in respect of diesel emissions, nitrous oxide, sulphur dioxide and small particulate matter. We are effectively killing people in the city centre every day by not controlling the air quality.</P>
      <P>I recall debates in the city council with the director of traffic, who maintained that the only possible solution would be to regulate vehicles that are extensively used in the city centre in terms of air quality emissions. This means that the only way to solve the problem and stop killing people with existing levels of air pollution is to regulate the bus fleet, the taxi fleet and other vehicles &ndash; including those belonging to the city council &ndash; which regularly use the city centre. That is the only way to begin to get a handle on the severe air pollution problem in Dublin city centre. I am sure there are other places around the country where it is equally a problem. It is remarkable that in setting out the regulations a taxi commissioner can apply we are not providing that he may regulate the emissions from a vehicle. If the Minister wishes, he can accept one section of my amendment. If we fail to take this opportunity we will have to return to the matter in a number of years to amend the legislation. Our persistent breaching of European air quality regulations in central urban areas will not be permitted to continue unchecked. Europe will insist that we begin to get our act together which is why I hope the Minister will accept the relevant part of this amendment.</P>
      <P>The Minister referred to amendment No. 41 which is in my name and seeks to amend section 39. I did not quite understand the Minister's arguments in this regard. The problem I seek to address will become less difficult as we achieve a high level of accessibility, but that will take a number of years. In the meantime, we need to put in place a mechanism to address current needs. The Minister mentioned that there are 1,188 wheelchair accessible vehicles in the city, but I can assure him the vast majority of those are not being used as wheelchair vehicles. The Minister says my amendment is too prescriptive, but I beg to differ. It is a serious problem that a tiny fraction of the supposed 1,188 wheelchair accessible vehicles are used for the purpose intended. My amendment is a very valuable tool in the interim to improve the day-to-day scenario before the introduction of 100% accessibility. Without a prescriptive approach, nothing will improve in the next three to four years for persons like the one mentioned by Deputy Crowe who had to wait five hours at a hospital to get a taxi home. I disagree with the Minister. The amendment is not prescriptive, rather it is a useful interim measure prior to the introduction of 100% accessibility.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. Brennan Mr. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand the Deputy's desire to make specific provision in the Bill to achieve environmental objectives and standards for small public service vehicles. It is not necessary or appropriate to introduce express statements on environmental matters in this Bill as there are strong mechanisms in place under the road traffic code to ensure that small public service vehicles operate to the highest environmental standards. The Minister for Transport is empowered under section 11 of the Road Traffic Act 1961 to apply standards for the construction, equipment and use of vehicles. In section 13 of the Road Traffic Act 2002, the Minister is given specific power to make regulations across a very broad expanse of legal structures which apply to traffic for the express purpose of the protection of the environment and the reduction or elimination of damage to it by vehicles. It is a requirement for the registration of all new motor vehicles that they conform to the emission limit values set out in EU directives. These broad powers are strong and exist in law to provide the basis for the introduction of any provision which would lead to the application of any measures necessary to address the environmental issue in this regard.</P>
      <P>I would prefer if the environmental aspect of motor vehicles could be dealt with in a holistic and co-ordinated manner under existing provisions rather than to single out the taxi industry in particular. The inevitable result of such a step would be the application of specific environmental measures to road haulage and bus operators. That is not the correct way to approach this matter. Such an approach could be counter-productive in the long run and might lead to inconsistent and poorer practices. I have no difficulty with the spirit of Deputy Eamon Ryan's amendments, but to select a particular industry rather than to make provisions across the board under very strong existing legislation could be counter-productive. I would prefer to deal with the issue under existing legislation rather than take the regulator to the centre of decision making in this area. The regulator can take a view, as can the council, and may make recommendations to apply some of the sections outlined to the taxi industry. I share the Deputy's broad intent and the spirit of what he wishes to provide, but given the three or four areas in the legislation to which I have referred, mechanisms exist already to achieve his goals. We should make provisions across the board rather than single out taxis. Were we to do so, it could immediately lead to high additional costs for them.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EamonRyanGP" hpid="Mr. Eamon Ryan Mr. Eamon Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Eamon Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The reason to treat them differently is that they are different. These are vehicles which are on the road for 12 hours a day, seven days a week. They are used in the city centre extensively and are very different to the family saloon &ndash; or should be &ndash; which sits at home for most of the week and is taken to work or out occasionally. The solution to the problem can only come when we recognise that the vehicles <Col N="1011" />which are used in the city centre most extensively have a special role in solving the problem. That is the intent of my amendment.</P>
      <P>I would like to hear the Minister's response to my latter point. We need an interim solution while we move towards 100% accessibility in Dublin. If the Minister does not intend to accept my amendment to require those with wheelchair accessible vehicles to carry disabled passengers, what measure does he propose to introduce to alleviate the severe difficulties experienced by persons in wheelchairs in finding cabs? He is not willing to accept what he describes as a prescriptive amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. Brennan Mr. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I hate it to seem as though I continue to retreat to the point, which is simply the reality, that the council will meet shortly and the regulator will soon be in place. It is best to let them work out the way in which we can give effect to the overall objective of ensuring that every single person in the country has access to a taxi. I do not propose to introduce an interim measure in this regard. The industry knows my wishes, the wishes of the Government and the wishes of the Dáil in this respect and I expect it to move in the desired direction as rapidly as possible. The industry knows broadly where this process is leading. The correct solution is to introduce the measures outlined. The first job we will give the regulator and the council will be to deal with the issue of wheelchair accessible taxis.</P>
      <P>I referred earlier to the Road Traffic Act 2002 which gives very strong legislative backing to whatever action the Minister wishes to take to secure environmentally friendly vehicles. The section which makes the provisions is just over one year old. It lays down that regulations can be made regarding the construction of vehicles, the provision of the fittings of vehicles and their use on vehicles, equipment and the restriction of, or prohibition on, the use of specified fuels or additives to fuels in engines or specified engines of vehicles generally or in specific places or at specified times. Regulations may also be made in respect of the carriage on vehicles on public roads, or specified public roads, of specified goods, the adaptation and modification of the engines of vehicles and the restriction and prohibition of the use of vehicles in specified places. Speed limits are also covered.</P>
      <P>It is quite clear that only 18 months ago the Minister was provided with specific powers to insist on environmentally friendly vehicles and those provisions should be used across the board. It is my intention to discover how we can do that.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Eamon Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I apologise for intruding on the time of other Deputies, but this is a hugely important issue. I am slightly concerned at the Minister's last statement on the accessibility issue, that the industry knows this is coming and will accept changes. In achieving this 100% accessibility, can the Minister say whether it will be done <Col N="1012" />through the greater introduction of purpose-built wheelchair accessible vehicles or by continuing the system we have had over recent years of converting vehicles which were designed for other use? Does the Minister have an opinion on what direction should be taken in that regard?</P>
      <P>If there is clarity on this subject, the Opposition can withdraw its amendments and support the Minister in moving towards his objective. Is the Minister unequivocally stating that the commitment given when deregulation occurred, that we would work towards 100% wheelchair accessibility in the Dublin market, will be pursued and fulfilled? If the council and the industry do not move in that direction, will the Minister be willing to stand by that policy commitment?</P>

      <P>The Government gave a commitment that all taxis in the Dublin market would be wheelchair accessible. That is different from saying that all people will have access to a taxi. If 10% of the vehicle fleet is wheelchair accessible, the Minister could argue that there is access to a taxi. People might have to wait two hours for a taxi or they might not have the same rights as the rest of the public in terms of access but they do have access. The commitment was that we will move towards 100% accessibility in the Dublin fleet, where it is perfectly feasible. Will that commitment, which was given at the time of deregulation, be pursued by the Minister using the regulations we are now putting in place?</P>

      <P>We should take the advice of the disability groups and the disability council, listen carefully to their requirements and see how we can deliver on them rather than be too prescriptive at this point, given the imminence of the council and regulator. The commitment in the programme for Government is that we will continue the process of making taxis wheelchair accessible. I believe we should approach this matter from the point of view of the individual who is confined to a wheelchair and ensure there is a full taxi service available to that person. I will ask the council immediately to set about finding a way of achieving that. If I am more prescriptive than that, it would be unreasonable and unfair to the council, the regulator and the disability groups. The disability groups are represented on the council and they would like to discuss this issue urgently, within weeks, to see how we can ensure that every person in this situation has full access. I do not wish to be more prescriptive because it would be wrong at this time.</P>

If it turns out to be the way the Deputy is advocating, that is fine and we will take that route and make sure it happens. If they have better ideas and quicker, more sensible solutions, we should follow those rather than try to re-fight an old election campaign.</P>
      <P>I want to move forward on this and the only people I am prepared to listen to are the disability council and the disability groups. We will see what their needs are and deliver on them. My pledge is that nobody in this country in a wheelchair will be denied full access to a taxi.

      <P>In page 9, subsection (2), between lines 18 and 19, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>(<i>i</i>) to establish a 24 hour free phone line to report complaints,</P>
      <P>(<i>j</i>) to introduce a central taxi monitoring and booking system with a single taxi contact phone number and electronic identification of the nearest available taxi.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>These amendments are reasonable. They provide for the establishment of a 24 hour freefone line to report complaints and the introduction of a central taxi monitoring and booking system. The number of taxis has increased in Dublin in recent years from about 3,000 to 10,000 so there will be more complaints. There were 540 complaints in 2001 and so far this year there have been over 200. The number has increased considerably with the increase in the number of taxis on the road.</P>
      <P>Overcharging by taxi drivers is probably the most common complaint. The condition of vehicles is another subject of complaint. The committee on transport also discussed this. I hope the Minister will consider what type of vehicle should be used. Obviously, there are many old, rundown vehicles on the road and this is not acceptable to the customer who is paying for the service. There also have been a number of assaults involving taxi drivers &ndash; they amount to about 17%.</P>
      <P>There are problems, and a 24 hour telephone helpline would improve the situation. Deputy Shortall told the transport committee some time ago that she tried to ring the telephone number currently being used but she got no reply. This is a serious situation. Many complaints go unreported. In some vehicles the taxi drivers' identification &ndash; I know they carry a badge as well &ndash; which is on the dashboard, it is torn and worn. Most passengers sit in the back seat so if there is a complaint the person is probably frustrated by the incident and does not get a chance to report it because the taxi driver is gone. These numbers should be displayed on the inside and, if necessary, on the outside of the car. Many of the complaints about assaults or whatever happen at night and it is important that the identification of the taxi is clear and that people can see what is happening.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to overcharging I have used taxis regularly to travel to Heuston Station or to Dublin Airport at times when there is no traffic hold <Col N="1015" />up. There is a suspicion that there is widespread overcharging in the business. It is important that the public has access to a phone number at which it can make complaints. On the introduction of a central taxi monitoring system using a single taxi contact phone number with electronic identification, if one calls a taxi company one does not know whether the company has one, nine or 90 vehicles. One company could have vehicles waiting around the corner, yet another company would have to bring a vehicle from further away to go to the customer. It is important to have a co-ordinated system. This will reduce the waiting time for taxis. I urge that the regulator look at these important issues, given the volume of taxis now on the streets and the way the system operates. That is why I have tabled this amendment today.</P>

      <P>My concern about amendment No. 25, which is included in this grouping, was that we should be slightly more prescriptive in terms of getting the best quality service. Radio controlling is a complicated business and difficult to regulate, but the commissioner should have the possibility of using the technology that is becoming available in terms of satellite positioning to co-ordinate the radio control services in use so that a caller accesses the vehicle that is closest, or the largest pool of vehicles that can be drawn on to provide such services. I do not want to be prescriptive in terms of how the commissioner might do that but I encourage the commissioner along those lines so that we do not have a myriad radio control companies from which it is impossible to get a taxi at busy times. In other words, we can make the best use of the resources that we have. </P>

      <P>I thank Deputy Shortall for her comments on my amendment No. 46. I introduced it as a direct result of her amendments and comments on Second Stage in this regard. Putting a complaints procedure in legislation is a good idea because it is one way of ensuring that standards are increased, for example, with complaints about the condition and cleanliness of the vehicle, conduct and behaviour of a driver in overcharging fares and other matters connected with the hiring of the vehicle. The commission shall publish details of that procedure, which covers what Deputy Shortall wanted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In regard to the proposal in the amendment in the names of Deputies Breen and Naughten, my amendment covers their point &ndash; we have worded it very carefully with good legal advice. They are specific about establishing a 24 hour free phone line. That can be done, but the Government amendment states that the commission would put in place a procedure to consider complaints from <Col N="1016" />members of the public. Let it figure out whether there should be a 24 hour or 23 hour line, a fax number, an e-mail address or whatever. I would not be specific in that regard. I assure the Deputy that I will bring his amendment to its attention and I am sure that it will take up the suggestion inherent in it.</P>
    <P>In regard to the GPS proposal from Deputy Ryan, I share his enthusiasm for the deployment of satellite communications and directional equipment by small public service vehicle operators. Perhaps it is not appropriate to put it in this way because in many respects it is a commercial issue. We have provided in section 48 for the regulator to encourage different services for different operators and I am sure that he or she would encourage them in this direction. The development of radio support services for small public service vehicle operations should also be promoted within the industry. As I said under section 48 of the Bill, I envisage the commission pursuing the promotion of the provision of these services through the grant of the service qualification certificate. I am fairly certain that it will go in this direction. There is a commercial element and in any case the regulator is empowered to encourage the industry in this direction in section 48.</P>

      <P>In my young and ideological days and in the young and idealist days of the Green Party we had a provision that one would hold a particular office for two terms and move on after that. We as a party have moved on since then. It would be a pity to lose a commissioner who might have extensive experience after two terms when allowing a third term would be more appropriate.

      <P>The present provision proposes that the regulator would be allowed two terms of office, of five years each. To push that up to 15 years is not the right way to go because to leave somebody in a central role like that for a long period does not allow for changeover in <Col N="1017" />ideas and fresh approaches. Ten years is a long time to be in charge of an industry. This does not mean that the person will have ten years. He or she will have five years, with the possibility of a second five. If the Deputy thinks about it he will consider that having somebody, no matter how good, for 15 years does not allow for fresh thinking and new approaches. The extra five years does not add to the legislation. Ten years is a long time and that it is unnecessary to change it to 15.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;(10) Where the Commission consists of 2 or more members, at least one shall be a woman and one shall be a man.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The purpose of these two amendments it to achieve gender balance. That should be our aim, and not just as an aspiration, for we must make it explicit in legislation. We are all signed up &ndash; or say that we are &ndash; to achieving a 40% gender balance, and the place to start should be in public bodies. The two proposals relate to the commission, where the maximum number of commissioners will eventually be three, and also to the council. It is only good practice, and the Government should be leading the way in respect of ensuring that there is gender balance. If one looks at the customers using taxis, one will see that the vast majority are women. An increasing number of taxi drivers are also women. It is good practice, and I hope that the Minister might support the thrust of the amendment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. Brennan Mr. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no problem with the principle. The problem is the legal situation, since the Deputy's amendment asks that, where the commission consists of two or more members, at least one should be a woman and one a man. I hope that it will work out that way. We gave some thought to how we might appoint the regulator and concluded that the proper way to make the appointment was through the Civil Service Commission. I listened to what the Deputy said about that on Second Stage. There was a view that another way to appoint the regulator would be through an interview or board mechanism outside the Civil Service Commission, since one could argue that people who would exercise a considerable amount of power under the legislation should be better known publicly and should have different criteria and broader considerations applied to them than those which the Civil Service Commission would apply. However, having <Col N="1018" />reflected on that and what the Deputy said on Second Stage, I concluded that the correct course was to appoint the person through the Civil Service Commission.</P>
      <P>The newspaper advertisement for that will not be allowed to specify gender, for I would be called to the High Court within hours if I attempted something of that sort. The legislation provides for three commissioners, but I have no proposal to appoint more than one person. I sense no wish anywhere for more than one at the moment. My difficulty is having to advertise for each position as it comes up and not being able to specify the gender. I must see what the Civil Service Commission turns up. In so far as one is allowed, I encourage the commission through this debate to take account of the fact that all of us in this House support the principle and wish behind what the Deputy is saying. That is the difficulty. If I accept the amendment, it is impossible for me to apply it, for I would then have to advertise. If the first two people appointed were men, I would have to advertise for a female member. I cannot do that, for I cannot specify gender when seeking to make appointments to public positions.</P>

If the intention is to have 40% representation of women, we should be explicit about that in the legislation. While the Minister is giving an undertaking today that he will achieve 40% representation on the council, there is no guarantee that a future Minister will be as enlightened as he claims to be.

      <P>Yesterday, on Committee Stage, we finalised the Protection of the Environment Bill 2003 which is taking a huge section of powers away from the local councils around the country. In the Taxi Regulation Bill, we are also taking much of the responsibility away from local authorities. Regardless of one's view on whether they were handling their brief well or badly, it is important to ensure that the new commissioner keeps in contact with and reports to local authorities around the country and particularly to the strategic policy committees who will have a particular interest in this area. I regret the Bill does not provide for such connection back to the local authorities. While we are all encouraging people to get involved in local authority elections and to run for various parties I genuinely fear what those councils will do given the diminution of powers which is occurring. I hope the Minister of State will accept the amendment recognising that it is important that the commission relates to local authorities, elected representatives and other representatives on the strategic policy committees.</P>

If so, it will get to a stage where the House will become a glorified talking shop where nobody will be accountable. A frequent reply from the Ceann Comhairle's office is that the Minister has no official responsibility to the House for this matter. This is a common practice in respect of many parliamentary questions being tabled. I look forward to tabling an amendment to clarify the position in order to have accountability to the House and that all organisations funded would be through the Department of Finance.</P>

      <P>What is being established here is a national body and, therefore, its boundaries will extend beyond the limitations of local authorities. I take the point that we should involve the local authorities. Where a national body is concerned Deputies are of the opinion that it should have a role in this area. Being a national body, the commission's task is to report the Houses of the Oireachtas and to the Minister. In developing a new licensing and operational regime for taxis and other small public service vehicles the commission is specifically empowered to adopt measures that can be applied in particular areas, in liaison and communication with the local authorities. The commission will have the overall authority because it is a national body. This does not mean it cannot be in touch with local authorities or that the local authorities cannot put forward proposals that deal specifically with their area.</P>
      <P>Deputy Breen has tabled a later amendment in regard to the commission being accountable to the House. While the commission, which is an independent body, will be able to appear before a committee of the Oireachtas, parliamentary questions on policy will be taken by the Minister in the House.</P>

      <P>I take the point that this is a national body. I do not wish to change that or to make it a local body. From my experience on a committee instituting policy, I know that if no provision is made for the local authority to call on the commission to come in to discuss matters of significant importance, the tendency would be to act on the basis of favour. That would be unfair to and inappropriate for the local authorities in question. What is the role of the strategic policy committees on transport in local authority areas if they do not have some connection to national bodies in order that they can question, make representations and give the local picture? It would be appropriate to include them in the consultation process that the commission should have with the various State authorities. This would not take from its independence but would recognise the seemingly diminishing role of local authorities.</P>

      <P>The Bill does not state that the commission should not engage with the local authorities but it must have the authority to pursue its own goals. The Bill specifically requires the commission to consult the local authorities on the exercise of certain of its functions. Where the commission makes a proposal which it intends to pursue, the Bill ensures that it must consult with local authorities to determine how the proposal affects them. Local authorities differ, particularly in rural as opposed to urban areas. In those specific areas, the commission is obliged under this legislation to consult with the local authorities. Such issues could be raised in committee or, as part of policy, be raised in the House.</P>
      <P>At present, the Bill takes into consideration liaison between the commission and local authorities and the ability of local authorities to put forward proposals. However, the commission will have the ultimate say. It is a national body and, for that reason, we must give the body the authority to bring forward proposals.</P>
      <P>The Bill already provides for what the Deputy proposes. Other amendments regarding accountability should probably have been grouped with it. There is an overlap between the local authority and the commission. However, as a national body, the commission must have overall authority.</P>

      <P>This amendment relates to what I said earlier in regard to allowing parliamentary questions to be answered by the Minister in the Dáil. The Minister of State said that ultimately the Minister will be accountable for the commission. When we ask questions about roads, the Minister says that the NRA is accountable and we do not want to see a similar situation arising in regard to the commission. I hope the Minister will include this provision in the Bill.</P>

      <P>As I have already pointed out, the Minister is responsible for policy and Oireachtas committees have the authority to call the commission before them to answer questions. The Minister for Transport, as a sponsoring Minister for this legislation, retains overall control of the legislative framework within which the provisions of this Bill will be pursued. The Minister is therefore directly answerable to this House on matters of overall policy.</P>
      <P>Acceptance of this amendment could give rise to the engagement of operational issues in the parliamentary questions process. In the debate on Second Stage Opposition Members acknowledged that this Bill places a clear degree of accountability on the commission to the Oireachtas. I consider that the lines of responsibility between the commission and the Minister have been established in a proper format and therefore ask the Deputy to withdraw his amendment. The Deputy will be able to ask parliamentary questions and there will be no deflection from that.</P>

      <P>As Deputy Breen said, the concern here is the same as pertains to the roads area. Essentially, we can ask few questions. We believe some major issues are not just local operational issues but public policy issues in terms of investment and effect, but these are often deemed operational and deferred and the Minister says he has no responsibility for them. The real key is where <Col N="1026" />the line between policy and operational issues is drawn. If the Minister is narrow in terms of drawing policy as purely what is set out in the legislation, it may mean that he answers very few real questions in this area. I am concerned about that.</P>

      <P>The condition that a small public service vehicle must be insured has been applied since the 1963 Public Service Vehicle Regulations were introduced. The current regulations applying to the licensing of small public service vehicles specify that the vehicle must be insured to provide the service, in respect of which the vehicle is to be licensed. This requirement reflects the fact that insurance companies may apply different loadings to each category of small public service vehicle. The purpose of this paragraph is to allow the commission to continue to ensure through its regulations, that the insurance of a small public service vehicle is of a type that will cover both <Col N="1027" />the driver and passengers in the event of an accident.

      <P>In page 20, between lines 37 and 38, to insert the following subsection:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(3) A licence shall not be granted under <i>subsection (1)</i> to a person in respect of a public service vehicle unless the person is the holder of a licence under that subsection entitling the person to drive a public service vehicle.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The purpose of this amendment is to close the loophole that currently exists whereby the local authority issues a taxi plate and the carriage office issues the PSV licence. There is no connection between the two. One can apply for a taxi plate without being the holder of a PSV licence. There is potential for abuse because the loop is not closed. It is not right that a person holding a plate is not also a PSV licence holder. It is difficult to maintain control over the standard of driver and vehicle unless that connection is made.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. McDaid</NameTxt>
      <P>While I appreciate the Deputy's point, I am concerned that its intended focus is too narrow. I cannot accede to this amendment because it would mean that when a person who operates and drives a small public service vehicle retires or dies, their next of kin could not continue to operate the vehicle unless he or she was the holder of the licence to drive a small public service vehicle. In some instances, it might not be possible for that person to obtain such a licence and, as a result, the income from the operation of the small public service vehicle would cease.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is also a significant corporate involvement in certain aspects of the operation of small <Col N="1028" />public service vehicles. I refer in particular to the large funeral undertaking concerns and the large limousine operators. Were this amendment to be accepted, those operations could be compromised by the fact that the company principals might not be the holders of the relevant driver licence.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RoisinShortall" hpid="Ms Shortall Ms Shortall">
      <NameTxt>Ms Shortall</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept that point and fully concede it. However, does the Minister of State accept that there is a difficulty in terms of keeping tabs on the calibre of people who own taxi plates? The local authority which issues the plates has no way of ensuring that the person who operates that plate is of good character. There is a need to tie this matter up.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. McDaid</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Deputy suggesting that there is no reason to question the calibre of people who own PSV licences? Is a person who has an ordinary licence of better character than the person who has a PSV licence? I am not fully <i>au fait </i>with the point the Deputy is trying to make. I understand where she is coming from, in that she feels there would be a better calibre of driver. I accept that. However, I cannot understand how that has anything to do with the character of the person.</P>

It could be done on the basis of named PSV drivers who would operate under a particular plate. At the moment, there is a gap between the owner of the taxi plate and the person who drives under that plate.</P>

It is in the interests of fairness that, if a person's career is being blocked for whatever reason, including false information, the person involved should have a say in it.</P>

      <P>I must point out that any decision to refuse a licence will be the subject of a comprehensive appeal system provided for in section 35. That system incorporates a provision through which an applicant must be informed of the reason for the potential refusal of the application and may request that a review be undertaken by the licensing authority in advance of its making that decision.

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Mr. Fahey)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am particularly pleased to have the opportunity to present this important Bill to the House. The Bill has been the subject of lengthy and fruitful debate in the Seanad. I believe the amendments made to the Bill in the Seanad have improved the Bill. I thank the Members of the Upper House for their time and effort in this regard. I have absolutely no doubt that Members of the Dáil will also approach our work on this Bill in a positive and proactive manner. I also thank my colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy <Col N="1030" />Michael Ahern, for bringing the Bill through the Seanad while I was away on official business earlier this month.</P>
    <P>As he pointed out in the Seanad, it is widely acknowledged that social partnership involving employers, employees and Government has been the driving force of change in the workplace over recent years. This social partnership process has been backed up by a well-balanced range of employment rights and labour legislation which, together with measures designed to stimulate employment, provides an appropriate framework for the purpose of achieving an efficient and competitive business environment.</P>
    <P>Employment rights legislation covering a range of areas such as conditions of employment has an important role to play in promoting labour market stability and minimising conflict. In keeping with Ireland's voluntarist tradition, collective agreements are, generally, the primary method of determining conditions of employment. The role of statute law has generally been limited to that of setting minimum levels of protection or entitlement.</P>
    <P>Ireland has over the past 20 to 30 years been at the forefront in ensuring that reasonable conditions of employment exist which set out clearly for both employers and employees their respective entitlements. Successive Governments have enacted legislation in the area of employment rights reflecting changes in society and the workplace at both national and international levels through, for example, the transposition of EU directives, and reflecting in Irish domestic law the standard-setting activities of the International Labour Organisation and the Council of Europe.</P>
    <P>Such legislation has covered a wide range of areas, including minimum notice and terms of employment; protection against unfair dismissal; payment of wages; organisation of working time; safeguarding of employees' rights on the transfer of undertakings; protection of young persons at work; safety, health and welfare; redundancy and insolvency entitlements; minimum wage entitlements; and protection of part-time workers.</P>
    <P>One area where employment rights legislation has dramatically affected people's work and lifestyle is that of the organisation of working time. This area covers issues such as holiday entitlements, rest periods, maximum working time and night work. Changing social needs and technological advances have influenced the way we work and the length of time in terms of days and hours per week we spend in the workplace.</P>
    <P>Nowadays, employers want a well educated and flexible workforce that allows their companies to be competitive in what are becoming increasingly globalised markets. Employees also want the flexibility that enables them to balance work and family life. They want to be allowed to move within and across employment and, thereby, enhance their work skills and educational needs through life-long learning programmes. Many such employees do this by means of temporary employment, either through the <Col N="1031" />auspices of employment agencies or through fixed-term contract work.</P>
    <P>In particular, fixed-term contract work provides these employees with both opportunities and challenges. Many of their contracts are fixed-purpose based or time based to coincide with the completion of a specific task or an event. This often involves meeting deadlines by the employee on the one hand, while giving employers increased productivity through clearly identifiable targets or outputs on the other. The combination of job satisfaction for fixed-term employees and increased productivity for employers has in many ways changed the environment in the Irish labour market in recent years.</P>
    <P>All these changes in employment rights legislation have influenced employment trends and the numbers in employment. According to Central Statistics Office figures for the last quarter of 2002, the number of persons in employment has risen from 1.22 million in 1994 to 1.77 million in 2002. That is an increase of 45%. Part of this number includes 294,000 part-time workers. This number represents 17% of the workforce, with the majority of these being women. In addition to atypical workers such as part-time workers, there is also the category of fixed-term contract workers. While the CSO does not at present have figures for these workers, it is estimated that there are 70,000 fixed-term contract workers, that is just 4% of the workforce.</P>
    <P>I should indicate to the Dáil that the CSO has been requested, as part of its review of the Quarterly National Household Survey 2003-2006, to include in its questionnaires a series of questions to ascertain the numbers and trends in relation to fixed-term workers. Despite these increasing and welcome figures, we have, over the past few years, been experiencing severe skills shortages in our economy. This is also happening right across Europe. To address this major problem, the European Commission and the European Council has, since 1998 under the Luxembourg process, each year requested member states to prepare an employment action plan setting out their respective Government's proposals on how to improve the overall economic environment in terms of people at work. As part of this process member states, in their respective annual employment action plans, are required to set out policies which, <i>inter alia,</i> facilitate opportunities for women who have raised their families and are keen to come back into the workplace. They are also required to formulate family-friendly policies which facilitate, in particular, greater female participation in the workforce.</P>
    <P>The European Commission guidelines for 2002 &ndash; this is the fifth year of this process &ndash; set out a number of horizontal objectives aimed at building conditions for full employment in a knowledge-based economy. The detailed guidelines require member states to formulate policies involving a more employment-friendly approach through a review, where necessary, of benefits, taxes and <Col N="1032" />training systems, and positive measures to maintain the skills and working capacity of older workers, especially through sufficient access to education and training and flexible working conditions such as part-time and contract work.</P>
    <P>The Government and its predecessor have in recent budgets substantially reduced the burden of income tax thereby making the option of working more attractive. The scenario I have painted sets us both a challenge and an opportunity. In this context, the timing of our discussions on the Bill is opportune.</P>
    <P>The Bill seeks to implement the provisions of EU Council Directive 1999/70/EC of 28 June 1999 concerning the framework agreement on fixed-term work concluded by the general cross-industry organisations at European level, namely, UNICE, the Union of Industrial and Employers Confederations of Europe, CEEP, the European Centre of Enterprises with Public Participation, and ETUC, the European Trade Union Confederation. The objectives of the directive are: to improve the quality of fixed-term work by ensuring the application of the principle of non-discrimination, meaning that fixed-term workers must be treated not less favourably than comparable permanent workers; remove discrimination against fixed-term workers where such exists; and establish a framework to prevent abuses arising from the use of successive fixed-term employment contracts.</P>
    <P>The target date for the implementation of this directive was 10 July 2001. A tripartite working group, including representatives from the social partners, IBEC and ICTU, who broadly support the intent of the directive, and from relevant Departments and State agencies, was established to discuss the measures necessary for the implementation of the directive. The deliberations of the group have contributed to and influenced the composition of the Bill. Article 2 of the directive allows for its implementation in an individual member state by means of a collective agreement between the social partners.. However, both ICTU and IBEC declined this option for the implementation of the directive in Ireland. Accordingly, it was necessary to prepare the Bill.</P>
    <P>I thank both IBEC and ICTU for their work at European and national levels in framing the Bill, which I believe will have a major social impact in Ireland in the years ahead. I also thank them for their contributions to my Department in recent weeks since the Bill passed through the Seanad. A number of important and constructive amendments have emerged which are being examined by my Department in consultation with the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel to the Government. I hope to be in a position to table a number of Government amendments on Committee Stage next week designed to reflect some of these concerns and which should improve the intent of the Bill and result in its speedy enactment.</P>
    <P>The scope of the directive is expressed as applying to fixed-term workers who have an employment contract or employment relationship <Col N="1033" />as defined by law, collective agreement or practice in force in each member state. In this context, Irish labour law covers persons employed under contracts of service. The Bill, which implements the terms of the directive, provides for measures guaranteeing that fixed-term workers may not be treated less favourably than full-time workers. It also requires the removal of discrimination against fixed-term workers where such exists and contains measures aimed at improving the quality of fixed-term work. The Fixed-Term Work Directive on which the Bill is based provides that the quality of work be improved by the application of the principle of non-discrimination, which means that people on fixed-term contracts are not treated in a less favourable manner than comparable permanent workers.</P>
    <P>One aspect of the Bill to which I would like to refer specifically is the inclusion of pay and pension entitlements of fixed-term workers. This entitlement is covered under the definition of &ldquo;remuneration&rdquo; set out in the interpretation section of the Bill, section 2. The Government has decided to include pay and pensions in the Bill as a deliberate policy initiative without prejudice to continuing to maintain the validity of the legal advice received to the effect that, because of the wording of Article 137(6) of the treaty, such inclusion cannot be regarded as obligatory under Directive 1999/70/EC. The Government's decision on pay and pensions means that fixed-term workers should be treated in a similar manner to comparable permanent workers with immediate effect in so far as pay and pension entitlements are concerned. This is entirely consistent as the Government has already granted similar pay and pension entitlements to part-time workers under the Protection of Employees (Part-Time Work) Act 2001.</P>
    <P>The granting of such entitlements to fixed-term workers will have the effect of increasing overall pension coverage levels. All parties to the new Sustaining Progress social partnership agreement share the objective that the level of coverage of occupational pensions schemes should be increased and are committed to co-operating to promote improvements in the coverage of schemes towards the national pensions policy initiative target of 70% of the workforce over 30 years. Employers who exclude employees from their pension scheme or who limit eligibility for a scheme must, from 15 September 2003, provide access to at least one standard personal retirement savings account, PRSA.</P>
    <P>The cost to the Exchequer of the inclusion of pay and pension entitlements in the Bill in respect of the wider public service is estimated at &euro;50 million annually. However, the economic and social benefits that will accrue, especially where workplace relationships and the promotion and encouragement of the process of change in work relationships are concerned, which will benefit both employers and employees alike, will be considerable. For example, fixed-term work can help people achieve a balance between work and fam<Col N="1034" />ily and fit in caring responsibilities. Term-time only contracts can benefit parents. It is important that those with caring responsibilities can provide for their retirement. Women are significantly more likely than men to be in fixed-term employment between the ages of 25 and 44 which are often the most important years for pensions benefit.</P>
    <P>Section 8 indicates that fixed-term workers must be advised by their employer in writing of the objective grounds justifying the withdrawal of the contract of employment on a fixed-term contract basis. Section 9 specifically addresses the issue of the use of successive fixed-term contracts by employers. The effect of this is to provide in future that, following a period of continuous service of at least three years by a fixed-term employee, an employer may in effect renew a fixed-term contract once only. Thereafter, further renewal of the fixed-term contract concerned will be deemed to be a contract of indefinite duration. The thinking behind this is that a period of three years' service followed by one renewal, which as drafted can be of any duration, provides a link to permanency in the employment of fixed-term workers.</P>
    <P>Section 9 provides those who have accumulated three years' service at a minimum with an employer will only have to complete one further contract before being deemed to be in a contract of indefinite duration. Employers are free to give such workers permanent employment through open-ended contracts of indefinite duration before the three year period required expires based on the performance of that fixed-term worker.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Toole tabled an amendment to this section on Committee Stage in the Seanad which was essentially designed to place a time limit on how long workers could be employed on fixed-term contract before being offered a contract of indefinite duration. I thank Senator O'Toole for this amendment which is being considered by the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel to the Government, and I will return to the House on this issue on Committee Stage next week with a package of amendments aimed at clarifying the intent of this section.</P>

      <P>Sections 15 to 17 provide that where fixed-term contract workers are concerned about their treatment by employers, they will have recourse to redress procedures of the rights commissioner service of the Labour Relations Commissioner Service in the first instance and then, on appeal, to the Labour Court, with a further appeal on a point of law to the High Court. These redress procedures are a standard provision in employment rights legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Many of the provisions to Part 2, entitled &ldquo;Fixed-Term Work and Rights of Fixed Term Workers&rdquo;, mirror the provisions of the Protection of Employees (Part-Time Work) Act 2001, which <Col N="1035" />also arose from a similar framework agreement at European level. Other provisions on complaints to rights commissioners and enforcement procedures reflect standard provisions of other employment rights legislation generally.</P>
    <P>While I have already highlighted key areas of the Bill, I will outline in detail the main provisions as passed by Seanad Éireann.</P>
    <P>Section 1 is a standard provision dealing with the Short Title of the Bill. Section 2 sets out the definitions. During the debate on the Bill in the Seanad, the Government accepted an Opposition amendment which brought the definition of &ldquo;remuneration&rdquo; into line with Protection of Employees (Part-Time Work) Act 2001. In addition, the exclusion of agency workers from the scope of the Bill was specifically raised by a number of Senators. In response, the Minister gave a commitment that the Government would report on this matter on Committee Stage in the Dáil and update the Seanad of any developments after passage of the Bill through the House.</P>
    <P>This exclusion was done in accordance with the terms of the Framework Agreement on Fixed-Term Work annexed to Directive 1999/70/EC which provided that the agreement &ldquo;applies to fixed term workers with the exceptions of those placed by a temporary work agency at the disposition of a user enterprise&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>This was done for a variety of reasons, not least the intention since the very beginning to deal with part-time, fixed term and temporary agency workers separately. Although the first two agreements between the social partners at European level finally reached were similar in nature, this was achieved after a thorough discussion of each type of work.</P>
    <P>Negotiations on a temporary agency worker directive between social partners at European level broke done in May 2001 and a draft directive in this area was subsequently published by the EU Commission in March 2002. This draft directive remains under detailed discussion in Brussels.</P>
    <P>While it is unclear at this stage how the Italian Presidency proposes to advance the temporary agency dossier, we understand it will continue to work on the proposal with a view to possibly reaching political agreement during its Presidency, which ends in December.</P>
    <P>Accordingly, under the definition of &ldquo;contract of employment&rdquo; in section 2, agency workers who agree with another person who is carrying on the business of an employment within the meaning of the Employment Agency Act 1971, and is acting in the course of that business to do or perform personally any work or service for a third person, whether or not the third person is party to the contract, are excluded from the ambit of the legislation because of the provision in the framework agreement on fixed-term work. Agency workers who have a contract of employment directly with an employment agency, however, are covered by <Col N="1036" />the Bill as, in those cases, the employment agency would be the employer as defined in the Bill.</P>
    <P>Section 3 empowers the Minister to make regulations and orders prescribing any matter or thing which is referred to in the Bill as prescribed or for the purpose of any enabling any provision of the Bill to have full effect.</P>
    <P>Section 4 is a standard provision. Section 5 provides that the employee is a comparable permanent employee in relation to a fixed-term employee if the permanent employee and the fixed-term employee are employed by the same or associated employer and one of the conditions referred to in (i), (ii) or (iii) is met. Where that does not apply, including a case where the fixed-term employee is the sole employee of the employer, the permanent employee is specified in a collective agreement, being an agreement that for the time being has effect in relation to the relevant fixed-term employee, to be a comparable employee in relation to the fixed-term employee. Where neither of those apply, the employee is employed in the same industry or sector of employment as the fixed-term employee and one of the conditions referred to in (i), (ii) or (iii) is met.</P>
    <P>The following are the conditions (i), (ii) and (iii) referred to: (i) both employees perform the same work under the same or similar conditions or each is interchangeable with the other in relation to the work; (ii) the work performed by one of the employees concerned is of the same or a similar nature to that performed by the other and any differences between the work performed or the conditions under which it is performed by each, either are of small importance in relation to the work as a whole or occur with such irregularity as not to be significant; and (iii) the work performed by the relevant fixed-term employee is equal or greater in value to the work performed by the other employee concerned, having regard to such matters as skill, physical or mental requirements, responsibility and working conditions.</P>
    <P>Section 6 provides that, generally, a fixed-term employee shall not be treated less favourably than a comparable permanent employee in respect of his or her conditions of employment. Section 6(4) was amended on Committee Stage in the Seanad to bring it into line with section 9(5) of the Protection of Employees (Part-Time Work) Act 2001 so that a comparator for a fixed-term employee should be of the same or opposite sex to such an employee.</P>
    <P>Section 7 provides that a ground for treating an employee less favourably shall not be regarded as an objective ground for that purpose unless it is based on considerations other than the fixed-term status of the employee.</P>
    <P>Section 8(1) provides that a fixed-term employee shall be informed in writing by his or her employer as soon as practicable of the objective condition determining the contract &ndash; arriving at a specific date, completing a specific task or the occurrence of a specific event. Section 8(2) <Col N="1037" />provides that where an employer proposes to renew a fixed-term contract the employee shall be informed in writing, not later than the date of renewal, of the objective grounds justifying the renewal of the fixed-term contract and the failure to offer a contract of indefinite duration. Section 8(3) provides that the written statements referred to in section 8(1) and section 8(2) are admissible as evidence in any proceedings under the Act. Section 8(4) provides that a rights commissioner or the Labour Court may draw any inference he or she considers just and equitable if it appears to him or her that an employer omitted to provide a written statement, or a written statement is evasive or equivocal.</P>
    <P>Section 9 is currently being revised by the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel to the Government and I hope to table a package of Government amendments on this section on Committee Stage next week.</P>
    <P>Section 10 provides that in order for a fixed-term employee to have the same opportunity as other employees to secure a permanent position, an employer shall inform him or her of relevant vacancies which occur.</P>
    <P>Section 11 provides that when calculating the threshold above which employees' representative bodies may be constituted in an undertaking in line with section 4 of the Transnational Information and Consultation of Employees Act 1996, fixed-term employees shall be taken into account. Employers shall, as far as practicable, consider informing employees' representatives about fixed-term work in the undertaking.</P>
    <P>Section 12 provides that a provision in any employment agreement shall be void in so far as it is inconsistent with any provision of this Bill.</P>
    <P>Section 13 provides that an employer shall not penalise an employee for invoking his or her right to be treated in his or her employment in the manner provided for in this Part of the Bill. Penalisation of an employee is also forbidden for having lawfully opposed an act which is unlawful under this Bill or for giving evidence in any proceedings under this Bill. Penalisation for this purpose includes dismissal, unfavourable change in conditions of employment or any unfair treatment including selection for redundancy.</P>
    <P>Part 3 deals with enforcement. Section 14 provides that a complaint by an employee, or by a trade union of which the employee is a member, that the employer has contravened any provision of the Bill in relation to that employee, may be presented to a rights commissioner. The rights commissioner shall issue a written decision in the matter and communicate that decision to the parties. The decision of the rights commissioner may require the employer to pay compensation subject to a limit of two years of the employee's remuneration. A complaint to a rights commissioner must be made within six months of the date of contravention of the Bill or the date of termination of the contract of employment concerned, whichever is the earlier. This period may <Col N="1038" />be extended by a further 12 months if the commissioner is satisfied that failure to refer the case within six months was due to reasonable cause. The hearing before the rights commissioner shall be conducted in private.</P>
    <P>Section 15 provides that a decision of a rights commissioner may be appealed to the Labour Court within six weeks of the date of the decision. The Labour Court shall issue a determination in writing affirming, varying or setting aside the decision of the rights commissioner. The Labour Court may, under this section, request the Minister to refer a question of law arising in proceedings before it to the High Court for final and conclusive determination. Where a decision of the rights commissioner has not been carried out by the employer, and an appeal against the decision has not been brought within the time allowed for doing so, the employee may refer the complaint to the Labour Court and the court, without hearing any evidence, may make a determination to the like effect as the decision of the rights commissioner.</P>
    <P>Section 16 provides that where an employer fails to implement a determination of the Labour Court within six weeks from the date it is communicated to the parties, and the determination has not been appealed within the appropriate time limit, the Circuit Court shall on application to it by the employee concerned, a trade union of which the employee is a member or the Minister, and without hearing any evidence, make an order directing the employer to implement the determination.</P>
    <P>Section 17 provides that the Bill shall not apply to a member of the Defence Forces, a trainee garda or a trainee nurse.</P>
    <P>Section 18 provides that relief may not be granted to an employee in respect of a penalisation in contravention of section 13(1) which constitutes a dismissal of an employee within the meaning of the unfair dismissals legislation, both under Part 3 of this Bill and under those Acts. It also provides that a person who is a fixed-term employee under this Bill and a part-time employee under the Protection of Employees (Part-Time Work) Act 2001 may not obtain relief in respect of the same circumstances under both this Bill and the 2001 Act.</P>
    <P>Section 19 raises the fines of £50 and £10 provided for in section 10(1) of the Employment Agency Act 1971 to &euro;2,000 and &euro;1,000 respectively. It also amends section 28(8) of the Organisation of Working Time Act 1997 and section 17(8) of the Protection of Employees (Part-Time Work) Act 2001 by removing the time limit of six weeks which currently applies to referrals of rights commissioners' decisions to the Labour Court. It further provides for a technical amendment to section 39(2) of the Organisation of Working Time Act 1997 relating to the powers of a rights commissioner, the Employment Appeals Tribunal or the Labour Court to amend decisions in certain cases.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1039" />I am satisfied that the right to reasonable conditions of employment should continue to be enshrined in employment rights legislation. It is our duty as elected and accountable legislators to take a proactive approach in ensuring that any future legislation reflects the needs and expectations of both employees and employers, is framed in such a way as to respond to the needs of society as a whole and reflects the ongoing changes occurring at an enormous pace in the labour market.</P>
    <P>The Protection of Employees (Fixed-Term Work) Bill 2003 is, without doubt, a welcome addition to our employment rights legislation. It will have a major impact on our employment landscape and, in particular, on professionals such as teachers and nurses, many of whom have been on fixed-term contracts without having the right to a permanent position. That will come to an end with this Bill and, accordingly, I commend the Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardMurphy" hpid="Mr. Murphy Mr. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>Fine Gael welcomes the Bill, which is overdue. Those working on fixed-term contracts will breath a sigh of relief at the increased level of job security provided by the Bill.</P>
      <P>As with so much of the business of this House, the Bill allows for the transposition into Irish law of an European Union directive which seeks to give contract workers the rights they deserve and to end exploitation of some workers by some bad employers.</P>
      <P>The Bill clearly shows the social progressive nature of the European Union. During the Nice referendum, many on the far left of the political spectrum condemned the EU as a body obsessed with the needs of the bosses. Many of those on the right continue to claim that the EU costs us jobs and holds back business. As a party of the progressive centre, Fine Gael recognises that the European Union is neither of those. The Bill gives employees protection, and it will not cost a single job. The people share our view of the EU which is that it is not a threat to employees or employers. Perhaps some day both elements on the extreme fringes will also agree with this concept. It is important to recognise that, were it not for the European Union, many of these progressive and socially-motivated directives would not be transferred into Irish law. That is the case currently and for the past six years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is generally accepted that this Government is the most right wing since the foundation of the State. Were it not for EU directives, social issues and workers' rights would not be a priority for this Government. The Tánaiste admitted that this Government was closer to Boston than Berlin. The Republican Party in the United States is obsessed with creating a favourable climate for big business, much like this Government's attitude over the past six years, where the rich have become richer and the poor have become poorer. There is always a danger, however, that too many <Col N="1040" />regulations will make us less competitive. That is why it is important to get the balance right, with flexibility to allow business to expand and change matched with fair and equitable legislation to protect workers' rights.</P>
    <P>The recent agreed expansion of the European Union will further help to create a level playing field as the new entrants will have to comply with the same environmental and work-related regulations as us. It is important to highlight that because during the European debates, the question of how the EU benefits workers is often raised. The principal benefit is that they are afforded rights that Ireland would not otherwise be able to afford. If Ireland were seeking to act on its own, we would not be able to impose these rights unilaterally because it would involve a significant competitive disadvantage for us. We are only able to establish such rights on a European-wide basis.</P>
    <P>It is important that the electorate realises that the benefits to individual employees are the other side to the EU and the Single Market. We all accept that social partnership, involving all sectors, has been a driving force for change. This process should be backed up with a well-balanced range of employment rights and company legislation, which we hope will continue to work in an efficient and competitive business environment.</P>
    <P>Due to the downturn in the economy and escalating costs, major challenges must be faced to ensure we remain competitive. For this reason, it is important that reasonable conditions of employment exist. It is important also that the respective entitlements of employers and employees are clearly set out. We have lost some competitive advantage in the past 12 months but I have no doubt this is entirely due to Government inaction, or too much action in some cases with the introduction of stealth taxes and charges. Insurance costs now cost us thousands of jobs, and there is still no solution in sight. Having said that, we welcome the Bill. Everyone accepts that the needs of workers and employers have changed over the years.</P>
    <P>The Bill is being introduced against the backdrop of a very different Irish workforce from that of ten or 20 years ago. There are now 294 part-time workers in the economy, representing 17% of the workforce. The idea of a job for life has gone. People may now carve out a career but they believe it is neither practical nor desirable to spend 20, 30 or even 40 years working for the same employer or institution.</P>
    <P>Hand in hand with this is the concept of contract work which offers an attractive prospect for thousands of young people entering the labour market for the first time, unsure of whether they wish to pledge their lives to their chosen profession or to one employer. Unfortunately, such attractions come with a price tag &ndash; job insecurity, less favourable treatment by management and often a general sense that they are being undervalued. Frequently, it is the contract worker who is asked to do what a permanent employee would <Col N="1041" />never dream of doing. This cannot be allowed to continue.</P>
    <P>This debate is framed around the Fine Gael Party's key belief in the need for rights and responsibility. For employers, the right to run a thriving, successful business is enshrined in our democratic system. No one is suggesting it would be possible to do this without the flexibility of a system of contract workers. What is suggested is that employers have a duty of responsibility to such workers once they have been in their employ for a given period. This will be recognised by the majority of employers and only a few rogue employers will fear the Bill.</P>
    <P>The Bill also points to the rights and responsibilities of employees. By allowing for easier passage to permanent status, workers will receive a share of the benefits, duties and responsibilities of permanent employees. In this way, employers win and employees' rights are protected.</P>
    <P>I wish to address the timing of the Bill. My colleague in the Upper House, Senator Coghlan, drew attention to the fact that the European Commission has claimed that Ireland failed to properly implement the relevant directive, which should have been transposed into law in 1999. While the Government is not known for keeping its promises, failing to keep international commitments takes its lack of action to a new level. A long list of legal cases is pending against the State for non-implementation of European Union directives, notably on the environment but also on other issues. The Government should be more proactive in ensuring that EU directives, especially those on workers' rights, are promptly transposed into Irish law.</P>
    <P>While I welcome specific aspects of the Bill, I also have a number of questions. It would be difficult for anyone to argue with the broad thrust of the legislation. Section 7 states that, generally, a fixed-term employee should not be treated less favourably than a comparable permanent employee in respect of his or her conditions of employment. It is astounding that we are debating this issue in 2003 as it should have been achieved a long time ago.</P>
    <P>Section 10(1) states the contract for fixed-term employment may be renewed only once after the employee has been in employment for a period of three years. I broadly support this move. It is not fair that it is possible for people to work for a company for 20 years without knowing from one year to the next whether they will keep their job. I hope it will be accepted that such circumstances will cease once the Bill is enacted.</P>
    <P>The Fine Gael Party supports the dynamic economy in which we live, but justice and fair play must be available to employees. The Bill goes some way towards achieving this. I welcome the moves towards establishing a rights commissioner to adjudicate in alleged cases of contravention of the measures provided for in the Bill and that provision is made for referral to the Labour Court when the rights commissioner is unable to solve an impasse. There is, I understand, some <Col N="1042" />degree of discomfort regarding the potential bureaucratic load which could be placed on employers upon enactment of the legislation. Employers must already deal with too much red tape. I call on the Government to assure business that the amount of red tape the Bill will entail will be minimised.</P>
    <P>I ask the Government to outline how it arrived at the estimated cost of the provisions of &euro;50 million. The Minister of State partially addressed the matter and we will consider his comments. While I agree the Bill will benefit the economy, these benefits are not always clear to the casual observer and accusations of big government can ring true.</P>
    <P>The Bill is a step forward, particularly for those on fixed-term contracts who want only the security and respect they deserve. We have the European Union to thank for these measures and the Government for the shameful delays in implementing them. The Fine Gael Party commends the legislation to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TommyBroughan" hpid="Mr. Broughan Mr. Broughan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Broughan</NameTxt>
      <P>On behalf of the Labour Party, I warmly welcome the Protection of Employees (Fixed-Term Work) Bill 2003, which deals with the most vulnerable and sometimes most abused workers in the economy. According to figures cited by the Minister of State, there are some 70,000 such workers in this country. From experience, however, it appears inconceivable that their number could be so low. A significant proportion of the 1.7 million workforce, now approaching 1.8 million, to which the Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Michael Ahern, referred in the Seanad, are now covered by fixed-term contracts. The issue was obviously crying out for action.</P>
      <P>The Minister of State noted the role of State and local authorities in employing workers on fixed-term contracts. He referred, for example, to teachers and nurses. Many other local authority workers and a plethora of workers employed in the community sector have minimal protection under one year contracts. These apply, for example, in the jobs initiative programme to which I recently drew the Minister of State's attention.</P>
      <P>There are significant issues in the Bill which need to be examined, particularly the objective grounds for giving a worker successive, fixed-term contracts and their number and duration. I will return to these points.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As my colleague, Deputy Murphy, mentioned, the appalling aspect of the presentation of this legislation is that the House is being asked to implement a directive issued in June 1999, based on the framework agreement and arrived at after many years of discussion with the European Trade Union Congress, UNICE and CEEP. We were required to transpose the directive into Irish law by 10 July 2001, almost exactly two years ago, but the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Harney, failed to do so. We were then allowed another year's grace until 10 <Col N="1043" />July 2002 if we applied for special circumstances, which I understand we also failed to do. Now that we have been brought shame-facedly before the European Court of Justice, we are belatedly having to bring legislation before the House in the last few days before the recess and, once again, effectively force it through using a guillotine. The Government's lethargic approach to worker protection legislation is lamentable and typical of the Minister and the policy she has pursued for the past six years during one of the longest ministerial tenures in the history of the State.</P>
    <P>In recent weeks, newspapers have carried a debate on the Government's position on the ideological spectrum. Last week, for example, Dan O'Brien of the <i>Economist Intelligence Unit</i> informed us that a consideration of the Government's spending policies, fiscal ideas, overspending in certain areas, agreement on benchmarking and consultation with social partners would place it left of centre. This is taking a snapshot at a point in time. As my colleague Deputy Quinn pointed out in <i>The Irish Times</i> yesterday, when one looks at the Government over the past six years, the countries to which we might be compared &ndash; which mostly have had Labour governments &ndash; would have a universal health system, would have put in place a full scale decent public transport system at some time over the past 50 years and have dealt with issues of access to education.</P>
    <P>It is ludicrous to place the Government anywhere on the left of the spectrum. Nowhere is this more true than in the transposition of European worker protection legislation. I have been sceptical about some aspects of European development in the past and have not been afraid to articulate it. The best influence Europe has had on this State in our 30 years of EU membership has been in the area of worker protection legislation. There is a plethora of legislation on the Statute Book that ultimately came from directives of the European Commission, by agreement with the European Parliament and the Council of Ministers.</P>
    <P>The first Bill I introduced to this House asked the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, after years of neglect, to introduce the directive on the transfer of undertakings for workers. While this is a welcome Bill, why has the Government been so lethargic in introducing it? Is the Government doing this because the EU put it in the dock and left it with no choice but to do so? I regret that, once again, the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment has not been to the fore in bringing forward legislation to protect workers.</P>
    <P>At this time, the Government, in conjunction with three other states, is blocking completion of the directive on temporary agency workers. Given that there are at least 100,000 such workers in this country, this is remarkable. The Minister of State has attended meetings on this recently, perhaps he will update us on the progress made.</P>

There were meetings on this last November and the Minister was present at one earlier this month when four countries opposed it. We have tried to show that we need at least an 18 month commitment to host firms for these agency workers before they receive the same rights. This is the nub of the issue.</P>
      <P>Since the vast majority of temporary workers fall outside the scope of equal treatment provisions, this temporary agency worker legislation is essential. I hope progress has been made in that regard. It was mentioned that the prime ministers would consider it at Thessalonika and that the Party of European Socialists, to which my party belongs, would bring that to the fore. The sad reality is that we have led the way in preventing the protection of temporary agency workers. The Minister of State made the point that due to skills shortages, the economy needs additional workers in a range of areas. Surely we should support a cross European, 25 country regime that would protect these workers. As the Minister knows, they are open to exploitation and gross abuse.</P>

      <P>This legislation is welcome. Colleagues have referred to the massive changes in the labour market where there are now almost 300,000 temporary workers, many of whom are women and this sector now makes up 17% of the workforce.</P>
      <P>I welcome what the Minister of State said about gaining knowledge of the precise number of temporary workers in the 2003-06 period. I urge the Minister of State to create better conditions for those workers and it is important for policy makers to know the numbers involved.</P>
      <P>It is of critical importance that we prevent further maltreatment of workers and many features of the Bill are welcome. I note the Minister of State said he was open to amendment in one important matter. The Labour Party will table an extensive number of amendments, as it did in the Seanad. The core point of the Bill is that fixed-term workers will not be treated less favourably than permanent workers. I would like to tease out the objective conditions in this regard.</P>
      <P>I have already mentioned that local and national government services have availed of fixed-term workers over many years and I welcome the Minister of State's comments that this legislation will help bring this to an end. While local authorities often take workers on for seasonal work for three to five months, the workers receive no permanent benefits.</P>
      <P>I urge the Minister of State to look again at the issue of job initiatives. Deputies have been bombarding the Minister of State with notes from different community groups that are under severe stress because of fixed five year terms and rolling one year terms. Perhaps the Minister of State might look at this over the next three or four years, if the Government survives, and bring forward comprehensive legislation regarding the rights of all of those workers and providing full backing for community support programmes.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social and Family Affairs (Mary Coughlan)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Pensions Board is a statutory body which is financed by fees payable by occupational pension schemes and PRSA providers. The main functions of the board are to supervise the operation of the Pensions Act and to advise on matters relating to pensions generally. The memberships of the board includes representatives of trade unions, employers, the Government, the pensions industry, trustees, consumers and pensioners. The existing board was appointed in December 2000 and published a strategy statement in 2002 covering the period up to 2005, when its term expires.</P>
      <P>It was decided some time ago that the board should conduct a mid-term review of its work programme and also a review of its strategy. To facilitate these reviews an away day was held in the hotel in question on 15 and 16 May. Those who attended included members of the Pensions Board, management of the board and officials from my Department involved in the pensions policy area. The meeting was facilitated by a consultant and the main objective was to identify areas of the strategy which needed to be revised.</P>
      <P>For a number of years the work of the board has revolved around the implementation of the national pensions policy initiative. The implementation of the provisions of the Pensions (Amendment) Act 2002 is also a critical element in the board's programme of work and a review of progress was an important part of the meeting in question. The board also looked at the external influences affecting pensions when it took office in 2000 and the way these have changed over the past years.</P>
      <P>Following on from these reviews, there were wide-ranging discussions on a number of issues in the pensions area. These included: the ability of the system to deliver adequate income for pensioners; the role of trustees in operating schemes; the possible implications for the board of the appointment of the pensions ombudsman and the launch of the Irish Financial Services Regulatory Authority; and the action required to ensure that PRSAs will be effective in increasing overall pension coverage. The detailed agenda will be provided. I understand from the board that the cost of the away day, including preparatory and follow-up work, was approximately &euro;19,000.</P>
      <P>The Pensions Board is active in regulating pensions and developing policy. It is appropriate that, at intervals, it should conduct an in-depth review of its operation and policy thinking. I pay tribute to the commitment of the board and its members for the outstanding contribution they have made to the development and implementation of the legislation in place for the regulation of pension schemes and the protection of pension rights.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelRing" hpid="Mr. Ring Mr. Ring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ring</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad the Minister provided a detailed response because I have been having <Col N="1047" />great difficulty in obtaining responses to parliamentary questions from her. Does she agree that this business of the Pensions Board could have been conducted in her Department? Yesterday, I attended Government Buildings and was never at a more lavish venue. There was nothing wrong with the board conducting its business there. Why did it have to go to Tinakilly House, at a cost of &euro;19,000, at a time when people are finding it difficult to live on their social welfare payments because of recent cost of living increases?</P>
      <P>The Minister has overall responsibility for the Pensions Board. Why did she allow it to spend &euro;19,000 on this venture at a time when people are losing home help and are unable to get into hospitals. At a time when all Departments are implementing cutbacks and when social welfare recipients are expected to live on &euro;150 per week, members of the Pensions Board can attend a weekend conference and avail of bed and breakfast accommodation, including meals and golf outings. Can the Minister stand over that?</P>
      <P>I am appalled at the amount of money spent by the Pensions Board. The meeting should have been held in Government Buildings. I do not know how the members of the board had time to do their business, given that they were involved in golfing activities and availed of dinners and a free bar. I would be interested to see the conference agenda and to ascertain if members of the board adhered to it.</P>

I am accountable only in the way provided by the legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As usual, Deputy Ring reflects on something in his idiosyncratic manner which was inadequately reported in the media. Naturally the reports will not be corrected. I indicated that I would circulate the agenda of the conference. Between 9 a.m. and 5.30 p.m. the board was involved in the review of its strategy for the period 2002-05. This included a consideration of progress reports, the external influences on pensions during 2002, a general discussion on the direction of the board <Col N="1048" />since 2000 and an examination of four specific items, including the question as to whether pensions systems will work, if the focus on trustees is the best way forward and if the advent of the pensions ombudsman will change the occupation of the board.</P>

      <P>The provision of comprehensive information in a clear and simple manner is an essential element in the effective delivery of social welfare services. The underlying objective of my Department's information policy is to ensure that all citizens are made aware of their entitlements under a broad range of social insurance, social assistance and other supports and are kept informed of changes and improvements as they occur. I am satisfied that the objective is being met.</P>
      <P>My Department ensures that citizens are made aware of new schemes and services through advertising, using an appropriate mix of national and provincial media, and information leaflets, fact sheets, posters and direct mail shots. Selective use is made of the freephone telephone service to provide information on new schemes and services and at particular times of the year, for example, at budget time. In addition, my Department's schemes and services are published on RTE's teletext service, AERTEL, and on our website at www.welfare.ie. All new mothers receive a bounty pack, which includes a booklet and a claim form on child benefit, prior to leaving maternity hospitals.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A recent newspaper article dated 18 June, identified a discrepancy of 52,000 between the number of children under 16 years of age who are entitled to child benefit and the number of those in payment by the Department. Figures released by the CSO show that according to the census of 2002, there were 888,310 children under the age of 16 years. The number of children in receipt of child benefit from the Department on 30 April <Col N="1049" />2002 was 878,870, with another 8,000 claims being processed by my Department. The discrepancy between the two figures is 1,440, which is different to the discrepancy of 52,000 quoted in the newspaper article.</P>
    <P>My Department is aware that a small number of families do not claim child benefit. A new initiative will begin this summer where all mothers of new babies will receive an invitation to apply for child benefit. Mothers of new babies who have already submitted a child benefit claim for another child will automatically receive benefit for the new baby. I am satisfied that the new arrangements and the information services provided by my Department will address the issue effectively and help to ensure that all those entitled to receive child benefit payments receive them.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamPenrose" hpid="Mr. Penrose Mr. Penrose">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Penrose</NameTxt>
      <P>My question was provoked by the article in the news media to which the Minister referred, which indicated that there was a discrepancy of 52,000. Is she satisfied that following the preliminary census results, this figure is incorrect? It is surprising that there is such a disparity between the Minister's figure and that published by a newspaper, which indicated it was extracted from figures to be published the following day by the CSO, showing that there were 946,000 children under the age of 16 years.</P>
      <P>The Minister now says there are 878,000. Are we sure we have the right figures? Surely, it is a cause of concern if only 1,000 children are not in receipt of benefit to which they are duly entitled. Has the Department carried out an exploratory or preliminary investigation as to why this occurs? Does the Minister feel that the allocation of a PPS number to every person will facilitate streamlining of the payment of moneys? We all acknowledge the importance of child benefit payments to families, particularly mothers.</P>
      <P>It has been put to me, particularly by people who are returning from England, that the application form is extremely awkward. It does not appear to be &ldquo;consumer friendly&rdquo; for want of a better term. The point was made to me by a person who is involved in a great deal of correspondence and dealings with the Minister's Department. The questions are somewhat vague and difficult for persons returning from outside the jurisdiction. How much is the State saving by not paying money which belongs rightfully to the 1,500 children in question on a per annum basis and over each child's life? Will the Minister take steps to ascertain why applications for child benefit have not been made in what she says are 1,440 cases, while the newspaper says there are 51,000 cases? The discrepancy in the figures should also be clarified by newspaper in a report which I hope will be given equal prominence to the original article. Is the Minister satisfied that the application forms and the method of application for young parents in particular is consumer friendly and facilitates an application for payment to which they are rightfully entitled?</P>

      <P>I am satisfied with the Department's figures. The discrepancy was a result of the methodology applied by the journalist in using the information provided. That was clarified on 20 June in the newspaper in a letter to the editor.</P>

      <P>With the new system being set up through the &ldquo;Grow&rdquo; project it will not be necessary to make an application for the children who are born.

It is something we are looking at. We will review the methodology.</P>
      <P>We take the opportunity to regularly evaluate the application forms. I set up a new initiative within the Department this year to address the fact that the high level of literacy problems makes some of the Department's forms difficult and complicated. We have a project operating this year to simplify the English used to make the forms more customer friendly. All the forms and information booklets of the Department are being examined in this light. Hopefully, this project will address the Deputy's concerns.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan" hpid="Mary Coughlan Mary Coughlan">
      <NameTxt>Mary Coughlan</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Deputy for this nice, hard question. The social insurance system, by linking the payment of social insurance contributions to individual entitlement for short-term and long-term benefits, guarantees basic pensions in retirement, invalidity and widowhood, as well as providing a range of payments during working life. The concept of weeks of insurable employment plays a key role in the operation of the PRSI system. An employer and employee must make their respective PRSI contributions in respect of any week of insurable employment where the employment itself meets the definition of insurable employment and the weekly earnings are in excess of &euro;38. In return, the employee is entitled to a PRSI contribution for any contribution week or part thereof that he or she is rostered to work and-or payment is due in respect of that work, regardless of when payment is made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1051" />A contribution week is defined as each successive period of seven days starting on 1 January each year. Work sharing arrangements are agreed between an employer and an employee and examples can include a four day week, a three day week, a week on, week off, mornings only etc. In many cases, the attendance pattern will overlap with the pattern of contribution weeks and work sharers will receive contributions in respect of 52 weeks, as is the case with full-time workers provided their weekly earnings exceed &euro;38. My Department recently published an information booklet which specifically deals with the issue of the interaction of the pattern of weeks of insurable employment and attendance patterns.</P>
    <P>It is recognised that there may be work sharing patterns where, in some years, the employee may be awarded only 26 weeks contributions or 39 weeks contributions. The attendance patterns and the years when this might occur are identified in the booklet. The type of work sharing involved may affect the amount of PRSI the employer and the employee pay and may also affect the number of PRSI contributions the employee is awarded. The exact effect depends on the attendance pattern worked and the level of earnings in any given week. Employees are not obliged to change their attendance patterns in these circumstances, although they may do so if they wish to increase the number of contributions they are awarded in that year to 52 contributions.</P>
    <P>A change in the present PRSI contribution arrangements based on weeks of insurable employment would have major implications and could adversely affect the position of certain categories of employees. As the Deputy will appreciate, central to this issue from the perspective of the employee is whether a smaller number of contributions would affect entitlement to benefit at some future date. For longer-term benefits, such as old age contributory and retirement benefits, it is most unlikely that entitlement would be adversely affected by the work attendance pattern given that it is the person's contributions over their entire working life that determine entitlement to benefit.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Additional Information</i>Qualification for long-term benefits requires that employees have a minimum number of paid contributions to qualify as well as reaching a yearly average of paid and credited contributions over an extended period.</P>
    <P>In the case of short-term benefits, the contribution conditions for short-term benefits such as unemployment and disability benefit were changed recently. In such cases, the condition whereby 26 paid weeks in the governing qualification tax year and 26 contributions paid in the prior tax year will mean that the employee who has been awarded only 26 contributions in a year is fully covered for short-term social welfare benefits.</P>

The system should change to assist them. I urge the Minister to make this a priority issue to enhance and develop equality in our society.

      <NameTxt>Mary Coughlan</NameTxt>
      <P>I will forward the information booklet to the Deputy. No more than the Deputy, I have had to brief myself on the matter. It comes down to the differential between one's calendar week and the contribution week. If the calendar week begins on 1 January on a Wednesday, the contribution week will be the following Wednesday. A person who works on Monday and Friday or Monday and Tuesday, will find themselves in a vacuum with only 26 weeks of contributions. They will have to change their work practices. A complex methodology is involved, but it does not affect people's long-term benefits while the short-term benefits require 26 weeks' contributions. In the main people will not be affected.</P>
      <P>Following submission of the Deputy's question, I analysed whether it would be appropriate to change the methodology, but discovered that the consequences for other schemes would be hugely negative. Over the years, we have examined and changed the number of contributions needed in a certain period to benefit from schemes. Reviews of the changes are ongoing. I agree that work sharing is very important and beneficial to the employee who may wish to get out of the house to do a few hours work. In the main, the employee is not expected to change and 26 weeks of contributions constitutes the usual baseline for short-term benefits. The long-term benefits are not affected. There are some who might get caught in the loop which is why we advise them of the methodology of the calculation. In consultation with their employer, they may have to change their work practices in order not to lose out on benefits. The additional information in the Official Report will explain the matter even more fully. I will forward a copy of the booklet to the Deputy when it is available.</P>

      <P>In framing proposals to change elements of the BTEA scheme I was conscious of the need to ensure that payments were focused on those who most need training or qualifications in order to gain a foothold in the labour market. As a result of changes introduced this year, payments under the back to education allowance scheme for the summer period have been discontinued for BTEA participants who were previously in receipt of an unemployment payment. Many students find seasonal work at home or abroad during the summer months. Participants in the scheme who fail to find employment during the summer may be entitled to unemployment assistance or benefit, subject to satisfying the usual qualifying conditions.</P>
      <P>With regard to the number of BTEA participants who have left the scheme, it is not possible to distinguish between persons who have completed their courses and those who intend to resume in the autumn. Some 4,700 participants have concluded this year's programme so far. The most recent statistics show that 2,075 former BTEA participants have claimed for unemployment payments since May 2003. A total of 1,951 of these claims have been awarded. It was estimated that gross savings of &euro;12.5 million would accrue from discontinuation of the BTEA during the summer period if there were no unemployment claims from those affected. Actual net savings will be less in that some of the people concerned qualify for unemployment assistance or unemployment benefit and a definitive savings figure will not be available until the summer period is over.</P>
      <P>The scheme was also revised in respect of people who wish to pursue certain full-time postgraduate courses. These now no longer qualify for BTEA purposes. All the people concerned are already in possession of a third level qualification. They have already achieved a good level of academic attainment which should impact positively on their employment prospects. In a time of financial constraint, I am anxious to ensure that supports are directed at those with the most pressing needs. Those wishing to take up a higher diploma in all disciplines or a graduate diploma in primary school teaching are not affected by these changes. It was anticipated that savings of up to &euro;1 million would arise from this change in the scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Details of BTEA participants who have had their allowance discontinued since May 2003 are set out in the following tabular statement on a county by county basis. These figures include persons who have completed their courses and will not resume studies in the autumn as well as those who have had their back to education allowance <Col N="1054" />discontinued for the summer period only. The fundamental aim of the back to education allowance scheme is to assist people who are unable to get work because of a lack of qualifications. I am satisfied that this scheme continues to fulfil this important role.</P>

      <P>The Department has already entered into an agreement with people in the existing scheme. When changing the rules this year, why did the Minister not change them so that they applied to people who are starting in the scheme from September this year rather than have them apply to the people who have previously entered into this contract? Does she accept that the Department entered into a contract with these people? They were told when starting the back to education scheme that they would be paid the allowance until their education was finished.</P>
      <P>Given the changes in the back to education scheme, the back to work scheme and the summer jobs scheme, does the Minister not accept that she is trying to save money on the backs of the most vulnerable in society? These people are trying to get back into the education system and to better themselves so they will not in future have to depend on social welfare. Is it not wrong, after entering into an agreement with these people, to break that agreement? If a person took this matter to the courts, he or she would win the case. I have been advised that this might happen. People are upset that the Department has broken the agreement it made. If the Department entered into an agreement with a social welfare recipient and the latter broke the agreement, the Department would be quick to pursue him or her.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is wrong to break this agreement. The Minister is only saving &euro;12 million. Those savings could be made elsewhere. A sum of &euro;19,000 could <Col N="1055" />have been saved last weekend, as we mentioned earlier.</P>

      <P>An independent review was carried out on all Departments and a number of recommendations were made. One of them related to the BTEA. I had to make some difficult and unpalatable decisions. However, on the basis of the fact that the people in receipt of the BTEA will have an income support in the summer months, I was satisfied that this decision could be taken.</P>
      <P>This is not a means tested scheme so the participants were working as well as receiving their allowance. That is a difficult situation to sustain at a time of economic constraints. I had to create a situation where people would have an income support and I have done that. People work and they can travel abroad. I have agreed that if some people have to do a certain type of work as part of their study course and if that is confirmed by the relevant college, they will continue to receive the allowance on the basis that they are continuing their studies. I was not in a position to change the scheme in any other way.</P>
      <P>The summer jobs scheme is not my responsibility but that of my colleague, Deputy Ó Cuív. It will be based, I assume, on the same criteria of access to work.</P>

      <askee>Minister for Social and Family Affairs</askee>
      <Quest>if all Government policies are poverty proofed; if the submission of CORI on the forthcoming national action plan for social inclusion has been drawn to her attention; her views on its claim that poverty is not taken into account by the Government in the policy formation process; and if she will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan" hpid="Mary Coughlan Mary Coughlan">
      <NameTxt>Mary Coughlan</NameTxt>
      <P>Since 1998, all memoranda for Government and key policy initiatives, upon which significant policy decisions have to be made, are required to be poverty proofed. The primary aim of the poverty proofing process is to identify the impact of policy proposals on people experiencing poverty so that this can be given proper consideration in designing the policy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The office for social inclusion in my Department has been mandated to develop a more effective poverty proofing process. In doing so it must ensure, particularly in light of the findings and recommendations in the review of this process published by the National Economic and Social <Col N="1056" />Council or NESC, that it is appropriately operational in all Departments. Work on this key area is now under way. The Office for Social Inclusion is also currently engaged in co-ordinating the preparation of Ireland's National Action Plan against Poverty and Social Exclusion, 2003-2005. All member states of the European Union are required to submit their national action plans to the EU Commission by 31 July 2003, which will contain their strategies to meet clear objectives agreed at EU level designed to combat poverty and social exclusion and the specific resources to give effect to these strategies.</P>
    <P>The preparation of the plan for the period 2003-05 is now well advanced and has involved an extensive process of consultation, organised in conjunction with the Combat Poverty Agency. This consultation process has included four regional and three national seminars as well as a public invitation for written submissions. The submission from CORI is one of almost 70 submissions received in response to that invitation and sets out its views on what should be contained in the national action plan. All the submissions received, together with the outcomes of the wider public consultation, will be taken into account in the context of the ongoing preparation of the national action plan and its implementation.</P>
    <P>I do not agree with the CORI view that poverty issues are not taken into account in policy formulation. The emphasis placed by Government on employment as a route out of poverty has been very successful with significant and sustained reductions in unemployment and increases in employment. The marked reduction in the levels of consistent poverty in recent years is largely attributable to this approach. However, side by side with that strategic approach, the Government has also invested heavily in increasing the levels of income support and services to those who are not in the active labour force, with record levels of investment in welfare payments and in child benefit payments.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Additional Information</i>The increases provided for in the 2003 budget protect or enhance, in real terms, the standard of living of all social welfare recipients. It must be recalled that this budget was introduced at a time of great economic uncertainty and the scale of investment in the welfare area underlined the Government's commitment to protecting those at highest risk. I look forward to making progress on meeting the income adequacy targets contained in the NAPS, and now restated in Sustaining Progress, in the budgets over the period to 2007.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamPenrose" hpid="Mr. Penrose Mr. Penrose">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Penrose</NameTxt>
      <P>Why does the Minister think a reputable organisation such as the CORI Justice Commission would state that the Government's claim that poverty is taken into account in policy formulation is not supported by the empirical evidence? Is the Minister aware that the CORI Jus<Col N="1057" />tice Commission submission identified two areas which illustrate the Government's clear lack of commitment? Is it the case that about 60% of those living in poverty are in households headed by a person who is not in the labour force? Will the Minister concede that the Government in its recent budget failed miserably to honour a strong commitment it made to raise the lowest social welfare rates in that budget? Furthermore, the CORI Justice Commission says that because so many of these households are headed by people who are not in the labour force, the Government's strategy of focusing on creating jobs for those people must, by definition, be a failure.</P>
      <P>The Government fails to appreciate the changes in the distribution of poverty over the past decade and therefore it has tried old and trusted ways as opposed to the new concepts that are now becoming available. The Minister of State will not accept this but CORI put forward the idea that the Government failed those people who are on the lowest social welfare payments in 2003, on the basis that they are less well off in 2003 than they were in 2002, when inflation and rent increases and myriad related cost increases are taken into account in the shopping basket.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan" hpid="Mary Coughlan Mary Coughlan">
      <NameTxt>Mary Coughlan</NameTxt>
      <P>I assume that this came from an article in <i>The Irish Times </i>which was a response not necessarily to the NAPS income but to a launch, in which I participated, of a study on the relationship between poverty and inequality by the Combat Poverty Agency and the Equality Authority. That is based on a technical methodology of poverty proofing. I do not agree with CORI, particularly on a number of issues, for example, that poverty proofing has not worked because it is a new methodology. All other Departments are taking it on. My Department led this through the social inclusion unit and it is aware of this and keen to pursue it. Where an independent group comes from is its business, just as any Member of this House can have an independent view on anything.</P>
      <P>It is difficult to accept the particular issue that CORI raises because I agree that when one looks at how employment has had an effect in reducing poverty it is quite difficult to see that supporting unemployment schemes and so on is the wrong thing to do but it is not the only thing to do. That is why we are also looking at other types of income support, of steps to progress, moving into education, training and all of those issues, new family support services &ndash; two pilot projects have almost completed their work. There is significant intervention which is positive and working well in moving people on who would perhaps have been left and never supported. I do not agree with CORI although it does make relevant points which would always be taken into consideration.</P>

      <askee>Minister for Social and Family Affairs</askee>
      <Quest>if she will increase the rate of disability allowance to allow for the fact that people with disabilities may have higher costs of living due to their disability.</Quest>

    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan" hpid="Mary Coughlan Mary Coughlan">
      <NameTxt>Mary Coughlan</NameTxt>
      <P>People with disabilities represent a diverse group with differing needs. For example, disability can have different consequences for individuals depending on the nature of the disability, the person's age, social circumstances, etc. The approach suggested by the Deputy does not recognise the fact that the additional costs associated with disability are not incurred to the same degree by all people with disabilities and I do not consider that increasing the level of income maintenance payments, such as disability allowance, is necessarily the most appropriate method of addressing the additional costs of disability.</P>
      <P>Additional costs associated with disability can arise whether or not a person is in employment or claiming a social welfare payment. Indeed, these costs can be greater where the person is working. If support towards the additional costs of disability were to be incorporated into payments such as the disability allowance, then this support would be withdrawn on taking up employment, thereby creating a significant disincentive to move from welfare dependency into work. For these reasons, the costs of disability might best be met in ways that are less dependent on the person's labour force status, if people with disabilities are to be given the opportunity to participate in the workforce. This approach is in line with the views of the Commission on the Status of People with Disabilities, which recommended that the additional costs of disability should be met separately to income maintenance needs.</P>
      <P>The complex issues involved in addressing how best to meet the additional costs of disability are currently being examined by a working group on the feasibility of a cost of disability payment, which comprises representatives of relevant Departments and agencies, including my own Department. The outcome of this group will be important in informing future policy in this area. The rate of disability allowance has been increased by &euro;6.00 to &euro;124.80 a week from the beginning of this year. Since 1997, social welfare payments have been increased substantially in real terms. For instance, during that period, the rate of disability allowance has increased by 45.6% compared with an increase of 26.6% in the cost of living, a real increase of 15%.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Following a review of the national anti-poverty strategy, the Government set a target of achieving by 2007 a rate of &euro;150 per week, in 2002 terms, for the lowest rates of social welfare payments. The achievement of this target, reiterated in Sus<Col N="1059" />taining Progress, will significantly increase the value of payments to persons on low incomes and at risk of poverty, including those on disability allowance.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeymourCrawford" hpid="Mr. Crawford Mr. Crawford">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crawford</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate the Minister's lengthy answer but it does not give much hope to those who are in poverty, such as people with disabilities. Is the Minister aware that somebody on disability allowance has to pay an increase for waste collection from &euro;153 last year to &euro;280 this year? That is an increase of &euro;2.5 per week. That person also has an increase in the TV licence fee and some other things if he or she has not been on unemployment assistance for long enough. He or she has to bear all the increases that others have to bear and received only &euro;6. For instance, somebody on disability allowance has to pay increased rent to the local authority or to a landlord if he or she is in a rented flat because of the Minister's change in the other rent allowance.</P>
      <P>I ask the Minister to consider this group as one that needs to be cared for. This is the European Year of People with Disabilities. Many high profile people have been out meeting those who have come here for the Special OIympics. Let us look after those who are in our care. I urge her to look again at that situation and make sure that those people get a realistic increase, &euro;6 was the lowest that anybody got this year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan" hpid="Mary Coughlan Mary Coughlan">
      <NameTxt>Mary Coughlan</NameTxt>
      <P>I was criticised on several occasions after the budget and during the debates for saying that any real increases would be on the basis of our inflation figures. I indicated that 5% was the parameter I was given and we are well within that, in fact below it.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mary Coughlan</NameTxt>
      <P>That being said I agree that there are additional costs attached to disability, and as the commission indicated, income maintenance was not necessarily everything that was needed. Other support networks are needed. In my own Department we look at the free schemes which have been very beneficial and supportive as well as other ancillary benefits that are available to people who suffer from a disability or who are disabled. My concern is that there would be an outcry. I agree that people with disability should be allowed to participate fully within the workforce in particular. It is a concept towards which we all must strive. Therefore, I have concerns about changing the methodology whereby we support people. The working group is looking at and evaluating the adequacies of the scheme, what new schemes perhaps are needed and what can be added. That will be completed soon and I look forward to the debate on that because it will be important.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Boyle</NameTxt>
      <P>Given that unemployment within disability groups is running at 80%, far above the national average, the Minister's answer that to increase payments might be a welfare trap for people with disability is not addressing the real problem. Institutional barriers prevent people with disability from getting work. In this European Year of People with Disabilities the Government has yet to produce an initiative that would improve the quality of life of people with disability. There is an opportunity now to build on the goodwill and success of the Special Olympics. That would win support from many people in the House if it were to produce such an initiative. If that helps in getting any resources from the Minister's colleagues at the Cabinet table people on this side of the House will be prepared to shout quite loudly about it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan" hpid="Mary Coughlan Mary Coughlan">
      <NameTxt>Mary Coughlan</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank my colleagues for their tremendous support. I look forward to it. There have been recent changes in the payments made available to people with disabilities. For a long time we had a difficulty as the Deputy probably is aware. When people on a disability allowance went into an institution they lost their income support. We changed that and it was very important because it allowed people to have access to their own finance. People in part-time residential care are also getting their full-term disability allowances since 2000. The spending allowances and the standardisation of many of these allowances have now come to my Department and have been taken from the Department of Health and Children so income support for people with disabilities is now wholly within my remit which is progressive. Despite the economic difficulties, none of my schemes in which a person with a disability was entitled to participate was touched. All the measures for people with disabilities were ring-fenced and accordingly no scheme in my Department has changed in any way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As the Members are saying, it is very important that people with disabilities make progress. There are several great initiatives in existence of which we are not as aware as we should be, for example, working with county enterprise boards to set up soft loans for people with disabilities and providing certain types of initiatives whereby we also work with credit unions in supporting people with disabilities to get into work, buy machines and <Col N="1061" />so on that are very important to them. All those initiatives are in place, but perhaps they are not shouted about loudly enough. They have made a real impact.</P>

      <askee>Minister for Social and Family Affairs</askee>
      <Quest>the total number of persons who received benefit under the back to school clothing and footwear allowance scheme; her plans to improve this scheme; and if she will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan" hpid="Mary Coughlan Mary Coughlan">
      <NameTxt>Mary Coughlan</NameTxt>
      <P>The back to school clothing and footwear allowance scheme was introduced in 1990. The scheme was designed to provide assistance towards the cost of school clothing and footwear for children attending primary and post-primary schools. It replaced the former public assistance footwear scheme, which was introduced in 1944, as well as taking over supplementary welfare allowance exceptional needs payments made in respect of school clothing. The scheme operates from the beginning of June to the end of September each year and is administered on behalf of my Department by the health boards.</P>
      <P>The scheme is advertised by health boards locally. The level and type of advertising varies from board to board but includes advertisements in the local press and posters in health centres and general medical scheme surgeries. Some boards issue application forms to those who received the allowance in previous years. Forms are available on health board Internet sites. An updated information booklet has been made available to citizens' information centres and local offices of the Department. In addition, I will be issuing a press release shortly to remind parents to apply for the allowance. A person may qualify for a back to school clothing and footwear allowance if he or she is in receipt of a social welfare or health board payment, is participating in an approved employment scheme or attending a recognised education and training course and has a household income at or below certain set levels.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under the scheme an allowance of &euro;80 is payable in respect of qualifying children aged between two and 11, and an allowance of &euro;150 is payable in respect of those aged between 12 and 22. Recipients of the allowance are now better able to meet the cost of school clothing and footwear than was the case in 1990, when the scheme <Col N="1062" />was introduced. The value of the allowance in real terms has improved considerably since the inception of the scheme.</P>
    <P>According to the consumer price index, in the period 1990-2002 the cost of clothing and footwear fell by 23%. In the same period, payment rates for the scheme increased by 137% in the case of children aged over 12 and by 152% in the case of those under 12. The &euro;150 rate payable this year represents an increase of 194% over the corresponding 1990 rate. In 2002, 71,759 applications were approved under the scheme, which benefited 155,800 children at a cost of &euro;15.2 million. This year it is expected that the scheme will cost &euro;16.8 million and that a similar number of children will benefit.</P>
    <P>As part of its expenditure review programme, my Department established a working group to undertake a review of the back to school clothing and footwear allowance scheme. The working group is undertaking a fundamental examination of all aspects of the scheme, including the rate of payment as well as the income limits, the means test, the timing of payments, eligibility criteria and other issues. I will consider changes to the scheme in light of the recommendations of the working group.</P>

      <P>There are strict criteria for income limits, which I can forward to the Deputy, and in no way should any officer working on my behalf fail to take those into consideration. I would be concerned if that were the situation, as they are outlined by the Department, and the CWOs are expected to deal with people accordingly. If the Deputy has specific concerns, I am most anxious to hear of them. The limits were increased last year to take into consideration the increases in social welfare benefits and social welfare assistance schemes. For example, for a couple with one child, the limit is &euro;331.40, and for a lone parent with one child, &euro;227.40. For up to four children the limit is &euro;389.30 and for a lone parent with a third child the limit is &euro;270.60. It is increased by &euro;19.30 for each child, and then by &euro;21.60.</P>

      <P>Given the importance of early payment to enable parents to acquire the footwear and clothing, is the Minister aware that this year's scheme will be a shambles since it will not operate on time? Does she know that in the Northern Area Health Board, the applications are to a certain extent processed by the community welfare officers, then sent on to a control unit? This year there is an embargo in that section and no control unit is in operation. The application forms are currently in the various offices and are not being processed on time. On that basis, what is she prepared to do to ensure that the parents get the grants on time and that the scheme does not end up as an utter shambles?</P>

    <Speaker pid="DanBoyle" hpid="Mr. Boyle Mr. Boyle">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boyle</NameTxt>
      <P>I suggest to the Minister that, to help the operation of the scheme, community welfare officers might liaise better with home-school liaison officers in schools, particularly those in disadvantaged areas. Very often the knowledge of the family situation helps in making payments quicker and making more effective use of resources.</P>

      <P>I will contact the chief executive of the Northern Area Health Board. We have the money for the scheme and want to make the payments fairly quickly, since people like to buy their footwear and clothing in July and August, especially the latter month when the sales are on. I will certainly address that matter immediately, and if something has to be done, we will deal with it.</P>
      <P>I could examine liaising with the home-school liaison officer. I get criticised on the other side of the House if I send out too much information or spend too much. However, we could examine a mail-shot to the schools or something of that sort. There is a fair amount of information available, and in the main people know about the scheme, just like the Deputies. Perhaps we could consider how we get the information out to people in time for next year's scheme. It is advertised locally by the boards.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mary Coughlan</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 8 and 44 together.</P>
      <P>My Department makes in excess of 54 million payment transactions per year on a range of payment schemes. In addition to payment at post offices, payment can be made by cheque or electronic fund transfer directly to a customer's bank or building society account. Currently, some 850,000 customers on longer term schemes have elected to be paid at post offices by means of a book of orders which are encashable each week at a post office designated by the customer.</P>
      <P>A further 140,000 customers, mainly those on unemployment schemes, are also paid at post offices by means of an electronic or manual Postdraft which is issued to the customer's designated post office each week. Approximately 180,000 customers across all scheme types are paid by cheque through the post to their home address. Some 400,000 customers are paid by electronic fund transfer directly into their bank or building society account.</P>
      <P>My Department has developed a wide range of contingency plans which, depending on the circumstances involved, can be put in place in the event of normal payment services being disrupted. In addition to these arrangements, An Post, under the terms of my Department's contract with it, has responsibility for providing contingency arrangements in the event of disruption to payment services at post offices.</P>
      <P>The recent dispute referred to by the Deputy originated as a one day unofficial industrial action on Friday, 13 June and affected payment services for my Department's customers at a small number of post offices in County Cork. Arrangements were made by An Post for these customers to receive their payment at another post office in the locality on that day. On Monday, 16 June, the dispute escalated to a number of other post offices throughout the country affecting payment services for 2,500 social welfare customers. The escalation was for one day and arrangements were made for the customers involved to collect their payment at the offices concerned when they reopened the following day.</P>
      <P>An Post plays a fundamental role in the delivery of social welfare payments on an ongoing basis and I look forward to its continued commitment to providing these services in the future.</P>
      <P>I acknowledge the long standing willingness of An Post management, unions and staff to ensure that the impact of disputes on social welfare customers is minimised.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanRyan" hpid="Mr. S. Ryan Mr. S. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pleased the dispute has been resolved and that there was not too much difficulty in respect of the payments. In the context of An Post and the service it provides, I ask the Minister &ndash; and this will have to get through to the management and the unions &ndash; to ensure <Col N="1065" />there is no disruption of services and that agreements entered into are worked out without the necessity for industrial disputes. Why is it that an agreement entered into in this case was not adhered to by management? Is the Minister aware of a specific commitment for feedback from management to union representatives as developments took place? Will she give an assurance that her Department will learn from the mistakes of the past, that full consultation will take place in future and that a proper mechanism will be put in place before action is taken on a unilateral basis?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan" hpid="Mary Coughlan Mary Coughlan">
      <NameTxt>Mary Coughlan</NameTxt>
      <P>First, I was not involved with the specific issue of why the dispute took place and, second, it was an unofficial dispute and, therefore, the unions were not involved. Had the unions been involved, additional contingency plans would have been available. In the main, I am happy that everyone who was entitled to a payment received it. That was facilitated. My Department has a contract with An Post which is very specific about facilitating customers with their payments. Unfortunately, it was one of these lightening strikes of which we were advised in the morning just as the cheques should have been paid out, but customers were facilitated and paid. My Department has many contingency plans which would enable a switch from one payment to another to be done very quickly through the computer system in the event of an escalation of any dispute. While the contingency plans are available, it would be difficult to change them within 30 seconds of the opening of a post office. Although the action was unofficial, we always learn from such disputes. Management facilitated the members of my staff in all the local offices when it came to payments for customers and no one was left without their formal payments.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Boyle</NameTxt>
      <P>As a rebel county TD, many of those affected by the first lightning strike were in my constituency. While I am somewhat reassured by what the Minister has said about contingency plans, both medium and long-term, she will appreciate there was a lack of information to react immediately as a result of which payments were delayed and people missed deadlines in respect of outgoing payments. I ask that the existing contingency plans be reshaped to provide an immediate response because people cannot be left in the situation that recurred. While I appreciate it was outside of the Minister's control and that of her Department, there must be a direct response as the situation develops rather than putting in place contingency plans that take effect a day or two after the event.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan" hpid="Mary Coughlan Mary Coughlan">
      <NameTxt>Mary Coughlan</NameTxt>
      <P>I regret that the Deputy's constituents were inconvenienced. In regard to the dispute we were not informed on time and, therefore, could not put more contingency plans in place. We shall certainly evaluate the outcome of what happened. Departmental officials were very <Col N="1066" />efficient in ensuring the contingency plans were put in place as quickly as possible. Naturally, we had to be facilitated by post mistresses and post masters in other areas. It is difficult to deal with a lightening strike but, hopefully, people have not been too badly inconvenienced with regard to their payments. Some were paid that day in another post office or the next day in their local post office.</P>

      <Quest>the number of licensed operators who took part in her Department's free travel scheme since 1999; her plans to improve the scheme in view of the number of licences which has issued; and if she will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>
      <QRef>[18073/03]</QRef>
    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan" hpid="Mary Coughlan Mary Coughlan">
      <NameTxt>Mary Coughlan</NameTxt>
      <P>The free travel scheme was introduced in 1967. The scheme is intended to assist older people and people with disabilities to remain independent and active in the community. The scheme also facilitates mobility for those without access to cars, and the greater use of public transport infrastructure, particularly during off-peak times.</P>
      <P>From its inception, the scheme applied to the services operated by the CIE Group. The services covered have been extended progressively in recent years and there are now 82 private operators participating in the scheme in addition to the CIE Group services. Most of these private contractors provide services in rural areas. Some 27 of these operators have joined the scheme since January 1999. I am keen to ensure that free travel pass-holders have access to as wide a range of public transport services as possible. My Department is willing to consider applications from any licensed operators who wish to provide passenger services to free travel pass-holders. Participation in the scheme is open to all transport operators licensed to operate a public scheduled service, who are properly insured and hold a current tax clearance certificate.</P>
      <P>To address the needs of those marginalised by lack of access to transport in rural areas, 34 community groups have been selected under the Government's rural transport initiative to receive funding to provide innovative community-based transport services, on a pilot basis.</P>
      <P>This initiative is being managed by Area Development Management Limited on behalf of the Department of Transport and funding has been provided for this purpose through the national development plan.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As free travel pass holders will benefit from this initiative, I have arranged for up to &euro;500,000 to be made available from my Department this year to help to ensure that they have full access to these pilot community-based transport services. I also intend that free travel pass-holders will be facilitated on Luas services when these com<Col N="1067" />mence. My Department has had initial contact with the Rail Procurement Agency in this regard.</P>
    <P>Significant improvements have been made in the free schemes, including the free travel scheme, in recent budgets both in terms of the qualifying conditions and the coverage of the schemes. I will continue to review the operation of these schemes with a view to identifying the scope for further improvements as resources permit.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Crawford</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware that the Minister, coming from Donegal, is aware of the problems in rural Ireland. Has she any plans to introduce a voucher system or some other system to enable those in isolated areas to obtain transport? A lady in a small town in my constituency who has to go for hospital treatment has learned that the health board will no longer pay her taxi fares. She has missed many medical appointments. Cases such as this are serious. Has the Minister any plans to introduce a system to deal with genuine hardship cases in isolated areas?</P>
      <P>What is the success rate or otherwise of the pilot scheme and does the Minister expect it to become widespread in the future? My final question, which is one the Ceann Comhairle raised many years ago, concerns the use of school transport buses &ndash; a major State asset &ndash; which are lying idle for long periods each day while schools are closed. This seems to be a waste of national assets which could be used for some of these other purposes.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan" hpid="Mary Coughlan Mary Coughlan">
      <NameTxt>Mary Coughlan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not accountable for nor am I involved in the management of the bus services. It is an issue I am not quite familiar with but it has been discussed on many occasions. Other Departments and agencies should support the people to whom the Deputy refers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeymourCrawford" hpid="Mr. Crawford Mr. Crawford">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crawford</NameTxt>
      <P>They do not do so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan" hpid="Mary Coughlan Mary Coughlan">
      <NameTxt>Mary Coughlan</NameTxt>
      <P>From what I can ascertain in my short period in office, if other people do not do what they should it lands back on me. In my health board area we have a service every day to all the major Dublin hospitals from Letterkenny and Sligo. People in need who cannot afford a taxi to get to where they have to go are facilitated and the health board has a fund for reimbursements.</P>
      <P>The cost of the free travel scheme is &euro;47 million. We have considerably increased the access of licensed operators to the scheme. That has been beneficial, otherwise we would not have had a service of any type. I agree that many people do not get an opportunity to use the service because they may not have access to the mainline rail or bus services.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The rural transport initiative has been successful. When it is evaluated there will be a recommendation to increase it all over the country. It <Col N="1068" />has been helpful and because it is community based people have taken possession of it and communities have been facilitated with the usage of the free travel pass. I will consult with the Minister for Transport when he evaluates the programme over the next two to three years. My experience of the three schemes we have in Donegal is that they are successful because the timetables reflect the needs of the people as opposed to the needs of the transport company.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanRyan" hpid="Mr. S. Ryan Mr. S. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister accept that the free travel pass is completely useless to many people in rural areas? Would she be prepared to look at the possibility of using taxis or a hackney service in regard to provision of a service? In the greater Dublin area there are major restrictions on the use of the pass which particularly affect older people who need to get to hospitals before 10 a.m. At present there are restrictions on the use of the pass up until 10 a.m. Will the Minister examine that situation with a view to resolving it? It is a major issue for many elderly people.</P>

      <P>I wish to add to what Deputy Seán Ryan has said. What measures does the Minister intend to put in place to ensure that the service for those with free travel passes is universal? Unfortunately, Bus Éireann does not provide a universal service as the Minister knows from her own constituency where the alternative Lough Swilly service is in difficulty. Pilot schemes are not in operation throughout the country. There are huge swathes of areas where a service does not exist.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Boyle</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister often needs to be led. What measures does the Department intend to put in place to make sure we have a universal application in terms of the free travel pass? At present, the value of the travel pass to one person in the country is far less than the value to someone else. The Government has a responsibility to ensure there is equal value for all.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan" hpid="Mary Coughlan Mary Coughlan">
      <NameTxt>Mary Coughlan</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate what the Deputy has said. Deputy Seán Ryan will be pleased to hear that one of my working groups from Trinity College completed its report and recommended a number of changes. One thing the group was asked to evaluate was the voucher system. It may be difficult to believe but it did not recommend the system because its usage could be abused and it is difficult to ascertain how it could be administered. I promised we would look at the system again. I will do so and will re-evaluate its usage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The free travel scheme has evolved since 1967. There have been significant changes, particularly in regard to eligibility with the introduction of companion passes and people with carer's allowance. In regard to restricted access to Dublin Bus <Col N="1069" />there is a situation whereby somebody with a specific illness, particularly a terminal one, can apply to the Department to have the restriction waived. There are quite strict criteria but the facility is there for those with serious illnesses. If the Deputy has a particular case in mind it would be facilitated between the hospital and my Department.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mary Coughlan</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 10 and 56 together.</P>
      <P>In applications for carer's allowance the basic qualifying conditions, apart from a means test, are that the person receiving care must be so incapacitated as to require full-time care and attention and the carer is providing that full-time care and attention. The carer is the applicant and, accordingly, is invariably the appellant against a decision disallowing payment.</P>
      <P>Appeals against the refusal of claims for carer's allowance normally require an oral hearing in order to determine the appeal. The carer, as the appellant, attends the hearing but it is not usual for the person being cared for to attend. In many instances the person who is being cared for is not in a position to attend the hearing. In any event, his or her absence should not mean that his or her situation cannot be adequately put forward at the hearing.</P>
      <P>In most instances an application for a carer's allowance will have been investigated by an inspector of the Department who will have given the general background to the application and afforded the applicant the opportunity to set out the basis for the claim. This is available to the appeals officer and will usually be gone through at the hearing. In addition, the medical evidence offered by both the caree's own doctor and the opinions of the Department's medical assessors are taken into consideration by the appeals officer. The case will usually revolve around aspects relating to the medical evidence and the facts relating to the extent and type of care provided. All of these matters are established by reference to the inspector's report, the carer's statements and evidence and the medical evidence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, many carees are by definition too elderly or frail to attend and for this reason they are rarely summoned. The presence of the caree <Col N="1070" />at the hearing is, therefore, not essential. However, in any instance where a carer wishes to have the caree present there is no difficulty about doing so.</P>
    <P>There is provision also for having the person who is being cared for examined by a medical assessor of the Department where this is likely to be helpful and where the caree's doctor has indicated that he or she would be able to attend such an examination. It is accepted that testimony by the care recipient could be helpful in certain cases. Indeed, in his annual report for 2001, the chief appeals officer alluded to the issue raised by the Deputies and stated that, in some cases, they would be able to provide valuable, first-hand testimony.</P>
    <P>Ultimately, the question of who should attend an oral hearing is one for the appeals officer but, in general, care recipients who do attend hearings with a view to testifying in support of the carer's appeal are readily facilitated.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeymourCrawford" hpid="Mr. Crawford Mr. Crawford">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crawford</NameTxt>
      <P>Although my name is attached to this question, it was put down by Deputy Ring and I do not know the full background to it. I understand that in the case in question the recipient was refused access to the appeal. He felt strongly that it would have been valuable to the appeal to have been there. I take it from the Minister's reply that there is no objection to that. If that is the case it is up to the person concerned with the appeal to accept the Minister's ruling. I accept the Minister's reply.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mary Coughlan</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 11, 20 and 49 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The back to education allowance scheme is a second chance education scheme designed to assist unemployed people and members of other disadvantaged groups who are being held back in their search for employment by a lack of qualifications. A review of the basic purpose underlying <Col N="1071" />my Department's back to education provisions was carried out last year.</P>
    <P>In the light of this and of the expenditure constraints facing us this year, the scheme has been revised. In framing proposals to change elements of the BTEA scheme, I was conscious of the need to ensure that payments were focused on those who most need training or qualifications in order to gain a foothold in the labour market. In line with this, payments under the scheme for the summer period have been discontinued for BTEA participants who were in receipt of an unemployment payment, as many students find seasonal work at home or abroad during the summer months.</P>
    <P>Of course, participants in the scheme who fail to find employment during the summer may be entitled to unemployment assistance or benefit, subject to satisfying the usual qualifying conditions. All other participants on the scheme, lone parents and people with disabilities, remain unaffected by this decision and will retain payment during the summer period.</P>
    <P>The BTEA scheme was also revised in respect of people who wish to pursue certain full-time postgraduate courses, which no longer qualify for BTEA purposes. All of the people concerned are already in possession of a third level qualification and I am satisfied that they have already achieved a good level of academic attainment which should impact positively on their employment prospects.</P>
    <P>In a time of financial constraint, I want to ensure that supports are directed at those with the most pressing needs. Those wishing to take up a higher diploma in all disciplines or graduate diploma in primary school teaching will not be affected by these changes. I am satisfied that the new arrangements will ensure that the back to education scheme continues to provide support to those people who are most distant from the labour market and I have no plans to alter these arrangements.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanBoyle" hpid="Mr. Boyle Mr. Boyle">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boyle</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister reconsider her changes to the back to education allowance scheme in regard to non-payment over the summer months? She has failed to take into account that many people are on modular courses, for which exams take place during the summer months, in August in particular. Some people have to repeat exams in July and August, a fact which should be considered.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Requiring people who are not lone parents or do not have a disability to go on unemployment benefit, if it applies, causes further complications for people. Asking them to go back into the labour market causes stresses in family life since, in many cases, such people are taking part in the back to education scheme in order to achieve a certain status and improve the lot of their families. I ask the Minister to consider that postgraduate courses may often be two years in duration. She should not make hard and fast decisions, such as those which have left many people in limbo <Col N="1072" />in regard to their back to education entitlements. They entered into what they thought was a contract with the Department, which does not seem to have been honoured.</P>

      <P>Is the Minister aware that many of the current BTEA recipients entered the scheme and were told they would be entitled to one postgraduate degree under its terms and conditions? They entered into it on the basis of being able to afford to do so. Will she examine this situation again in the context of people who wish to go on to take up a master's degree? Does she accept that further restrictions on the scheme could put people's potential at risk?  </P>

People were advised in October but, unfortunately, they did not seem to bother to look at the website or familiarise themselves with the issues.</P>
      <P>The scheme has been beneficial. It causes me some concern that people with a primary degree, who wanted to continue with a PhD or a master's degree, have found themselves employment before progressing to the next part of their education. We have done a great deal and the scheme has been beneficial. It has moved people into education, which has been important. Obtaining a third level qualification should adequately address the concern of allowing people to enter the workforce. People have achieved a great deal by participating in the scheme and have been successful. However, I am not in a position to change or reverse the scheme in any other way.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TommyBroughan" hpid="Mr. Broughan Mr. Broughan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Broughan</NameTxt>
      <P>I have already referred to the lethargic and tardy introduction of this legislation which is, unfortunately, typical of the Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment and the Government.</P>
      <P>The Labour Party will table a number of amendments on Committee Stage on various aspects of this Bill when my colleague, Deputy Howlin, will have an opportunity to contribute to the debate. In regard to contracts of employment as referred to in the definitions section of the Bill, it was our understanding that the Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Michael Ahern, gave commitments in the Seanad on the direct employees of agencies. Having listened to the contribution of the Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Fahey, I do not know whether this is an area which our officials and the Minister can make a bit more favourable, particularly in regard to agency workers, about whom I spoke at length during my previous contribution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In regard to the definition of &ldquo;employer&rdquo; in the Bill, the Minister of State, Deputy Michael Ahern, indicated that he might be prepared to expand on that definition and on the definition of &ldquo;fixed-term employee&rdquo;, in order to give a more favourable role to fixed-term workers. The Labour Party has concerns about the section on fixed-term employees, particularly an employee with a contract of employment &ldquo;which has been concluded within the framework of a specific public or publicly-supported training integration or <Col N="1074" />vocational training programme&rdquo;. What will be the impact of that on employees who came through such programmes into permanent employment? I would be grateful if the officials would tease that issue out further and respond to the Labour Party's amendment, which will be tabled on Committee Stage. I warmly welcome the extension of &ldquo;remuneration&rdquo; to include pension schemes or arrangements. It is an important innovation.</P>
    <P>We also have some concerns about section 3, regarding the regulation in orders and we will also table an amendment in that regard. One of our major concerns in section 7, is in regard to the &ldquo;objective grounds&rdquo; whereby an employee would be given another fixed-term contract, rather than a contract of permanent work. A sufficiently clear definition does not seem to be provided. I referred earlier to employees on public sector short-term contracts and one can think of examples in the private sector, such as the ICT development for the millennium, where there is a definite objective reason for it. However, we still feel this is too vague and it is something to which the Minister will hopefully return.</P>
    <P>There does not appear to be a role for the rights commissioner in the first phase of enforcement in regard to an employee being informed in writing by the employer of the objective grounds justifying the renewal of the fixed-term contract. The Rights Commissioner should have a role in deciding and making an assessment of what these objective grounds would be. In Part 2, section nine is a key section which relates to successive fixed-term contracts. How can we prevent rogue employers making a mockery of this legislation in the future? This aspect was rightly criticised in the Seanad by my colleagues Senators McDowell, O'Toole and others on the difficulties that arise with allowing for the contract of a fixed-term employee to be renewed on one further occasion after the employee has completed three years of continuous employment. The Labour Party would strongly support an amendment which would provide that a full year's service would be deemed to be a contract which would be followed by permanency. On behalf of the Labour Party I welcome the Bill and I commend the Minister of State, Deputy Fahey, to the extent that the Bill is at last with us. I urge him to consider a number of important amendments which the party will table next week.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Eamon Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>With Deputy Murphy and Deputies from the other Opposition parties I welcome the provisions of this Bill. I particularly welcome the tone of such legislation from Europe from which we get so much of the progressive, <Col N="1075" />social and environmental legislation which is directing our society. The Green Party was associated in some recent referendums with those who were critical of some aspects of the European Union policy. I am happy to say the party supports the European Union institutions and the direction of the Union when it is setting out fundamental social rights which would be introduced more slowly if we were outside the EU.</P>
      <P>It is deeply regrettable that for all the espousal of European regulations by those in Government, we are passing this legislation at the last minute, when in effect the sheriff is knocking at the door and the European Court of Justice is taking prosecutions against the Irish State for its failure to implement the directive. It is regrettable that in my limited experience in the Dáil we invariably seem to be the last to implement the fundamental social environmental protections which directives from Europe are providing. We recently passed the Fisheries (Amendment) Bill 2002, yet were the last in Europe to apply the relevant EU directive. In the Bill before us today we are again slow in complying, but I welcome the fact that we are doing so.</P>
      <P>Deputy Broughan asked how we might keep tabs on rogue employers. With regard to fixed-term contracts, in my experience &ndash; and the Minister might back this up &ndash; it is the State itself which has been the greatest user of such contracts. We are all aware of individuals who seem to have been employed for years by the State on continuous fixed-term contracts. I know a number of teachers in such a situation. It becomes embarrassing after a number of years when one meets a person, asks how the job is going and if it is now full-time, and is told that yet another annual contract has been rolled out. It is remarkable that the State allowed its own institutions to develop this form of employment. The greatest changes to come as a result of the legislation before us will be in the State and the semi-State sectors. A sign of that is the welcome fact that with pension entitlements now being made allowable for such fixed-term workers, the bill to the State is some &euro;50 million annually. This is a remarkable figure and shows the remarkable extent of such fixed-term contracts in the State itself.</P>
      <P>While welcoming the Bill, the Green Party shares some of the concerns expressed earlier. In particular it is concerned about how we will move away from the policy of using fixed-term contracts. The Bill as currently drafted does not address this issue properly. It is hard to know exactly what the proposal is in this area. The Green Party supports a much tighter timeframe regarding the elimination of the multi-annual one year fixed term contracts. The provision in the Bill for three years of fixed contracts followed by only one more before full-time employment must be offered, is far too lax and is in a sense generous in allowing the current policy to continue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1076" />As a former employer, I know that when one employs people on a full-time basis, one is very cognisant that after one year, many legal issues kick in, in terms of the person's rights, and quite rightly, the protection of that employee's status. If we want to have equality between fixed-term contracts and full-time working, we must look first at the one year timeframe, and then look at ways of providing equal rights. Otherwise, if allowance is made for three consecutive one year contracts, there will still be a huge incentive for employers to continue using that system. That is not in the best interests of employees and does not sit with the general intent of the Bill. I encourage the Minister and his officials to take on the amendments tabled by, I believe, Irish Congress of Trade Unions representatives and certain Senators.</P>
    <P>The other main issue of contention arose in the Seanad debate and will probably arise again on Committee Stage. This is the issue of temporary workers and temporary agencies, and whether the legislation would apply to workers provided by such temporary agencies. The Minister says there is a separate directive on the way, and perhaps we should wait for that before legislation is approved.</P>
    <P>I am seriously concerned, however, that the ideology of this Government is one which, as Deputy Broughan said, would be involved in Europe in trying to water down or cut back on the protection we want to give to temporary workers. Unfortunately it is impossible to know which countries are being progressive on the issue and which are trying to hinder it, as it is a closed process. Reading the Minister's speech and its references to this matter, I fear that an Italian EU Presidency followed by an Irish one might well result in the matter being dragged out further and further, with the provisions watered down.</P>
    <P>Responding to Deputy Broughan's speech, the Minister of State, Deputy Fahey, said that what people want is flexibility, as if this great use of employment agencies proves that. What people want is proper maternity leave. They want the benefits system changed so that benefits are not lost at a very low pay threshold if one goes into part-time work, as happens currently. People want a strong telecommunications network provided to enable them to work from home. The flexibility people want is not the flexibility George Bush is looking for in the great globalised economy, where we are involved in a race to the bottom in terms of us as a State providing the most flexible, cheapest and best arrangements for employers. What we want is a family friendly set up in the true sense of providing Irish parents with the chance to work for a period with flexible arrangements. I fear that is not the exact intention of the Minister when he talks about flexibility. I welcome the chance to debate the Bill on Committee Stage and Report Stage when I hope the Minister will accept certain amendments to tighten up the issue, particularly in regard to the <Col N="1077" />number of consecutive fixed-time contracts a person can be given.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MartinFerrisSF" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the objectives of this Bill. It is only right that fixed-term workers be given equality with comparable permanent workers. We must first ask why it is only now that this Bill is being brought forward by the Government to implement the provisions of the EU Council directive 1999/70 EC 28 June 1999. The target date for the implementation of this directive was July 2001. The European Commission referred this State to the European Court of Justice for failure to implement the directives on time. This questions the sincerity of the Government given its failure to meet this stipulation, and one must question the reasons.</P>
      <P>There are legitimate reasons for employing people on fixed-term contracts for specific purposes. We must, however, recognise that there has been a high level of abuse in this area by employers who keep staff on a casual or temporary basis to avoid giving them the rights to which they would normally be entitled. This behaviour by employers is unacceptable and must be brought to an end. Measures to tackle this abuse and evasion by employers are long overdue.</P>
      <P>Even public sector employers are involved in this abuse. For example, many postal workers are employed on successive fixed-term employment contracts. I know of one person who has been employed in such a way for more than 18 years. This is scandalous. Many teachers and health board staff are also kept on this type of contract. During the general election, I met a teacher who was employed for 18 years on this type of contract and this militates against people in such positions in trying to secure mortgages or loans for their houses and so forth and discriminates against them. It is only right that this should be brought to an end.</P>
      <P>I am concerned that the provisions in the Bill will not have the intended effect and that section 10, which provides that an employer can only renew a fixed-term contract once after three years of continuous service, will not result in such employees being made permanent. I am concerned that this provision could result in certain employers laying people off to avoid the measure. Workers will be concerned unless the Minister of State can assure the House on this matter, and I urge him to do so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Neither my party nor I are gullible enough to believe that the Government has a real commitment to ensuring workers' rights. I intend to address a number of issues that expose its lack of commitment. One such issue that the Government has ignored is workplace accidents and deaths. Some 57 people died in work-related accidents last year, 21 on construction sites. Over the past ten years, 172 people have died on building sites. In the first four months of this year there have been eight fatal accidents on construction sites. Despite this, the coalition Government has <Col N="1078" />failed to act to protect the health and safety of workers, especially those in the construction sector. This is an indictment of the Government.</P>
    <P>This Administration has long promised tough new legislation and on-the-spot fines, yet nothing has been done. This legislation is not a priority for a Government that is closely connected to the building industry. Public protests by construction workers reflect a deep level of anger on their part and is because they have seen their colleagues die on unsafe sites. We in this House have recently witnessed a number of these protests by construction workers trying to obtain this basic right of safety in their workplaces.</P>
    <P>The Government, in the interests of employers, recently joined with Britain, Germany and Denmark in blocking an EU directive designed to improve rights for part-time and temporary workers by giving them the same pay and conditions as full-time workers. This is an indictment of the Government and questions its sincerity in proposing the Bill. The Government has put basic workers' rights on the bargaining table of social partnership. Workers are increasingly forced to bargain with employers on issues such as recognition of unions, compliance with labour regulations and the fulfilling of statutory redundancy rights which are all basic workplace rights.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State will be familiar with the position of oil rig workers. In recent years, to prevent unions organising on oil rigs, Irish men who wish to obtain work on oil rigs near Ireland have been forced to go to the North Sea or elsewhere first for work before they can obtain work on rigs in Ireland, and non-union ones at that. This is wrong. The Minister of State is well aware of this and I have met him about it before in the company of two oil rig workers from Galway.</P>
    <P>The Government has used the partnership process to create an obedient trade union leadership by making union leaders part of the establishment, therefore creating a gulf between union leadership and grassroots membership. It is unfortunate that there is such a compliant union leadership in place.</P>
    <P>The current agreement, Sustaining Progress, represents a poor deal for workers and the low paid. It offers nothing on the real issues facing workers, such as health, child care and education. There is no doubt that the Government, under the control of the Progressive Democrats, has used social partnership to silence dissent on social and economic matters in the face of broken promises, wide-ranging cutbacks in health, housing and education and the deterioration in the quality of life of working people. It serves to occupy the time of union representatives as the Government implements its anti-worker right-wing agenda. This is a Government for employers, landowners, big business and exploiters. Workers should not be fooled by the words of the Minister of State, Deputy Fahey, who has little credibility among ordinary working class people given his record on other issues.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1079" />I welcome the Bill although I have reservations about it. Will the Minister of State assure me regarding the possibility of workers being laid off to avoid the measures in section 10?</P>
    <Speaker pid="FinianMcGrath" hpid="Mr. F. McGrath Mr. F. McGrath">
      <NameTxt>Mr. F. McGrath</NameTxt>
      <P>Workers' rights are always important for me and it is essential in this debate to ensure that all staff are treated in a fair and just manner. The fact that we live in a high-tech economy does not mean that we should ever forget the tradition of great people like James Connolly or other great trade unionists who fought for the rights of workers. It is essential that we are constantly on our guard to ensure that low wages, discrimination and exploitation are things of the past. The Bill is a step in the right direction and I will support it, but we still have a long way to go to end low pay, poverty and social disadvantage.</P>
      <P>The Bill provides for the improvement of the quality of fixed-term work by ensuring the application of the principle of non-discrimination. It also provides for the removal of discrimination against fixed-term workers where such exists and establishes a framework to prevent abuse arising from the use of successive fixed-term employment contracts. I welcome section 4 which raises the fines of £50 and £10 provided in section 10(1) of the Employment Agency Act 1971 to &euro;2,000 and &euro;1,000, respectively. I welcome Part 3 on enforcement. Section 15 provides that a complaint by an employee or trade union of which the employee is a member, that the employer has contravened a provision of the Bill in respect of that employee may be presented to a rights commissioner. Section 17 gives some teeth to the Bill and some positive action in the interests of the employee.</P>
      <P>I have some concerns about section 18 which does not apply to a trainee nurse. I hope that this will not be used as an excuse to ignore the plight of young nurses, especially when we are in the middle of major changes to our health services. We should always remember that young nurses are the future of health care and are on the front line in providing services. We should always be on our guard to protect their rights. This is why I am concerned about section 18.</P>
      <P>I notice in the financial implications that the cost to the Exchequer will be about &euro;50 million per annum. However, I agree that the benefits that will accrue, especially regarding the promotion and encouragement of the process of change in work relationships which will benefit employers and employees, will outweigh the costs involved. People's rights and entitlements should never be eroded by costs and it is essential that we keep this in mind when debating this legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We must also face the reality that certain elements in society would like to see workers' rights eroded and the end of the trade union movement. Right wing elements will always want to suppress trade unionists and I put down a <Col N="1080" />marker in this debate that the trade union movement will never be beaten. Despite economic circumstances, it has a major part to play in society. If it ever goes out of business we will all lose. It is the future, the progressive force, and we should listen to it. When it comes to social justice and workers' rights, particularly for PAYE workers, trade unions will always pay a progressive role. I commend the thousands of active trade unionists in Ireland today and I intend to be their voice in this Dáil. Today members of the INTO, of which I am a member, visited Ministers about the conditions of schools and I welcome them to the Houses of the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>It is a disgrace that senior Ministers are not listening to sensible voices in the trade union movement. In the current debate with the Minister for Transport on the plan to build a private terminal at Dublin Airport, the break up of Aer Rianta and the ending of the bilateral agreement at Shannon Airport, the Minister's objectives are not supported by the findings of reputable reports, particularly those commissioned by the Government. The trade union movement, particularly the civil aviation branch of SIPTU at Dublin Airport, has been pointing this out for months, but no one is listening. The best independent economic advice is given to the Minister for Transport but he ignores it.</P>
    <P>This is a wake up call for everyone and I urge the Minister to heed the voice of the trade union movement in this debate. We will then see if we are really serious about the Protection of Employees (Fixed-Term Work) Bill 2003, which directly affects more than 70,000 workers. I commend it to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MarianHarkinIND" hpid="Ms Harkin Ms Harkin">
      <NameTxt>Ms Harkin</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pleased to have the opportunity to address the House on this important legislation. I welcome and support this Bill, an encouraging and progressive move to provide equal treatment for non-permanent workers.</P>
      <P>As we move from the jobs for life era and into a period of fixed-term contract arrangements, Government legislation should protect the workers concerned. It is essential that we put in place laws to ensure that workers are not deprived of their rights by the use of repeated roll-overs of fixed-term contracts.</P>
      <P>We have enjoyed an unprecedented ten years of growth in employment, including an estimated 70,000 fixed-term contract workers. Unfortunately, we now face a period of reduced growth where employment might be more difficult to find. This situation could encourage employers to take advantage of workers through offering reduced salaries and conditions that would run totally counter to the social partnership ethos which, up to now, has worked well for employers, employees and the economy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome this Bill as a practical example of the benefits of EU membership to Irish workers. Sometimes people ask what benefit EU membership has offered, other than Structural Funds and agricultural support. There is no doubt that in the <Col N="1081" />area of equality and labour legislation, Brussels has led the way and in some cases forced the Government to implement legislation that has been of enormous benefit to workers, women and minorities whose rights were not enshrined in law.</P>
    <P>In the wider context of the protection of employees, I want to raise the proposed cuts in the jobs initiative programme. In County Sligo, on 11 July, 26 workers will face redundancy after four years in a successful community-led employment project. These workers have been employed in a range of projects &ndash; care of the elderly, estate management and social care. Following redundancy they will return to the live register, losing good community jobs and saving the Exchequer little. As the majority of the people concerned are men over 50, their future prospects of employment are bleak, particularly in a rural area. The communities will lose a range of services provided by the scheme and by people they know.</P>
    <P>I have discussed this with the Minister on other occasions, especially the health care and elder care projects, because they are extremely important. It should be noted that there has been 60% success in progressing scheme participants into full-time employment. It is an example of a scheme that is working well, providing services to the community and employment, but it will end in July.</P>
    <P>A similar situation exists in County Leitrim, where up to 15 workers will face redundancy as a result of the discontinuation of community services in towns like Dromahair, Drumkeerin, Mohill, Kinlough and Manorhamilton. While it is not directly connected to the debate, an athlete from the Gambian team, which Manorhamilton is hosting, ten year old Nuha Sanneh, is the youngest athlete to win a gold medal at the Special Olympics and I send him my congratulations.</P>
    <P>The Government has now put in place a new, one year jobs initiative programme. If we contrast that with section 10 of the Bill, where an employer may renew a fixed term only after three years in continuous service, we see that the workers in the current jobs initiative scheme will not get that opportunity because existing workers will not qualify. I ask the Ministers concerned to reconsider this decision.</P>
    <P>Not only will workers not qualify, communities that are being served by the scheme will not qualify for the same services. If a worker is made redundant, the post will no longer exist. If a worker in estate management in McDermott Terrace in Manorhamilton is made redundant, that job will no longer be there and a crucial community service will disappear. I ask the Minister and the Tánaiste to review their decisions on the jobs initiative scheme and to keep in place a valuable community service.</P>
    <P>I welcome this Bill. It will benefit Irish and non-national workers and is positive labour legislation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnEllis" hpid="Mr. Ellis Mr. Ellis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ellis</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to speak on this Bill which will be of significant benefit to many people. We have all seen the problems faced by contract workers. Teaching has experienced major difficulties over the years, with teaching organisations, including the Department of Education and Science, giving people short-term contracts and renewing them <i>ad infinitum</i>. The bottom line was that many people had no statutory rights when it came to pensions and retirement. In recent years I have met teachers who have worked on a contract basis for 15 years. I remember sitting on an interview panel with a teacher who had been employed on a temporary basis for 14 years. That was terrible. He had problems getting a mortgage and his life was governed by renewal of his contract. Even after periods of lengthy service, people employed under contract were let go. The same situation exists in the health care system, although to a lesser extent.</P>
      <P>This Bill, however, should protect those employees and their rights and entitlements. The fact that the maximum by which a contract can be increased after three years is one year is to be welcomed.</P>
      <P>Credit is due to the employers' organisations that co-operated in the drafting of the Bill. Some of them may have been reluctant but they realised that workers are entitled to know what the future holds for them. There are 200,000 part-time workers in the State and they are entitled to protection of their rights. They represent 17% of the workforce.</P>
      <P>The Bill will help to improve the position of people on contract work. Many contract workers, be they nationals or non-nationals working under permits or otherwise, have found themselves in a very insecure position. They do not know what the next day will hold for them and it is imperative that they be given reasonable tenure with regard to their employment.</P>
      <P>Various guidelines have been issued over the years by the European Union and other bodies. EU legislation has improved the position of part-time employees but in protecting their rights it is imperative that the rights of employers are equally protected. This Bill will give solace to both parties because it will help address the problems experienced by them as far as fixed-term employees are concerned. In many cases, those workers have been at the mercy of employers but employers also have been at the mercy of some part-time workers who would walk away from the job if a permanent position was offered to them. It is important that the proper notice is given to both parties.</P>

    <P>When we consider all the other labour law that has been introduced here over recent years, we have to accept that the introduction of the minimum wage is probably one of the greatest achievements of this Government. While some might say that certain industries are affected by the minimum wage, its introduction has prevented employers abusing weak employees. Before the introduction of the minimum wage <Col N="1083" />there was always the danger that unscrupulous employers would force somebody to work for very low wages in the knowledge that because of their circumstances, family or otherwise, they could not move from that employment. We have all heard of cases where that applied. The recent decision to increase the minimum wage is to be welcomed.</P>
    <P>There has to be a further review of work permits. Certain industries are experiencing a shortage of skilled labour and the delays some employers are experiencing with regard to the renewal of work permits need to be examined. I came across a case recently in my constituency of an employer whose employee had to leave to return to his own country for family reasons but who had been held up for quite some time trying to get his work permit renewed. The unfortunate aspect is that the particular employee needs the job more than the employer needs him because his family, who live in the home country, are dependent on him as a breadwinner. That is an issue that needs to be examined.</P>
    <P>If we are to continue to be competitive as far as the labour market and world markets are concerned and if industry is experiencing a shortage of a particular labour force, it is imperative that companies have the opportunity to bring in foreign workers. That is not always practical and, in some cases, foreign workers have been used to displace nationals, but where that has happened, reasonably appropriate action was taken by the Department and the displaced employees.</P>
    <P>As far as certain professions are concerned, if it were not for our non-national workers we would be in serious trouble. I notice that especially with regard to hotels, pubs and restaurants, which have found it very difficult to get Irish staff and were forced to take in foreign staff. In many cases they would not have been able to continue in business but for those foreign staff. That is an area that also has to be addressed.</P>
    <P>Community employment schemes have been mentioned. We are all familiar with the work done by people on CE schemes who are on fixed-term contracts for the lifetime of the schemes. Many of them have progressed significantly on CE schemes. People who were unemployable prior to taking up CE schemes have become employable during the lifetime of the schemes. There will always be a certain section of people who will not be employable in the ordinary workforce and CE schemes have provided them with a sense of pride and a good income.</P>
    <P>There is some merit in examining the continuation of CE schemes, especially those involving community and care work. I hope the schemes can continue because if they do not, much of the good work done over recent years will go to waste. Some of the successful CE schemes may founder and the net result will be that care for the elderly, underprivileged groups and neglected areas of towns and villages will discontinue. That is something we all hope will not happen.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1084" />I mentioned the teaching profession earlier. There is a definite need for fixed-term work to be properly legislated for and controlled, and the Bill will do that. I know that the Minister hopes that when the Bill is passed by the House it can be implemented as soon as possible. It is hoped that before the House rises next week, it will be complete and will come into operation at the earliest possible date.</P>
    <P>On the labour market here, we are facing a shortage of labour in certain areas and contract and fixed-term employees will have to be taken on. I hope the Bill will give those workers the same protection as those in permanent positions.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MJNolan" hpid="Mr. Nolan Mr. Nolan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Nolan</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope the Bill is passed by the House before it rises for the summer recess. It had a speedy passage through the Seanad.</P>
      <P>The EU directive on fixed-term work, on which the Bill is based, provides that the quality of work be improved by the application of the principle of non-discrimination, which means that people on fixed-term contracts are not treated in a less favourable manner than comparable permanent workers. The debate so far has been interesting in that regard. There appears to be cross-party support for the principle. The purpose of the Bill is to protect the rights of individuals who are not fortunate enough to have permanent, full-time work.</P>
      <P>I am glad to note that both the ICTU and IBEC have had fruitful discussions on this legislation. As a result of their negotiations, some amendments to the Bill were agreed and they will be introduced on Committee Stage.</P>
      <P>It is only right that the Government should enshrine in legislation the rights and responsibilities of individuals who are not permanently employed. For far too long we have seen abuses by unscrupulous employers. Fortunately, the level of protection employees received in the past 15 years in particular from successive Governments has improved because such protection was enshrined in legislation. The passing of legislation addressing the problem of work practices which employers imposed on their employees in the past is welcome.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In implementing legislation to improve the rights of employees, we have to be careful that we do not shift the balance. My concern is that we will shift it to the point at which individuals or companies which are in a position to create employment will choose not to do so because of the level of responsibility being imposed on them by Government and State agencies and that, effectively, we price ourselves out of the employment marketplace. We have seen some evidence of this in the past three or four years as companies, particularly international firms, sought to source future manufacturing plants and operations elsewhere, notably in the Far East where employment is not as expensive. I hope the World Trade Organisation and world leaders will ensure we have a level playing pitch and countries such as China adopt the same levels of responsi<Col N="1085" />bility and workers' rights as the European Union and the United States.</P>
    <P>It will be difficult for the Government to enforce certain aspects of the legislation. However, this will be possible with commitment from employers. IBEC, in particular, appears to be genuine in its concern to preserve the rights and work practices it has negotiated. It is interesting to have observed the change in attitude of the trade union movement since the 1980s, particularly during the past two years. I commend it for the manner in which it has succeeded in safeguarding the rights of its members. The attitude of trade unions in the past five years has been excellent in so far as they have shown no interest in representing rogue workers. I know at first hand that the trade union movement represents the vast majority of workers, who are keen to earn a decent living, work hard and do well for themselves. Their rights are being looked after well.</P>
    <P>Health and safety is another area in which the current Government and its predecessors have taken a positive approach. We have seen major improvements in the health and safety record of construction sites in the past five years. It is important that those employed in that industry are aware the Government is serious about implementing health and safety rules, regulations and laws. While we still have an inordinate number of workplace accidents, the controls and safeguards in place, which are constantly monitored by the Health and Safety Authority, are welcome.</P>
    <P>The labour market and work practices have changed significantly over the past 20 years. There are now significantly fewer Irish employees working in the hotel and catering industry, which is indicative of a national trend. Our young and well-educated workforce is no longer entering that sector of the labour market, which is the reason we must employ non-nationals.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to be mindful of employment agencies which bring non-nationals into the country. They are, to an extent, fixed-term contract workers who are possibly being exploited. One or two cases of individuals in agencies exploiting workers have been brought to my attention. Fortunately, the unions, whom I commend in this regard, were able to get involved on behalf of the non-national workers concerned and sort out the matter to their satisfaction.</P>
    <P>Difficulties are increasingly cropping up in the area of international shipping and employment practices on ships. In the past year, there have been a number of cases of workers having to stage sit-ins on ships docking in our ports in order to obtain their rights. In some cases, these have continued for weeks or months without the workers receiving pay from their employers who are based overseas. I ask the Minister to discuss this issue with his counterparts in the European Union and to seek European-wide strategies to help the individuals concerned, who tend to be non-nationals with little knowledge of their rights. It is only when they come to countries such <Col N="1086" />as Ireland that they are able to tap into the trade union system and obtain advice.</P>
    <P>Given the cyclical nature of the labour market, the introduction of this legislation is timely. We have seen a downturn in our economic fortunes and according to all the economic indicators, matters will improve significantly over the next 12 to 18 months. It is important, therefore, that this legislation be introduced at this time.</P>
    <P>The temporary nature of employment in some sectors of the labour market has been mentioned, notably teaching. While it would be wrong to say teachers were abused in the past, the roll-over of temporary contracts for teachers was a symptom of the 1980s. Thankfully, this practice has stopped and we now see more permanent contracts being offered to teachers.</P>
    <P>Benchmarking was raised at the Committee on Finance and the Public Service this week. It will be of interest to the House and its committees to observe how the evaluation and the improved work practices proceed. There are areas within the public sector and Civil Service where productivity needs to improve. I hope the implementation of the benchmarking process and the provisions agreed therein will enable us to identify and tackle areas in which improvements are required.</P>
    <P>I hope the legislation, including amendments negotiated by the Minister with ICTU and IBEC, will be passed and on the Statute Book by the time the House rises.</P>

      <P>I welcome the Bill. Although the legislation is now two or three years overdue, the Government has now responded to the directive issued by the European Union. We like to praise ourselves for progress made in legislating in the area of labour relations. However, we have always been forced to do so on foot of EU directives. I recall that as far back as 1977, when a raft of legislation was introduced by the European Economic Community on unfair dismissals, equal pay and a range of other matters, the Government tried to postpone implementation. There were, at that time, real and considerable cost and competitiveness factors involved and a concern that the legislation would lead to massive job losses. Nevertheless, the State responded by transposing the directive into law, minimised job losses and got on with things.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister of State referred to our tradition of voluntarism. Our having as little legislative input as possible into the area of labour relations has proved to be very productive. For this to be the case, there needs to be a strong trade union movement and responsive employers. Otherwise, those in marginal employment and those who are not in a position to negotiate for themselves <Col N="1087" />would fare badly. The National Minimum Wage Act should not have been deemed necessary in a society where voluntarism was practised and where negotiations between equal partners took place.</P>
    <P>As other Deputies have stated, employees are vulnerable to exploitation and they have been exploited over the years. However, strong unionisation or the fear of unionisation has compelled some companies to offer good conditions of employment. I have had much experience of the legislation of the 1970s and I was on the Employment Appeals Tribunal for nine years. That there be no legal involvement in labour relations cases was in the spirit of the legislation introduced in 1977 but, as I stated in respect of a different Bill, lawyers became increasingly involved in bringing cases before various tribunals. For example, when I was on the Employment Appeals Tribunal I remember when representatives of IBEC &ndash; or its predecessor, FUE &ndash; would take the case of the employer and a trade union official would take that of the employee. This approach was extremely successful and all parties involved were keen to seek a resolution to difficulties. The Employment Appeals Tribunal recognised that the parties to the disputes were not lawyers but that they were trying to make their cases as well as possible.</P>
    <P>Nowadays, cases that come before the Employment Appeals Tribunal, such as unfair dismissal cases, invariably involve some of the highest paid lawyers in the country, who are representing either the employee or the employer, and sometimes both. The law was never meant to be applied in this way but, unfortunately, it has. I would love to see a return to its original spirit, which stressed voluntarism in negotiations. Many of the Acts pertaining to this area were meant to extend face to face negotiation between the trade union and the employer or the employee and the employer.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State praised the various agreements &ndash; I accept that they have played a valuable role in developing rights and ensuring competitiveness &ndash; but employers' and employees' representatives have almost lost the art of negotiation. The trade unions involved in the many agreements I negotiated were very experienced, and we all became very experienced because we had to. One negotiated instinctively. I believe there would be a considerable fight between the trade unions' and employers' representatives if they had to negotiate individual agreements in every company in the country. They may not even have the personnel to do so. I do not know what the position would be in respect of organisations without trade union representation &ndash; I presume the employers would try to find a way of negotiating with their employees to the satisfaction of both parties. It would be an interesting development and I would be keen to observe it from the outside.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1088" />There is no doubt that the conditions of workers have changed dramatically in recent decades. I remember when people who joined a company after their having left school remained in that company until they reached the age of retirement. This was expected, especially in the old, traditional companies which represented the mainstay of employment at that time. Every man who took up employment in Guinness's at the age of 14 knew he would remain there until he reached retirement age. Such companies were often very good employers and looked after the welfare of their staff. However, this has totally changed. Nobody taking up employment in a particular company believes he will remain in it for the rest of his life, except for some people taking up positions in the Civil Service or public service. However, there are also changes in the public service &ndash; there is much more flexibility and opportunity for development, which was not the case previously. It is believed that anybody starting work today will probably have three to five jobs or careers in his lifetime.</P>
    <P>There is a need for the flexibility that is now evident in the workplace. However, as it became more prevalent so also did exploitation. Employers in the private and public sectors used fixed-term contracts to contract themselves out of what I would regard as their obligations under the various employment laws to which I referred, including the 1974 Act. The Minister of State stated that there are 70,000 people on fixed contracts. Obviously, many of these contracts suit both the employer and the employee and they are necessary in certain businesses.</P>
    <P>When Acts such as those to which I referred conferred certain rights on employees, certain employers examined ways in which they could renege on their obligations. Before these Acts came into law, there was no such thing as a fixed-term contract &ndash; an employer could give a week's notice to anybody and terminate his or her employment. There was no control at all over employers and unscrupulous ones could sack anybody for no reason and did not have to account for themselves, except in cases where the involvement of a strong trade union might have given rise to a strike.</P>
    <P>One way in which employers attempted to renege on their obligations under the legislation was to introduce piece-work contracts. They stated to employees that they would not give them a weekly wage but a fixed sum for doing a certain job. The meat industry company I worked for introduced contract boners. They were paid per carcass, their status was self-employed and they had to deal with their own tax and social insurance. The company had no obligations towards them. The legislation is necessary to address situations such as this.</P>
    <P>I am pleased that the ICTU and IBEC have been involved in drawing up the legislation. It sends a signal that the main players in the employment areas agree in principle with the legislation and probably with the detail. While <Col N="1089" />employers will want less and trade unions more, that is the nature of the volunteerism process. It allows for negotiating positions to be taken.</P>
    <P>There will be no significant erosion of competitiveness. Inflation and the cost of insurance are much more important in that regard, both of which the Government can do much to address. It is ten years since IBEC produced a report showing that our insurance costs were uncompetitive by comparison with our European competitors. It showed that if employer's liability insurance in this country was as competitively priced as elsewhere, an additional 10,000 jobs would have been created. I hate to consider how much more uncompetitive the cost of employer's liability insurance is today. It would be interesting to see how many jobs could be created if the cost of such insurance was in line with our main competitors in Europe.</P>
    <P>The area of negotiations to which I referred often provided the opportunity for employers to express concern about their difficulties, including their competitiveness, while allowing trade unions to express their concern about the aspirations of the employees they represented. I was involved in personnel management for almost 20 years. I question the use of the term &ldquo;human resource management&rdquo;, which originated in the United States. While it is legitimate to refer to resources in terms of minerals, raw materials and such like, I am uncomfortable in referring to human beings in the same terms. They are more than a resource. The old personnel management approach placed a great emphasis on welfare. By this I mean not only conditions of employment and remuneration, but the well-being of employees in terms of their home situation. For example, if an employee had a sick family member he or she was often helped by the firm. By contrast, human resource management suggests that human beings are a resource that must be maximised, while there is no desire to deal with employees in the round as human beings. We have lost much of the welfare approach inherent in the old personnel approach.</P>
    <P>Contract employment is likely to become increasingly prevalent. Many of those with higher skills will work on this basis. Women who have left employment to rear families constitute a massive resource to the economy. Many are highly skilled and experienced and everything should be done to assist them to return to the workforce and contribute in whatever way they can, be it on the basis of temporary employment, short-term contracts or shared employment. There have been developments in these areas. The Bill goes some way to address the concerns of those taking short-term contract employment regarding exploitation, which is to be welcomed.</P>
    <P>The Bill also responds to the EU directive and is in line with the socially progressive nature of the Union since its foundation. It was founded after the Second World War for social and economic reasons. Many of the directives are socially aware and allow for flexibility for business to <Col N="1090" />expand and change while balancing this with equitable and fair legislation to protect the rights of workers.</P>
    <P>I hope the Government will ensure that the economic downturn will be of short duration. It has a duty to do so and it will be in the interests of us all. I also hope it will respond to the need to ensure that employment losses are minimised.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture and Food (Mr. Walsh)</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this opportunity to inform the House of the outcome of the negotiations on the mid-term review of the Common Agricultural Policy which concluded at the meeting of the Council of Ministers in Luxembourg early this morning. As the House is aware, outline proposals for the mid-term review of Agenda 2000 were presented by the Commission in July 2002 while the detailed proposals were published in January 2003. The proposals comprised the most radical reform of the CAP since its foundation and have been the subject of much analysis and intense public debate here and in other member states. The Council of Ministers has debated the proposals at each of its meetings this year. My officials and I have had close ongoing consultations with all farming, food processing and other representative bodies as the negotiations have proceeded, mainly through consultative groups which I established for this purpose. Issues and concerns have been identified and have been well known for some time. I have also made my position on the proposals clear both at home and in the Council of Ministers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>From the outset, my objectives have been to safeguard the benefits to Irish agriculture and to rural communities of Agenda 2000 and to ensure the best possible level of support and protection for our production base into the future. The agreement reached this morning was the culmination of a long process and represented a meeting of minds that the time to conclude an agreement had been reached. Any objective examination of the out<Col N="1091" />come of the negotiations will acknowledge that I have been successful in achieving my objectives. By any standards, the terms of the balanced agreement concluded in the Council represent a successful outcome to the negotiations from Ireland's point of view. The agreement which was reached will reshape the Common Agricultural Policy and secure its future by making it more relevant to modern society. We have the opportunity now to exploit the position to our advantage. I will deal with the various issues involved in detail.</P>
    <P>The proposal to decouple direct payments from production represented a fundamental change to the CAP and was the most contentious issue throughout the negotiations. The Council agreed to amend the proposal for full decoupling of direct payments to give member states a number of options to implement decoupling in a manner best suited to their requirements. Besides providing the opportunity to reduce the paperwork associated with direct payments, about which farmers have been extremely critical, the new arrangements provide new opportunities for Irish farmers to respond to market demands. The menu of options agreed includes provision to allow each member state to decouple fully all payments. It provides for other options in relation to cereals, beef and sheep meat which allow for a variety of partial decoupling arrangements. Some of the options include up to 100% coupling of the suckler cow premium, up to 100% coupling of the slaughter premium and up to 75% coupling of the special beef premium. The sheep premium and the supplementary ewe premium may now be either fully decoupled or fully coupled. Furthermore, payments up to 10% of a member state's direct payments may be allowed for the purpose of encouraging specific types of farming.</P>
    <P>I am convinced the outcome of the negotiations represents a significant improvement on the original proposals and that it makes increased simplification possible. From the point of view of the forthcoming World Trade Organisation talks, the new arrangements on decoupling will enable a substantial proportion of direct payments, depending on the choices made by member states, to qualify as domestic supports with no trade-distorting effects or effects on production or, at most, minimal effects. This refers to the so-called &ldquo;green box&rdquo;. Such supports will therefore be protected from challenge at the negotiations. I have made it absolutely clear that the outcome represents the bottom line in so far as the WTO negotiations are concerned and that I will not agree to a new WTO round which requires further reform of the Common Agricultural Policy.</P>
    <P>I intend to consult with the social partners with a view to introducing the model best suited to Irish requirements to maximise efficiency, competitiveness and the protection of the rural economy. Moreover, I intend to keep the arrangements under close review, particularly in light of the facility under the agreement which provides <Col N="1092" />for a review by the Commission of the operation of the new arrangements after two years with a view to dealing with its possible impact on structural reform and markets.</P>
    <P>I am particularly satisfied with the outcome which I secured in relation to degressivity and modulation. The Commission's proposals represented a very serious threat to the level of direct payments to Ireland which are of critical importance to farm incomes of which they now account for 69%. The total amount involved is &euro;1.3 billion. I managed to secure the removal of the proposed reduction of up to 13% in direct payments to meet future financing needs. This is the degressivity proposal. The removal of this automatic system of annual reductions in direct payments was a major achievement and the compromise agreed, which requires the Council to review from 2007 onwards the financial situation annually if budget deficits arise and to take the necessary action, represents a much more satisfactory approach.</P>
    <P>In addition, the proposed rate of modulation has been reduced from 6% to 5%. My objective of retaining modulated funds within Ireland for rural development measures has also largely been achieved. Modulation will commence in 2005 at a rate of 3% and will increase by 1% each year to 5%. When the agreed modulated system is fully implemented, Ireland will retain over &euro;34 million per annum of the &euro;40 million which will be raised through modulation. The retention of the &euro;5,000 franchise or exemption will ensure that modulation will not be applied to about half of Irish farmers. This is a major improvement on the original proposal whereby the combined effect of modulation and degressivity would have resulted in &euro;464 million being siphoned off direct payments over the period 2006 to 2012.</P>
    <P>On milk, I am delighted to inform the House that I have succeeded in having the original proposals for an overall 10% reduction beyond the level agreed in Agenda 2000 reduced to approximately 4%.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomHayes" hpid="Mr. Hayes Mr. Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>What did Deputy Ned O'Keeffe say about that today?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>In addition, the original proposal provided for compensation for the intervention price reductions at the same level as applied in the Agenda 2000 agreement, or 56%. I managed to secure compensation of approximately 80% for the additional intervention price reduction of over 4% now agreed. That will be paid through a dairy cow premium.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Losses to the dairy sector from the net effect of the 4% intervention price reduction and the increase in the dairy cow premium amount to less than &euro;14 million a year. However, the intervention price reduction will have effect only if product is sold to intervention. In other words, this represents a decrease in intervention, but if one is not tied to or dependent on it, there is no reason prices should be reduced by that or any <Col N="1093" />amount. If product is sold where it should, on the market, there may not be any loss at all. In fact, depending on market prices, there could be substantial gains.</P>
    <P>The Irish dairy industry must reform, rationalise and streamline its activities. To address this, I established the Prospectus Study some months ago and I am sure Deputies are familiar with the resulting report. It stated clearly that the Irish dairy industry must increase its product range. Selling to intervention is not the way to build a viable industry capable of remunerating its farmer suppliers adequately for its raw material.</P>
    <P>Where we are and what we have to do can be illustrated by reference to a few statistics. In the last four years, Ireland has accounted for between 27% and 35% of EU butter intervention in-take, compared with our 8% share of production. The figures for skimmed milk powder are similar. Our reliance on commodity products is way out of line with, for example, Denmark and the Netherlands. Whole or skimmed milk powder contribute 50% of Irish total production of dairy products compared with 23% in Denmark and 15% in the Netherlands.</P>
    <P>Notwithstanding the objective of reducing dependence on commodity products and on intervention purchases, the original proposal of the Commission to cut butter intervention intake to 30,000 tonnes a year would have been too disruptive in the short term. I was able to obtain an agreement against enormous opposition. In fact, no other member state, not even from among the ten new member states, was supportive of increased intervention. They knew, of course, that if a product is manufactured for intervention, it goes into storage and the taxpayer pays for that. It has to come out of intervention but while it is overhanging the market like a dark cloud, it depresses the market. Finally, it depresses prices further when it is released onto the market. That is not the way to build a viable industry for the future.</P>
    <P>The Commission proposal was for a ceiling of 30,000 tonnes of butter. In my compromise proposal for a final agreement there is a ceiling for next year of 70,000 tonnes which reduces by 10,000 tonnes per year over the next five years. This gives a lead in period to the industry to wean itself away from dependence on intervention. The new dairy cow premium will not be decoupled until reform in the sector is completed thereby favouring active producers. Overall, the agreement is satisfactory given, in particular, that the quota regime has been extended. Irish farmers want the quota retained. There was also the option of retaining Agenda 2000 and losing the quota in 2008. Under the new arrangement, the quota is secure until 2015.</P>
    <P>I argued successfully that the original proposal for a reduction of 5% in the intervention price for cereals was excessive and unnecessary in view of trends in world market prices. It was ultimately agreed to leave the intervention price for cereals unchanged with the partial retention of the <Col N="1094" />monthly increments. I also secured the dropping of the original proposal for ten year obligatory non-rotational set aside, which would not have been suitable in the Irish situation. The new arrangements on set aside are more workable in the Irish situation and allow further set aside obligations as market needs arise.</P>
    <P>From the outset of the negotiations I have been concerned to secure the best possible terms and conditions for young farmers.</P>

      <P>The maximum support for young farmers undertaking investments within five years of setting up has been increased to 60% in less favoured areas and to 50% in other areas. Additional changes which I negotiated for young farmers include the more equitable calculation of single payment entitlements for young farmers who entered farming during the reference period, flexibility to create a national reserve and the possibility of allowing young farmers who inherit farms to also inherit any entitlements established by the retiring farmer. Other changes secured during the negotiations are as follows: the farm advisory system or farm audit will now be voluntary for all farmers, the national reserve may be used for certain early retirement cases and special payment entitlements for certain dairy and other farmers can be traded in the same way as single payment entitlements.</P>
      <P>I firmly believe that the outcome of the negotiations means that the benefits of the Agenda 2000 agreement have been retained while the change in policy framework will ensure a more market orientated and sustainable agriculture and food industry. I had to look at the outcome as a total package and the balance within it. The new arrangements reposition the CAP in the modern world and, ultimately, in the longer term, will be seen as safeguarding its future. We are highly dependent on a strong and viable CAP and we are not serving our own interests if we bury our heads in the sand and ignore the external threats and challenges.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The options for decoupling direct payments will allow such payments to be made secure from challenge in the WTO. As a consequence, the contribution of direct payments to farm incomes and, therefore, to the rural economy will be safeguarded in a manner not heretofore achieved. I do not believe the level of criticism of the agree<Col N="1095" />ment is in any way justified. It is not helpful to the interests of Irish agriculture or our rural communities to criticise without justification a worthy agreement and, in the process, preach doom and gloom, which undermine the confidence of our farmers and particularly those young people contemplating entering farming.</P>
    <P>We can look ahead with confidence and plan for the future in a stable policy environment. My priority now is to manage the transition from the old to the new regime so as to ensure a smooth transfer and enable Irish agriculture to exploit the new opportunities to the full.</P>

      <P>All the criticism of this agreement has originated in the countryside. I thank the Minister for coming to the House at such short notice but I also wish to put on record that this debate, consisting of statements and questions, should not be taken as an indication that after 7.30 p.m. this issue should no longer be discussed in the House. Much analysis is needed to digest the detail and the likely impact the measures will have on the Irish farming sector.</P>
      <P>I can understand that the Minister wishes to close the door on these proposals because, regardless of how one looks at them, it has been a bad day's work. Everybody remembers the former Taoiseach, Albert Reynolds, being carried home on the euphoria of many billions of pounds in Cohesion Funds.</P>

      <P>Success was judged on the amount of additional funding or positive policy change that one achieved. On this occasion, however, the Minister came home with less than he had going out. No matter what measurement one uses this has to be adjudged a failure. To refer to it as a balanced outcome is simply not correct, because even within the failure some sectors have been more severely hurt than others.</P>
      <P>Once again, the Minister's nemesis from east Cork has been hauled out by the Government doctors of spin to play the &ldquo;good cop/bad cop&rdquo; routine and, once again, our national broadcaster fell for this oft repeated crisis management tactic. The sentiments expressed by Deputy Ned O'Keeffe are correct. I only wish he had the courage of his articulated convictions to support the various motions put down in this House during the last year on agriculture. He talks the talk but he will not walk the walk.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Commissioner Fischler will argue that agricultural reform before the WTO meeting in Cancun in September was imperative to ensure that the Doha round can achieve fruition. He seamlessly threads the language of taxpayer, consumer, pro<Col N="1096" />ducer, market requirement, rural development and environmental protection &ndash; terms with which we all agree &ndash; into an inviting and mystic concoction which, as far as farmers in Ireland are concerned, will leave less money in their pockets. In recent times commentators have sought to sully the term &ldquo;farm protectionism&rdquo;. The practice was there long before the advent of the Common Agricultural Policy and it was there for a good reason. Adam Smith in his book, &ldquo;Wealth of Nations&rdquo;, written over 200 years ago, refers in detail to the various interventionist policies in the production of food in Europe.</P>
    <P>The ultimate beneficiary of farm subsidies is the consumer. Farmers cannot be expected to produce for nothing and there has to be payment to ensure a sufficient and safe supply of food. Europe is not at the front of the world league in providing funding for agriculture and it imports more produce from third countries than the USA, Canada and the CAIRNS group put together. The Commissioner now has the deal he so longed for and let us hope that he loses no ground at the WTO. However, to sign off on any deal at 7 a.m., after an all night session, is no way to do business.</P>
    <P>Ireland exports almost 90% of its produce. In relative terms the impact of this new deal will be felt to a greater extent in this country than in other member states. It is important to realise that these dramatic changes were originally supposed to be a review, not a reform. Following the agreement on Agenda 2000, the Minister established a working group which produced a document that became a blueprint for his Department, entitled &ldquo;2010&rdquo;. Where does this stand now? Can we be sure that the new reforms will remain in place for the set period? The Commissioner says they should but we have heard that before.</P>
    <P>When the original proposals first appeared in July 2002, there was no mention of any change in the dairy sector. One year later, however, we see that it has been struck a devastating blow. Is this a hidden cost of an enlargement which virtually all of us welcomed in view of the new opportunities it presented? Only time will tell the true story. Europe has been good to us but there must be honesty at all times. The main strength of the CAP has been that it was common to all members. The Commission's final paper of 26 June 2003 stated that &ldquo;every country or Union has a right to an agricultural policy of its own, provided it is sustainable and avoids or limits trade distortion&rdquo;. I fear an advent of trade distortions in the EU and I would like an assurance from the Minister this will not be so. A nationalisation of the CAP is its dismantling and if this happens we will be at a serious disadvantage compared to our partners in the EU.</P>
    <P>The Minister has outlined the detail of the document and a detailed analysis of this will be required in the days ahead. Over the last few months decoupling has been the main issue but the main losers in today's agreement are the dairy people. The drop in the price of milk in County Cork alone in 2001-02 was roughly equivalent to <Col N="1097" />the loss of 1,450 jobs at the average industrial wage. A few months ago I spoke at a meeting in Mallow where much genuine cause for concern was raised. Dairy farmers have got one commitment from this deal and that is for reduced income. The number of quota holders declined by 31% between 1990 and 1999 &ndash; these were mainly quota holders with less than 20,000 gallons. Following these proposals the number of dairy farmers will fall by half from the current 27,000 over the next ten years.</P>
    <P>The Minister will argue that the cut in dairying, taken on top of Agenda 2000 and averaged across butter and skim milk powder, is just over 4% but we must remember that Agenda 2000 has been scrapped so the real cut is over 19%. The loss in the price per gallon of milk is over 9 pence, not cents, and when fully implemented the loss to the dairy sector will be in the region of &euro;115 million not &euro;14 million as outlined by the Minister. Under the current policy a dairy farmer with a 40,000 gallon quota has an average income of &euro;22,296, but under the new system his income will now fall to &euro;15,443, a drop of &euro;6,900. That is what faces a dairy farmer with a 40,000 gallon milk quota. I advise the Minister to take the boat home to west Cork and avoid what will be a very angry dairy country.</P>
    <P>The proposed cut in cereals has been dropped but I note that Jacques Chirac is taking the credit for that. Any reduction in red tape is welcome and this may be the only positive aspect of this deal. I hope it will not be replaced with a plethora of cross-compliance measures as input costs for farmers have soared over the last few years. The Minister stated that he will sit down with the social partners over the next few weeks and decide on a form of decoupling. This is a most important decision.</P>
    <P>To date there are many varied views on this. Many farmers want complete decoupling but others feel that some production measure has to be built in to ensure its sustainability. No matter what option is selected farm numbers will continue to decline. CSO figures published yesterday showed a drop in agricultural output volume of 8.1% for 2002 and when inflation is added to this it is clear that farm incomes are definitely falling. Government measures in the last year have also added to the burden. The Minister has to revisit these.</P>
    <P>Jacques Delors said he would not sacrifice the French countryside on the altar of world trade. I fear that the deal the Government has struck has the potential to sacrifice our countryside. This is not just about economics, where we have clearly lost. It is also about the killing of our countryside. In light of today's events the Minister must seek a package at Cabinet to ensure the survival of our countryside. The best method of rural development is sustainable agriculture. This Government has failed to halt this slide and I have no confidence that it will do anything different in the future.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1098" />In conclusion, it is a pity that we are here today after the horse has bolted. For almost a year we have looked for a debate on this and we are getting it now. I hope that in the remaining week of this session the Minister, if required, will come back here to go through some of the finer detail of the reforms. I thank him for coming here today but we all know, and if he does not know now he will know by Monday or Tuesday, it is a bad deal.</P>

      <P>I join Deputy Timmins in thanking the Minister for coming here at such short notice to explain in detail how the Agenda 2000 talks worked out. Today will go down as the day when the Minister finally sold out on Irish agriculture. When farmers got out of bed this morning to go about their work they did not realise as they heard on the news and from Deputy Ned O'Keeffe how badly they had been sold out in Luxembourg. The dairy industry, which has been the backbone of Irish agriculture for many years, was sold out by this Government and by the negotiators in Luxembourg and when the dairy industry is sold out, the whole of agriculture and every section of the supporting community, co-ops in every town and village in the countryside, will be affected.</P>

      <P>Twenty five years ago one could sell corn and get £80 or £85 a tonne. It made &euro;70 a tonne last year and what will it make over the coming years? The beef industry too has been sold out. In every cattle market across the country over the next few weeks people will be so despondent about what happened that there will be a further drop in cattle prices. It is a sell out and a cop out. I am sorry for the backbenchers who have to sell this deal because people believe it is a sell out and that the Minister was weak in his negotiation.</P>

      <P>The Minister has come into the House at very short notice today but this is the first time he has come in to discuss this issue. There have to be large question marks over that. <Col N="1099" />The fact that the Minister has agreed to the re-nationalisation of agriculture and a major drop in dairy raises major questions about his ability. He has to consider his position. We are about to enter WTO talks and he has once again promised us that he will hold the line in those talks. He promised there would be no change in Agenda 2000 and now we have a drop in dairy farming and an opportunity for other countries to fund agriculture.</P>
      <P>In the six years he has been Minister he has allowed the budget for agriculture to drop. I do not believe that the Minister will be able to deliver extra money at the Cabinet to relieve the problems that this deal has brought. Other countries will fund their farmers but we will not. Farmers are walking off the land in their hundreds. Six agricultural colleges have been closed in this Minister's time in office. He promised the opening of the Egyptian market for beef and live cattle. What has happened? Immediately before the election he got out a few tons, and last week he sent out another delegation to try to give the impression that he was active in that area again.</P>
      <P>I said on the night of the Minister's appointment that he did a good job and that he is a nice fellow. He won a lot of plaudits for what he did during the foot and mouth outbreak but we all worked with him. He has got tired and fails to understand what the young farmers of this country want and need. When the small print emerges on the funds available to them it will be tied up in so much red tape that they will not be able to draw them down. A form for an ordinary farm building grant today is a nightmare. It can be filled only by a consultant. Will he change that? No. I do not believe there will be any move in that direction. There is only one thing for the Minister to do, and that is consider his position very seriously, for unless we get some new thinking in agriculture and some more backbone&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Upton</NameTxt>
      <P>I too thank the Minister for coming to the House to allow an opportunity for debate on the outcome of the discussions. Much of the small print has yet to be dissected or absorbed, and at the moment it is only possible for us to respond to the broad thrust of the agreements reached this morning in Luxembourg. I ask at the outset that the Minister engage as soon as possible with the various farming organisations and social partners to discuss the impact of the reforms in detail. The different farming enterprises and the various sizes of farm holdings render it impossible to design a &ldquo;one size fits all&rdquo; response to different farming interests. The initial purpose of the Fischler proposals was to remove a subsidy-driven system which was taking up half the EU budget. EU subsidies still make up 60% of Irish farm incomes. The flexible arrangements on decoupling will allow a good degree of choice for farmers, but it is important that the different farming sectors are advised on the minutiae of the proposals to allow them to make informed choices.</P>
      <P>It is a useful exercise to review the findings of a Eurobarometer poll held earlier this year. According to that poll, more than 60% of EU citizens see a shift to farm subsidies from production to directly supporting farmers and rural areas as positive and desirable. Those surveyed were strongly in favour of the farm policy objectives listed in the survey: to ensure that agricultural products are healthy and safe; to protect the environment; to protect medium and small farmers; to help farmers adapt their production to consumer expectations; and to make European agriculture more competitive on the world markets. I do not believe that anyone can disagree with any of those aspirations.</P>
      <P>The key change arising from the Fischler proposals is that the majority of subsidies will be paid independently of the volume of production. Now it appears that there will be limited links between subsidy and production under defined conditions. The environment, food quality and animal welfare will be enhanced, and that is certainly to be welcomed. However, one of the concerns that has been expressed repeatedly by everyone who spoke here this evening is the level of bureaucracy historically associated with farm payments. Is the latest compromise likely to add to the bureaucracy? For example, there will presumably be different options for different farming sectors. Will that mean a lack of uniformity and therefore confusion and further bureaucracy?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I will refer specifically to the dairy sector. I understand why it has concerns about a significant drop in income. The Minister stated in his radio interview this morning that he saw a need for the industry to adapt and change. I would like him to expand on that concept and explain how the dairy farmers can be supported to accommodate that change. Milk production in Ireland is seasonal, and that cannot be altered. That seasonality precludes dairy farmers from certain options regarding alternative fresh dairy products <Col N="1101" />throughout the year. What kind of supports does the Minister envisage to allow the development of alternative dairy products? Incidentally, both Mr. Fischler and Bord Bia have been calling for some time for Ireland to engage in the development of value-added products, and we seem to be lagging significantly behind European countries, as well as others such as Japan, in that area.</P>
    <P>Everyone wants to see a vibrant rural economy and way of life, and up to now Brussels has underpinned that option for Ireland. It has provided the supports and market opportunities and allowed a rural way of life that would otherwise have been impossible. It is important now to secure farming where it is strong and viable. The diversification of rural employment options and retaining rural populations through resource-based development in other sectors, such as forestry, the marine and natural resources, must also be sustained and developed. Options such as tourism in rural Ireland must be enhanced and a quality product offered to visitors to this country. Rural towns must be supported with the labour supply and skills that will complement rural development. Small farmers should not be sacrificed to the larger enterprises. That is where new ideas must come forward. An acceptance of the need for off-farm work must be highlighted, and the Minister now has a responsibility to ensure that industry in small rural towns is given every support to ensure off-farm employment is enhanced and supported where necessary.</P>
    <P>Linked to that is the need to ensure that can be accommodated by the local infrastructure. Industrial developments in small rural towns must be encouraged. It is now becoming just as important to the farmer as it is to the industrial worker that jobs in industry are protected. The area of research, development and education cannot be sacrificed, and for that reason I wish to express my concern once again at the cuts in funding for training, research and development, particularly in the area of food development, which were made earlier this year to the Teagasc budget. It is more important than ever, particularly when I refer back to the need to develop new products in the dairy industry, for example, that there is a strong research base to support that. That is not simply going to happen, and we must lead by making the best research facilities available to develop it.</P>
    <P>Some of the issues I have mentioned, I acknowledge, would not have been part of the wider CAP reform discussions, but it is vitally important that they be recognised and debated nationally in tandem with the proposed reforms.</P>
    <P>I would like to hear the views of the Minister on how the reforms will impact on the price of food. It seems that what has been offered today will bring no joy to the consumer regarding food prices, and it is important to note that farmers are also consumers of food. In all the press releases available today, the consumer scarcely merits a mention. This opportunity should not have been allowed to go by without ensuring that the con<Col N="1102" />sumer will also benefit financially from the deal struck. Perhaps, when the finer details are aired and debated, it will be possible to see a way forward to ensure the consumer is not ripped off in the prices that he or she pays for food here and that we might lose our rather invidious top-of-the-league place regarding European food prices. Enhanced quality and safety are most welcome, but the cost of food to the consumer must be addressed.</P>
    <P>I represent an urban constituency. Food prices and jobs in the food industry are a primary concern for my constituents. However, it is also important to them and to me that the producers of the food and the instigators of the jobs, the farmers, also get a fair deal. The relevance of the reforms to developing countries has been disappointing. To say the very least, development has not been at the heart of the debate. Mr. Fischler stated today that we were saying goodbye to the old subsidy system, which significantly distorts international trade and harms developing countries. However, in reality we did not get rid of that system. It has been modified and reduced, and that is a step in the right direction, but it is misleading to suggest that the lot of developing countries will be significantly enhanced by the changes introduced today.</P>
    <P>Arising from that last observation, I would like the Minister to give his views on the unity of purpose in the EU in approaching the World Trade Organisation talks in September. The negotiations in Europe were divisive. Is it safe to assume that unity will prevail in the talks and that any vested interests will be set aside? Perhaps the Minister might also let us know what specific involvement he will have in the WTO negotiations.</P>

      <P>The Minister has had a difficult few days, and on behalf of my party I too appreciate this early opportunity to debate the outcome of talks that have been keenly awaited and are of crucial importance not only to the economy of the country but to the future of rural life. In the press release issued by the Minister's Department, it was stated that he had secured concessions to ensure that Ireland's objectives had been satisfied in crucial negotiations. It struck me as a press release that could have been issued regarding any number of previous meetings for farm negotiations at European Council level. It has been yet another series of negotiations about retrenchment and fighting a rearguard action, trying to avoid what has seemingly been the inevitable direction of European Union farm policy in recent years. The type of fudge has been agreed that has dogged agriculture and failed many who wish to see a viable industry based on innovation and quality. An opportunity has been lost.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1103" />The Minister stated that his prime objective was to ensure decisions had been ring-fenced and that further decisions could not be made at the World Trade Organisation talks in Cancun. This is an unfortunate response. There exists a climate, even within the farming community in Ireland, where different farm organisations are looking at different approaches and are debating within and between their organisations as to how things can and should be done differently in agriculture.</P>
    <P>The Minister has presided over the evolution of agriculture where many farmers are more concerned with drawing ink than with driving cattle. They are more concerned with filling forms than with ploughing furrows. Many who have been engaged in agriculture did not get involved in agricultural life for those reasons and do not want to remain in agricultural life for those reasons. The net effect has been that 2,000 leave farming each year.</P>
    <P>Existing prices are on absolute levels and in real terms are much less than ten years ago. This is not a record of which one can be proud. Those on this side should constantly remind the Minister of the failings of the policies being pursued.</P>
    <P>The language of agriculture has been debased. We are now talking about decoupling, digression, modulation and the basics of agriculture. It is a culture that has been debased. We are thoroughly enthralled to the needs of agri-business and the needs of individual farmers and family farms have taken a low priority in Government policy and how it has influenced EU policy. That has had knock-on effects in terms of consumer confidence. My party and I are confident that confidence can be restored because there is within the Irish agricultural community the ability to produce food of high quality at costs that are easily affordable and can compete with the best in the world. Unfortunately the Common Agricultural Policy as organised does not allow that to happen. Ultimately the Minister's stand on the World Trade Organisation talks, while perhaps done in the best interests of Ireland and Irish farmers in the short term, will have a knock-on effect as to how Ireland is perceived in the wider world community. That will affect our ability to export agricultural produce.</P>
    <P>The effect of the Common Agricultural Policy is that a subsidy in the EU region of $2 per day is paid per head of cattle. That is twice what 1 billion people on the planet have to exist on. If agricultural subsidies and our ability to create a viable agricultural system which interacts, competes and provides quality food are put in those terms we need to ask serious questions. The reality is that the Minister could have taken chances. We should have taken the leap into the unknown. Agricultural policy should not have been linked solely with production but with income maintenance, innovation and active rural <Col N="1104" />development policies. The opposite is the case and 2,000 farmers per year are leaving the land. </P>

We have not been in Government. The bogey man has been sitting in the Department for the past six years, has been practising the policies and driving 2,000 farmers off farm holdings each year during the past six years. The bogey man has made farm prices static in absolute and real terms. That is the tragedy of the traditional, conservative, short-sighted, blinkered approached the Minister has followed in yet another series of farm negotiations.

To the extent that the Minister has been able to ensure this is the case he must be commended. The reforms contain proposals which can be made to work for the benefit of Irish farmers. Sinn Féin has said this from the time the original reform proposals were published in July 2002. Almost alone among Irish political parties and some farming organisations we had advocated a creative engagement with the process in order to secure the best possible deal for Irish farmers.</P>
      <P>We have long been critical of the Common Agricultural Policy. It was clear that in its present form small to medium size farmers would continue to struggle with the continual loss of tens of thousands from that sector. A stark indication of this fact was that of 146,300 farmers in the State in 1998, only 43,300 were considered viable. Faced with the choice of a continuation of this process under the <i>status quo</i> or seizing the opportunity to bring about a reform that will guarantee a certain level of security and prosperity for small to medium size farms there was only one option. It is unfortunate that others chose to adopt a completely negative approach and this contributed to the lack of input into the final agreement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have to look at how the Common Agricultural Policy has served us. Who represented the tens of thousands of Irish farmers who have left the land? The family farm and the countryside has been decimated. We have argued that we had to approach this review in a positive and constructive way in order to do the best for those most in need, the small to medium size family farm. I am not worried about ranchers, those with hundreds of acres of land and those in the <Col N="1105" />&euro;100,000 income threshold in the farming community.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>Sinn Féin is concerned, and the Government and this House should be concerned, about those who are struggling to make ends meet and those who are struggling with bureaucracy trying to fill out forms and being penalised if they make a slight mistake. That is why we came out in favour of decoupling so that payments could go directly into the farmer's pocket. We advocated that when it was not popular in this House. We stood alone on it and make no apologies for doing so because the small family farmer has been neglected by those they chose to represent them. The small farmer has been decimated and little has been done to eradicate the cause of what is happening.</P>
      <P>I commend the Minister for having the courage to come in and put the proposal before the House. Sinn Féin supports parts of it. It is easy to be negative and critical all the time but what does it do for those who are struggling to survive and maintain a way of life. We have to look at the positive aspects and offer something constructive to the debate, otherwise we are not doing a service to those who elected us or those we purport to represent, the family farm, and the small family farm.</P>
      <P>In regard to modulation, parts of it are difficult. The position in regard to the dairy farmer is worrying and something will have to be done in a collective and responsible way to address the needs. Equally there are difficulties and problems for the young farmer entering the industry and we must try to find a way of ensuring they will have a livelihood that will sustain them and their families into the future. If we go down the road of attacking each other and trying to expose each other here in regard to the negotiations &ndash; I have said this in the House previously and at every IFA, ICMSA and ICSA meeting &ndash; collectively we are not singing from the same hymn sheet. That was a difficulty. We have to find a mechanism here where we represent those most in mind. That is the reason I give a qualified welcome to many parts of what has been negotiated. There are difficulties in other parts of it. I will be critical when it is constructive to be critical but not for the sake of making noise and seeking a headline in the newspaper because it is far more important to remember the ordinary people whom we represent. We represent the family farm and that is more important than seeking a headline in tomorrow's newspaper.</P>

      <P>I welcome the Minister back from the CAP reform talks in Luxembourg. This welcome is to reassure the Minister lest he got a different impression if he was listening to one of his Munster party colleagues on the &ldquo;News at One&rdquo; today.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1106" />Tonight's discussion takes place after the deed has been done. The CAP reforms have been agreed and this House has no power to change in any way the elements of the package agreed. This exercise therefore is, in a sense, a post mortem. Normally in carrying out a post mortem one has a body. The disadvantage this evening is that we do not have that body, nor do we have the fine details necessary to enable a definitive assessment to be made.</P>
    <P>One could take one element of the package and deem the whole deal a failure. One could, for political purposes, take a negative view in order to play to the gallery and bask in whatever benefits accrue from that stance. However, the package has many elements and facets and a balanced judgment needs to be made.</P>
    <P>There is no doubt that the dairy sector will suffer most from this deal. It is estimated that dairy farmers could experience a cut of one third in their incomes. This is disastrous for them. If any other sector of society was faced with such a drop in income there would be a revolution.</P>
    <P>One of the elements of the reforms which has most engaged people's attention throughout the negotiations has been the decoupling of direct payments from production. I welcome the outcome of the talks in regard to this issue. Some may say the outcome was a fudge or a cop-out but I disagree. In any EU negotiations it is a good outcome if there is agreement to allow individual member states tailor policies to their own requirements, as is the case on this issue. The various options agreed include provision for fully decoupling all payments. It also allows for a number of other options in regard to partial decoupling for cereals, beef and sheep meat.</P>
    <P>We need to simplify the present set up. We are now being allowed the opportunity to engage in constructive discussions and internal negotiations which will hopefully lead to an improved lot for Irish farmers. In my discussions with farmers in the west I have detected a fair degree of support for full decoupling. I therefore welcome this opportunity whereby other elements of disagreement are removed from the agenda in order that the debate can focus on decoupling and what is best for Irish farmers.</P>
    <P>It was important to have this mid-term review of the Common Agricultural Policy concluded before the WTO talks take place. With this agreement now in place the EU can enter those talks with a clear agenda, focused on securing a more favourable outcome for Europe.</P>
    <P>These discussions on the CAP reform agreement are taking place too early. It would have been more sensible to have deferred such a discussion until next week when more details would be available and when the impact of those details on the entire farming community could be fully assessed. I am not looking forward to the next few weeks where some Government backbench Deputies will no doubt do political somersaults in regard to this deal when the pressure comes from some sectors.</P>

When reform is up and running fully, will the &euro;34 million that will come into modulation come back to the Department of Agriculture and Food or will it go to the colleague of the Minister of State, Deputy Treacy, to spend on his clients in Galway tarring roads or whatever? Finally, the Minister's colleague, Deputy Ned O'Keeffe &ndash; I do not like referring to him too often because I notice that when we had a vote he voted with the Government but said something else on the public airwaves &ndash; said that the dairy measures would have a devastating impact on the Munster area where he said 40% of the milk is processed. I know that 25% of dairy cows in the country are from Cork and perhaps they produce 40% of the milk. Will the Minister tell me if his former ministerial colleague is right?</P>

      <P>It is a good suggestion that in a few weeks' time, when the entire document is studied and evaluated and we have received some clarifications still awaited from the Commission &ndash; there are some technical matters still to be ironed out &ndash; we could have a fuller debate. The committees of the House will continue during the summer although the House will adjourn next week. I and my two colleagues, Ministers of State, Deputies Aylward and Treacy, will be available to attend one of those committees for a fuller debate.</P>
      <P>I welcome the constructive contributions made by a number of Deputies in regard to this important matter. Decoupling, or the new arrangement for supporting agriculture, comes into effect at any time from 1 January 2005.

      <P>I have publicly stated a number of times, especially in the last few weeks, that it is my intention, when people have had time to study the outcome, when the technical details regarding ceilings, retention times and the various menus there for decoupling and partial decoupling and <Col N="1108" />the full impact of that is studied properly &ndash; I expect that will be in three or four weeks' time &ndash; I will sit down with the social partners, the farming pillar, and we will decide on a road map for the future development of agriculture.</P>
      <P>In regard to the WTO, Commissioner Fischler is of course only one part of the negotiations. Commissioner Lamy, because it is a trade round, will represent the Commission. Commissioner Fischler has given an absolute commitment that the reason for the reform of the Common Agricultural Policy now is to ensure we do not have to reform it again after the WTO talks. In other words, we are not going to pay twice for the reform of the Common Agricultural Policy. There will not be any further dilution of the CAP in the WTO round.</P>
      <P>We have got a good outcome to modulation. There is a need to invest on-farm and that is where the money will go. It is in the regulation that the money will go for various enterprises which are environmentally friendly and which produce high quality safe food.</P>
      <P>The dairy industry is extremely important and is the backbone of the agriculture industry. However, 50% of the milk produced in Ireland, which is converted into butter and powder, ends up in intervention. At the moment, 30% of the entire butter mountain has been created by Ireland. It is a cost to the taxpayer and export subsidies have to be put in place to finally dump this butter in some part of the world. As Deputy Upton said, there is no regard for developing countries in the use of export subsidies to get rid of it. There are 200,000 tonnes of butter in intervention at the moment. Commissioner Fischler and Europe are entitled to be concerned about the creation of a further butter mountain. It is incumbent on the processing industry to broaden the profile of its products. We are members of a community of 400 million consumers. That will be increased by 109 million from 1 January. That is over 500 million consumers&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;and yet, some people suggest we rely on the prop of converting milk into products, storing them in intervention at a cost and disposing of them to some unfortunate country which is trying to develop its own industry. This is not a reliable basis for the future of the dairy industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryUpton" hpid="Dr. Upton Dr. Upton">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Upton</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the Minister's last point regarding intervention. There are serious objections to producing a product and storing it, just for the sake of doing so, and drawing a subsidy on its account. It is all very well to state that we have access to intervention storage but does the Minister have any suggestions or ideas as to how we can change that system to stop these products being produced for intervention? What kinds of supports can be put in place for the dairy <Col N="1109" />farming community to allow it to develop alternative products? We must produce value-added and different kinds of products.</P>
      <P>There has been little commentary in regard to consumer prices. Consumers reasonably expect that there should be some account of the fact that we pay inordinately high prices for many of our food products. Does the Minister see any way in which those prices will be reduced or any other benefit to the consumer?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>In regard to weaning the dairy industry away from intervention, I commissioned the Prospectus study last year which produced its findings a couple of months ago. I have met with virtually all the co-ops in the last few weeks to tell them that they need to share facilities and engage in far more research and development. The Danish dairy industry invests more than twice as much in research and development as the Irish industry and it has a far better profile of products. Denmark is further away from the UK market, and yet it has no difficulties in that regard. Denmark objected to my call for greater input of butter into intervention, despite the fact that its industry is similar to ours. The Danish climate and industry structure is more difficult than Ireland's because the cows are indoors for several months of the year. Even so, the Danes are not screaming for a dependence on intervention.</P>
      <P>There is a structure in west Cork, which might be taken as an example, where four co-ops use one central processing facility &ndash; Carberry Milk Products. That company is doing a tremendous job in making a whole range of products, some as exotic as Ború vodka.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomHayes" hpid="Mr. Hayes Mr. Hayes">

    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>I could do with a swig of it myself.</P>
      <P>As well as that, Newmarket and Kanturk co-op in north Cork concentrate milk whey and send it to Carberry Milk Products. They share the facility. Another company called Shannonside is in casein production. It is in a central location and could be examined for opportunities to share facilities. There is no point in a multiplicity of dairies producing the same product in different locations. There must be a sharing of operations and a sharing of research and development. In Killeshandra some 30 years ago, John O' Neill was making UHT milk in jigger packs that ended up on every airline in the world and a whole range of products developed afterwards. It is some time since I read about or visited a plant that had a new process or product. We must get away from the industry's dependence on the intervention culture. Enterprise Ireland has a range of grant aids, particularly for research and development, available to the industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is always difficult to ensure that any support system is ultimately passed on to the consumer by way of lower prices. However, I hope that can <Col N="1110" />be the case as a result of this package. An ordinary farmer at present must have suckler cows or special beef in order to draw down grants. That notwithstanding they are substantial grants. For example, in the special beef, the farmer gets two &euro;150, two &euro;80 on extensification and another &euro;80 in slaughter premium. That amounts to &euro;540 before the farmer goes to the factory. He or she will now be able to get these grants in one single farm payment and can decide what he or she is going to do. For example, the farmer could decide to specialise in high quality Angus beef or Belgian blue beef for a particular market. That is the farmer's only outlet, therefore, he or she must have regard to what the consumer wants in terms of quality, food safety and animal welfare. Some farmers are now being paid &euro;1.10 for high quality beef by local butchers who specialise in high quality. There is no other way to go and we must continue in that direction.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomHayes" hpid="Mr. Hayes Mr. Hayes">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>I have already stated that the form of coupling or decoupling will be decided in consultation with the farming pillar of the social partners. We have myriad choices &ndash; we can have full decoupling of all payments across the board or alternatively we can have vertical decoupling. For example, we could have the ewe, special beef and suckler premia fully decoupled or have partial decoupling for some of them, with others fully decoupled. There is a range and flexibility. Therefore, it will be a matter of achieving consensus between the Department and the social partners as to the best way forward.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The position in regard to milk is that there is a 4% reduction in intervention support. There is no reason why that should be reflected in the price <Col N="1111" />of milk to farmers. It will only be so if the processors are dependent on intervention. If they are not, there is no reason why that should represent a loss. At any rate, it is made up with compensation to the tune of 81%, by way of a new dairy cow premium. </P>
    <P>I have already explained the position in regard to butter. However, the final outcome is that next year the 30,000 tonne limit is up to 70,000 tonnes, the following year, 60,000 tonnes and so on, down to 30,000 over a five year period. This is to give the Irish dairy processing industry a lead-in time in order to get away from its over-dependence on intervention. The ewe premium can also be fully decoupled.</P>
    <P>In regard to the general payments in support of agriculture, the Agenda 2000 payments are secured. They are doubly secured because they will avoid any challenge in the WTO because they are going from the blue box into the green box, which is extremely important.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>The value in direct payments is &euro;1.3 billion. This will result in an average 69% of farmers' incomes in direct payments. It is a matter for farmers then to make a profit. If one includes REPS and the farm retirement scheme, those payments go up to &euro;1.6 billion per annum. For REPS alone, over the next three years, there is &euro;1 billion available. It is also a tremendous scheme ensuring good farm practice and caring for the rural environment. I believe there is a degree of security and certainty, including the security of milk quotas until 2015, in the outcome of this package. This is a good package for Irish agriculture.</P>

      <P>For the first time I can remember, dairy farmers will sell milk ex-farm, <Col N="1112" />without the compensation, for 75 cent. I want the Minister for Agriculture and Food to stand up and deny that is right. The price today is 92 cent to 96 cent. As regards the compensation, there will be a loss of 80% &ndash; it accounts for only 9 cent to 10 cent. The farmers will lose at least 9 cent to 10 cent, but they will sell the milk at 75 cent. I want the Minister to comment on that.</P>
      <P>If one takes an 80,000 gallon farmer, he will lose &euro;7,200 net on the package the Minister brought back this morning. To go down that road is to break the backs of the dairy farmers of Ireland.</P>
      <P>The Minister talked about the overall intervention cut from 70,000 tonnes to 30,000 tonnes, but what he did not say is that it stands at 150,000 tonnes as we speak. That is where the huge cut is. Calf prices will fall and milk quota will be devalued, even though the Minister states it will be there until 2015 If we take this package in its totality, the Minister has nailed the dairy farmers of Ireland&mdash;</P>

      <P>In so far as decoupling is concerned, where is the saving if one partially decouples the special ewe premium? The inspectors will have to come out and inspect the sheep anyway whether one is getting the full or half premium. Has the Minister made up his mind about the red tape? He has not belled the cat. Ordinary farmers will see that in these reforms they are being sold out. Why the Minister did not stand up and walk out last night during the negotiations, I will never know. It was done years ago, with much better effect. The Minister for Agriculture and Food has let us down.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusKirk" hpid="Mr. Kirk Mr. Kirk">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kirk</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister for Agriculture and Food has negotiated well in very difficult circumstances. Those of us long enough in the House will remember the time when there was talk about food security at Community level. We are not talking about food security anymore but about a completely different policy within the CAP, taking account of the changes within the European and the wider global market.</P>
      <P>One issue that is relevant to my constituency is that of <i>force majeure.</i> Sheep farmers in the Cooley peninsula who were badly hit during the foot and mouth disease outbreak are clearly in a <i>force majeure</i> situation. How will individual farmers who experienced disease problems in the reference years be catered for? The reference years that are mentioned are 2000, 2001 and 2002. Is there any flexibility in that, particularly having regard to <i>force majeure</i> considerations?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Apart from the research and development provisions in terms of Enterprise Ireland, most <Col N="1113" />people accept that new product development is vital for the future viability of the dairy industry. Indeed it is much more relevant than much of what is being said here. If we can develop on that area, it will assure the future for the dairy sector.</P>
    <P>How tradeable will production rights be? Clearly, in the dairy sector, there is a dairy cow premium and it is important to bear in mind that it is based on the milk quota rather than the number of animals retained on the farm. My interpretation &ndash; I am subject to correction &ndash; is that this will be paid in a number of stages, to peak at a significant figure of 16 cent or 17 cent per gallon. At what stage will that kick in and will it, in turn, be decoupled? Will a minimum stocking density be required for the operation of the new regime, having regard to the new test rates that are going to kick in now? This gives individual farmers the opportunity and the freedom to farm.</P>
    <P>Can we anticipate that this package will stand the tests of the WTO negotiations? In that context, there is always the worry that there could be a dilution of what is involved in the package. As the package will be introduced on a phased basis in particular areas, what is the timescale for this?</P>
    <P>I congratulate the Minister for Agriculture and Food for his work. We do not fully appreciate the difficult circumstances in which he was negotiating. He did well in the circumstances.</P>

      <P>Deputy McHugh referred to the ICMSA statement on farm incomes. The incomes of dairy farmers are a matter for the dairy industry, particularly on the processing and marketing side. Dairy farmers have improved their operations substantially over the past decade with exceptional milking parlours. It is a pity that the processing and marketing side has not developed in parallel with this. Dairy farmers are entitled to the best return. The cuts that have been put in place in Agenda 2000 and the 4% cuts in this package are intervention cuts. They have nothing to do with the market. The sooner the industry gets closer to the market and gets a better return, the better. It is a large market in Europe with a population of 400 million, and in the new Europe it will be 509 million. Anyone can stroll down to a supermarket in Clondalkin or Ballinasloe and find dairy products from as far away as New Zealand.</P>

      <P>There are opportunities for our dairy industry in terms of supply. I have not heard what the ICMSA favours. It is easy to get out of bed in the morning and criticise a document before it is even run off the presses, but it is more difficult to say what one wants from these negotiations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Connaughton spoke about the milk industry and decoupling. If there is full decoupling for the sheep industry, that will remove the red tape. There will be an annual single payment. <Col N="1114" />If there is horizontal decoupling, with a ratio of 75:25 or 50:50, all the red tape will be retained.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaulConnaughton" hpid="Mr. Connaughton Mr. Connaughton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connaughton</NameTxt>
      <P>Exactly, so what?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>I will repeat for the third time that in a few weeks' time I will meet the farming pillar of the social partners and we will decide by consensus what route we will take. It is very easy to say we will opt for full decoupling across the board. When I hired FAPRI Ireland, the independent economic study group, to create models for full and partial decoupling, its findings suggested that there would be a 16% reduction in the suckler cow herd and a 5% reduction in sheep numbers. We need to retain a production base because if it is lost at any stage in a certain product area it is not possible to recommence production immediately four or five years later. Detailed studies and comprehensive discussions will take place with the social partners to ensure we get it right.</P>
      <P>Regarding the return from milk, even though reasonable progress has been made, more is needed. Let us make a comparison with Denmark. Average butter fat in Denmark is 4.3% whereas it is 3.75% in Ireland. The average protein in Denmark is 3.6% and is 3.25% in Ireland. There is no reason we cannot improve on that, although we are a long way from where we were ten to 15 years ago.</P>
      <P>I remember when the MacSharry reforms were introduced. Some people described him as Cromwell and burned effigies of him and so on. The same people reacted similarly to Agenda 2000. Almost every development that has taken place since we joined the EEC and Europe has been criticised by these people.</P>

      <P>Deputy Kirk raised a number of pertinent matters. Regarding <i>force majeure,</i> people in the Cooley Mountains who had to destock are entitled to consideration as a result. We have elicited important changes and modifications in regard to the reference years, 2000, 2001 and 2002. For example, if a young person inherited a farm in 2001 or 2002, the original proposals provided that the amount of direct support that farm received was divided by three over the three years. Now it is either divided by two if it is inherited for two years or not at all it is only for one year. That is very important.</P>
      <P>There are other technical matters, such as a farmer who has leased his farm in the context of the farm retirement scheme and is mid-way through. If a younger family member is waiting to take over the farm, he or she can inherit it and the single farm payment that goes with it. In some cases there is no family member to take over the farm and the question then is who qualifies for the premia rights. That is one of the technical matters that must be ironed out with the legal services in the European Union. The person farming would feel he or she would be entitled to the premium while the retiring farmer would say he had built the farm up over a lifetime and would be entitled to the premium. We do not want litigation like the Mulder case with milk quotas. We want to get it right.</P>
      <P>The issue of production rights, to which Deputy Kirk referred, is one of the other technical matters which are with the legal services. It will take a few weeks to decide how they will be traded. The dairy cow premium will remain coupled up to 2008 and there will be a review at that stage. I know all the farming organisations wanted it because they wanted support for active producers and farmers and that active farmers would be entitled to the dairy cow premium. There would be no requirement for stocking density in the context of full decoupling.</P>

      <P>&mdash;but the fact is that, since we joined the European Community, we have made it our business to stay close to French leaders, especially Jacques Chirac and the French Mini<Col N="1117" />ster for agriculture, because French farming is similar to Irish farming. We only have three votes out of 87 on the Council of Ministers and we need alliances. The alliance and partnership we have with France is extremely important to us. There will be no cut in the price of cereals and that is a good outcome.</P>
      <P>Regarding young farmers, we have negotiated a number of important concessions related to hereditary and trading rights, the take-over of farms, investment at a higher rate for younger farmers and a range of other areas. These concessions have been much appreciated.</P>
      <P>Deputy Johnny Brady also asked how soon sheep decoupling can be implemented. The answer is from 1 January 2005, but the decision on the best starting date will depend on the outcome of the negotiations with the social partners. The Deputy also asked about the terms of decoupling and the options facing farmers. There is a range of options and that was one of the successes of the outcome of the package. It took us away from complete dependence on full decoupling and gave us a range of opportunities.</P>
      <P>Deputy Kehoe talked about farm incomes. I was interested earlier to hear a not very large farmer say that his income would fall from &euro;22,000 to &euro;15,000. I thought the average income was already &euro;15,000 but I am glad to know it is &euro;22,000.</P>

We got rid of that and it is now either full decoupling or full coupling for the entire sheep subsidy.</P>
      <P>Deputy Deenihan asked about groups that are not in partnership.

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoynihan" hpid="Mr. M. Moynihan Mr. M. Moynihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Moynihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to speak on the Protection of Employees (Fixed-Term Work) Bill 2003.</P>
      <P>This legislation stems from an EU directive and across the European Union it has been recognised that the nature of employment has changed considerably and greater flexibility is needed in the workplace. Fortunately we have managed to avoid confrontation in meeting this challenge by developing a highly skilled, educated and motivated work force, and by utilising fiscal incentives we have enjoyed remarkable success in reducing unemployment.</P>
      <P>Many countries look to Ireland as an example. They are coming to the conclusion that regulations that are rigid and inflexible only lead to unemployment, stagnation and a lack of opportunity. There must be a genuine balance between regulation and freedom and this legislation achieves that balance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1119" />Employees want to see a balance struck between work and family life and want to be able to move from job to job with ease and we must ensure this is possible. Ease of movement between jobs offers the chance to improve and broaden skills. Long gone are the days when a 17 year old entered the work force and stayed in one job for life. Many people value security over anything else but there has been an acceptance that contracts enable us to see challenges and potential where once problems would have been envisaged.</P>
    <P>In this House we are all contract workers and this gives us a sense of urgency and purpose. Productivity can soar in a contract situation and contracts help to provide barriers against complacency and a jobs-worth attitude. There is no doubt that the combination of job satisfaction for fixed-term employees and increased productivity for employers were a major boon for the labour market in recent years.</P>
    <P>In the last ten years the work force has risen by 45% from 1.22 million in 1994 to 1.77 million in 2002 and the measures enacted in that time made a colossal contribution to this. Many of the new jobs are a direct result of a willingness to undertake contract work.</P>
    <P>This Bill, however, takes account of the rise in contract work and seeks to extend protection to employees in a manner that will not undermine the benefits that have accrued from such work. The EU directive seeks to improve the quality of fixed-term work by ensuring the application of the principle of non-discrimination &ndash; fixed-term workers must be treated no less favourably than permanent workers.</P>
    <P>The directive further seeks to establish a framework to prevent abuse arising from the use of consecutive fixed-term employment contracts. The Bill, which was inspired by the directive, seeks to fulfil its terms.</P>
    <P>One aspect of the Bill that is especially welcome is the extension of pay-in pension entitlements to fixed-term workers and the Government is to be congratulated for that. When there was no compulsory PRSI provision for pensions, some people disregarded advice and failed to avail of the opportunity to make payments and now those people are 65 years of age and find they have little or no pension. Our population is ageing and a serious situation could arise in years to come. Provision must be made for pensions and security in relation to health for older people.</P>
    <P>Fixed-term workers should be treated the same as comparable permanent workers with immediate effect in so far as pay and pension entitlements are concerned. This Government has already granted similar pay and pension entitlements to part-time workers under the Protection of Employees (Part-Time Work) Act 2001. Granting such entitlements to fixed-term workers will increase overall pension coverage levels, a goal of the new social partnership agreement. <Col N="1120" />There is a cost to the Exchequer but the value of the legislation will be seen in the consequent economic and social benefits that accrue. That will be particularly pertinent for the promotion of harmony in the workplace and fostering an environment open to innovation and dynamism.</P>
    <P>As women are more likely to be on fixed-term contracts between the ages of 25 and 44, this legislation will provide an excellent opportunity for them to accrue pension benefits. Most public representatives in this House and beyond will know of women who had been in employment, left that employment to rear their families and returned to the workforce only to find that because of the gap in their PRSI contributions they were not entitled to a full pension. This legislation will ensure that women get their pension entitlements.</P>
    <P>Another aspect of the Bill to be welcomed is the provision that fixed-term workers must be provided with a written advice by their employer of the criteria justifying the renewal of their contract of employment on a fixed-term basis.</P>
    <P>Section 10 expressly deals with the issue of successive fixed-term contracts for employees. In regularising the fixed-term contracts it might be seen that they could be used almost on a permanent basis but renewing them every three years. The upshot of this section is to ensure that in the event of a period of continuous service of not less than three years by a fixed-term contract employee, an employer may, in effect, renew a fixed-term contract only once. By the time this arises, I presume the employer will have some idea of the quality of the staff involved.</P>
    <P>I welcome the fact that, under sections 15 to 17, fixed-term contract workers who are concerned about their treatment by their employers will have recourse to redress through the rights commissioner service of the Labour Relations Commission in the first instance, on appeal to the Labour Court and a further appeal, on a point of law, to the High Court.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill, which is in the spirit of the partnership from which this country has done well over the past number of years.</P>
    <P>One issue on which employers throughout the country have expressed concern over the past number of years, and rightly so, is the cost of insurance. While I welcome the Bill, the insurance issue needs to be addressed to ensure that employment continues and employers do not become involved in the black economy or go outside the area of insurance. I welcome the opportunity of commending the Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMulcahyFF" hpid="Mr. Mulcahy Mr. Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank my colleague, Deputy Michael Moynihan, for sharing his time with me. We could easily underestimate the importance of the Bill but we should not do so because it is important new legislation. It must be seen in the context of a tapestry of legislation on labour and <Col N="1121" />workers' rights going back to 1967 with the introduction of the Redundancy Payments Act. It is not a coincidence that much of that legislation, the best of which was introduced in the early 1970s, coincided with Ireland's membership of the EEC, as it was then, now the European Union. The Bill before the House also implements a European directive of 1999.</P>
      <P>I would like to read into the record some of the legislation which has made Ireland the vanguard in terms of workers' rights. It includes the Redundancy Payments Act of 1967; the Minimum Notice and Terms of Employment Act of 1973; the Employment Agency Act of 1971; the Unfair Dismissals Acts &ndash; the seminal Acts &ndash; of 1977 to 2001; the Organisation of Working Time Act 1997; the Worker Protection (Regular Part-Time Employees) Act 1991; the Parental Leave Act 1988 and the Carer's Leave Act 2001.</P>
      <P>As somebody who practices as a barrister in the area of employment law, I am aware there are myriad rights which protect the worker from virtually every angle, including being capriciously dismissed or dismissed for reasons due to pregnancy. Part-time workers were protected in the 2001 Act. If my memory serves me correctly, the period a part-time worker had to be working was 18 hours per week and so on. We can be justifiably proud of the amount of legislation we have put in place to protect workers' rights.</P>
      <P>On a slightly philosophical level, in the area of workers' rights legislation there is always a fine balance to be achieved because a contract of employment is just that &ndash; a contract. Obviously the worker has certain rights including the right to remuneration, the right to be treated with dignity, the right to information and all the statutory rights. We must remember, however, that employers have rights also. Their right is that the workers they pay will perform the tasks for which they have been hired and that they will be diligent, honest, punctual and so on. We should not forget that it is a contract of employment.</P>
      <P>The Minister will probably agree that some countries in Europe have erred by going a little overboard on one side or the other. From what I know of the position in the United States, the balance is tilted far too much on the side of the employer. Employers in the United States can hire and fire with impunity whereas in some European countries it can be very difficult to fire employees under any circumstances. I would not support that. There is a fine balance to be achieved in that area. There are rights and obligations on both sides and they must be respected and enshrined in law. The Protection of Employees (Fixed-Term Work) Bill 2003 strikes that balance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I ask the Minister to clarify one detail. When the Bill went before the Seanad it was proposed that if a worker who had been in employment for a period of three years was offered another <Col N="1122" />contract, it would have to be a permanent one. It appears now that the period of time is four years. It may have been argued in the Seanad that a period of three years was too short and that four years was preferable. Somewhere in the region of three to four years is about right. A shorter period might have negatived the requirements of an employer and a longer period would have negatived the due entitlement of those seeking work.</P>
    <P>I notice there is recourse for an employee to go to the Labour Court and subsequently to the Circuit Court. Why was the Employment Appeals Tribunal, the EAT, an excellent institution of which I was once a member, not brought into play in the Bill? It would have made sense to provide for an appeal of a finding from the Labour Court to the Employment Appeals Tribunal, which would have been a less cumbersome and more cost-effective way for workers to remedy their rights. The EAT is an informal and successful tribunal where awards of costs cannot be made. It is a tribunal that workers and trade union representatives have felt comfortable with over time. Was there any reason the Employment Appeals Tribunal was not given a place in this legislation?</P>
    <P>I strongly welcome the Government's decision to include the concept of pensions in the Bill's definition of remuneration. I understand there was no binding legal obligation under the directive to introduce pension rights. The Government has correctly decided to do so as there is no reason those who benefit from the Bill should be excluded from pension provision.</P>
    <P>The State has been one of the main culprits in using fixed-term contracts. We have all heard of teachers or health service workers employed in temporary, full-time positions on contracts which are renewed from year to year without those workers ever being given the certainty of permanency. The Bill, therefore, remedies a problem partly brought about by the State.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to clarify whether the Bill's provisions will be retrospective. If someone has been in a temporary position for ten years, will he or she automatically qualify for permanent status, or will the provisions apply only to people employed on temporary contracts for three or four years after the Bill becomes law? They should be retrospective.</P>
    <P>A teacher who has been on a one year, fixed-term renewable contract renewed for the past ten years deserves to be made permanent immediately. I call on the Minister to ensure the Bill is retrospective and that those who have been denied rights for many years are given their due entitlements. The relevant temporary employees should be made permanent immediately on enactment of the legislation.</P>
    <P>All of us have been approached in our clinics by people complaining that they have been employed on a roll-over contract for many years and are suffering a disadvantage through not <Col N="1123" />being made permanent. These people would not be happy to learn they must wait for another three or four years to be given permanent status, especially as the directive is being implemented slightly late.</P>
    <P>I am delighted the Government has introduced the Bill. It is well drafted legislation which will do the job it sets out to do and add to an already rich and positive tapestry of law in the area of employment rights. I commend it to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPerry" hpid="Mr. Perry Mr. Perry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Perry</NameTxt>
      <P>I am delighted to speak on the Bill. The Fine Gael Party supports this overdue legislation which provides that a fixed-term employee shall not be treated less favourably than a comparable permanent employee in respect of his or her conditions of employment. Deputy Mulcahy discussed the rights of employees to have a contract of employment. It is equally important that contracts be two-way, providing a clear definition of the work of the employee and employer to be honoured by both parties. This is often difficult.</P>
      <P>Employees are frequently regarded as victims. It is important to note that the people who take the risks, hits and pressure in business are the employers. Even with the best intentions, matters do not always work out. I recommend that all employees receive a contract precisely defining their responsibilities. Unfortunately, too many employers do not clearly define the work they expect of their employees and contracts are only examined when litigation or unfair dismissals arise. IBEC and the Small Firms Association should recommend that their members issue contracts which comply with legislation and specify the obligations of the employer and employee in terms of the work they are contracted to do.</P>
      <P>The Bill transposes a European Union directive four years late. The area of employment law illustrates that membership of the EU has been positive for the country and employees. During the Nice treaty referendum campaign we debated the difficulties of Europe. This important legislation is one of the benefits of membership. Its main provisions prevent employers from continually renewing an employee's contract. Only one renewal will be allowed after a three year period, after which the employee will be considered permanent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As a businessman, Deputy Cassidy will be aware that jobs are no longer for life. In recent years, difficulties have arisen in the services sector. This is apparent from the number of visas and work permits issued and the number of people who have entered the country to work. Service and meeting the customer are of critical importance in tourism and at the coalface of business. Regrettably, the education system frowns on the céad míle fáilte, friendliness, commitment and customer care associated with the service sector. Jobs in the sector are perceived by parents as <Col N="1124" />part-time and somewhat demeaning for their sons and daughters and, as a result, are seen as useful only for filling gaps.</P>
    <P>I am a firm believer in the enterprise culture. The backbone of this economy was built by small companies, the people who from a small acorn grew a large oak. It is important we continue to encourage enterprise and consider employers as vital partners. We should never castigate them as a group, although there are obviously rogue elements whose activities I do not condone. It is paramount that employers adhere to the law and comply with the tax regime. Equally, it is vital that partnership is encouraged to promote development and growth.</P>
    <P>Small companies employing fewer than ten people provide the backbone of the economy, yet few incentives are offered to enterprises of this size. This role has been left to enterprise boards. Enterprise Ireland deals with manufacturing and development companies, while IDA Ireland deals with external companies. Our small towns and villages have been developed by people who started out small, but had a burning ambition to succeed. Unfortunately, they receive little or no encouragement under the current system.</P>
    <P>This issue closely ties into the objective of the Bill, which is to address the level of security offered to permanent employees. The success and sustainability of any job rests on the profitability of the company in question. In many cases, business owners are often the last and lowest paid. This is not a common perception and may not be believed by many. I know many business people who work 40-hour weekends, as opposed to 40 hour weeks. They take great pride in their work and many risks, which cost them sweat. Their families must also endure a great deal. While I do not wish to diminish the role of employees, it is critical that we take a balanced view.</P>
    <P>A contract worker cannot be discriminated against purely because of his or her status. If he or she is doing the same work as a permanent employee, no preferential treatment can be given to the permanent worker.</P>
    <P>People going into business can spend a fortune on equipment and machines, which are significant cost factors. The largest and most important investment a company operating in an open economy will make is in staff capable of doing the work required. Contract periods are, therefore, important as they allow employers to assess new employees. There should be a clear understanding when one signs a contract that one is entering a trial period in which one's capabilities as an employee are assessed. I have seen curricula vitae which are so good and well presented that one expects the person to be able to go straight to the moon. People do not always live up to expectations and their CVs are not always fully truthful. They may contain dubious references and this is why recruitment companies have been so suc<Col N="1125" />cessful. The selection process in which these companies engage is critically important because if an employer mistakenly takes on an unsuitable employee, it can have undesirable consequences. Deputy Cassidy would agree with me in this regard because the recruitment process involves a significant investment on the part of employers and, therefore, it is very important that they choose the correct candidate. The principle of selecting a suitable candidate applies not only to private companies but also to the public service. People should be able to do the job they are paid to do, just as employers are obliged to fulfil their contracts, because a successful company is about having a successful team. The Bill will help in this regard.</P>
    <P>An employer who contravenes the law can be taken to the rights commissioner who will adjudicate on the matter in question. If an employer fails to mend his ways, his employees may take him to the Labour Court and <i>vice versa.</i> This Bill is as good for the employer as the employee and we should not castigate employers or use them as fall guys. A culture exists whereby begrudgery is directed at those who are enterprising and creating wealth in the economy but we should acknowledge and encourage their risk taking and foster an enterprise culture. State organisations such as FÁS and the enterprise boards have a role to play in this respect.</P>
    <P>Deputy Cassidy is Chairman of the Select Committee on Enterprise and Small Business, which is doing a very good job addressing the issues of small companies. It is critically important that a man of his expertise hold that position in order to recognise sufficiently the difficulties companies encounter. These difficulties are mentioned daily and include high insurance and electricity costs. People often make comparisons with other countries in Europe but they do not take into account the huge stacked-up costs and operational charges that companies must pay in Ireland.</P>
    <P>Some concerns exist regarding bureaucracy and red tape. The Government should assure business people that these problems will not arise and stress the importance of compliance. It is important to note that the smallest businesses now have to employ a secretary just to comply with all the legislative requirements imposed on them. The legislation that applies to businesses should be kept simple and the red tape involved in the creation of employment should be kept to a minimum. Simple contracts would ensure that employees and employers knew exactly what they had to do, and there should be no hidden agenda.</P>
    <P>Deputy Mulcahy referred to the State and local authorities. It is quite disappointing that people taking up employment in the health boards have very short-term contracts. Their parents think they have long-term jobs only to find out that <Col N="1126" />they lose these jobs soon afterwards because of their short-term contracts. The employers have to operate totally within the law and cannot retain employees for one day in addition to the period specified in their contracts. I hope the Minister will take heed of this in the Bill and ensure that local authorities, health boards and State bodies are not in breach of any regulation. If we are to establish standards for the private sector, it is equally important that the public sector is fully in compliance with the law.</P>
    <P>Our present workforce is very different to that of ten or 20 years ago. There are now 294,000 part-time workers in the economy, representing 17% of the workforce. The idea of one's having a job for life is gone. Nowadays, people may carve out a career but they feel it is neither practical nor desirable to spend 20, 30 or 40 years working for the same employer or institution. To change is to live and most people like the idea of change. It is very much an American concept that people feel they can improve themselves in a job, but it is important.</P>
    <P>Let us consider pension entitlements. Insurance companies are promoting the concept of pension policies. Employers must promote the concept of pensions but it is unfortunate that they are not obliged by law to have pension schemes for their employees. Pensions are very badly catered for in both the public and private sectors &ndash; it is very much at the discretion of the employer whether to have a scheme. There should be a mechanism in the PAYE system to ensure that people who have served in employment all their lives do not end up without any allowance other than the old age pension. This is very important.</P>
    <P>Contract work is an attractive prospect for young people entering the labour market who are unsure whether they wish to pledge their entire working lives to a chosen profession. This no longer happens. Young people are so well educated that they want to go abroad to work and want to change careers. It is only right that they get the opportunity to do so. As they get older, they settle down, have families, buy houses &ndash; generally between the ages of 27 and 40 &ndash; and develop a greater sense of what they are doing in their lives. They look for security and pension entitlements. They have to consider the high costs of rearing families and of mortgages, etc., and it is important that the tenure of their employment be sufficient to provide job security.</P>
    <P>Some years ago, there was usually only one wage earner per household but now two or three members of certain families have jobs to maintain a high standard of living. Some families go on two holidays per year, own two cars and have high expectations. It is very common to compare one's lifestyle with that of one's neighbours and friends. In the past people were happy to go to a local beach on holidays once a year &ndash; they now want to go to Portugal and other places. The mass <Col N="1127" />exodus of holiday makers from the country demonstrates that expectations have changed. There is considerable pressure on people, particularly young people who are interested in fashion and want to buy designer brands. Never was there greater pressure on families than there is now and simple lifestyles are no longer evident. These factors have a bearing on people's desire for secure jobs.</P>
    <P>During the debate on the Intoxicating Liquor Bill this week, the Minister, Deputy McDowell, spoke about the difficulties associated with alcohol and the huge impact they are having on families. However, the problem is also having a huge impact on employers. The difficulties it causes bring themselves to bear on the employment contract. One must remember that Monday morning blues are a significant difficulty and contribute to the tension that exists between employers and employees. A massive commitment must be made by the licensed traders to police this problem. It is equally important that the overall contract should deal with those employees who are not doing their job, do not attend work on Monday mornings and have a sick head on Tuesday afternoons. This is making an impact, as the recent debate on the liquor licensing legislation testifies.</P>
    <P>This legislation is concerned with what Fine Gael believes to be the need for rights and responsibilities. For employers this means the right, enshrined in our democratic system, to run a thriving, successful business. Nobody suggests it would be possible to do this without the flexibility afforded by a system of contract work. In this context, partnership is important. It also means that a duty is owed to employees who have been in employment for a given period of time. I am sure that will be recognised by the majority of employers. Only the unscrupulous need be worried about the legislation. It is a good Bill.</P>
    <P>The rights and responsibilities of employees are also recognised. By allowing for an easier passage to the status of permanent worker, they will share in the duties and responsibilities of every permanent employee. In this way, both employers and employees win. Although the legislation might be four years overdue, its importance is undiminished because it places the contract of employment on a permanent footing. </P>
    <P>It would be difficult to argue against the broad thrust of the Bill. Section 7 provides that a fixed-term employee shall not be treated less favourably than a comparable permanent employee in respect of his or her conditions of employment. It is astounding that this should even be debated in 2003. Section 10 provides that the contract for a fixed-term employee may be renewed only once after he or she has been employed for a period of three years. I support this. It is unfair that somebody could work for a company for, say, 20 years and not know from one year to the next <Col N="1128" />whether he or she will keep his or her job. It is an insult to treat in such a manner somebody who may work for a company for all of his or her life.</P>
    <P>We live in a dynamic economy, but we are also civilised human beings. We must treat each other accordingly. I welcome the establishment of a rights commissioner who will adjudicate on alleged cases of contravention of the legislative provisions. I am also pleased that in cases where the rights commissioner cannot solve an impasse, provision is made for referral to the Labour Court.</P>
    <P>I congratulate the Minister of State for introducing what is a good Bill, albeit that it is late. The employment contract is a two-way process. It is equally important that recognition is given to employers and small businesses, who are the backbone of the economy.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DonnieCassidyFF" hpid="Mr. Cassidy Mr. Cassidy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cassidy</NameTxt>
      <P>Much has been covered in this debate. I agree with much of Deputy Perry's contribution. He is experienced in the business world. I welcome the Bill and compliment the Minister of State and his civil servants. It is a move in the right direction.</P>
      <P>I have been an employer since 1963 and I can testify that a company's biggest asset is its employees. A happy workforce is productive and a productive workforce gets results. I have always found that trust is the most important attribute between employees and employers. The Bill enhances the opportunity for trust to prevail.</P>
      <P>I welcome the provisions on accountability. Workers cannot be treated in a one-sided manner. They must be able to be accountable because if their employers do not succeed in achieving their goals, job opportunities will diminish. The day of the job for life is practically over and in the few areas where it prevails it is not as assured as it was 25 or 30 years ago. This has arisen because of global change. World markets are changing. For example, with a few exceptions, the products that were popular 30 years ago are no longer so. Some 80% of the businesses located 30 years ago on the principal street in the city, O'Connell Street, are no longer trading. It illustrates the massive change in trends, and is replicated across the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill affords the employee the opportunity to make a big impression and create an opportunity for himself or herself. As one who worked in the postal services for five years in what was known as a whole-time temporary position, I can identify with short-term employees and I welcome the opportunity the legislation affords them for the first time. The teaching and nursing professions have been mentioned, but the great friend of most people in the country was the postman calling to the door once or twice a week. In some rural parts of the country he was the only person somebody in the autumn of his or her career might see. Some 90% of them were never <Col N="1129" />appointed to permanent positions. They were always known as whole-time temporary appointments. At the time there was no such thing as the five day week &ndash; it was a six day week &ndash; nor the fine tarmac roads that now prevail. The roads then were most difficult.</P>
    <P>I commend Ireland plc, especially for the marvellous changes that have occurred since the 1960s as a result of the education system. The first-class contribution of the teaching profession must be acknowledged. The Bill will help and reward certain individuals for the significant contribution they have made to the success of the country and its achievements over the past 30 years.</P>
    <P>Since 1987 in particular, an enormous number of people have given employment and taken risks. At that time, the top level of income tax was 65%, the lower rate was 35% and a 2% health levy applied. We have come a long way since then and have achieved much. In 1987 the country probably had the highest income tax rates of any EU country whereas today we have one of the lowest. At that time, the banks charged interest at a rate of 19% while today rates are unimaginably low. Some home owners pay less than 3.7% on their home loans.</P>
    <P>Most of us employers have worked all our life to keep our business going, paying high interest charges. That was not confined to Ireland but was the order of the day across the world. It prohibited employers from reaching their full potential. Thankfully, our entry to the European Union and subsequent entry to economic and monetary union has provided us with a marvellous opportunity. Nobody thought we would be in such an advantageous position as one of the best performers in the western world and one of the top countries in the EU. The reward for the risk taker must always be acknowledged and the reward for the worker must always be protected. The Bill addresses this issue.</P>
    <P>I acknowledge the marvellous contributions of the community employment scheme and of those people who took part in them. I acknowledge, in particular, the contributions of those who cared for the less fortunate in our society and those members of our community with handicaps. It is wonderful to consider that during this week of the Special Olympics, the greatest single sporting event in Ireland during my lifetime. I congratulate everyone from the Taoiseach and members of the Government to the personnel at Croke Park, without whom the event could probably not have happened. I congratulate the 37,000 volunteers who have made it all possible by doing everything they can to encourage our athletes to bring them to where they are today. Also to be congratulated are the parents and those who are looking after everyone associated with the event. Travelling around Ireland has reminded me of the time His Holiness visited in 1979 and of the <Col N="1130" />effect An Tóstal had right across the country in the 1950s when I was a very young boy.</P>
    <P>We should not forget that we are presented with a marvellous opportunity and we should hold on to the idea of the volunteer and to the value of making a contribution in a voluntary capacity. Almost all of us became Members of the Oireachtas because of our total commitment to working in voluntary organisations, our commitment to communities and our commitment to the sporting life in the early part of our careers. There are no greater rewards than the community spirit engendered by community commitment and the value to a person of helping people to enjoy themselves, particularly by getting them involved in the sporting world to exploit their abilities fully. The Leas-Cheann Comhairle had a distinguished career as a sportsman before coming to the House and he will know that we were told a fit body meant a fit brain which gave one confidence. If one had confidence, one could move mountains. The Special Olympics and the commitment of the volunteers have rekindled everything we were taught during our early years in sport.</P>
    <P>The Bill before the House represents a major contribution by the Government which will cost &euro;50 million to implement. The Government has brought this legislation before us at an opportune moment. The various aspects of the Bill highlighted and discussed during this debate are to be commended. This week the Intoxicating Liquor Bill came before the House to be amended. When it came before the Oireachtas previously, I asked in the Upper House what time we would allow people to go to their beds to sleep. The opening hours permitted to various establishments did not allow people to participate in school, work or life in general. I am glad to see that amendments have been made to the Act.</P>
    <P>It is nice to see that pension rights are included in this Bill. All fair minded politicians will say that Deputy McCreevy has been an excellent Minister for Finance. The initial provision of &euro;50 million in this Bill is a move in the right direction. We should keep a watchful eye on this legislation to see how it progresses over the next year and if it needs further amendment, I will encourage the Minister to return it to the House. He is to be commended for bringing the legislation before us and I hope it receives a safe passage. I look forward to its early implementation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>The Protection of Employees (Fixed-Term Work) Bill 2003, which enshrines the 1999 EU directive, is acceptable to me as a socialist as far as it goes, which is not a great distance. In his opening statement, the Minister of State said there were 70,000 fixed-term contracts representing about 4% of the workforce. He made the point that the Central Statistics Office did not have a category for this type of worker and he made the welcome statement that this is to be corrected. Many trade unionists believe the figure of 70,000 is an underestimation of the true number, which is why we need access to accurate information in this regard.</P>
      <P>The stated aim of this Bill is to apply principles of non-discrimination with regard to fixed-term contract workers. According to the explanatory memorandum, workers on fixed-term contracts will not be treated less favourably than comparable permanent workers, which is to miss the point slightly. By virtue of being fixed-contract workers, this category of employee is vulnerable to discrimination. They cannot be considered to be on the same level as permanent workers in terms of their rights and status within the same workplace. It is a fact that categories of employers have a calculated policy to use the fixed-term contract system to suit themselves. While the title &ldquo;fixed-term contract worker&rdquo; sounds impressive, we are really speaking about a form of casual labour. It is true that we have moved on from the days of Jim Larkin when workers had to line up at the docks to be picked out by gangers according to their record of trade union militancy. Thanks to Larkin, Connolly and the ordinary, nameless men and women who fought for union rights, that day is gone but certain forms of exploitation are still with us.</P>
      <P>The casualisation of labour through fixed-term contracts is a part of that. Such contracts are used consciously by certain employers to keep workers in check. The workers are on tenterhooks for the extent of the contract, whether that is for six months, nine months or a year, as to whether they will be re-appointed. There is either an overt or an unspoken threat that they may not be re-appointed if their conduct is not suitable to the employer. That could mean anything from joining a trade union to expressing dissatisfaction with the rate of remuneration or the work conditions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is, unfortunately, an increasing phenomenon in our society. It is scandalous that fixed-term contracts are increasingly used in the public and semi-State sector. I assume the &euro;50 million for the implementation of this Bill is to deal with workers who are employed at present on fixed-term contracts in the semi-State or public sector. I hope I am right in that assumption. I know from experience that in the so-called prestigious parts of the public sector short-term contracts have been <Col N="1132" />increasingly utilised in recent years. That is disgraceful. Workers on fixed-term, generally short-term, contracts are in a vulnerable position. They have no long-term security of employment. A number of implications flow from that. Try to get a mortgage as a fixed-term contract worker. Even if one is on a reasonable level of pay, and that is often not the case, no bank or building society will give a mortgage on the basis of the good character of the fixed-term contract worker applying for the mortgage. The contract determines whether workers will be granted the right to take out a mortgage. These workers are at a serious disadvantage in many areas.</P>
    <P>It is quite contradictory that this legislation, which confers welcome extra rights, is the result of an EU directive because the trend on workers' rights is now in the opposite direction within the EU in crucial areas of life. This directive was issued in 1999 after, presumably, years of consideration. One wonders whether the same directive would be issued in 2003. There is an increasing trend within many of the important states of the EU to obliterate the concept of permanent, pensionable employment. I was amused by the contribution of one of the Deputies who participated in this discussion. He castigated the left in this country for its opposition to the Nice treaty on the basis that the EU is a champion of workers' rights, as this Bill proved.</P>
    <P>However, the current thrust of EU policy is in the opposite direction. A number of EU states are, in a calculated way, reversing the gains that have been made in terms of workers' rights and they are doing so in a brutal fashion. Take, for example, the issue of pension rights, which is mentioned in this Bill. In France there is a calculated assault, led by the French Prime Minister, Mr. Raffarin, on the pension rights of the French working class. Whereas now a French worker will qualify for full pension after 37.5 years, the Government wishes to extend that to 40 years. That should immediately set alarm bells ringing for workers and the trade union movement in this country. This process is not just confined to one country in the EU but is happening in many others and, inevitably, pressure will be brought to bear on the pensions area in this country as well.</P>
    <P>This must be seen in the context of what has happened over the last 200 years. During that time working people had to struggle incessantly for some of the rights they currently have. The struggles were probably never more bitter than when they were about the length of the working day, the working week and the working year. Throughout the history of the labour and trade union movement and of the working class, workers sacrificed their lives for these principles. The eight hour day was not granted out of the munificence of the hearts of the employers in this or any other country but as a result of bitter struggles by the organised working class in those <Col N="1133" />countries. In the annals of the American working class, for example, we encounter the same history. The famous Haymarket Martyrs were victimised for participating in major protest and strike movements for the eight-hour day. They were victimised, framed and hanged by the state. Incidentally, many of these workers were immigrants from Europe.</P>
    <P>Perhaps the Minister of State will outline the position of immigrant workers in this country <i>vis-à-vis</i> this legislation. Where do they stand in terms of the extra rights conferred by this Bill? Do they figure in the equation? They are the supreme example of the fixed-term contract.</P>

      <P>I am glad to hear it. However, let us see how it works out. They are imported into this country for a 12-month contract period. If the contract and the work permit are renewed and they qualify for permanency as envisaged under the provisions of this Bill, are they granted an indefinite work permit by the Government? Perhaps the Minister of State would clarify that. This is an alarmingly exploited sector of the workforce. Unfortunately, it is not sufficiently outed because of the vulnerable position those workers occupy. We should note, and the Government should note, the storm of opposition in country after country in the EU to the plans to cut back on workers' employment and pension rights. Two million workers went on strike in France on 13 May, and in Austria, Spain and other countries there is a great deal of opposition to these plans.</P>

      <P>EU-based multinational corporations and their lobby groups are applying serious pressure to the structures of the EU and the European Commission to cut back on the pension and other rights of workers. Deregulation and liberalisation are the flavour of the times. It is interesting that IBEC, the employers' organisation, criticised precisely the fact that pension and remuneration provisions of fixed-term contract <Col N="1134" />workers were included under the scope of this Bill. In this, they are in complete sympathy with their counterparts in Europe who are trying to thwart and take away such rights as exist because globalisation is dictating to them.</P>
      <P>The dominance of multinational companies of ruthless, faceless employers who want to strip away as many rights as they can for the maximisation of profits for themselves and their shareholders is sacrificing workers' rights. This is the key to understanding that in 2003 we have the phenomenon of an attempt to turn the clock, as far as workers' rights and entitlements are concerned. I warn the Minister that it will not be possible to do this because he will face strong opposition when he moves to introduce the same measures in this State as are being adopted in other countries.</P>
      <P>I received an interesting submission from the free legal advice centres on this, as I am sure did others. I hope that the Minister of State and his Department also received it because it makes some good points as to how the Bill should be strengthened, even within its present confines. The comment on the written statement from employer to employee in section 8 is valid. It suggests that whereas in the Bill the employer is to provide the contract &ldquo;as soon as practicable&rdquo;, these words should be replaced by &ldquo;in advance of the commencement date of the contract&rdquo;, and that should be the case. It should be set down in black and white when the contract is being agreed upon and granted.</P>
      <P>Subsection 2 of this section obliges an employer, when renewing fixed-term contracts, to inform the employee in question of the objective grounds justifying the renewal of the fixed term rather than the offer of a contract of indefinite duration. This is in the nature of an information provision only and there does not seem to be a corresponding right for the employee to challenge this decision if he or she is unhappy with the explanation provided by the boss so the suggestion, therefore, is that the legislation should confer a specific right on the employee to bring a complaint to a rights commissioner if he or she is unhappy with the explanation offered as to renewal of fixed term contracts.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Finneran</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister of State to the House and compliment him on bringing forward this important legislation, which is a protection for workers. As a former Minister and <Col N="1135" />Minister of State, Deputy Fahey has a long and proud record as regards his response to issues, social or otherwise, and his time in the Oireachtas as an elected representative has been fruitful and supportive of many areas covered by what would be considered to be social legislation. Tonight we are dealing with the Protection of Employees (Fixed-Term Work) Bill 2003 which will put in place protection for people who are on fixed-term contracts.</P>
      <P>The legislation is clear in its intent. Although it is the result of an EU directive it is fashioned here in a way that fits into the Irish practice of social partnership and it protects workers in so far as fixed-term workers must be treated no less favourably than comparable permanent workers. This is the most important aspect of the Bill and is its clear intent. The Bill will remove discrimination where this exists. The other important point is that a framework to prevent abuses arising from the use of successive fixed-term employment contracts is to be established. Those three aspects alone will be an insurance for people who are in fixed-term employment, once this legislation is put in place.</P>
      <P> We have come a long way since the day of the spailpín fánach who stood at the corner where the landlord employed him. If it rained the landlord told him to go home at lunchtime and when night fell, he gave him a few pence for the work he had done during the day. There was no cover for sickness or holidays; one had only to serve the landlord when that was required and stay away when it was not. The same applied to all the fine young men who worked in the cities of England in particular, in London most of all, who stood in line in Kentish town or Camden town waiting for the Grey Murphy or the Green Murphy or Lowry or somebody else to come along and pick out one in every three on the basis that he would deliver a good day's work. Many of those who stood in line were desperate for the money as they could not get a full-time job. In some cases they had to get a substitute at 10 o'clock to get their breakfast. This legislation is important but we should not forget all of those young Irish men and women who had to work in atrocious conditions without any protection down through the centuries.</P>
      <P>We have come a long way over the years with the legislation enacted up to now, the minimum notice and terms of employment, the payment of wages, the safeguarding of an employee's rights and transfer of undertakings, the protection of young people at work, safety, health and welfare, redundancy legislation, minimum wage entitlements and the protection of part-time workers. Those are examples of legislation passed by successive Governments. When I looked through the list earlier this evening, I saw that 90% of it was enacted by my party.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1136" />There are of course other matters that should be mentioned here, for example, the concept of the social partnership that has taken us from the strife of the 1950s and 1960s, with the loss of all those working days and all that production owing to there being little or no understanding between employer and employee &ndash; nor was that promoted. The concept of social partnership was introduced some years ago by my party and has existed since. It has proved the test of time. During my time on the consultative council of the European Commission some years ago, many of the other European Ministers with responsibility for labour were in awe of social partnership in Ireland. They would dearly have loved to have it in their countries. Our template or prototype has been worked on in many European countries and is in place in a few. The success of the social partnership supported and implemented by successive Governments is to be commended and spoken of in glowing terms. This country would not have achieved the current prosperity and levels of employment or production had it not been for social partnership.</P>
    <P>In 1993-94 there were around 1.1 million or 1.2 million people employed in this country. Today the figure is 1.8 million. Some 300,000 of those workers are part time, and I understand that there may be up to 100,000 on fixed-term contracts. It is important that what legislation we have in place is recognised, but that we also move on to new situations. The situation in which we find ourselves today is one where fixed-term contracts are increasingly becoming part of employment concept and practice. If that is the case, we must ensure that there are no abuses. We want legislation in place to protect those in that category. I compliment the Minister for introducing this legislation to do just that &ndash; bring in protection for people on fixed-term contracts.</P>
    <P>We would be foolish to ignore the fact that employers need a flexible workforce. That is understood and expected and is part of the way that production, employment and employee/employer relationships are today. If a flexible approach and fixed-term contracts are needed, we must legislate for that. That is what we are doing here, and I compliment the Minister on it.</P>
    <P>The biggest downside to fixed contracts hitherto has been that there has been very little if any protection &ndash; perhaps in some areas but certainly not to the necessary extent. There was nothing of substance regarding pensions, which are so important today. The whole Government thrust is towards people making provision for their pensions, and the Government is to be complimented on the scheme which it introduced recently whereby people can invest in their pension voluntarily under the PRSA system. I do not know what the uptake on that is yet, but I would be surprised if it were not significant. The Irish <Col N="1137" />people seem to respond to opportunities that present protection and comfort for them and their families. I remember being in the Oireachtas when the special savings scheme was initiated. It is interesting to read some of the comments made in the two Houses at that time. Some of the people, I am sure, will wish that they had not made those statements.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Finneran</NameTxt>
      <P>He did not say that he did not, either. He will get his money back, at least. The important part is that 1.1 million people in this country availed of that scheme. It set a new concept that was needed so that young people &ndash; and people generally &ndash; would start to save again. We had moved from a situation where it had been indoctrinated into people that they should go to the post office to save, putting in a few pounds or whatever. The important thing was not how much one put in but that one set up that trend in one's life, starting with £5 or £10 or whatever the sum was. For one reason or another, that had disappeared from Ireland in the 1990s. Deputy McCreevy, as Minister for Finance, and the Government in general, took a brave decision. It is costly to the State, but one should remember that it is only our money returning to us to be available to this country again. It was not thrown away, wasted or gambled. It is being made available to the people themselves. While that is important and positive, the fact that we were able to start people on the savings road, thinking how important it was to do that, was vital.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the area of fixed work contracts, I do not think that any group has suffered more or been in greater danger than the women of this country. Over the years, contract workers who were the victims of not having proper protection were women. It suited them to take short-term or contract employment, and they were at the whim of their employers. I am glad for them alone that this legislation is being introduced. They have been the backbone of much of the development that has taken place in this country over the years. It is they who have got the children out of school and who have held homes together. They have made all the effort towards making Ireland what it is today, for if one does not have a base at home, one has neither employment nor social life. For various reasons, women have had to take <Col N="1138" />contract employment, and there has been little or no protection for them, but now the Minister and his legislation have provided that.</P>
    <P>Another area by which I am impressed is that of enforcement. Over the years we have seen where inadequate or poorly thought out legislation has been put on the Statute Book. One hears the excuses that it is hard or impossible to enforce or that there are problems with enforcement. Then somebody suggests further legislation is needed. I have always been of the opinion that legislation should be enacted and enforced before introducing new legislation. Too many Bills have been put through this House and the other House and enacted.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomHayes" hpid="Mr. Hayes Mr. Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFinneranFF" hpid="Mr. Finneran Mr. Finneran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Finneran</NameTxt>
      <P>The media, those outside and even those who saw it through the Houses have criticised it afterwards as being inadequate but in most cases the simple fact is that it has not been enforced. If legislation is enforced and found to be inadequate then we should amend it. However, we should not amend it on the basis that it has not been properly enforced. I see that as a problem in regard to under-age drinking and problems on the streets at night. Sometimes the Opposition may say the resources are not available to enforce it. I am not sure if that is the case but it may be a question of the proper placing of resources and about attitude towards the problem.</P>
      <P>I am of the opinion where workers' rights are concerned that there will be enforcement because the trade union movement is there to take it to the Labour Court. Our social partnership agreements would not have survived the test of time had it not been for the labour laws. Social partnership involving employers, Government and farmers is a good idea and would possibly work if everybody stayed with it. In the event that what has been agreed is not put into practice, there must be checks and balances, such as the Labour Court, on labour laws. In this case we are talking about labour laws and the trade union movement being involved and having a say.</P>
      <P>In the area of multinationals we have to be careful while ensuring that workers' rights are protected. Many of them are not interested in representation from the trade union movement. I do not have a problem with that provided they deal with matters in a way that is transparent and that the overall workforce accepts the practices laid down in the agreements. If, however, sections of the workforce in some of the large corporations or major plants are abused I would be concerned. When replying perhaps the Minister of State would tell the House if there are protections in place for such groups in multinationals? I assume there are protections but it is an area about which I would be concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1139" />I welcome the legislation and compliment the Minister of State and the Government on bringing it forward. Looking back over 30 years of involvement with the EU there are those who would say there are too many EU directives and that too much of our lives is controlled by EU directives, that there is too much bureaucracy, form-filling and so on. On balance the EU has been supportive and has made a positive input into people's lives, particularly those of workers. It is one other step along that road and one that will be welcomed by workers generally. It is a protection for some 100,000 fixed-term contract workers.</P>
    <P>I commend the Bill to the House.</P>

      <P>It was amusing to hear Deputy Finneran claim the success of 90% of progressive social employment legislation for Fianna Fáil Governments. While it may be technically true that Fianna Fáil would have been in Government when some of the legislation was introduced, it is stretching it to say it was introduced by such Governments.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelFinneranFF" hpid="Mr. Finneran Mr. Finneran">

    <Speaker pid="DanBoyle" hpid="Mr. Boyle Mr. Boyle">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boyle</NameTxt>
      <P>I will let the Deputy know exactly from where I was coming. My recollection is that much of this legislation did not exist in an Irish parliamentary form until the 1970s. Practically all employment legislation has been introduced on foot of an EU directive. We should be grateful for our membership of the European Union for achieving such progressiveness. It is not in order for any one political party to claim a monopoly, or a near monopoly, on introducing progressive change in Ireland. It is fair to say that the first tranche of progressive employment legislation was probably introduced during the coalition Government's term of office from 1973-77 under the then Minister for Labour, Michael O'Leary.</P>
      <P>Another EU directive is now being transposed into Irish legislation. As a 1999 directive, it is coming before the House much earlier than many other directives. The trend in the past has been for many Irish Governments to drag their feet on transposing these directives into Irish law. For example, another directive which seeks to introduce the Protection of the Environment Bill 2003 into Irish law is of a far older vintage. At least this Government appears to be quicker at introducing some legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The problems regarding fixed-term work and short-term work need a legislative response. My party would be supportive of the limited moves that come through this legislation as a necessary addition to the rights of those who find them<Col N="1140" />selves in such employment conditions. When the Irish economy was achieving higher growth rates and creating many jobs, there was an assumption that all the jobs being created were of the highest quality, highest security and highest forms of payment. That was not the case, and the figures mentioned by the Minister in his Second Stage speech, indicate that almost 300,000 are involved in part-time, short-term work of one form or another. That indicates that we have allowed to develop within Ireland a casual economy. My fear is that a casual economy serves only the needs of a casual society and the Government needs to be aware of these trends.</P>
    <P>In my employment record I have never been in employment where I had fixity of tenure. That has nothing to do with my short fuse or my ability to operate any employer's instructions. I happened to work largely in the State system as a community worker, a youth worker and a social worker under contracts defined by time and contracts which were dependent on funding. Many in our economy exist under such conditions. Between employment positions there were also difficulties in terms of periods of unemployment. While the Bill is welcome I would prefer if it was part of a co-ordinated approach. I am also my party's spokesperson on social and family affairs.</P>
    <P>One of the areas this Bill needs to address is the issue of a tie-in regarding what is done with people's social welfare entitlements in the periods between fixed-term contracts. From my own experience between periods of employment, where I was not receiving any form of welfare for periods of up to three months because the time a contract would finish was not convenient in terms of a calendar year, I found that the required number of stamps would not be earned for the period in question. I suspect there are thousands of people in the country who have similar employment records. I hope the Government, in addressing the wider issue, will look at that. It is another example of what we refer to on this side of the House as the lack of joined-up thinking. It is all very well to introduce piecemeal reform but we must look at the wider picture. This area is something the Government has chosen or has not been willing to examine.</P>
    <P>In terms of the narrow definition of fixed-term work, what is being proposed is welcome. The Minister, in his speech, referred to the lack of statistical information and hopes for better information provision in the future through the Central Statistics Office which will properly define how many people are involved in this category. There are others who are in part-time, short-term work categories who will not be affected by this Bill and there is a need for legislation in this area also.</P>
    <P>I find it ironic that this Minister is introducing the Bill considering that one of my periods of employment over the past number of years was <Col N="1141" />as a FÁS community employment scheme supervisor. If anything typifies the nature of part-time, short-term employment it is the use of and the history of the community employment schemes. Of course the category of workers involved in them will not be affected at all by this Bill. There are thousands of those people in our labour market and in society.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaulKehoeFG" hpid="Mr. Kehoe Mr. Kehoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kehoe</NameTxt>
      <P>The FÁS workers are all gone.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanBoyle" hpid="Mr. Boyle Mr. Boyle">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boyle</NameTxt>
      <P>Almost, but some live on. Given the nature of employment trends, the need for community employment schemes will be greater in coming years than in the past. The schemes were community supports and never really employment schemes. We have had that argument in the House previously and will continue to have it in many other debates.</P>
      <P>In regard to fixed-term work, part-time or short-term work, the categories of people most affected are younger people &ndash; people in first-time employment, people from 16 years of age to mid and late 20s. They are largely women and increasingly, given the changing nature of Irish society, they are non-nationals with residency status.</P>
      <P>My fear regarding the legislation can be expressed in the same manner expressed by other speakers. Having the legislation is one thing but having the ability and willingness to enforce it is something else. The Minister stressed the involvement of the social partnership in this process. Social partnership has served the country well but it is no panacea to solving all the problems of our society.</P>
      <P>Social partnership is not fully representative of Irish society or of the reality of Irish economic life. The trade unions and employers' groups which have influenced, through consultation, this piece of legislation do not represent many of those who will be affected by it. Many of these workers are non-unionised and many continue to work in employment situations where their employment can be threatened or terminated through any number or manner of means. While this Bill is a welcome step towards ensuring that threat does not exist to the extent it used to, the threat will not disappear. Those threats are most pertinent in terms of the employment conditions of many non-nationals. Many of the jobs referred to are of a menial nature, in the service industry and have low pay.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanBoyle" hpid="Mr. Boyle Mr. Boyle">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boyle</NameTxt>
      <P>This is the reality. The Minister of State has been informed of this by youth organisations. The answer is simple. The legislation has been on the books for many years but the Government does not have the resources to put in place an enforcement network. The number of inspectors in regard to that legislation is derisory. It makes the legislation ineffective and I fear the same will happen with this Bill.</P>
      <P>It is not only a duty of a Government to introduce legislation which is workable, effective and fits the criteria of social justice but there is an ongoing responsibility on the Government to ensure the resources are provided to ensure legislation is workable. I do not see that in the history of this Government.</P>
      <P>I mentioned three particular categories about which I am concerned, namely younger people, women and non-nationals. I wish to concentrate now on the role of women in fixed-term employment, part-time and short-term work. The difficulty that many women have had, aside from being engaged in low security, low paid jobs, is that the work has an enormous effect on family life and, subsequently, on community life. The type of employment in which many women are engaged affects decisions on whether to have a family because of difficulties regarding maternity leave and payments. This will be addressed to some extent in the legislation but will the resources and the desire to ensure that the necessary support is available be addressed? Not only must this be done in the Minister of State's Department, it must happen across the range of Departments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to see legislation introduced in this House that has more than one Minister's or one Department's name on it. I would like to see legislation that makes a reality of the idea of joined-up Government, which would look at the gaps and try to fill them. There is too much empire building in Departments. Each one measures success in terms of the number of pieces of legislation it can get through, the number of staff it employs and the size of its budget. The <Col N="1143" />role of Government and Departments should be to work on behalf of the people. This Government has shown itself to be more selfish than most.</P>
    <P>In regard to the role of the European Union in this directive and to where European policy is going, it is unfortunate that the directive which was to be put in place regarding temporary workers with agencies has collapsed at European level. A new draft is now under discussion. We needed that regulation to help us have a better and broader Bill. If this directive is eventually agreed &ndash; probably in 2004 or 2005 &ndash; and we follow the timescale the Government tends to follow, this House will not see any legislation in terms of temporary workers until 2009 or 2010. This is a long process but it is the reality.</P>
    <P>This is a 1999 directive and it has taken four years to produce this piece of legislation. If we are only at draft directive stage now regarding agency workers, the directive will only come into force in the next couple of years. On the Government's timescale, it will take another four to five years to bring forward legislation in this House. This is a piecemeal approach to the rights of all people who find themselves in temporary, part-time or short-term work and is another sign that the Government has missed an opportunity.</P>
    <P>There are some provisions in the Bill which deserve congratulations and to which we can look forward. The raising of fines to a more realistic level is welcome and begs the question as to why they were so low for so long. I realise this is something the Government intends to tackle in a fines Bill which would index-link fines of this nature. When fines are at such a derisory low level, the incentive does not exist for employers to engage properly with employment legislation. Deputy Joe Higgins said that there are too many employers in the economy who will abuse workers in whatever way they can if they get the chance. The abuses are usually in the area of length and types of working conditions and pay, and it does not seem to matter what legislation is in place.</P>
    <P>It could be argued that the reluctance to put in place proper resources and bring about effective enforcement of this type of legislation is because of the relationship the Government parties have with employer bodies and prominent employers. We do not have a balance in terms of enforcement of rights. The people most affected by not having the rights that exist enforced are the socially disadvantaged. This is why much of what Deputy Finneran said is laughable in its content and untrue in its form.</P>
    <P>In summing up, the Minister of State needs to tell us where he sees employment legislation going from here. Does he see the Government coming up with ideas in its own right to identify the areas that still remain for many people in the <Col N="1144" />labour force in terms of having their working conditions improved? Will the Government wait for the EU to come up with directives in several areas and wait for the process of drafting a Bill to come into being again? If it does so, it will be serving the needs of workers badly. It has a special responsibility to recognise that the people most in need of this legislation and having their rights enforced are not those who are being represented.</P>

      <P>The Government has presented a Bill to the House which has not come from its own resources or philosophical base. It is filling up the time of the House which would be better served if it were to come up with a more all-embracing Bill. Some rights will be improved in this Bill. However, other rights need to be defined and protected and other Bills need to be brought before the House. I do not have the confidence that they will come before this Dáil. I hope that the informed debate that will follow on Committee and Report Stages will highlight some of the areas on which the Government can act.</P>

      <P>I welcome the Minister of State and this Bill to the House. With regard to the exchange between Deputy Boyle and the Minister of State about the rights and responsibilities of employees, conditions are not as bad as they were years ago. I disagree with Deputy Boyle in that if a person is being abused in the workplace, <Col N="1145" />he or she will now know his or her relevant rights and will contact the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment or his or her local representative. People have contacted me in this connection and in my subsequent representations to the Department, I found the officials more than helpful on occasions, for which I thank the Minister of State. It is important that when a young person is starting out in a workplace, he or she is treated correctly and not abused in any way. I welcome the Government's legislation to protect younger workers in order that they enjoy proper pay and hours.</P>
      <P>It is up to anyone in employment to report the matter if he or she is being abused. This Bill is long overdue. It will give people security, which is important because I have experience of workplaces with no sense of security. Deputy Perry spoke earlier about security, in particular with regard to young people, and the need to make sure they are well looked after. Some 70,000 people will benefit from this Bill, which is a good thing. Deputy Finneran referred to the Bills which pass through the House but are not enacted. In that context, I hope this Bill is enacted straight away because it is there for the protection of many workers.</P>
      <P>Local authorities, health boards and the State in general have been abusers in not giving employees full-time contracts. I understand that local authority employees work on a year-to-year contract, which is unfair. Wexford General Hospital is one of the few that does not employ agency nurses. The nurses who are employed there work on a year-to-year contract, or not even that &ndash; they work on a part-time/full-time basis. These nurses are not appreciated and some of them have contacted me to tell me what is happening. They are called at 8 a.m. and asked to be in work for 9 a.m. That type of situation gives no sense of security to people who have, perhaps, spent many years in college training for their job. However, they are not getting the respect and security they deserve. There are many agencies which will take on nurses, a point to which Deputy Perry referred earlier. This Bill should give people like these nurses a sense of security and stop the abuses that are being perpetrated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is disappointing for a worker to be in a workplace on a part-time basis. When I left college, I did not go into any workplace to be there on a part-time basis. Rather, I wanted to be a full-time employee, which I hopefully will be in this job for a few years more. I like to see people trying to move up ladders from one company to another. Few people remain in their workplace for long these days if they are able to move. For example, accountants can move up the ladder to other companies. People are mobile, and fair play to them. I admire anyone who is trying to move up any ladder in life and gain a better position in any job. When a person goes through the education <Col N="1146" />system, he or she is trying to do something to better himself or herself and it is good that people have the opportunity to move. The same opportunities are not there that were there years ago. People do not have many opportunities to move on but hope they will in future.</P>
    <P>I urge the Minister to create better working conditions for people. When people are not in employment for a long time, they do not get the benefits of permanent workers, and that is disappointing. I spoke earlier of some people in this country abusing the contract system. I have worked in many jobs and was once a manager in the forestry sector. The sort of situation which arose there was mentioned by Deputy Finneran. If it was a wet day or if it became dark, the workers were sent home. This happened years ago.</P>
    <P>Deputy Cassidy spoke about postmen. With regard to companies like An Post, the ESB and other State-run companies, we were always told that they offered jobs for life, but they no longer do so. We all want to see people enjoying their rights, and job security is a great thing. All employers have responsibilities and must look after their workers. If they do not, they should not be allowed continue as employers.</P>
    <P>I am critical of this Bill in so far as it was not introduced years ago. I realise we have gone through boom years, but the relevant EC directive should have been implemented in 1999. One has to consider the rights of employers too because they are the people supplying jobs. The employee is not always right, and neither is the employer, but the legislation must protect both.</P>
    <P>I welcome the rights commissioner. He or she can judge cases and if a decision cannot be reached, the issue can be taken to the Labour Court. It is important that we have the commissioner so that employers can enjoy protection at all times.</P>
    <P>When I worked as a manager in a private company in the forestry service, I noticed that the amount of red tape which the employers had to deal with was unbelievable. I would like to see the Minister of State, Deputy Fahey, looking into this matter. The employer is providing a service in employing people but has to deal with red tape which is becoming more prevalent than in the farming sector, where it has gone out of control. The Minister for Agriculture and Food, Deputy Walsh, told us in the House this evening that the red tape is gone in that sector, but I do not believe so. The more red tape there is, the worse the situation becomes. Perhaps the Minister, Deputy Fahey, will raise this issue with the Tánaiste, Deputy Harney.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill, which provides the security and respect deserved by all our workers. I trust it will not be delayed in its passage through the House. It is a shame the EC directive was not implemented in 1999 as it should have been, but <Col N="1147" />nevertheless I commend the Bill to the House, as does Fine Gael.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomHayes" hpid="Mr. Hayes Mr. Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Fahey, to the House. I am glad of the opportunity to speak on the Bill. Because of the downturn in the economy and the escalating costs, there are major challenges to be faced to ensure that we remain competitive as a country. For that reason it is important that reasonable conditions of employment exist. It is important too that the respective entitlements of employers and employees are clearly set out. There is no doubt that we lost some competitive advantages in the past year, but this is not entirely due to the Government's inaction. There are many other causes.</P>
      <P>Rising insurance costs are probably the principal reason for the loss of many jobs in small industries. I cannot repeat often enough that huge insurance costs are a burden on employers. The Government is making an effort in some areas, but I ask the Minister of State to pursue this issue again. A constituent of mine told me that his insurance bill three years ago was £3,000 and that he has today been given a quote of &euro;29,000. These are huge costs for employers in an economy which is becoming more competitive. It is becoming more difficult to employ people. Employers must be encouraged.</P>
      <P>In the past couple of weeks, the directors of Pall Ireland, an employer in Tipperary town which earlier this year laid off 200 workers, met Oireachtas Members. They told us that they would prefer to stay in Ireland than move to any other European country. They specifically mentioned France, which they saw as more competitive because of its long holidays. We remain competitive in Ireland but should try to maintain competitiveness for the benefit of everyone, including workers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Bill is being introduced against the backdrop of an Irish workforce very different from that of ten or 20 years ago. There are now 294,000 part-time employees in the economy, representing over 17% of the workforce. Added to this, the idea of a job for life is gone. Nowadays, people may carve out a career, but they feel it is not practical nor desirable to spend 20, 30 or 40 years with the same employer or institution. That is a good thing. I come from a background where I was never employed by anybody, but was always self-employed. Some years ago I came into this job, and I find a total change in my lifestyle. Yet it is good for me and my family. The discovery that one can change from one career to another has given me a renewed interest in life. People should be more open to career changes. In the United States, for instance, people consider that when they have spent a certain period of time in employment they can retire and move <Col N="1148" />on to something else. It is good for the economy but also extremely good for people. When one is too long in the same job doing the same thing, one becomes stale. That is an important consideration.</P>
    <P>The concept of contract work offers an attractive prospect for thousands of young people entering the labour market for the first time, unsure of whether they wish to pledge their entire lives to the chosen profession or employer. Unfortunately, some attractions come with price tags &ndash; job insecurity, less favourable treatment by management and often a general sense that the employee is being undervalued. Frequently, it is the contract worker who is asked to do something that the permanent employee would not dream of doing. This situation cannot be allowed continue.</P>
    <P>Deputy Kehoe spoke about the contract system for nurses. Nursing is a profession that we have been very proud of in Ireland. Some years ago, wherever Irish nurses went in the world, they were the pride of the nation. Whether they went to America or England, Canada or Australia, Irish people were extremely proud of them. Their great care of patients was often mentioned. I have no doubt that we probably trained the best nurses in the world, but in the past few years, something happened that has dented that profession greatly. The contracts system, whereby nurses were recruited to work alongside permanent and temporary staff in hospitals, had a negative effect. Many nurses say it has been a disheartening experience for their profession and has changed nursing from what it was some years ago. We should examine the way in which we have let standards in the profession slide as a result of hiring so many nurses on contract. Why did we allow it to happen?</P>
    <P>The debate is framed around the need for rights and responsibilities. For employers, the right to run a thriving and successful business is enshrined in our democratic system. No one suggests it would be possible to do this without the flexibility of a system for contract workers. What is suggested is that there is a duty and responsibility to those workers who have been in employment for a given period. That would be recognised by the majority of employers. There are certainly employers who abuse their position and do so at the first opportunity. The Bill also points to the rights and responsibilities of employees. The legislation can be of benefit to employers and employees. Where both are satisfied with their lot, it can be of huge benefit to all.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill. It is late, but it is better late than never. It will be of benefit to employees and employers. We live in an increasingly competitive environment which is making it more difficult for employers to continue in business. We have a committed workforce which, if treated properly and with dignity, will respond. Any legislation we <Col N="1149" />introduce that secures people's position is of benefit.</P>
    <P>A worker works for his family. The Minister of State referred to flexibility where family life is concerned, and that is most important. Earlier this week we discussed parental responsibility in the context of the Intoxicating Liquor Bill. There should be flexibility for parents to spend time with their children. Young children are growing up in a difficult environment and need their parents to be with them as often as possible. There must be flexibility in the workplace to allow employers to give their employees the time to spend with their children. I hope that is covered in the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankFahey" hpid="Mr. Fahey Mr. Fahey">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Mr. Fahey)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank all Members who contributed to the debate. All contributors welcomed the thrust and intent of the Bill, and I welcome the cross-party support for it. Many referred to the rights and responsibilities of employees and employers and the need for both to play their respective roles in this regard. I share this view.</P>
      <P>I will deal with the issue raised by a number of Opposition Members of the reason for the long delay in bringing the Bill before the House. The date of transposition in the directive was set at 10 July 2001. The main reason for the delay was the preoccupation of the relevant section in the Department with the work on the Carer's Leave Act and the Protection of Employees (Part-Time Work) Act which had been given priority. When both measures were enacted towards the end of 2001, priority was then given to the implementation of the Fixed-Term Work Directive.</P>
      <P>Considerable time was spent on the tripartite group discussions which included representatives of the ICTU and IBEC and which was established to consider the best means of transposing the directive in Irish circumstances. The work of this group is reflected in the Bill. There were considerable delays as well in the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel which were outside our control. These delays were caused by a significant amount of legislation in the pipeline. The provisions of the Bill will come into effect immediately upon its enactment and it is not intended for them to be retrospective.</P>
      <P>Members referred to amendments and I know they will table a number of them for Committee Stage next week. I will also table a number of Government amendments which will be aimed at securing the flexibility and security fixed-term workers and employers want and to which a number of Members referred. These are being worked on by the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel to the Government and will be discussed next week.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I reject some of the criticisms made by some Members about the content of the Bill. Considerable discussion and negotiation took place during <Col N="1150" />preparation of the legislation and especially since it was discussed in the Seanad a few weeks ago. A good and positive debate took place in that Chamber during which a number of issues were raised and as a result of which we promised to make amendments.</P>
    <P>Considerable discussions have taken place with the social partners, especially with the ICTU, in order that we would arrive at a consensus and try to satisfy the requirements of unions. I am grateful to my officials in the Department for their work and effort in examining the ICTU's proposals and trying to incorporate them in the legislation.</P>
    <P>Listening to some Members, one would have thought that no consultation took place and that the Bill was flawed and was being rushed through. I reject that criticism. It is good legislation. It is also complex and it took significant discussion to ensure we satisfied in particular the demands of the ICTU and unions and ensured the rights of workers were properly balanced in the legislation. I thank the ICTU and IBEC. A number of Members referred to the spirit of partnership which was part of the formulation of this legislation.</P>
    <P>Members referred to cases of workers being exploited. Deputy Boyle's contribution was not only negative but also inaccurate in this respect. I am not concerned about being criticised by Members nor about their making good critical analysis, but when a Member makes outlandish statements that are clearly untrue, it is very unfair. Deputy Boyle said that thousands of young people are being exploited. That is just not correct. If he has examples of employers exploiting young people he should bring them to my attention and I will have them dealt with. It is not fair to come into the House and make outlandish statements and claim that we should have enough inspectors to police everyone. That is not the way to enforce legislation. We do not want to use a significant volume of taxpayers' money. We have an inspectorate and a control system but at the end of the day it is up to the people themselves, their unions and committed people in the community. If there is exploitation of young people, or anyone else, in the workplace, they should bring it to the attention of my Department. I assure the House, and it is a credit to the officials of the Department, that these incidents are dealt with quickly and effectively and, if necessary, as we saw in some high profile cases recently, offending employers are brought before the courts.</P>
    <P>For the benefit of the Green Party I will reiterate some of the legislation of recent years covering workers' rights &ndash; the Minimum Notice and Terms of Employment Act, the Unfair Dismissals Act, the Payment of Wages Act, the Organisation of Working Time Act, the Safeguarding of Employees' Rights on the Transfer of Undertak<Col N="1151" />ing Regulations, the Protection of Young People at Work Act, the Safety, Health and Welfare Act, the Redundancy Payments Act, the National Minimum Wage Act and the Protection of Employees (Part-Time Work) Act.</P>
    <P>If there are gaps and if Deputy Boyle wants to lecture us about joined up Government, let him be specific and tell us what legislation we are missing. There is some legislation still to be introduced but I reject, particularly from the Green Party, the sort of contribution we got from Deputy Boyle. I am sure he would pay for it all with the green taxes he would raise to provide all the extra resources he demands.</P>
    <P>Many Deputies asked about non-national workers. Non-national workers who have proper work permits are covered by this legislation in the same way as everyone else. Non-national workers are covered by all employment rights legislation and that is how it should be.</P>
    <P>I wish to comment on the misunderstanding about the temporary agency workers legislation. The reason we, along with Britain, Germany and Denmark, opposed the Commission in Luxembourg in trying to reach agreement is because a different culture exists in a number of European countries. We have heard a great deal about the difficulties in France at the moment but the temporary agency workers regime works well in this State. If I was to hear of any instances of exploitation of workers who are employed by temporary agencies, I would deal with that but I have not heard of any major difficulties.</P>
    <P>The concept of temporary agency work has worked well here and we want to protect that segment of our employment because it gives a flexibility that has contributed in no small way to the growth of employment in the State, particularly in the IT industry. A significant proportion of the rapid growth in the IT industry was caused by the fact that a company can set up and employ workers straight away under the employment agency regime. The vast majority of those workers have gone on to become full-time, permanent employees in these companies. I have heard from senior people in the IT industry that Ireland has an advantage in that a regime exists where they can find workers immediately. They tell me that they pay the workers in that sector of the economy as much if not more than they would those on permanent contracts.</P>
    <P>The European Commission's proposals would have allowed the temporary agency businesses a six-week qualifying period before temporary agency workers were assigned to the user enterprise and would qualify for the same terms and conditions and permanent employees. Temporary agency workers have the same rights and are covered by all of the legislation I mentioned. They are not being exploited and while there may <Col N="1152" />be differentials in pay levels, and some temporary agency workers who are paid less than others, it is equally fair to say that many temporary agency workers are paid more, as is the case with temporary agency nurses.</P>
    <P>We sought to lengthen the qualifying period proposed by the Commission to a year and I am sure the Commission will continue to try to make progress on the issue. We will contribute in a positive way to reach a solution which is satisfactory to all concerned.</P>
    <P>The Labour Party is of the view that we are opposed to the introduction of this directive because we wanted to leave temporary agency workers in a worse position than others. That is not the case. We feel there should be an adequate qualifying period because it gives the employer an adequate opportunity to take on a worker on a temporary basis before making that worker permanent.</P>
    <P>There are also many people who want to work in that structure, who do not want to work a full five-day week on a permanent basis. They want the opportunity to work two or three days a week and in different firms, they want to take weeks off at a time. I have had many people from across the spectrum lobbying me since the start of the debate to say they are happy with the arrangement they have with an employment agency.</P>
    <P>Consequently, there is much to recommend this type of work and I have not seen anyone breaking down my door in recent months saying that this is wrong, he or she is being exploited or experiencing major problems. We want to have a reasonable qualifying period and want to reach agreement in Brussels and I am confident we will do that. It will be a priority during our Presidency.</P>
    <P>I thank all Deputies who contributed to this Bill. It will have an impact, particularly for State employees. In the teaching profession there are far too many teachers who have been on short-term contracts from September to June for up to ten or 20 years. It is time to end that. There are many nurses in the same situation and those people will benefit significantly from this legislation. It will cost the Exchequer an extra &euro;50 million to implement this legislation which shows that someone will benefit.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1153" />On 8 May 2002, a major fire destroyed the Glanbia Meats pig processing facility at Rooskey, County Roscommon. Yesterday, the company announced that it had plans to restore the capacity lost due to the fire by upgrading and expanding its two remaining facilities at Edenderry, County Offaly and Roscrea, County Tipperary at an estimated investment cost of approximately &euro;27 million, with the knock-on closure of the Rooskey killing facility.</P>
    <P>While the decision to retain the cannery at Roosky, County Roscommon, is a positive one and leaves the door open for some hope, it is a huge blow to the local community. After the fire had destroyed much of the premises, the Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment asked the then Minister for Agriculture and Food, Deputy Joe Walsh, who is also the current Minister, to immediately establish how soon the pigmeat facility could be reopened.</P>
    <P>In a response on a previous Adjournment debate, the Minister of State at the Department of Finance, Deputy Parlon, stated that finding new investment and providing new sources of employment in areas of County Roscommon will not be easy but that the Tánaiste is determined to do everything she can to make that happen. Sadly, those were hollow words because in a reply to a parliamentary question I received from the Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment and from the Minister for Agriculture and Food, in which I specifically requested information regarding the contacts made directly with the company, the responses I received were to the effect that neither Minister has made direct contact with the company. Not a word has passed between them, yet we are told that the Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment is determined to do everything she can. Those are hollow words which she also uttered to the factory employees in Roosky, County Roscommon, on 8 May last year in light of the fact that the company had planning discussions with Roscommon County Council regarding the reopening and redevelopment of the facility.</P>
    <P>In her response today, the Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment stated that the company's proposal was part of a rationalisation of the slaughtering facility. I am aware it is a policy of Enterprise Ireland to see a rationalisation within the slaughtering and processing facilities for the meat industry. I ask the Minister to answer a number of questions. Are any State funds involved in the rationalisation programme into which Glanbia has now entered? Are State funds being made available to support the additional employment in Edenderry and Roscrea? What offer, if any, was made to Glanbia by way of financial aid or incentive to retain the facility in Roosky, County Roscommon?</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1154" />Glanbia is the biggest employer in Roosky. The east Roscommon area has lost 340 jobs at the plant, which will have a major impact on the local economy. That is in conjunction with two other major blows in the area, namely, the loss of 300 jobs at Atlantic Mills and the postponement of an investment by Cardinal Healthcare which would have created 1,300 jobs in the locality.</P>
    <P>Some 1,185 jobs have been lost to County Roscommon and its hinterland since January 2001, yet nothing has happened to address this crisis. I do not know of any other region that could absorb such job losses. It is ten years since County Roscommon benefited from a single IDA job. I doubt if there is any other county which has not received one IDA job in the past ten years during a time when there were massive amounts of foreign direct investment into the country. There is no doubt that County Roscommon has been neglected by the State agencies which have responsibility for job creation.</P>
    <P>The establishment of the BMW region was nothing more than a paper exercise as far as creating jobs in the region is concerned. We now know that the IDA has abandoned the only policy decision taken by the Government, that 50% of all jobs created should be targeted to the BMW region. It says this is simply no longer possible.</P>
    <P>Roscommon must be given priority and provided with the opportunity to create jobs either through the IDA or Enterprise Ireland. We must also have a firm commitment regarding the decentralisation of civil servants to the county and the future development by Cardinal Healthcare. Roscommon is an employment black-spot with inadequate infrastructure. As I said, it is ten years since we have had a positive proposal on job investment in the county and it is about time we got our fair share, nothing more and nothing less. I call on the Government and the State agencies to respond with a positive step to the needs of the county, in particular the needs of the people of Roosky and west Roscommon, and ensure a replacement industry is obtained. A 40 acre site is available on the site in Rooskey where Glanbia is pulling out. Surely that provides potential for investment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFinneranFF" hpid="Mr. Finneran Mr. Finneran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Finneran</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank you, a Cheann Comhairle, for accepting my matter for the Adjournment regarding the decision of Glanbia to abandon Roosky and reinvest in another part of the country. This is an outrage as far as the people of Roscommon are concerned, particularly Roosky and the catchment area that takes in the three counties of Roscommon, Leitrim and Longford. The question must be asked: why did a commercial company change its mind in the period since January of this year when at that time all of the discussions were focused on the rebuilding of the plant at Roosky? In fact, a company representa<Col N="1155" />tive said at that time that the only outstanding matter that had to be dealt with regarding the re-establishment of the company at Roosky was the final agreement on the insurance package. We now know that the insurance package has been agreed, but we also know it has now been transferred to Edenderry and Roscrea.</P>
      <P>I wish the people well in those two towns but if there is a need for employment in those two factories now, why are 75 jobs being presented to them when they have been granted leave to apply for work permits for foreign workers in the two plants? Will the extra 75 jobs now being provided in the plants be filled by people with work permits from states outside the European Union? If that is the case, it is an outrage because in the catchment area of Roscommon, Leitrim and Longford, there are 450 willing workers &ndash; in many cases local people with small farms &ndash; who worked at the plant over the years and made a great commitment to it. Some of them are second and third generations of people who previously worked in Hanley Meats. They built up a tradition of pigmeat processing in the village of Roosky which has been the mainstay in terms of employment and the local economy over many years. I would like to know the reasons the commercial decision has been taken by Glanbia Meats to raid the village of Roosky, take &euro;28 million out of it and reinvest it elsewhere.</P>
      <P>This was a disgrace which shows little concern for the workforce that has invested so much over many years. I call on the board and executive of Glanbia to explain to the House or the community in Roosky the reason the decision was made. What is its intention with regard to what is left of the plant?</P>
      <P>A sop has been given to the people of Roosky regarding 100 jobs at the cannery. There are 60 jobs left at the cannery, not 100, and there will be none left down the line as I do not envisage the company transporting raw material from another location to Roosky for current purposes.</P>
      <P>At my instigation and that of Deputy Naughten, discussions were held with the planning authority and Enterprise Ireland on the redevelopment and rebuilding of the plant and everything was on track at the start of this year. What happened in the intervening period?</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Mr. Fahey)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Deputies for raising the matter on the Adjournment. Since the fire at Glanbia Meats plant at Roosky, County Roscommon, in May 2002, the company has been examining the possibility of rebuilding its pig slaughtering plant. It was always anticipated that it would be some time before a final decision was taken on the matter. Unfortunately, the end result was yesterday's announcement by the company that the rebuilding of the Roosky plant will not proceed.</P>
      <P>Over the past two years, Enterprise Ireland has been actively working with the Glanbia Group in terms of its global competitiveness, given that it must compete with large-scale competitors from the UK, Europe and the US. Since the fire last year, Glanbia Meats has been examining its best future options and has been in ongoing discussions with Enterprise Ireland. The company had indicated, subsequent to the fire, that it was its intention to rebuild the plant. However, despite extensive exploration of options by the company, it proved to be uneconomic to do so. According to Glanbia, the restoration of lost capacity into the existing facilities at Roscrea and Edenderry was seen as a better long-term solution for the company and its producers.</P>
      <P>While the Glanbia decision, based on commercial considerations, is not to rebuild the Roosky facility, it will develop the existing Roscrea and Edenderry plants. As part of a proposed &euro;27 million investment in the rationalisation of slaughtering facilities with a view to improving competitiveness, an additional 150 jobs will be created between the Roscrea and Edenderry plants. In effect, plans are now being developed to reshape the business using the fire as a catalyst for change and Glanbia Meats has been in detailed discussions with Enterprise Ireland seeking support for the proposed investment with a view to maximising the level of value addition that will take place in Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1157" />This proposed investment is seen as critical to establish a sustainable strategic position for the Irish pigmeat industry, matching international competitive and best practice standards. Upon completion in late 2004, the upgraded facilities with integrated boning and packing facilities will be the largest and most efficient facilities of their kind in the Irish Republic. Overall, the expanded processing activities will result in an increase in employment at the Roscrea and Edenderry plants of approximately 150.</P>
    <P>A voluntary redundancy scheme has been agreed with the workers at Roosky and 290 people have already left the company on this basis. Most of the redundant workers have registered with FÁS, which is offering them the full range of services available, including skills analysis, job placement, guidance and counselling interviews, identification of training needs and suitable courses. The existing Glanbia Meats cannery at Roosky, employing 95 people, will be developed and a number of growth initiatives are being explored.</P>
    <P>The State development agencies are fully committed to addressing the adverse situation arising from the job losses in Roosky and elsewhere and are actively encouraging investment in the region through the establishment of new projects and the expansion of existing projects. IDA Ireland is committed to playing its part in the development of the midlands by maintaining the maximum number of jobs in overseas industry and by attracting new foreign direct investment into the region. The agency has strengthened its commitment to the midlands by establishing its health care division together with part of its property and regions divisions in Athlone.</P>
    <P>Enterprise Ireland will work with the management of Glanbia Meats to assist any staff members who wish to pursue starting up their own businesses. This will be done in co-operation with FÁS and the county enterprise board. Enterprise Ireland will also make staff from its high growth start-up unit available to meet senior management-technical staff to explore business ideas. The county enterprise board is also fully committed to providing every support possible to encourage new enterprise in the area. I am confident that a focused agency approach, together with a local based approach, should be successful in addressing the jobs situation in the area.</P>
    <P>I appreciate the comments made by Deputies Naughten and Finneran and the significant negative impact this closure will have for the area of County Roscommon in question. I will bring to the attention of the Minister and Enterprise Ireland the comments of the Deputies, in particular in respect of the need to make every effort to develop the 40 acre site owned by the company. I agree with Deputy Finneran's comments on the need for the company to act responsibly in <Col N="1158" />respect of the site and make a contribution to a new industry being established in the location.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gogarty</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Minister of State will be aware, I and my Green Party colleagues have long been opposed to the dual mandate and voluntarily resigned from double-jobbing last year. We did not call for payment to be made at this or any other stage, ask for kudos or seek the high moral ground. The issue was one of principle for the Green Party, which does not make us better or worse than anyone else. However, we did not ask for money for doing so. We now find that others are being paid for being forced or incentivised to do something we did willingly.</P>
      <P>The Minister for the Environment, Heritage and the Local Government, Deputy Cullen, directly and indirectly is paying out a combined total of &euro;12,800 to those Members who resigned or will resign their council seats between, approximately, May and September this year. This is absurd and I call on the Minister to halt gratuity payments due to Oireachtas Members for relinquishing their council seats. The &euro;12,800 payment is nothing less than a bribe which all but a few charitable Deputies, such as Deputy Grealish or dual mandate hardliners such as Deputy Ring, will lap up without complaint.</P>
      <P>I would prefer if the payment were not made, particularly in light of recent revelations about overspending at election time and the lack of legislation to cover spending outside these times. Des Kelly who brought the recent, useful case before the courts is from my constituency. He must have spent three or four times what one would normally spend during an election outside the election campaign. This area needs to be tightened up.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister appears insistent on paying money to Oireachtas Members for resigning the dual mandate. Will this money be paid to all Members who resigned council seats before the legislation was passed and not just those who step down between May and September this year? Rumours, particularly those based on conversations party members have had with the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, suggest that it will not. If this is the case it is a scandal and skulduggery of the highest order because paying money early to those who did not resign on principle is shocking and unfair. It will give other parties an advantage in terms of funding both before and during the next general election. It is basically an unfair bribe and means that my constituency rivals and their fellow Oireachtas Members nationwide will be able to afford to plaster their faces around their constituencies without having to draw on their salaries and other resources they are meant to have to do their work while the rest of us will be under more <Col N="1159" />pressure. It is one thing to do the job required of one, but when campaigning for re-election one has to let people know that one is doing one's job, and unless one spends money on this one will not get re-elected no matter how good one is.</P>
    <P>The 2002 election overspend means that more and more money will be spent between elections. The &euro;12,800 is not a small sum and exceeds what I spent on my general election campaign. We know that most Deputies and Senators will spend it on their election campaigns and publicity material, although I acknowledge Deputy Grealish put his hand on his heart and said he would give it to charity.</P>

It would be fairer not to pay anybody and put the money towards education and health. I am being consistent in this regard because I called for a pay freeze for Members before Christmas &ndash; very few people took me up on this and some remarked that I should have given back my increase. I might be green in politics but I am not a total idiot and realise that we should all decline our increases together or not at all.</P>

Locally, they will read, &ldquo;Joanna Tuffy takes bribe&rdquo;, or &ldquo;John Curran takes bribe&rdquo;. Any representative who makes a financial killing by being bribed in respect of the dual mandate will be fair game. I call on the Minister to play a fair game and not to pay out the money or if it is paid, to pay it to all concerned. Then, perhaps, we could have an equal playing field. If no action is taken by the Minister, I reserve the right to let all hell break loose and let the electorate know exactly what is happening and exactly who has an unfair electoral advantage in the next general election.</P>

      <P>Under regulations made in 2002, all retiring councillors, whether they are Members of the <Col N="1160" />Oireachtas or not, qualify for a gratuity on retirement subject to the conditions of the scheme as laid out in the regulations. These require a minimum term of qualifying service of three years, starting from 4 May 2000. The regulations were made in June last year and were notified to local authorities in that month. This notification included an information note specifically setting out the details and rules governing the scheme.</P>
      <P>The scheme involves payment on retirement of a lump sum calculated as three twentieths of the current rate of representational payment for each year of service, that is, service since 4 May 2000, up to a maximum of 20 years of service. Subject to certain conditions, the gratuity is payable on a councillor's retirement on the basis of voluntary retirement, failure to be elected, death or ill health.</P>
      <P>A three-year minimum service requirement attaches to the scheme, with service commencing on 4 May 2000. Thus, any councillor who resigned his or her local authority seat prior to the 4 May 2003 does not qualify for a gratuity. This is the clear position and it is in accordance with the conditions of the scheme as set out in the regulations and as made available to all councillors last year.</P>
      <P>Members of the Green Party who resigned their local authority seats several months ago after the gratuity scheme regulations were made did so in the full knowledge that they would not qualify for a gratuity. They could have remained as councillors until 4 May 2003 and benefited from a gratuity. Under the existing rules, they would have had the required three years of service.</P>

      <P>As I understand it, for some years it has been Green Party policy that its members do not hold a dual mandate and, consequently, some of its Deputies resigned their local authority seats last year. I have heard them take credit for holding this position, particularly when the dual mandate was being discussed in the Dáil recently. Moreover, never once did they question the matter or claim that they should benefit from the gratuity arrangements. They are trying to have it both ways.</P>
      <P>Last February the Minister, Deputy Cullen, announced, in the context of the ending of the dual mandate, proposals for modestly improved gratuity arrangements for Oireachtas councillors in recognition of their contribution to local government.</P>

    <P>There has been nothing but openness and transparency in the gratuity scheme since it was <Col N="1161" />developed. The same applies to the revised gratuity arrangements for Oireachtas councillors, which were announced last February.</P>

      <P>I thank you, a Cheann Comhairle, for allowing me raise this issue and thank the Minister of State, Deputy Noel Ahern, for being present to reply. It is a simple matter and I will <Col N="1162" />not delay the staff of the House. It concerns a sad case which is symptomatic of the kinds of cases that come to my attention on a regular basis. A single man who was in a relationship found that he had a malignant growth that required surgery. Subsequently, the relationship terminated and he became homeless. It is sad that there is no place for a single person in his circumstances, be it a man or woman. Society does not want to assist such people.</P>
      <P>I know the Minister of State is a humane and caring person but I ask that the people who make decisions such as that made in respect of the single man's case should be a little more humane. The relevant health board has advised that the rent being sought in his case is &euro;205 per week, which is almost twice the relevant rent limit for a single person of &euro;107 per week. I do not know what circumstances are like in the Minister of State's constituency but in mine nobody rents accommodation for one person for &euro;107 per week any more. At a minimum, tenants have to pay approximately &euro;200 per week or &euro;800 per month.</P>
      <P>The Minister of State may shake his head but a person renting accommodation either has to pay his or her rent or do without accommodation &ndash; there is nowhere else to go.</P>
      <P>I hope I have brought this matter to the attention of the Minister of State in time for the community welfare officer to take the necessary action to address what is a serious situation. Any person attempting to recover from cancer has enough problems and does not need more burdens imposed on him or her. A little humanity should be brought to bear on this situation. I ask the Minister of State to issue a directive to the relevant person in the Department to reconsider this case and recognise the marketplace in which we live. This person can live on the side of the road in the open air or he can pay rent of &euro;200 per week for accommodation.</P>

It was introduced in 1997 when it replaced a number of schemes for different categories of lone parent. These schemes included lone parent's allowance, deserted wife's benefit and allowance and the non-contributory widow and widower's pension for those with dependent children. Under the new scheme lone parents are encouraged to maximise their income from different sources and the means test for this scheme makes allowance/provision for the exemption of significant levels of earnings and maintenance payments.</P>
      <P>Lone parents are encouraged to pursue the question of maintenance payments with the other parent. This is achieved by ensuring that there is a clear benefit to them and to their children arising from any maintenance payments secured. Where maintenance is in payment, up to &euro;95.23 per week of this maintenance is not assessed where there are vouched housing costs, that is, rent or mortgage repayments. This is the allowance to which the Deputy refers. In addition, only 50% of the rest of maintenance being received is assessed.</P>
      <P>Data provided by the Central Statistics Office show that rent levels in the private sector have been stable for some time and have actually fallen in the period from April 2002. More recent data from the CSO confirm this trend. In the circumstances it would not be appropriate to adjust this disregard in the assessment of maintenance contribution for the purposes of entitlement under the scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In addition to the disregards applying to maintenance payments, there are significant income disregards to assist in overcoming the particular obstacles which lone parents may face in taking up employment and training opportunities, and to encourage them to return to employment instead of remaining dependent on social welfare payments. Lone parents are also eligible to avail of the full range of employment support schemes operated by my Department. Lone parents can <Col N="1166" />earn up to &euro;146.50 per week without affecting their payment. Earnings above this limit are assessed at 50%, up to a maximum of &euro;293.00 per week. There are also transitional arrangements in place whereby a lone parent who exceeds the earnings threshold may retain 50% of his or her payment for a further 12 months.</P>
    <P>Those who have difficulty with housing costs are, of course, eligible to apply for rent supplement under the supplementary welfare allowance scheme. At the end of May 2003, there were 11,915 recipients of one-parent family payment in receipt of rent supplement paid under the supplementary welfare allowance scheme. I am satisfied that the present arrangements in place for lone parents are appropriate to address their income support needs and to encourage them to secure maintenance support where this is relevant, and to encourage them to consider employment as a realistic alternative to long-term welfare dependency. It would not be appropriate to increase the disregards for housing costs for the reason already mentioned and I have no proposal to do so.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social and Family Affairs (Mary Coughlan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 13 and 14 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government has decided that the most appropriate way to cater for the accommodation needs of asylum seekers is through the direct provision system operated by the Reception and Integration Agency of the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform. Arising from this decision, the Social Welfare (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2003 provided for a change in the conditions for receipt of rent supplement under the supplementary welfare allowance scheme. The new provision came into effect by way of a commencement order which I signed on 27 May 2003. The change means that asylum seekers and persons who are not lawfully in the State are not entitled to rent supplement in respect of applications made on or after 27 May. Persons in receipt of rent supplement prior to that date are not affected by the change. The direct provision system provides a range of accommodation including &ldquo;step-down&rdquo; self-catering units that are on a par with accommodation available in the private rented sector. It would not make sense for <Col N="1167" />the State to spend scarce resources on additional private rented accommodation. I am satisfied that the direct provision system caters for all the essential needs of asylum seekers and that the needs of people who have particular problems or difficulties, for example, problems of a medical or psychological nature, can be adequately addressed within the direct provision system. I should also mention that the swifter processing of asylum applications has resulted in a reduction in the average length of time spent by asylum seekers in the direct provision system.</P>
    <P>Recent figures furnished by the Office of the Refugee Applications Commissioner indicate that the number of new asylum applications received this year continues to decline. With regard to persons who are granted refugee status I would like to emphasise that such individuals are not affected by the change in the rent supplement provisions. They continue to be entitled to the same benefits under the social welfare code as Irish citizens.</P>

      <Quest>her views on whether the discrepancy between lone parent allowance and payments for the fostering of children is inconsistent; and her further views on whether such payments should be linked.</Quest>
      <QRef>[17892/03]</QRef>
    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan" hpid="Mary Coughlan Mary Coughlan">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Social and Family Affairs (Mary Coughlan)</NameTxt>
      <P>The one-parent family payment, OFP, was introduced in 1997 when it replaced a number of schemes for different categories of lone parent. These schemes included lone parent's allowance, deserted wife's benefit and allowance and the non-contributory widow and widower's pension for those with dependent children.</P>
      <P>The scheme is based on the contingency of lone parenthood and the need for social welfare support for parents with children where a person has not secured adequate, or any, maintenance from the spouse or the other parent. The scheme also supports and encourages lone parents to consider employment as an alternative to long-term welfare dependency while at the same time supporting them to remain in the home if that is their wish.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is generally accepted that the most effective route to long-term self-sufficiency for lone parents is through paid employment. Accordingly, provision is made under the scheme to encourage and facilitate lone parents in moving into the paid labour force so that they may avoid long-term welfare dependency. The main element of this policy is an earnings disregard of &euro;146.50 per week. This disregard is designed to assist in overcoming the particular obstacles which lone parents may face in taking up employment and training opportunities, and to encourage them to <Col N="1168" />return to employment, instead of remaining dependent on social welfare payments.</P>
    <P>Foster care, on the other hand, is part of the child protection and welfare service and is the responsibility of the Minister for Health and Children. The foster care allowance is paid in respect of children who have been taken into the care of the health board under the provisions of the Child Care Act 1991, for their care and protection, and placed in foster care or relative care.</P>
    <P>Foster care is the main form of alternative care for those children who cannot be looked after in their own homes. Under the regulations, a health board must assess the needs of a child placed in care and the suitability of the prospective foster or relative carers, and draw up a child care plan. The implementation of the child care plan places significant responsibilities and duties on foster carers, whether relatives or non-relatives. The foster care allowance is paid in recognition of these additional responsibilities and the additional costs of looking after foster children. The current rates of payment are &euro;281.50 per week per child under the age of 12, and &euro;308.50 per week per child aged 12 and over. I am satisfied that the social welfare arrangements in place for lone parents are appropriate and support general policy in this area which is to provide income support for lone parents while at the same time encouraging them to consider employment as a realistic alternative to long-term welfare dependency.</P>

      <P>The back to education allowance is a second chance education opportunities scheme designed to help the unemployed and other groups to improve their qualifications and to enhance their employment prospects.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A review of the basic purpose underlying my Department's back to education provisions was carried out last year. In light of this, and in view of the expenditure constraints facing us this year, the scheme has been revised. In framing proposals to change elements of the BTEA scheme, my concern was to ensure that resources should be focused where the need is greatest. In line with this, payments under the scheme for the summer period have been discontinued for BTEA participants who were in receipt of an unemployment <Col N="1169" />payment as many students traditionally find seasonal work at home or abroad during the summer months. Participants in the scheme who fail to find employment during the summer may be entitled to an unemployment payment, subject to satisfying the usual qualifying conditions. All other participants on the scheme &ndash; lone parents and people with disabilities &ndash; remain unaffected by this decision and will retain payment during the summer period. Furthermore, BTEA participants who, as an integral part of their course of study have to undertake a period of work experience, placement or research during the summer months will continue to be paid the allowance for this period.</P>
    <P>With regard to the individual case raised by the Deputy, the person concerned is, on a voluntary basis, travelling abroad for the summer months. There is no evidence that the travel is an integral part of his course and consequently, the allowance is not payable for this period.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that the arrangements now in place will ensure that the back to education scheme continues to provide support to those people who are most distant from the labour market and I have no plans to alter these arrangements.</P>

      <P>The Pensions Board is a statutory body which is financed by fees payable by occupational pension schemes and PRSA providers. The main functions of the board are to supervise the operation of the Pensions Act and to advise on matters relating to pensions generally.</P>
      <P>A review of the role and operations of the Pensions Board was completed in early 2001. A key element of the review was the role the board would play in development and implementation of measures recommended in the national pensions policy initiative which was published in 1998. The introduction of personal retirement savings accounts was a key element in the strategy recommended in the pensions initiative and it was decided to allocate responsibility for the development and subsequent regulation of this new product to the Pensions Board.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Allied to extra responsibilities for the Pensions Board came a need for additional staff, which was sanctioned in June 2001, and this in turn led to a requirement for additional office space. In February 2001 the Pensions Board availed of an opportunity to give notice that they intended to surrender the lease on their existing offices and sought new offices which could accommodate the revised <Col N="1170" />staffing requirements. Following comprehensive analysis and consideration by the board, new premises were secured at Lower Mount Street, Dublin, and these were fitted out and occupied by the time the previous premises expired in November 2001.</P>
    <P>The Deputy's reference to junkets is an unwarranted slur on the board which I absolutely reject. The meeting to which I assume the Deputy refers was arranged by the board and involved a full day discussion related to a mid-term review, with the help of a consultant, of the board's strategy, having regard, <i>inter alia,</i> to recent major changes affecting the pensions sector. I think it is appropriate that the board would review its operations from time to time and I have full confidence in the board and its management to conduct its business, including events of this sort, in a professional and effective way.</P>

      <P>The purpose of the supplementary welfare allowance scheme, which is administered by the health boards on behalf of my Department, is to provide a basic weekly allowance to people who have little or no income. Subject to certain conditions, every person in the State whose means are insufficient to meet his or her needs and the needs of any adult or child dependant is entitled to supplementary welfare allowance.</P>
      <P>Apart from the basic allowance, assistance may be given in the form of supplements in respect of rent, mortgage interest, special dietary or heating needs. In addition, a health board may, where it considers it reasonable, having regard to all the circumstances of a case, make a single payment to meet an exceptional need.</P>
      <P>Expenditure under the supplementary welfare allowance scheme for 2002 was &euro;526.9 million. A breakdown of this expenditure is given in a tabular statement prepared by my Department which I will make available to the Deputy. Expenditure under the supplementary welfare allowance scheme for the years 1998 to 2001 is set out in a further tabular statement which I will also arrange to make available to the Deputy. Total expenditure more than doubled between 1998 and 2002. It rose from just under &euro;250 million to almost &euro;527 million, an increase of over &euro;277 million in that time. This represents an overall increase of 111%.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Rent supplements accounted for the largest portion of expenditure within the scheme over the period in question. In 2002, rent supplements <Col N="1171" />accounted for some 48% of total supplementary welfare allowance expenditure. The number of recipients of rent supplement has risen significantly over the past 12 months while the level of rent has stabilised.</P>
    <P>My Department is undertaking a major review of all aspects of the supplementary welfare allowance scheme at present and I will be considering any necessary changes to the scheme in light of the outcome of that review.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 19 and 47 together.</P>
      <P>The report An End Based on Means which deals with how the legal system treats uncontested consumer debt cases and examines alternatives and proposals for reform, is a very comprehensive report on an area that has not been examined for a long time.</P>
      <P>The report brings together many of the issues faced by people who are over-indebted. The free legal advice centres work closely with the Money Advice and Budgeting Service funded by my Department and the views of those working in the service were sought for the purpose of this report. The Money Advice and Budgeting Service helps to negotiate voluntary repayment arrangements as an alternative to the legal system. This approach is generally well received by creditors who in the absence of the MABS would be more likely to use the legal system to enforce the debt. The service now operates nationwide with 52 services operating from 62 centres throughout the country. It has an emphasis on practical, budget-based measures that will assist in removing people permanently from dependence on moneylenders and open up alternative sources of credit through the credit unions. The service gives advice and assistance, but does not pay debts. An option offered by the MABS is to arrange for the person to open a &ldquo;special account&rdquo; in their local credit union. This enables them to repay their debts by paying an agreed weekly amount into this account. They also open a shares account which helps to cultivate a savings habit and facilitates borrowing in time of need.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the past year the Money Advice and Budgeting Service and the Irish Bankers' Federation have developed an alternative to the legal system in relation to debt enforcement and this is being piloted in a number of areas in Dublin. This pilot is targeted at those who are on the point of legal action with their creditor or creditors. The programme consists of a voluntary agreement between debtor and creditors which provides for basic income retention, freezing of interest and writing off of residual debt after a repayment period of up to five years. This fresh start pilot scheme recognises that some people may find it almost impossible to repay their debts and that court action would be futile, only adding to misery and hardship. Several people have already availed of the pilot and it has now been extended to give others throughout the country an opportunity to participate. I believe that the Money Advice and Budgeting Service offers practical <Col N="1173" />and effective assistance to people with problems of indebtedness. I will be taking account of the recommendations in this report in considering future development in this area.</P>

      <P>The number of posts filled in my Department at present is 4,366. This is 50 posts higher than the Departments authorised number of core posts as set under Government policy on public service numbers. The difference between the core staffing allocation and the number of posts currently filled arises from temporary sanctions for staff to deal with specific projects of a temporary nature. As the sanctions for temporary posts lapse the necessary reduction in staff numbers must be implemented on a gradual basis and when posts fall vacant, when a vacancy arises in any area, the question of filling it has to be considered in the context of the overall excess on sanctioned numbers, but taking account of the needs of the service.</P>
      <P>The fact that the Department is heavily decentralised means that the management of this process can be difficult. The present position, which is subject to ongoing review, is that, pending completion of the process of achieving overall target staff numbers while ensuring that the available resources are deployed to meet the changing business needs in different locations, 51 posts have not been replaced in the following grades: PO one; AP one; HEO four; EO seven; SO seven; and CO 31.</P>

      <P>The provision of comprehensive information in a clear and simple manner is an essential element in the delivery of social welfare services. The objective of my Department's information policy is to ensure that all citizens are made aware of their entitlements under a broad range of social insurance, social assistance and other supports and are kept informed of changes <Col N="1174" />and improvements as they occur. I am satisfied that that objective is being met.</P>
      <P>My Department directs information to citizens on new schemes and services through advertising, using an appropriate mix of national and provincial media, and through information leaflets, fact sheets, posters and direct mailshots. Selective use is also made of freephone telephone services to provide information on new schemes and services and at particular times of the year, such as budget time. In addition, my Department's schemes and services are publicised on RTE's teletext service, Aertel, and on its website at www.welfare.ie</P>
      <P>In relation to information products, my Department produces a comprehensive range of information leaflets and booklets covering each social welfare payment. These are widely available across the country from social welfare local offices, citizens information centres and many other local organisations. In the past two months alone, seven new and revised editions of information leaflets have been published as well as the 2003 edition of our main information booklet, Guide to Social Welfare Services, a copy of which I sent to each Member of the Oireachtas. The new booklet has been distributed to information providers around the country, including voluntary and community groups.</P>
      <P>My Department also works closely with voluntary and community organisations involved in an information-giving role. A number of such organisations receive funding on an annual basis towards the cost of providing welfare rights and information services for their targets groups. Customer panels and customer surveys are among the mechanisms we use to consult with our customers in relation to the services we provide and to tailor the delivery of services, including information services, to meet the needs identified. The findings of these surveys are, in the main, very positive and show a high overall satisfaction rating with the services provided.</P>
      <P>Comhairle is the national information agency coming under the aegis of my Department with responsibility for supporting the provision of independent information, advice and other supports to all citizens, including those with disabilities. Comhairle supports a network of some 85 citizens' information centres whose role is to provide information to members of the public on all social services.</P>

      <P>The personal public services, PPS, number was introduced in the 1998 Social Welfare Act and is the individual's unique identifier <Col N="1175" />in his dealings with public services. An awareness campaign for the number was launched in November 2002 and it described the number as the key to accessing services and making the delivery of benefits to citizens easier and more efficient. The wider use of the number is part of the general drive to modernise Government services and provide for a more integrated public service.</P>
      <P>The PPS number is based on each individual's basic identity information such as name, date of birth and address and it is only issued when this information is verified. It already has an established population base as it replaced the Revenue and social insurance number, or RSI number. In addition, for some years, my Department has allocated numbers to children as child benefit is claimed.</P>
      <P>There is a high level of awareness of the PPS number since the public awareness campaign. Over 80% of individuals surveyed since the campaign have an awareness of the PPS number and its uses, and many Departments and agencies now use the number. The important aspect in relation to the PPS number is that it is unique for each individual and, when linked to a card, it will be a reliable form of identification.</P>
      <P>My Department currently issues a social services card. This caters for certain payment customers of my Department and it is also a permanent record of the PPS number. Each year, the card is automatically issued to individuals as they reach 16 years of age. The card visibly displays the customer's PPS number, name and signature and other details such as gender and date of birth are encoded on the card.</P>
      <P>The social services card is well placed in terms of usage and recognition for development as a public services card. To do so, however, it will need significant upgrading to meet existing and future demands including authentication of identity. I am considering how best to move to a public service card and what the implications of this would be.</P>
      <P>I also share the public concern about under age drinking, and in this regard my colleague, the Minister for Justice Equality and Law Reform, has proposed that those aged between 18 and 25 should carry identification cards in order to be served in pubs. I will be exploring with the Minister the possibility of using the PPS number and related public services card as a means of identification for this purpose.</P>

      <P>Family income supplement is <Col N="1176" />designed to provide cash support for employees on low earnings with families. This preserves the incentive to remain in employment in circumstances where the employee might only be marginally better off than if he or she were claiming other social welfare payments. FIS is paid on a weekly basis over a period of 52 weeks, taking into account a family's net earnings and the number of children under age 18 or aged between 18 and 22 years and in full-time education.</P>
      <P>In addition to the progressive annual increases in the income limits, the range of improvements to the scheme instituted by the Government include the assessment of FIS on the basis of net rather than gross income and an increase in the minimum supplement payable, which now stands at &euro;13. These improvements have made it easier for lower income households to qualify for payment under the scheme. This year I provided for further increases in the FIS income limits with effect from January 2003. These increases raised the weekly limit by &euro;17 at each point, adding an extra &euro;10.20 to the payments of most existing FIS recipients. The average weekly payment now stands at &euro;62.71 per week, with over 12,300 families receiving a supplement under the scheme.</P>
      <P>A working group was established under the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness to examine the role which refundable tax credits could play in the tax and welfare systems, including the possibility of paying FIS through the tax system. While the report of the group has yet to be finalised, I envisage that it will make some recommendations to improve the take-up of FIS but will not recommend a radical overhaul of the scheme.</P>
      <P>In the recent partnership agreement, Sustaining Progress, the importance of child income support is recognised, with a commitment to examine the effectiveness of current arrangements, including the role of FIS and child dependant allowances in tackling child poverty. Further improvements to the scheme will be considered in the context of the above review and overall budgetary priorities, having regard to available resources and Government commitments.</P>

      <Quest>her views on whether it is unfair that a person for whom a qualified adult allowance was payable on her late spouse's old age contributory pension should herself be denied a payment of widow's pension following the death of her spouse; and if she will arrange to have the case of a person (details supplied) in County Cork re-opened with a view to payment of a widow's pension.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan" hpid="Mary Coughlan Mary Coughlan">

      <P>Under social welfare legislation, where a person in receipt of a standard rate retirement or old age contributory pension, which includes a full qualified adult allowance in respect of his or her spouse, dies, the widow or widower <Col N="1177" />automatically qualifies for the maximum rate of widow's-widower's contributory pension. These provisions also apply where a qualified adult allowance would have been payable but for the receipt by the spouse of a non-contributory old age pension, a blind pension or carer's allowance in his or her own right.</P>
      <P>In all other circumstances, entitlement to widow's or widower's contributory pension is based on the qualifying contribution conditions being satisfied on either the insurance record of the deceased spouse or on the insurance record of the widow or widower.</P>
      <P>In the particular case referred to by the Deputy, the deceased spouse was in receipt of a special pre-53 rate of old age contributory pension. This is a non-standard pension the weekly rate of which is 50% of the maximum weekly personal rate of the contributory pension. The pension included a qualified adult allowance which is also payable at 50% of the standard qualified adult rate. Accordingly, the person concerned does not come within the criteria to automatically qualify for the widow's contributory pension.</P>
      <P>The person also did not qualify for the pension based on her own contribution record or that of her late husband as both records have insufficient contributions to satisfy the yearly average condition. The person concerned was informed of the position and of her right to appeal against the decision. It is open to the person concerned to make an application for the means tested non-contributory widow's pension.</P>
      <P>Decisions in relation to claims must be made within the terms of the legislation and such decisions are made by deciding officers and appeals officers. It is not open to me to reopen any case which does not qualify for payment under the terms of the legislation.</P>

      <P>The household benefits package, which comprises the electricity-gas allowance, telephone allowance and free television licence schemes, is generally available to people living in the State, aged 66 years or over, who are in receipt of a social welfare-type payment or who fulfil a means test. Widows and widowers aged from 60 to 65 whose late spouses had been in receipt of the household benefit package retain that entitlement following the death of a spouse.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to widows under 60 years of age, recently published data from census 2002 state that there are 27,600 widows and widowers in this category. The cost of extending the household benefits package to all of these widows and widowers would be in the region of &euro;20 million. If free travel were also included, this would add a further &euro;2.4 million to the cost. These figures <Col N="1178" />assume that none of the 27,600 widowed persons are currently in receipt of these benefits. There would be additional costs in respect of widowed people in the age group 60-65, some of whom are not currently in receipt of the free schemes. The current arrangements for the free schemes will be kept under review in the context of the future budgets and available resources.</P>

      <P>The preparation of the plan for the period 2003-05 is now well advanced and has involved a very extensive process of consultation, organised in conjunction with the Combat Poverty Agency. This consultation process has included four regional and three national seminars as well as a public invitation for written submissions. Some 67 written submissions were received. These, together with the outcomes of the wider public consultation, are now being examined and assessed. They will be taken into account in the context of the preparation of the national action plan which is on course for submission to the European Commission by 31 July deadline.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 29, 34, 40, 43, 48, 122 and 128 together.</P>
      <P>The carer's allowance is a social assistance payment which provides income support to people who are providing certain elderly or incapacitated persons with full-time care and attention and whose incomes fall below a certain limit. There are currently 20,600 people in receipt of the allowance at a cost of &euro;160 million last year. As with all other social assistance schemes, a means test applies under which the income of the applicant and his or her partner is assessable. This ensures that limited resources are directed to those in greatest need.</P>
      <P>Provision has been made in successive budgets for substantial increases in the means disregards. In April 2003 the weekly income disregards increased to &euro;210 for a single carer and to &euro;420 for a couple. The effect of this increase is that a couple with two children, earning a joint income of up to &euro;24,150 can qualify for the maximum rate of carer's allowance. The same couple, if they had an income of &euro;39,750, could still qualify for partial carer's allowance, the free schemes and the respite care grant. It is estimated that an additional 1,700 carers now qualify for the allowance and 2,800 existing carers receive an increased payment as a result of this measure.</P>
      <P>It is estimated that abolition of the means test could cost in the region of &euro;150 million per annum. In view of the many supports required by carers, particularly community care and respite care, it is considered that abolition of the means test would not necessarily constitute the best use of the resources available for the support of carers.</P>
      <P>There are plans to introduce a specific income disregard for applicants for carer's allowance who are in receipt of another social welfare payment when they become carers. With regard to recipients who are no longer full-time carers, they may be entitled to another social welfare payment. For example, those who are 55 or over and are no longer eligible to the carer's allowance may be entitled to the pre-retirement allowance.</P>
      <P>In budget 2003 I increased the annual respite care grant by &euro;100 to &euro;735 and to &euro;470 for carers who are caring for more than one person. This increase, which results in a trebling of the grant since its introduction in 1999, acknowledges the valuable work done by carers and demonstrates the Government's commitment to them. All other matters relating to the provision and availability of respite care are the responsibility of my colleague, the Minister for Health and Children.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In regard to the number of family carers, a pilot census survey undertaken by the Central Statistics Office, CSO, found as follows: 35,000 people provide more than 50 hours' unpaid personal help per week, or seven hours per day; 17,000 people provide 20 to 49 hours' unpaid personal help per week, or between three and seven hours per day and 79,000 people provide one to 19 hours' unpaid personal help per week, or between nine <Col N="1181" />minutes and 2.5 hours per day. There are currently over 20,400 carers in receipt of carer's allowance which means that almost 40% of the 52,000 carers, as estimated by the CSO to be caring for more than three hours per day, are in receipt of carer's allowance. Further work has been undertaken in the 2002 census by the CSO to identify the number of carers providing full-time care and attention. The analysis of this portion of the census, when available, should provide more comprehensive data to both myself and the voluntary organisations on the number of full-time and part-time carers.</P>
    <P>Yesterday, I launched a comprehensive study on the future financing of long-term care, carried out by Mercer Human Resource Consultants on behalf of my Department. In order to make progress in the area of policy on long-term care, I now propose to prepare a consultation document to accompany this study which will aim to focus all interested parties on the specific issues we need to address. These will be significant issues, including those in relation to benefit designs, cost and financing which are discussed at length in the report.</P>
    <P>A consultation process on the financing of long-term care will then take place. This process will be undertaken by my Department in close consultation with the Department of Health and Children over about a three month period. It is envisaged that the feedback from the consultation process would be the starting point for the commitment in the partnership document, Sustaining Progress, to establish a working group to examine the strategic policy, cost and service delivery issues associated with the care of older people. I hope this working group could be established early in 2004.</P>
    <P>Further improvements in the carer's allowance will be kept under review in a budgetary context. The development of the range of supports for carers will continue to be a priority for this Government and, building on the foundations now in place, we will continue to develop the types of services which recognise the value of the caring ethos and which provide real support and practical assistance to people who devote their time to improving the quality of life for others.</P>

      <P>Social Welfare legislation provides that a person must satisfy the conditions of being available for and genuinely seeking work in order to be entitled to an unemployment payment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Where a person has been in full-time employment, and on losing that employment, continues <Col N="1182" />to follow a course of study on a part-time basis, undertaken while in employment, he or she would not be precluded from claiming an unemployment payment provided that he or she is available for full-time employment, is genuinely seeking work and satisfies all other statutory conditions for the receipt of that payment. A person who is committed to a full-time day course of study, could not, however, be considered to satisfy the statutory requirement of being available for full-time employment.</P>
    <P>Each case is decided on its own merits within the framework of the relevant legislation and the onus is on the unemployed person to show that he or she satisfies the availability for employment and the genuinely seeking work conditions on an ongoing basis.</P>
    <P>Under social welfare legislation decisions in relation to individual cases are made by statutorily appointed deciding officers and appeals officers. Where a person is dissatisfied with a decision made by a deciding officer to refuse him or her an unemployment payment, the decision may be appealed to the social welfare appeals office.</P>
    <P>There is also provision under the Department's unemployment schemes to facilitate an unemployed person who wishes to attend a part-time education course which will help him or her to enhance his or her employment prospects. Attendance on such a course is facilitated on the understanding that the requirements of availability for and genuinely seeking reasonable work opportunities continue to apply.</P>

      <P>Data from the quarterly national household survey published by the CSO last year estimate that almost 51% of persons at work aged 20 to 69 have supplementary occupational or personal pensions cover. However, coverage varies greatly across different sectors. Employees in the public administration sector have the highest coverage at 87.8%, while in the retail trade and hotels and restaurants sectors coverage is low at 25.8% and 12.5% respectively. The Pensions Board report on the National Pensions Policy Initiative estimated that 70% of workers over 30 years of age require supplementary pension cover if they are to maintain their pre-retirement standard of living.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government aims to increase private pensions coverage in line with this target. In this regard, the personal retirement savings account, PRSA, provided for in the Pensions <Col N="1183" />(Amendment) Act 2002 is a key instrument of this strategy which has been available to the public since March of this year.</P>
    <P>Participation in a PRSA arrangement is not compulsory but employers will be required to facilitate this for their employees if they do not already offer a pensions scheme. This requirement will take effect from 16 September 2003.</P>
    <P>Some &euro;0.5 million has been provided for a pensions awareness campaign. This will have a two-fold aim &ndash; first, to make employers aware of their obligations in relation to PRSAs and, second, to encourage the general public to consider contributing to supplementary pension arrangements. The campaign is being run by the Pensions Board and arrangements in this regard are well advanced. The take-up of PRSAs and pensions coverage generally will be monitored and a review of the overall pensions strategy will be undertaken within three years.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 32 and 41 together.</P>
      <P>It is an essential part of my Department's customer service policy to ensure that citizens are made aware of their entitlements and are kept informed of changes and improvements as they occur.</P>
      <P>My Department tries to ensure that information in relation to all of its schemes, including family income supplement, FIS, is widely available to the public so that entitlements, where appropriate, can be claimed. Information and publicity on the FIS scheme is provided in a variety of different ways. In particular, information is provided to all one parent families when awarded a one parent family payment and all employers receive information on FIS at least annually in PRSI mailshots. FIS entitlement is examined for all applicants awarded the back to work allowance. Regional and local offices of my Department have been asked to ensure that the FIS scheme is extensively advertised. Information on the scheme and the application form are available on the Department's website. Information on FIS is contained in all child benefit books.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1184" />In addition, the scheme has previously been extensively advertised through local and national media outlets, including newspapers, radio, and the Aertel service, as well as through poster campaigns and targeted mailshots. These methods of information provision will continue to be used and where possible enhanced to promote the scheme.</P>
    <P>From 2 January this year, the income limits governing entitlement to FIS were increased by &euro;17 at each point for all recipients. The number of persons in receipt of FIS at 13 June 2003 is 12,305. The numbers in receipt of the supplement at 31 December for each of the past five years were in the range 11,840 to 13,260. Numbers for each year during that period are: 1998 &ndash; 13,260; 1999 &ndash; 14,686; 2000 &ndash; 13,181; 2001 &ndash; 11,840; and 2002 &ndash; 12,043.</P>

      <P>Supplementary welfare allowance may be paid to a person awaiting a decision on an application for any benefit, assistance or allowance from my Department or who is waiting for similar benefits to be transferred from another state and who has insufficient means to meet his or her immediate needs.</P>
      <P>Expenditure on interim supplementary welfare allowance payments amounted to &euro;32.7 million in 2000, &euro;37.4 million in 2001 and &euro;49.3 million in 2002. The numbers of recipients at the end of those years were 12,868, 14,282 and 15,372, respectively.</P>
      <P>Where a health board has paid supplementary welfare allowance to a person who is subsequently granted another benefit, assistance or allowance, the amount so paid may be recouped from any arrears due.</P>
      <P>In addition, if the amount of supplementary welfare allowance is in excess of what would have been paid to the person if he or she had been in receipt of the other benefit, assistance or allowance such excess sum may be recovered during the relevant continuous period of entitlement to the other benefit, assistance or allowance.</P>
      <P>My Department endeavours to pay people their entitlements at the earliest date possible and thus minimise the need for interim supplementary welfare allowance payments. A number of pilot projects are currently in operation with a view to further streamlining the system and reducing recourse to supplementary welfare allowance payments.</P>

      <P>Child benefit is payable on a monthly basis. Every effort is made to ensure that claims are decided and put into payment as quickly as possible and, in particular, that this process is accomplished within an appropriate timeframe for a monthly payment. Claim processing performance is, however, sensitive to seasonal fluctuations in claims intake which can adversely affect the service.</P>
      <P>At this time of year there is an increase in the volume of claims submitted for children who reach the age of 17 over the summer months and who get their forms certified prior to the school holidays to ensure payment over the summer months. There is an increase in work arising from the renewal of allowance books which occurs in June each year.</P>
      <P>A new computer system went into production in November 2002. This system will bring about significant improvements in customer services over time. Initially, there was some slow down in service as staff became familiar with the new system and associated organisational changes. However, it is expected that service levels will improve in the near future as training and familiarisation is completed.</P>
      <P>A further enhancement is anticipated later in the year as the new computer system is designed to take advantage of the computerisation of records of births held in the General Registration Office, GRO. When access to these records becomes available later in the year, the information will be used to invite applications from new customers and for the automatic processing of claims for children born to existing beneficiaries. This will make the service more customer-focused and will help speed up the processing of claims.</P>
      <P>Every effort is being made to deal with claims as quickly as possible. The average claim processing times are constantly monitored and a number of measures are in place to speed-up the processing of claims. I have no plans at present to increase the number of staff in this area as I am satisfied that in normal circumstances the staff cadre is adequate to deal with claims under this scheme.  </P>

      <P>The one parent family payment was introduced in 1997 when it replaced a number of schemes for different categories of lone parent. These schemes included lone parent's allowance, deserted wife's benefit and allowance and the non-contributory widow and widower's pension for those with dependent children.</P>
      <P>In common with other social assistance schemes the OFP features a means test which is intended to ensure that available resources are targeted at those who are most in need. The means test associated with the OFP operates broadly along the same lines as other social assistance schemes, however, it makes allowance-provision for the exemption of significant levels of earnings and maintenance payments.</P>
      <P>It is generally accepted that the most effective route out of poverty for lone parents is through paid employment. Accordingly, the policy is to encourage and facilitate lone parents in moving into the paid labour force so as to avoid long-term welfare dependency. The earnings disregard of &euro;146.50 per week is an important element of this policy. Treating other income in the same way as earnings would not be in keeping with this policy objective.</P>
      <P>I am satisfied that the social welfare arrangements in place for lone parents are effective in providing income support for lone parents while at the same time encouraging them to consider employment as a realistic alternative to long-term welfare dependency.</P>

      <P>The current rates structure, which comprises an under 66 and over 66 rate, was introduced in 1998 when the process of aligning payments of those over 66 years of age with the rate of old age contributory pension commenced. These arrangements reflect the fact that age 66 is the standard qualifying age for pension purposes under the social welfare system and, in keeping with the Government's commitment to older people, increased payments are generally made to those over age 66 years of age.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Since 1998, those over 66 years of age have received increases amounting to almost 61% while those under 66 years of age have seen their payment increase by about 44%. I do not regard the existing structure as anomalous. As I have already indicated, the Government is committed to bringing widow's and widower's contributory <Col N="1187" />rates for those over age 66 to the same level as the old age contributory pension.

      <P>My Department's school meals programme provides funding for the urban school meals scheme which operates in conjunction with certain local authorities as well as the local projects school meals scheme which supports innovative projects in both urban and rural areas.</P>
      <P>In 2002, 380 schools, with a total of over 60,000 pupils, benefited from the urban school meals scheme and this year a similar number of pupils will benefit from the scheme. Some 105 schools and voluntary organisations received funding which further benefited over 11,000 children under the local projects school meals scheme in 2002.</P>
      <P>The total funding for school meals this year is &euro;4.37 million. Some 145 schools and voluntary organisations will have received funding under the local projects scheme by the end of the current school year, benefiting some 15,500 children. The local projects school meals scheme is focusing on schools with high levels of disadvantaged pupils and is being promoted mainly through the framework of the Department of Education and Science's school completion programme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is difficult to estimate the cost of providing school meals to all disadvantaged children as the costs for each school vary depending on the meals provided and the facilities that the school can provide. A number of options for such an extension were examined in a recent review of the school meals programme by a departmental <Col N="1188" />working group. The working group estimated that up to 220,000 pupils in both national and secondary schools could eventually come within the scope of a revised school meals programme. The group estimated that the cost of providing meals, based on existing data as well as the distribution of meal types and the likely take-up rate could eventually reach &euro;50 million per annum. The project referred to was established by the Northside Partnership to combat the high incidence of early school leaving in the area. The schools in question, which are part of this project, have received funding from my Department since December 2000. The school meals programme provides funding for the food element of projects. The provision of staff does not come within the scope of the programme.</P>
    <P>Currently, operational staff for the project in question are provided through a FÁS scheme. I understand that when the contracts of the existing staff expire, FÁS will be supplying replacements thus ensuring the continuity of the project while fulfilling the FÁS training mandate. In addition, the co-ordinator of the project will remain in the post for the forthcoming school year.</P>

      <P>My Department assists and encourages long-term unemployed and other long-term welfare recipients to return to work, training or further education through a range of measures administered by the Department's employment support service.</P>
      <P>One significant measure is the back to work allowance scheme which incentivises and encourages long-term unemployed people, lone parents and certain persons with disabilities to return to work by allowing them to retain part of their social welfare payment when they take up employment or self-employment. There are 20,965 participants in the scheme, over half of whom are engaged in a wide range of self-employment options.</P>
      <P>Another measure offered by my Department's employment support service is the back to education allowance programme. This is a second chance educational opportunities programme designed to encourage and facilitate unemployed people, lone parents and people with disabilities to improve their skills and qualifications with a view to returning to the work force.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1189" />A range of other supports is provided by the Department's locally based jobs facilitators. Their primary role is to assist the long-term unemployed and other long-term welfare dependants back to work, training or further education by providing them on an individual basis with assistance to access the necessary programmes or supports which their circumstances demand. Jobs facilitators have access to some additional services, including funding to arrange specialised training and supports for those who are distant from the labour market and who need additional help in preparing them for further training and employment.</P>
    <P>Other supports targeted specifically at the long-term unemployed include the operation of the employment action plan, EAP, under which customers on the live register are systematically referred to FÁS for guidance, intervention or placement. The programme for Government contains a commitment that all customers on the live register will be offered similar referral to FÁS. The process of extending the EAP to all people over six months on the live register commenced in the Dublin region in May 2003 and discussions are taking place with a view to commencing this process in all other regions before the end of 2003.</P>
    <P>Within the EAP process, certain customers may face severe employability issues which are not amenable to resolution within the normal range of interventions available. To assist such customers a high supports process was established earlier this year by the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment. As part of this process local networks of relevant service providers are being established in certain areas in conjunction with FÁS and my Department's job facilitators. People identified as suffering severe employability issues will be referred to the local networks and appropriate avenues will be identified to enhance employability. A special fund is available to purchase specialist training or interventions that may be required to assist an individual.</P>
    <P>The Department is also engaged at present with the Economic and Social Research Institute in research to identify, at an early stage, those customers on the live register who are likely to suffer employability difficulties. This will facilitate the availability of more appropriate and timely interventions to address these difficulties and will help prevent future long-term unemployment. It is hoped that the results of this research will be available by August 2003.</P>
    <P>My Department, through its employment support and other services, has been very successful in assisting people away from the cycle of long-term unemployment and back into the workforce. The services provided are under constant review and I am satisfied as to their continued relevance and flexibility in today's job market.</P>

      <P>The core objective of chapter five of Sustaining Progress is the creation of a fairer and more inclusive society, where people have adequate resources and opportunities to live with dignity and have access to quality public services.</P>
      <P>Recognising that an extensive framework for addressing poverty, social inclusion and equality concerns is already in place, Sustaining Progress identifies key principles for action. These are: the implementation of the key social inclusion and equality strategies, including the National Anti-Poverty Strategy; the targeting of key resources to ensure the achievement of the strategic objectives identified in those strategies; the identification of emerging causes of exclusion or inequality; the development of a data framework to support evidence-based policy making and to support the evaluation, monitoring and review of social inclusion programmes and initiatives, and the review and revision, as appropriate, of social inclusion programmes and initiatives.</P>
      <P>The office for social inclusion, based in my Department, is currently engaged in a process which is directly addressing these principles, through the framing of Ireland's second National Action Plan against Poverty and Social Exclusion, NAPincl. The NAPincl, which must be submitted to the EU by end July 2003, will cover the period from mid-2003 to 2005 and will set out the social inclusion targets and actions for the next two years in line with a set of objectives agreed by the EU Council of Ministers in December 2002. The plan will draw to a significant extent on the revised National Anti-Poverty Strategy and on the commitments contained in Sustaining Progress.</P>
      <P>As part of the preparation of the plan, the office for social inclusion in conjunction with the Combat Poverty Agency has engaged in a wide-ranging consultation process with all the relevant actors. Progress towards the achievement of the objectives and targets in the NAPincl will be monitored through the use of indicators agreed at EU level, as well as through the use of supplementary national indicators where relevant. I am confident that the delivery of the commitments contained in Sustaining Progress will significantly improve the position of people in poverty and of an inclusive society.</P>

      <P>In addition to satisfying the relevant contribution conditions, those applying for retirement pension at age 65 must be retired from employment or self-employment. Retirement is defined as not having earnings from employment of more than &euro;38 per week or earnings from self-employment of more than &euro;3,174 per annum.</P>
      <P>The retirement pension was introduced in 1970 and was intended to bridge the gap between retirement at 65 and the pension age for social welfare purposes, which at the time was 70 years of age. The qualifying age for old age pension was subsequently reduced over time to 66 years of age. There is no retirement condition associated with old age contributory or non-contributory pensions which are both payable at 66 years of age.</P>
      <P>The Government is committed, as part of the programme for Government, to removing the requirement to retire at 65 in order to receive a retirement pension. Progress in this regard will be made as soon as possible, having regard to the availability of resources and the priority attaching to other elements of the Government programme.</P>

      <P>The recent publication, Poverty and Inequality, by the Combat Poverty Agency and the Equality Authority, which explores the potential for the development of an integrated poverty and equality proofing process, is both welcome and timely. It is welcome because it can contribute significantly to the development of the policy proofing process, which is now widely recognised as a vital tool in promoting equality and social inclusion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1192" />It is timely since it comes at a time when the office for social inclusion in my Department is actively pursuing the development of an enhanced poverty proofing process in line with the requirements of the revised National Anti-Poverty Strategy. The NAPS states that the office for social inclusion will develop a more effective poverty proofing process and that, in doing so, it will take full account of the conclusions and recommendations of the National Economic and Social Council in its review of the poverty proofing process. A key recommendation of this review by the NESC was that poverty proofing should ultimately be integrated with other proofing mechanisms &ndash; for example, gender and equality proofing, rural proofing and environmental proofing.</P>
    <P>The Poverty and Inequality report provides a useful analysis of the links between poverty and discrimination under the nine grounds of the equality legislation. It highlights the fact that there are clear parallels to be drawn between the groups identified in the NAPS as being vulnerable to poverty and exclusion and the grounds for discrimination set out in the equality legislation.</P>
    <P>My Department, together with the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform and the Equality Authority, is already seeking to advance some of the recommendations of the report by testing the application of an integrated poverty and equality proofing process on a pilot basis.</P>

      <P>The revised National Anti-Poverty Strategy sets out a series of targets in relation to children and young people. The overall objective, in line with the National Children's Strategy, is to eliminate child poverty and to move to a situation of greater equality for all children in terms of access to appropriate education, health and housing. It aims specifically to reduce the number of children who are consistently poor to below 2% by 2007 and to reduce the gap in low birth weight rates between children from the lowest and highest socio-economic group by 10% from the 2002 level by 2007.</P>
      <P>A key element in reducing the numbers of children in consistent poverty is through supporting and facilitating their parents in obtaining and maintaining employment. A number of policies are geared towards this objective &ndash; for example, child care provision and the earnings disregard for receipt of the one parent family payment.</P>
      <P>In addition, the NAPS sets a target that the basic level of child income support be set at 33% to 35% of the minimum adult social welfare rate by 2007. The target in respect of the lowest rates of social welfare is to achieve a rate of &euro;150 per week, in 2002 terms, to be met by 2007. Among the special initiatives to be undertaken during the period of the social partnership agreement, Sustaining Progress, is one dealing with ending child poverty. This initiative will be led by the office for social inclusion in my Department and is being developed at present.</P>
      <P>In tandem with the social partners, key Departments, the National Children's Office, the Combat Poverty Agency and other relevant bodies, the initiative will pursue a number of objectives identified in Sustaining Progress. These objectives include: better medical and health services within the community for young children and their parents; priority to early education and child care facilities for disadvantaged families; ensuring every child obtains a threshold of numeracy and literacy; accelerated provision of play environments for local communities; wider availability of parenting support services for families at risk; and maximising the efficacy of child income support arrangements.</P>
      <P>The Government recognises the importance of supporting and protecting families and is fully committed to achieving objectives and targets in the NAPS and in Sustaining Progress.</P>

      <P>The secondary benefits payable by my Department to certain categories of social welfare recipients, include free travel and fuel allowance and the household benefits package, which comprises the electricity-gas allowance, free television licence and telephone allowance. These are generally available to pensioners aged over 66 resident in the State in receipt of a qualifying payment who are living alone or only with certain excepted categories of people. They are also available to carers and people with disabilities under age 66 in receipt of certain social welfare-type payments who satisfy the qualifying criteria. Since May 2001 they are available to all <Col N="1195" />those aged over 70 residing in the State regardless of income or household composition. People aged 66 to 69 who do not receive a qualifying payment may have an entitlement to the household benefits package if they satisfy a means test and other qualifying criteria.</P>
      <P>Free travel is available to all those aged over 66 permanently residing in the State and to certain incapacitated people under 66. The fuel allowance applies to persons in receipt of long-term social welfare payments and who are unable to provide for their own heating needs. In order to be eligible, a person must be living alone or with people who come within certain categories and must also satisfy a means test. The free travel scheme provision for 2003 is &euro;47 million; &euro;87.20 million for fuel allowances, electricity-gas allowance, &euro;68.45 million; free television licence scheme, &euro;32.96 million; and telephone allowance &euro;80.39 million. All of these secondary benefits are paid by way of benefit-in-kind to the customer, except for the fuel allowance which is paid by way of an additional cash amount with his weekly social welfare payment.</P>

      <P>The purpose of the national fuel scheme is to assist householders who are in receipt of long-term social welfare or health board payments and who are unable to provide fully for their heating needs. A fuel allowance of &euro;9.00 per week is paid to eligible households while an additional &euro;3.90 per week is paid in smokeless zones, bringing the total amount in those areas to &euro;12.90 per week. These payments are made for the duration of the fuel season which lasts for 29 weeks.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The fuel allowances represent a contribution towards a person's normal heating expenses. They are not intended to meet the full cost. I would also point out that fuel allowances are not the sole mechanism through which assistance is provided to people with heating needs. Many households also qualify for electricity and gas allowances. In addition there is a facility available through the supplementary welfare allowance scheme to assist people in certain circumstances who have special heating needs. Improvements <Col N="1196" />have been made to the fuel allowance scheme in recent budgets. The means test has been eased and the duration of payment has been increased from 26 weeks to 29 weeks.</P>
    <P>The cost of the national fuel scheme in 2002 was &euro;80.5 million, of which &euro;67.5 million was spent on fuel allowances and &euro;13 million on smokeless fuel allowances. The ban on bituminous coal sales will be extended later this year to include Bray, Kilkenny, Sligo and Tralee at a cost to the scheme of &euro;356,000 in 2003 and &euro;860,000 in a full year. The significant increases in recent years in primary social welfare payment rates, such as the old age pension, have also improved the income position for people dependent on the social welfare system. Primary payment rates are payable for the full 52 weeks of the year and increases in these rates benefit a wider range of recipients. The question of further increases in the rates of fuel allowance or an extension of the fuel allowance season is a matter for consideration in a budgetary context.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 58 and 117 together.</P>
      <P>One of the key objectives of the 2003 social welfare budget package was to protect and, if possible, enhance the real value of all rates of payment. The budget made provision for increases in the main personal rates of weekly payments ranging from 5.1% to 7.6% as well as similar percentage increases in the weekly rate of qualified adult allowances. These increases were ahead of projected inflation rates.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Social welfare spending rose by over &euro;3.5 billion between 1997 and 2002, providing for increases in social welfare rates significantly ahead of the level of inflation. An additional &euro;833 million in social welfare spending is provided for during this year, and this will bring the projected level of annual spending to over &euro;10 billion for the first time. On an ongoing basis and as part of its programme of expenditure reviews of programme areas, my Department considers the operation of its schemes with a view to ensuring that poverty traps and disincentives to persons taking up employment are minimised. Enormous strides have been made in recent years in making <Col N="1197" />the social welfare system more employment-friendly and in providing support for persons in taking up employment.</P>
    <P>At a time of economic uncertainty, the increase in payment rates emphasises the Government's commitment to protecting those at highest risk. My colleagues and I are committed to safeguarding the position of all social welfare recipients and I look forward to making further progress, in the years ahead, on the achievement of our social inclusion commitments.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social and Family Affairs (Mary Coughlan)</NameTxt>
      <P>The report of the Institute of Public Health, Inequalities in Mortality 1989-98, has shown that the all-cause mortality rate in the lowest occupational groups was 100%-200% per cent higher than the rate in the highest occupational group. The figure quoted recently by the person concerned of an estimated 6,000 people dying prematurely due to poverty and inequality is derived from that report and refers to deaths on the whole island of Ireland.</P>
      <P>Health status and mortality rates are influenced by several factors. These include people's natural endowments, the physical and emotional nurturing they receive, the lifestyle they adopt, the degree to which the health services and the wider environment support and complement their attempts to prevent disease and to improve their health as well as the access they have to quality health and personal social services in times of need.</P>
      <P>There is often a complex interaction between determinants that can have a more adverse effect on health. For example, unemployment where it leads to social isolation and involves poor living conditions, in turn influences an individual's psychological and coping skills. Together these factors may lead to poor health. Ireland now has historically low levels of unemployment &ndash; 4.6% compared with 10.3% in 1997 &ndash; and has experienced a real decrease in long-term unemployment from 5.6% in 1997 to 1.4% now. Consistent poverty has fallen from 15.1% of the population in 1994 to 6.2% in 2000. These developments, as well as leading to an overall improvement in living standards, should be expected to have a beneficial impact on health, and on mortality rates.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The main objective of the Government's revised national anti-poverty strategy is to further reduce, and ideally eliminate, poverty in Ireland and to build a socially inclusive society. Maintaining unemployment at a low level will be a key part of the strategy. The strategy also addresses the issue of health inequalities with a key objective being to reduce the gap in premature mor<Col N="1198" />tality between the highest and lowest socio-economic groups by at least 10% for circulatory diseases, cancers and for injuries and poisoning by 2007. A wide range of actions across the whole spectrum of health services and in other sectors is required to achieve this target.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social and Family Affairs (Mary Coughlan)</NameTxt>
      <P>At present, some 17,500 customers are having deductions made from their current entitlements in respect of overpayments. Most of the deductions are in respect of overpayments which arose in previous years. A total of 38,628 overpayments, with a value of some &euro;28.74 million were recorded in 2002, while 17,724 cases with a value of some &euro;14.21million have been recorded to date this year. The number of overpayment cases is quite small relative to the number of payments issued. In 2002 some 938,000 weekly payments were made in respect of almost 1.5 million beneficiaries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The number of overpayments attributed to departmental error in 2002 was 2,849, with a value of some &euro;1.47 million. The number recorded so far this year is 1,365 with a value of some &euro;0.72 million. Overpayments attributed to departmental error constitute between 7% and 8% of all overpayment cases, and represented, in money terms, 5% of the total value of all overpayments. Some cases of departmental error arise where a person returns to work after payments have been prepared for issue. If such cases were to be amended it would result in payments being <Col N="1199" />delayed. Overpayments which arise in these cases are subject to recovery at a later date.</P>
    <P>The repayment of all social welfare overpayments is governed by a code of practice. The code requires that, in the context of overpayments, due account be taken of the interests of taxpayers and social insurance contributors who finance the various social welfare payments as well as the ability of the person concerned to repay. In this regard, every effort is to be made to recover overpayments in full.</P>
    <P>There is provision within the code, however, for repayment of an overpayment, to be deferred, suspended or the rate of repayment reduced, depending on the circumstances of each case. In the case of overpayments caused by departmental error, the code provides that repayment of an overpayment may be reduced or cancelled but only where the person could not reasonably have been expected to be aware of the error.</P>

The company in question has been examining the possibility of rebuilding its pig slaughtering plant in Roosky, County Roscommon, following the fire in the plant in May 2002. However, it was always anticipated that it would be some time before a final decision was taken. In this regard, Enterprise Ireland has been in regular contact with the company on its future plans.</P>
      <P>As part of a proposed investment in the rationalisation of slaughtering facilities in order to improve competitiveness, the company announced on Wednesday, 25 June 2003 that it does not propose to rebuild the slaughtering facility at Roosky but will develop its Roscrea and Edenderry plants with the creation of an additional 150 jobs. However, the cannery at Roosky will also be developed and a number of growth initiatives are being explored with Enterprise Ireland.</P>

      <P>The Pyramid Selling Act 1980 was introduced to deal with pyramid or multilevel selling as it is sometimes called. The Act defines in some detail what is called a scheme. The Act makes it an offence for a promoter or a participant in a scheme to induce or attempt to induce people to join a scheme. It is also an offence for a promoter or participant in a scheme to receive payment from participants by holding out that those participants will receive payments or benefits from introducing other persons into the scheme. Participants in these schemes have a right to have the amount paid by them for goods or an article returned to them in certain cases.</P>
      <P>If the Deputy feels that the scheme mentioned in her question might fall under the definition of a scheme in the Pyramid Selling Act 1980 she should contact the enforcement body for the Act, which is the Garda Bureau of Fraud Investigation. As always I would urge people to be vigilant in how they use their money. If a scheme sounds too good to be true it is probably just that &ndash; too good to be true.</P>

      <P>The pricing and underwriting of insurance is a matter for individual insurance companies and EU law prevents Governments from intervening directly in relation to premium levels or in respect of what risks they are prepared to underwrite.

      <P>In their assessment of risks in individual cases, insurers may consider that the existence of an endorsement on a motor licence is an indication of a higher risk and consequently a higher premium may be applied by the insurer.

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy)</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy is aware, in budget 1998 I introduced a system of capital allowances for expenditure on the construction or refurbishment of nursing homes that are registered with a health board. The purpose of this measure is to encourage investment in increased nursing home capacity and in improved facilities for the elderly and incapacitated for which there is a growing demand. In the Finance Act 2002 I extended the scope of this relief by providing capital allowances for expenditure incurred on the construction or refurbishment of housing units associated with a registered nursing home. This scheme acts as an incentive for the provision of suitable residential accommodation in caring for elderly persons who are no longer able to live alone without some level of care but who do not as yet need to transfer to full nursing home residence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under the normal self-assessment tax rules any person seeking to claim capital allowances in respect of a qualifying building would submit their claim on the appropriate tax return form. However, the form does not distinguish between capital allowances claimed in respect of nursing homes and on private convalescent facilities from those claimed in respect of other buildings entitled to capital allowances. Consequently it is not possible for Revenue to indicate the level of take-up of this specific incentive. In order to estimate the number of nursing homes that have <Col N="1205" />availed of the capital allowances scheme, officials from my Department have written to the Department of Health and Children requesting that it contact the relevant health boards and ascertain the number of private nursing homes that have been registered since the scheme was introduced, the number of beds in each nursing home and the construction cost of each building.</P>

      <P>Open recruitment competitions are held for appointment to certain posts in the Civil Service, including the post of executive officer, subject to the recruitment needs of the civil service. The Deputy may wish to note that the majority of vacancies in the post of executive officer occur in Dublin at present. Recruitment of executive officers to fill posts in provincial locations is normally undertaken as part of the executive officer competition. It is expected that the next competition to fill these posts in provincial locations will be held early next year. The Civil Service Commissioners will keep this matter under review.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy may wish to note that a confined competition for promotion to executive officer was announced in September 2002. This competition provides for the placing of candidates on panels for appointment to the post of executive officer in up to 24 provincial locations. An open competition for the recruitment of executive officers to posts in Dublin only was advertised in December 2002. The Civil Service Commissioners indicate that up to 74 candidates have been called to interview to date and further interviews will be arranged as appropriate.

    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>At the recent meeting of the European Council in Thessaloniki, the President of the European Convention, Mr Valéry Giscard dEstaing, presented the Heads of State and Government of the Union's member states with the Convention's Draft Treaty establishing a Constitution for Europe. The convention will now undertake some further technical work before completing its task on 10 July.</P>
      <P>The European Council welcomed the Convention's draft as &ldquo;a good basis for starting in the Intergovernmental Conference&rdquo; which will begin its work in the autumn. It will be for the conference, acting unanimously, to decide on the new treaty's final contents. While there are some issues where it believes further work remains to be done, the Government regards the Convention's draft as positive and as representing significant progress towards making the union, its institutions and its working arrangements more easily understood and accessible to citizens.</P>
      <P>It does not, in any sense, represent a step towards a &ldquo;unitary European State.&rdquo; Key principles underpinning the Union's work &ndash; conferral, subsidiarity and proportionality &ndash; are strengthened and made clearer. For example, it is explicitly stated for the first time that competences, or powers, not conferred on the Union remain with the member states. A greater effort is made to set out more clearly the areas in which the Union can act. The balance between the Union and the member states is maintained, and no significant new area of activity is created for the Union.</P>
      <P>The role of national parliaments, in particular in overseeing implementation of the principle of subsidiarity, is strengthened. The proposals for the Union's institutions respect the principle of equality between member states regarding membership of the Commission and the Presidency of formations of the Council of Ministers. These are welcome developments which the Government fully supports. I also very much welcome the extensive public debate that has taken place throughout the progress of the convention's work, in the Oireachtas, especially within the Joint Committee on European Affairs, in the National Forum on Europe and elsewhere. I hope that this will continue as the work of the Intergovernmental Conference proceeds.</P>

      <P>As I have stated on a number of previous occasions, the individuals in question are members of Falun Gong, which was banned by the Chinese authorities in July 1999. Falun Gong is regarded by the Chinese Government as an &ldquo;evil cult&rdquo;. The persons concerned are Chinese citizens, and are, therefore, subject to the laws of China while in that country. As they are not Irish citizens, Ireland has no consular function in this matter, and the matter currently rests with the Chinese authorities.</P>
      <P>However, the Government takes concerns about human rights in China, including those of Falun Dafa members, seriously. Human rights, including the treatment of practitioners of Falun Dafa, are an integral part of our ongoing relationship with China. I raised this matter directly with the Chinese authorities during my visit to Beijing in January 2002. In December 2002, and again in February 2003, the Minister of State, Deputy Tom Kitt, reviewed these issues with concerned NGOs, including members of the Irish Falun Dafa Association. In May of this year, he also met the Chinese ambassador and raised our concerns over these cases with him.</P>
      <P>The EU discusses key human rights concerns with China within the framework of the EU-China Human Rights Dialogue. At the most recent session of the dialogue, which took place in Athens on 5-6 March this year, the EU conveyed our concerns in relation to the position of followers of Falun Gong. I am pleased to report that the Chinese interlocutors at the dialogue expressed a willingness to co-operate with the Office of the UN High Commission for Human Rights, and informed the EU side that they had extended invitations to visit China to the UN special rapporteurs on torture, and the right to education, and to the UN working group on arbitrary detention. I particularly welcome the fact that China has also issued a formal invitation to the UN Special Rapporteur on Freedom of Religion, Mr. Abdelfattah Amor.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At the External Relations Council in March this year, I discussed this matter with my EU colleagues, and it was agreed that the EU should convey its deep concern over reported violations of human rights in China, at the UN Commission on Human Rights. At the recent session of the CHR in Geneva, the EU urged China to take clear steps to improve the human rights situation generally, and more specifically with respect to freedoms of expression, religion and belief, which have a particular impact on practitioners of Falun Dafa. Officials in my Department, both in Dublin <Col N="1208" />and in the embassy at Beijing, continue to monitor these cases on an ongoing basis.</P>

      <P>The qualification in religion held by this person is not suitable for the purpose of teaching this subject as prescribed in the second level curriculum. If she intends to seek appointment as a teacher of religion, she will require a suitable third level qualification recognised for this purpose. It is a matter for the person in question to seek to address the shortfall in content or qualification by means of a course of relevant study at a recognised third level institution, as suggested in my reply of 12 June last. To do this it will be necessary for her to make contact with a third level institution offering courses suited to her needs. Information on courses offered by individual institutions is normally available from the registrar of the institution.</P>
      <P>Courses leading to qualifications with general recognition for the teaching of home economics and of religion are provided, among others, by St. Angela's College, Lough Gill, Sligo (Tel. 071-43580).</P>

      <P>Under my Department's higher education grant schemes, maintenance grants are available to eligible students pursuing approved undergraduate courses in other EU member states.

      <P>There is no bilateral agreement in place on adoption between the Republic of Belarus and the Irish Government. However, the Adoption Board has a working arrangement with the Belarussian authorities in relation to adoption. The Adoption Board is an independent statutory body with responsibility for the administration of the Adoption Acts, 1952 to 1998, including the issuing of declarations of eligibility and suitability to adopt abroad. My Department has forwarded the details of your question to the chief executive officer of the Adoption Board for direct reply to the Deputy.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>The drugs payment scheme, DPS, replaced the drug cost subsidisation, DCSS, and drugs refund, DRS, schemes in 1999. It was initially introduced on an administrative basis, with the intention that regulations to underpin its operation would be introduced following amendment of the relevant section of the 1970 Health Act. However, amendment of the Act was delayed, and, following further consideration and legal advice obtained <Col N="1214" />from the Attorney General's office in October 2000, regulations made under the existing section 59 of the 1970 Act, fixing the threshold for the new scheme at &euro;53.33, came into effect on 1 March 2001.</P>
      <P>Following a review by my Department of the position in relation to this issue, it was decided that a process should be put in place for assessing applications for refunds to people who may be owed money arising from the introduction of the DPS.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will be pleased to learn that the administrative arrangements have now been put in place and that applications for refunds will be invited through public notice this week.</P>
      <P>While 175,000 households were involved and there were 4.75 million transactions in this period, the General Medical Services (Payments) Board only has records of drugs purchased where the amount exceeded the threshold, in this case &euro;53.33. A person or family unit who spent less than this, but who was over the &euro;40.63 threshold of the previous scheme, will, therefore, not have their transactions on the board's files and it would not be possible to validate or calculate the refund due to them.</P>

      <P>My Department raised the matter with the Midland Health Board and I have been advised that the individual concerned retired from the position of staff nurse on 3 June 1999, and his gratuity and pension were inclusive of the long service increment appropriate to the staff nurse salary scale. The individual concerned appears to be claiming entitlement to payment of gratuity and pension applicable to the senior staff nurse grade.</P>
      <P>The senior staff nurse grade was introduced with effect from 5 November 1999, as part of the settlement of the nurses' strike of that year, five months after the individual concerned retired. As this person never held the grade of senior staff nurse, it is not possible to calculate his gratuity and pension payments based on the senior staff nurse salary scale. This position has been advised by the Department of Finance, which has overall responsibility for public service pensions policy.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Transport (Mr. Brennan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 105 and 106 together.</P>
      <P>The Government has approved the implementation on a phased basis of the recommendations of the taxi hardship panel which was the independent three person panel established to report in general terms on the nature and extent of extreme personal financial hardship that may have been experienced by individual taxi licence holders arising from loss of income as a direct result of the liberalisation of the taxi market. The report of the taxi hardship panel recommends the establishment of a scheme to provide payments to individual taxi licence holders who fall into one of six categories that the panel assessed as having suffered extreme personal financial hardship arising from taxi liberalisation. Category 5 of the panel report refers to particular circumstances where large loan repayments are outstanding and these have been secured against the family home.</P>
      <P>I am aware of the recent report of the EU committee on petitions in relation to their fact-finding mission to Ireland in connection with the effects of taxi liberalisation. I met with the delegation from the committee on 4 April 2003 and outlined the background to taxi liberalisation and the establishment of the independent three person taxi hardship panel to them. I also explained that based on legal precedent there can be no legal duty on the State to compensate taxi licence holders in relation to open market licence values that may have existed prior to liberalisation. This position remains unchanged and I have no proposals for any payments beyond the recommendations of the panel report.</P>
      <P>The design and administration of a scheme to implement the recommendations of the taxi hardship panel and the arrangements to facilitate the making of payments to eligible persons is being progressed as quickly as possible so as to ensure that applications are dealt with on a confidential and objective basis. Every effort is being made to put in place a structure to facilitate the commencement of payments on the basis of the panel recommendations as soon as possible.</P>

      <P>In consultation with the Mountaineering Council of Ireland, MCI, and with the endorsement of the Wicklow Mountains National Park Council, it has been the policy of my Department that any organised walks in Wicklow Mountains National Park involving in excess of 50 persons should require a permit from the National Park management which may or may not be granted, depending on the circumstances prevailing at the time of an application. This permitting arrangement is not statutorily based, but is considered prudent given the large numbers of persons who frequent the park and the sensitive nature of some areas of the park and its landscape.</P>
      <P>Discussions took place earlier this year between my Department and the president of the Irish Ramblers Club, which is affiliated to the MCI, about the organisation of the Lug Walk in the Wicklow Mountains National Park on 21 June 2003. In seeking a permit for the walk on 14 April 2003, the club indicated that up to 250 persons would take part in this event, and a permit in relation to this proposal was refused by the national park management.</P>
      <P>However, following further discussions, the club indicated on 5 June 2003 that it was in a position to restrict the numbers significantly from the original figure, to 120 persons. In the light of this development, it was decided to grant a permit to the Irish Ramblers Club &ndash; restricted to 120 participants &ndash; in view of the imminence of the event which had already been publicised and was established over many years; and the fact that the club had made a significant gesture in reducing the numbers participating from 250 to 120. My Department does not regard this decision as establishing a precedent for other group walks or for the organisation of the Lug Walk in future. As already outlined, the stated policy in relation to organised walks is to require specific consultation of organised walks involving more than 50 people on the basis of prevailing and evolving circumstances.</P>
      <P>In granting the permit, my Department advised the club that it should endeavour to keep the numbers participating in the walk as low as possible. I am informed that the club complied with this advice and that the eventual number which participated in the Lug Walk was 113 persons, with 106 persons completing the event.</P>

      <P>The promotion of continuity and stability in family life is a primary goal for the Government. Our approach involves an increasing emphasis on preventing family breakdown in the first place through the development of marriage and relationship counselling services.</P>
      <P>The scheme of grants for voluntary organisations providing marriage, child and bereavement counselling services is a non-statutory scheme of once-off grants to voluntary organisations providing marriage counselling, child counselling in relation to parental separation, marriage preparation courses and bereavement counselling and support services. The focus of the scheme is on support for the voluntary sector with the development of counselling and support services in the community for families, to enhance stability in family life, and to assist families and their members to deal with difficult periods which they may experience.</P>
      <P>Government grant aid for the development of marriage, child and relationship counselling services in the voluntary sector has been increased from &euro;900,000 in 1997 to &euro;6.6 million in 2002. There are now more than 460 voluntary and community groups throughout the country providing the services. The organisation referred to has received funding under this scheme in the past.</P>
      <P>The scheme of grants to voluntary organisations providing marriage, child and bereavement counselling services is now administered by the Family Support Agency, which I have recently established under the Family Support Agency Act 2002. I hope to be in a position to announce details of grants to be made available under the 2003 grants scheme shortly.</P>

      <P>The use of advertising is a vital medium in delivering this Government's commitment to ensuring that all of our citizens are fully aware of their social welfare entitlements and are notified about improvements and changes affecting their payments and services.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My Department's expenditure on public relations consultancy in 2002 was &euro;6,534. There was no expenditure of this nature in 2001 or in 2003 to date. Expenditure on advertising in 2001 was &euro;1,519,053, in 2002 it was &euro;1,319,239 and in 2003 to date it has amounted to &euro;71,352. In line with the reduced financial allocations the adver<Col N="1224" />tising budget has been reduced in 2003 to &euro;520,000. There was no expenditure on marketing during this period.</P>
    <P>Expenditure on advertising during 2002 covered a wide range of departmental schemes and services and included three information campaigns relating to the promotion of the farm assist scheme among low income farmers; the promotion of awareness of the personal public service number and its use as the key to accessing public services; and the Budget 2003 information campaign which advised social welfare customers on when and how their budget increases would be paid.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that expenditure on advertising served to promote awareness and understanding of our schemes and services and provides excellent value for money.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social and Family Affairs (Mary Coughlan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 120 and 121 together.</P>
      <P>The old age non-contributory pension and the widower's non-contributory pension are social assistance schemes which are designed to provide financial support for older people and widowers who do not qualify for one of the contributory pension schemes.</P>
      <P>In common with other social assistance schemes, these schemes feature a means test which is intended to ensure that available resources are targeted at those who are most in need. The operation of the means test is kept under review and changes are made as required.</P>
      <P>Budget 2003 provided for a &euro;10 per week increase, from &euro;134 to &euro;144, in the rate of old age non-contributory pension and widower's non-contributory pension payable to those aged 66 or over. This was a significant first step towards the achievement of the commitment contained in An Agreed Programme for Government to increase the rate of the basic State pension to &euro;200 by 2007. Recipients of widower's non-contributory pension aged under 66 received an increase of &euro;7 per week thereby increasing the value of the payment in real terms.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These measures, allied with the significant increase over the period since 1997, reflect the emphasis the Government has placed on improv<Col N="1225" />ing the personal pension rates of our older people and widowers which I believe is the most effective and equitable way of ensuring that their position is improved.</P>
    <P>The programme for Government contains a number of specific commitments for further improvements in social welfare rates of payment over the period of this Government. I look forward to progressing these and other social welfare commitments in the context of future budgets, having regard to the available budgetary resources.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan" hpid="Mary Coughlan Mary Coughlan">

      <P>A range of improvements has been made in the maternity benefit scheme in recent years, including an extension of cover to the self-employed from April 1997 and an increase in the duration of the benefit by four extra weeks from February 2001. The minimum and maximum levels of the benefit have also been increased. Since 1997, the minimum rate of maternity benefit has increased by 38.2%. From February 2001, credited contributions are awarded during periods of additional maternity leave, which was also increased from four to eight weeks at the same time. These credited contributions protect the social insurance entitlements of women who take additional &ldquo;unpaid&rdquo; maternity leave.</P>
      <P>Many of the above improvements follow on from the recommendations of the PPF working group on the review and improvement of the maternity protection legislation, which was published in January 2001. The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform is currently progressing the Maternity Protection (Amendment) Bill 2003 through the Houses of the Oireachtas. This Bill is designed to implement the remaining recommendations of the PPF working group, in so far as they relate to entitlement to maternity leave.</P>
      <P>As entitlement to maternity benefit is contingent on the woman qualifying for maternity leave in the first instance, some of the proposals contained in the Maternity Protection (Amendment) Bill will have implications for the operation of the maternity benefit scheme. I intend to bring forward appropriate proposals in relation to the maternity benefit scheme following the enactment of the Maternity Protection (Amendment) Bill.</P>

      <P>The Government is committed to bringing the maximum rate of the widow's and widower's contributory pension for those over 66 years of age into line with that of the old age contributory pension. A number of special increases have been granted in recent budgets in pursuit of this objective and the maximum rate now stands at &euro;155.80 per week compared with a rate of &euro;157.30 for the old age contributory pension.</P>
      <P>Widows and widowers are also benefiting from the changes in the free schemes announced over a number of budgets. Under these arrangements, all persons aged over 70 years of age are now entitled to the full range of schemes regardless of their means or household composition.</P>
      <P>In Budget 2000, a new scheme was introduced, the widowed parent grant, to help with the special needs of this particular group in the immediate aftermath of a bereavement. This involves the payment of a special grant of &euro;2,500 to a widow/or widower with dependent children.</P>
      <P>The increase in the rates of child benefit are of benefit to widows and widowers with children. Since 1997, the monthly rates of child benefit have been increased dramatically. Since April this year, monthly child benefit payments are &euro;125.60 per month for each of the first and second children and &euro;157.30 per month for the third and subsequent children.</P>
      <P>In addition, there are special arrangements in place whereby a person in receipt of a widow or widower's pension or one-parent family payment may also receive half-rate disability benefit or unemployment benefit in addition to their pension. This provision applies where the person satisfies the relevant contribution conditions and dual payment can continue for up to 15 months. Social welfare provision for widows and widowers will be kept under review in a budgetary context.</P>

      <P>Ireland has concluded bilateral social security agreements with seven countries: Austria, Australia, Canada, New Zealand, the United Kingdom, the USA and Switzerland. Ireland also entered into a bilateral understanding with Que<Col N="1228" />bec on 1 October 1994. All of these agreements are currently in operation. A further agreement has been negotiated with the Republic of Korea, and full ratification of this agreement is expected shortly. The main purpose of these agreements is to protect the social security pension rights of workers who have worked both in Ireland and the other country to which the agreements apply.</P>
      <P>The bilateral agreements mainly provide for the adding together of periods of insurance and, where appropriate, periods treated as equivalent to periods of insurance completed in Ireland and the other country involved, for the purposes of calculating and awarding pensions. These pensions can also be paid to those residing in the territory of the other country. Consideration is given to concluding further such bilateral agreements, if warranted by the numbers employed in Ireland and the other country concerned, or where a request is received from another country.</P>
