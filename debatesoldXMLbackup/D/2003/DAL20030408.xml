      <P>Arising from the statistical reply that I do not have sight of, will the Minister of State indicate what trends have been established in the information and convey them to the House? What jurisdictions are likely to present the greatest opportunities for further improvements in our exports?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin" hpid="Ms Hanafin Ms Hanafin">
      <NameTxt>Ms Hanafin</NameTxt>
      <P>There are a number of different headings for the export of beef. Carcases, half carcases, &ldquo;compensated&rdquo; quarters, forequarters, hindquarters and boneless all come under the heading of fresh or chilled meat of bovine animals. Categories such as &ldquo;compensated&rdquo; quarters, forequarters, hindquarters, boneless forequarters, crop, chuck and blade and brisket cuts come under the headings of frozen meat of bovine animals. The Deputy will be able to extrapolate trends from the information I will make available to him. I am sure it will be of interest to Members that 214,454 tonnes of beef were exported in 2001 and this increased to 333,933 tonnes in 2002.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin" hpid="Ms Hanafin Ms Hanafin">
      <NameTxt>Ms Hanafin</NameTxt>
      <P>The information I have circulated is divided into EU and non-EU countries. A quick glance shows that exports to Great Britain increased from 94,229 in 2001 to 115,823 in 2002. Similarly, exports to Russia increased from 32,398 in 2001 to 104,452.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Timmins</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister of State for her reply. The increase in British trade is due to the foot and mouth disease crisis in Britain. Only <Col N="896" /> for this, our beef trade would have collapsed by this stage. Will the Minister of State agree with the other Whips to allot time to discuss the serious issue of difficulties in agriculture?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
      <P>I would certainly support Deputy Timmins's request for a debate whether it arises or not. In looking at the classification of beef exports in 2002, it is still the case that this country is 1000% self-sufficient in beef. For every ten animals raised here, nine have to be exported. Is this still the ratio we are talking about? If this is the case, can the Minister of State say if there is a policy initiative to diversify agriculture so we are not as vulnerable to the vagaries of the export market which will, in the current international climate, make it more difficult to predict where our cattle will go in the future?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin" hpid="Ms Hanafin Ms Hanafin">
      <NameTxt>Ms Hanafin</NameTxt>
      <P>We export 90% of our agricultural products and that is why we have strict regulations and guidelines in that area. The Minister and Ministers of State are constantly examining ways of diversifying and making the best use of the land we have.</P>

      <P>The Department of the Taoiseach chairs an interdepartmental group of assistant <Col N="900" /> secretaries general who monitor the implementation of the Government's strategy for the development of the information society in Ireland. That strategy is set out in the document, New Connections, published in April 2002.</P>
      <P>Considerable progress continues to be made in the delivery of e-government with Departments and agencies engaged in a wide range of initiatives to put their services on-line. Examples of e-public services now available include on-line services provided by Revenue, the Civil Service Commission and the Land Registry.</P>
      <P>Central to the delivery of e-public services is the public services broker which will provide a gateway for the management of access by citizens to on-line services. The broker is being developed by the Reach Agency under the aegis of the Department of Social and Family Affairs. A report of progress in implementing the recommendations in New Connections has recently been published and is available on the Department of the Taoiseach's website. Ireland continues to perform excellently by international comparison for its progress in the delivery of e-government.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister of State alarmed, as I am, at the decline in take-up of science and IT subjects at school and college levels? This is undermining our long-term attractiveness <Col N="901" /> as a location for this important sector. While Government efforts in putting hardware into certain areas may be succeeding, a serious problem is developing in the education area which she and her Government ought to address.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin" hpid="Ms Hanafin Ms Hanafin">
      <NameTxt>Ms Hanafin</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a source of worry that not enough students are taking science subjects, particularly at second level. That is an issue which the Minister for Education and Science has tackled and continues to tackle in terms of the provision of facilities for the technological side of it. The Deputy will be aware that since 1998, almost &euro;140 million has been made available to schools in respect of the information society and the provision of the necessary hardware for second level schools. To date, substantial capital grants have been made available to ensure that students at primary and second level have the necessary computer facilities. The national centre for technology in education is currently undertaking a census of all schools to determine their infrastructural development needs. The next stage will be to determine how we can integrate the use of computers into the curriculum. For many people, the computer class is a separate class but computers are not used as an integral part of the teaching of history or geography. That is something that is being looked at now through the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment.</P>
      <P>Another interest for the education sector would be the rolling out of broadband connectivity, the coming on stream of the availability of flat rate Internet access, etc. and the initiatives being taken to encourage people to take more science subjects. The special grants given to schools for science equipment and the special grants given to schools for every student doing science is a way of encouraging students to take those subjects. There is a need also to encourage more science graduates to teach science subjects because the difficulty is that they are now able to get good jobs in industry and are not being attracted into secondary schools to teach. That is another area that needs to be tackled. Research and development is a central part of the Government's platform to ensure we get investment into the country. The number of computer and technology companies coming here is essential for the high level investment we enjoy. I agree with the Deputy that is something that starts at primary level.</P>

      <P>In her reply, the Minister of State stated that &euro;140 million was provided for the purchase of computers for schools and so on. When the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Martin, was Minister for Education and Science, he made a big play about the amount of equipment going into schools, particularly primary schools. Does the Minister of State agree that many of those computers are lying idle in classrooms because the teachers do not have the expertise to work them? Does she also agree that <Col N="902" /> there is a shortfall in inservice training for teachers on the operation of computers? Will the Minister of State relay that concern to the Minister for Education and Science or is it something of which she is aware?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin" hpid="Ms Hanafin Ms Hanafin">
      <NameTxt>Ms Hanafin</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not accept the Deputy's last comment because intensive inservice training was made available to teachers at both primary and secondary level. A number of them who would not be directly involved in the teaching of computers have undertaken these courses. The provision of the hardware has ensured that from a position in 1998 where there was one computer for every 35 pupils, it is now the case that for every 11 pupils there is at least one computer in primary level and one computer for every nine pupils at second level, which is real progress. The dedication and commitment of teachers who have undertaken these courses shows that they are willing to try to integrate the use of computers in their own curriculum subjects.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister of State agree that she is almost alone in expressing confidence in the measures the Government has put in place to increase participation in science? Does she agree also that the problem in science is that we are unique in Europe in having no practical aspect to the examination of science, that points are extremely difficult to get in science and, as a result, pupils are not taking up the subject? In terms of her optimism about primary level, 12 years after the proposal to introduce science in the primary curriculum was initiated, only 6,000 teachers have completed training in the teaching of science and only 300 schools have done anything in the area of science. The Minister of State's confidence is misplaced and I ask her, in her very influential position in Government, to inject some urgency into addressing the area of science and IT in education.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin" hpid="Ms Hanafin Ms Hanafin">
      <NameTxt>Ms Hanafin</NameTxt>
      <P>I indicated at the outset that it was a cause for concern that not enough students were taking science or that there were not enough science graduates willing to teach science. However, the Deputy will be aware that the report on the teaching of sciences in schools was presented to the Minister last year. It contained a wide range of recommendations and proposals which have been taken on board.</P>
      <P>It will take some time. There are a number of issues like those mentioned by the Deputy, including the number of points, but one also must be conscious of an already overloaded curriculum which needs to be looked at, both at primary and second level.</P>
      <P>In terms of the broader educational value of science and its importance in the long-term investment of the economy, I accept there is more that needs to be done, not only from the point of view of providing the infrastructure such as the practical facilities but in training teachers and encouraging students to take on the subjects.</P>

      <P>Is the Minister of State aware that there are thousands of children, particularly in primary schools, who have been doing science long before this debate started recently? Does she accept that the problem seems to be in second level, where not enough students will take the science subjects, that there is a crisis, and that we need more students doing science?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin" hpid="Ms Hanafin Ms Hanafin">
      <NameTxt>Ms Hanafin</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware of schools which have made great advances in teaching science particularly of a practical nature, to the extent that in recent years the young scientist exhibition includes a section for primary schools, and that is to encourage all of those students.</P>
      <P>Many schools make science a compulsory subject for junior certificate to give everybody a basic foundation in science. The difficulty which then arises is that, in asking students to choose a maximum of six or seven subjects for leaving certificate, they are not then choosing physics, chemistry and biology. There is certainly a difficulty with physics and chemistry. Biology seems to be the more popular subject, particularly among girls. Certainly there needs to be much more done by way of encouragement in that regard.</P>

Is she concerned, for instance, with the fall in the number of students who are doing higher mathematics at leaving certificate level? In higher mathematics there is no equipment required. Essentially, unless people have some competence in higher mathematics at leaving certificate level, they have no capacity to do engineering, for instance, and they find themselves barred from a significant number courses. Is she concerned that in quite a number of schools the quality of science equipment is so poor that the teaching of scientific subjects at second level is seriously hindered, and there are schools where it is doubtful that the science equipment would pass a check by the health and safety authority?</P>

      <P>My responsibility in this area is co-ordinating the information society agenda, but I am aware of the issue raised by Deputy Burton. It particularly came to light last year with the announcement of the acceptances of the CAO offers, and the vacancies which exist in courses throughout the country.</P>
      <P>I am equally aware that courses tend to be affected by trends and popularity. For a long time people did nothing other than business management degrees. There was a time everybody was going for the social sciences, whereas now they are not going for that area either. Courses tend to be popular in cycles.</P>
      <P>Last year there was a slight downturn in the technological industry. That might have had a bearing on people's decisions on whether to go into that area, particularly with a view to long-term employment, but I am confident that that can change also.</P>

      <P>Will the Minister outline exactly and in as much detail as she can the problem regarding the public service broker initiative? I understand there are technical problems. Is it the case that the wrong technology was picked and that this technology has failed in other countries?</P>
      <P>Does the Minister agree that providing computers in schools should be about much more than providing so many computers per student population? Is she aware of the progress that has been made in schools in Northern Ireland in the area of computer education? Northern Ireland is far ahead of us because its Government did more than just supplying computers to schools. It made sure a programme of IT education was implemented also. Many schools here have done their own thing and purchased different types of computers. There has been no co-ordination. Many of these computers are now obsolete and the schools are finding it difficult to replace them. Has the Minister, in her role as e-Minister, plans to co-ordinate this effort across the sector to ensure that value for money is obtained for the taxpayer?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Will the Minister explain what has happened to the e-health project? At the moment, purchasing of materials for the health boards is done on an individual basis. This could be far more efficient if it was done centrally, using the purchasing power of all the health boards together. Does she <Col N="905" /> have information on progress in the other aspects of the e-health programme?</P>

      <P>The public service broker project has proceeded to the extent that the procurement and tendering process is now under way. The project is the responsibility of the Department of Social and Family Affairs. We are confident that this will be in place before the end of the year because the Government is according it high priority. By this mechanism we will be able to deliver our e-government services.</P>
      <P>In my reply, I said that of course ICT in schools was about more than the provision of computers. We have now moved on to consider their use in the curriculum, which has been successful in other countries. To this end, two officers within the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment have been appointed to consider the issue of delivering the curriculum via ICT at both primary and secondary level, which is necessary if we are to take the project to the next stage.</P>
      <P>The Deputy also asked about e-procurement. In general, as opposed to specifically in the area of health, quite a bit of headway has been made. The Deputy will be aware of the e-tenders website which is already established. That is the gateway for public sector procurement opportunities and we envisage some progress in that area. There are 10,000 registered suppliers to the site, 1,000 contracting authority users of the site and 45,000 visitors per month. As we continue to review progress we will be able to follow the development of a national tender management process over the next few years. At the moment, although we are able to give information, we do not actually accept tenders on-line as there are issues of security and so on to be overcome. However, the success of the site to date shows the potential it has.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms Hanafin</NameTxt>
      <P>The CSO has made considerable progress in developing electronic solutions for data capture in recent years. The CSO's e-public service strategy, published in December 2000, set out its strategy on the electronic collection and dissemination of statistics. It identified the CSO's main focus to be on the incremental improvement of the use of technology and related functionality in targeted areas and on the adaptation and use of systems being developed in the international statistical domain.</P>
      <P>The main sources of statistical data are household surveys, business surveys and administrative data. There are marked differences between these three data sources in utilising and benefiting from technology. For household surveys, computer assisted personal interviewing (CAPI) technologies, where interviewers record information collected on laptop computers, have been in use for the quarterly national household survey (QNHS) since its inception in 1997 and will be used for the new EU survey of income and living conditions (EU-SILC), which will commence in 2003.</P>
      <P>For business surveys, electronic versions of all statistical forms for businesses and associated metadata have been put on the CSO website. All of these forms can be downloaded and a number can be completed electronically and returned using the CSO secure deposit box. The release of this mechanism was one of the most significant developments during 2002. It facilitates the secure transmission of files to the CSO via the Internet. It is in use for a number of surveys at present and it is planned to extend its usage during 2003.</P>
      <P>However, it is the view of the CSO that electronic questionnaires alone do not provide the best value solution for data providers, especially when the provider is in regular and/or multiple surveys. The strategy of the CSO for business surveys is to develop ways of automatically extracting data from companies' financial and/or management information systems. Developments in the area of automated extraction from business systems include the collection of cattle prices from livestock marts and a project to modify hotel front office reservation software to enable the automatic extraction of data for the monthly national survey of accommodation establishments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At present, a wide range of administrative data is used for statistical purposes. The CSO makes use of administrative data in electronic format where feasible. Examples include foreign trade statistics and other information from the Office of the Revenue Commissioners, motor vehicle registration data from the Department of the Environment and Local Government, data from port authorities and payroll data from Departments and local authorities. Much of these data <Col N="907" /> are now transmitted to the CSO via the Internet using the CSO secure deposit box.</P>
    <P>The CSO recognises that in order to gain organisational efficiencies, any data collection initiatives must involve re-organisation of the back-end systems. The CSO is currently in the final stages of implementing its IT strategy. This is a major programme involving the migration of all systems from the mainframe to a PC environment. Crucially, it proposes a multi-channel architecture, which will enable the CSO to take advantage of Internet technologies in the acquisition and dissemination of information. It will also position the CSO to take advantage of the e-government initiatives as they come on stream.</P>
    <P>The office is also making increased use of scanning technologies to capture data from paper questionnaires. The recent 2002 census of population returns were scanned and recognised for the first time using state of the art technologies with significant improvements in the processing time.</P>
    <P>In addition to the examples I have quoted, a range of other initiatives is being undertaken by the CSO. When taken together with those previously mentioned, these will result in continued improvement in the service being provided by the CSO.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Despite the Minister's lengthy reply, the census of population did not seem to feature. This is the most important research conducted by the CSO and in this era of electronic capability it seems extraordinarily slow in producing results from such a vital survey. From a parochial point of view it is crucial for deciding constituency boundaries and is important for planning in many areas. Is there potential to speed up the processing of census data?</P>
      <P>It is extraordinary that the data on the number of people working in the public service, which surely must be within the Government brain, are six months in arrears. Why does it take the CSO six months to count the number of people on the public payroll?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin" hpid="Ms Hanafin Ms Hanafin">
      <NameTxt>Ms Hanafin</NameTxt>
      <P>I know I gave a lengthy if quickly read answer, during which I referred to the census of population in saying that for the first time all the paper questionnaires were scanned while processing the census. The Deputy will be aware that 1.3 million census forms were returned and subsequently scanned. The introduction of the new technology meant that the information became available more quickly than previously. The final results will be published within a two year framework, which is in line with best international practice and ahead of what we were able to do in the past. All the outputs from the 2002 census will be published on the CSO website using a special package which has considerably speeded up the process of making the information available. I do not have the information <Col N="908" /> regarding the other question the Deputy asked but I will get it for him.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB" hpid="Ms Burton Ms Burton">
      <NameTxt>Ms Burton</NameTxt>
      <P>Has the Minister of State a date on which she expects the information from the census to be available, with a view to briefing any boundary commission that may be required in the context of that information? Are arrangements available within the Government administration to share the expertise of the CSO with other bodies which are also involved in collecting information for Government, in the context of the CSO project and improving the efficiency of statistics? In particular, does the Minister of State see the CSO as being available to advise Garda management on the collection of crime statistics and the use of Garda computer systems for statistical collection? These Garda systems seem to be extraordinarily slow and inefficient in capturing data to such an extent that many crimes are no longer effectively reported and those that are reported are not effectively captured by the PULSE system. What the Minister of State said about the CSO and its management systems is truly impressive. Perhaps Garda management and the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform could do with some of its support.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin" hpid="Ms Hanafin Ms Hanafin">
      <NameTxt>Ms Hanafin</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the Deputy's comments about the CSO. It does a tremendous amount of work as a separate independent body and deserves all the credit it gets, particularly in relation to its advances in technology.</P>
      <P>The issue of the final results of the census, particularly the breakdown in local areas, was raised on the last occasion on which I took questions, about a month ago. At the time, I undertook to ask the CSO for the information which I forwarded the following day to Deputy Rabbitte and Fine Gael's spokesperson. I am told the end of June is the earliest the information, which will complete the full detail from the CSO, will be available.</P>
      <P>The National Statistics Board works in co-operation with the Department of the Taoiseach in helping to devise systems for sharing information throughout different Departments. It is currently undertaking a project on social statistics, upon which we have little knowledge. The data from the CSO are combined with the National Statistics Board's to ensure we get all the information we need.</P>

      <P>The Central Statistics Office produces quarterly and annual statistics on tourism and travel, which include data on the number of Irish residents who holiday abroad and their <Col N="909" /> estimated expenditure. It is estimated that there were 2.7 million overseas visits by Irish residents for reason of holiday, leisure and recreation in 2002, with a total expenditure of just over &euro;2,720 million. This compares with just over 2.4 million visits and expenditure of &euro;2,205 million in 2001, representing increases of 12.7% in visits and 23.4% in expenditure.

      <P>Is the Minister not concerned, in view of the exceptionally fine weather we have been enjoying, that Irish people are increasingly determined to holiday abroad?

They show that even though Irish people are travelling abroad, the number of tourists that visited Ireland last year was 3,243,000, which is slightly more than the previous year. That was encouraging.</P>
      <P>Obviously, the current world situation makes tourism difficult and it will be a challenge for my colleague, the Minister for Arts, Sport and Tourism, Deputy O'Donoghue. However, when Ministers travelled to various places abroad on behalf of the Government for St. Patrick's Day, we were given a substantial brief in relation to the tourism industry in this country. The brief dealt with Tourism Ireland and encouraging people to holiday here. I, like other Ministers, took every opportunity at major events, particularly in the United States, to encourage people to come to Ireland this year. I believe the slogan for this year is &ldquo;People, Place and Pace&rdquo;. Every effort is being made by the Government at every level to ensure the tourism industry continues to grow.</P>

      <P>As Minister with responsibility for the information society, I have a keen interest in promoting Ireland's overall e-readiness. In this regard, I recently published a progress report on the Government's action plan on the information society, New Connections. It outlines progress in <Col N="910" /> each of the seven strands underpinning the action plan. Furthermore, it enables us to determine what key issues need to be addressed to continue to drive the agenda forward.</P>
      <P>In terms of our overall e-readiness, Ireland's relative strengths lie in our consistently strong performance in the e-Europe benchmarking process &ndash; Ireland has performed strongest of all EU member states in the area of e-government since November 2001; our comprehensive information society strategy set out in New Connections, which captures the key policy commitments that need to be progressed to ensure our development as a leading information society; the establishment of the Cabinet committee on the information society and the appointment for the first time of a Minister responsible for that area, which provides the framework to co-ordinate and drive the agenda forward; our performance in attracting foreign direct investment, which is one of the strongest in the world relative to the size of our economy; and our &euro;2.5 billion investment to research and development under the NDP, which reflects our commitment to advanced science and technological research.</P>
      <P>One area of critical importance to our e-readiness is the development of the underlying telecommunications infrastructure. The Government is firmly committed to developing this infrastructure through our broadband strategy. Significant progress has been made under the strategy to date, with broadband roll-outs for the first of the pathfinder towns having recently been announced.</P>
      <P>In analysis of e-readiness, one must bear in mind that this is not a process which will occur overnight. The vast programme of change and innovation outlined in New Connections requires continual commitment and review. Through our various strategies, action plan and supporting frameworks, however, we are well positioned to deliver on this rapidly evolving agenda and to ensure that everybody can benefit from e-readiness. I am particularly interested not only in the area of education but also in the areas of lifelong learning and e-inclusion.</P>

      <P>Is the Minister of State concerned about reports, especially in the <i>Economist </i>intelligence unit, that we have slipped globally in this area? What will she do about those? Does she agree that one of the big issues relating to e-readiness is spam mail? Has the Minister of State examined this problem which is costing business millions of euro? In her capacity as Minister of State with responsibility for e-government, does she have any plans to introduce measures to deal with this troubling and difficult issue?</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms Hanafin</NameTxt>
      <P>Various reports have referred to Ireland's ranking in this regard but the results are different depending upon which report one reads. The report of the World Economic Forum was based on the availability of broadband here, while the network readiness index examined whether <Col N="911" /> we had the relevant skills and ICTs, as well as whether Government was using those services and processes. In the latter report, Ireland ranks 21 out of 82. On the broader framework, our rankings continue to be very high but, nevertheless, we are conscious of the progress that needs to be made across a wide range of issues.</P>
      <P>The problem of spam mail continues to arise and more so recently for some reason; I do not know whether it is because people are receiving more of it now than before. Obviously, we are all very conscious of it. Technological advances are required to screen out spam mail but that is in the hands of others. The Government will have to examine what steps are necessary to ensure that this cannot happen in future. Given that e-mail is so international, the issue of spam mail will be very difficult to control at a national level.</P>

      <P>Is the Minister of State aware that we have recently slipped from 24th to 28th place in the world rankings? Is she not seriously concerned about the cost to families of linking up to such systems? Children now expect to use IT as a matter of course but the cost is prohibitive. Almost nothing is happening to bring down the cost of Internet subscriptions in Ireland, which is exceptionally expensive. Many visitors to Ireland, including business visitors and executives who relocate here with their families, are genuinely shocked by the costs involved. We are developing a bad reputation in this area when we should stand out as one of the best countries in which to conduct e-business.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin" hpid="Ms Hanafin Ms Hanafin">
      <NameTxt>Ms Hanafin</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy referred to a report but there are so many of these reports that keep appearing at various levels. I am interested in the e-Government report which constantly shows Ireland in first or second place in this regard. Last month, the ComReg report on residential telecoms services showed that we have now passed out Germany and are ranked fifth <i>vis-à-vis</i> our European partners. We have also moved up the rankings when it comes to the provision of business telecommunications services and national leased-line services. We are very much to the fore in e-readiness and e-government and we are making huge progress in developing broadband services.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The rolling out of broadband to the areas identified in the strategy, including 19 towns immediately and 67 others that are coming on stream, will ensure that a higher speed of service is available, which will also be cheaper. ComReg has confirmed that the introduction of FRIACO is on schedule, while Eircom has already announced its rates. Flat-rate access is scheduled to be made available to retail consumers and businesses by the end of June. We have seen substantial competition between providers who are now offering cheaper monthly flat-rate access. The price of DSL has also been halved. All these factors are <Col N="912" /> contributing to ensuring that faster access is available. The aim of the New Connections document is to ensure that cheap, flat-rate access is always available in order to encourage more Internet usage.</P>

      <P>The old adage states that &ldquo;the devil can often cite scripture for his own purposes&rdquo; and, to some extent, the Minister of State is doing this. She says foreign investors are expressing confidence but last week the Irish Management Institute reported that one in four of the very same foreign investors lacked confidence in Ireland. Significantly, the issue they put at the top of their list was a lack of broadband access for people trying to do business here. Will the Minister of State examine the key issue of rolling out broadband access because it is a vital artery for doing business? Whatever about our performance in the area of e-government, if we cannot get business networks right, we cannot succeed.</P>

Investment has also been made in it although I admit it will take some months before we see the benefits of this.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy)</NameTxt>
      <P>As I indicated in my reply to Question No. 170 of 25 February last, the current estimated cost of implementing the economic and social infrastructure operational programme of the NDP is &euro;40 billion in 2002 prices as compared to an original <Col N="913" /> estimate of &euro;26 billion. The reasons for the increased cost are: construction industry inflation over the first three years of the plan was considerably in excess of that assumed; land costs, which impact heavily in the roads programme in particular, have also increased significantly; delays due to factors such as foot and mouth disease, environmental and archaeological factors and general planning considerations; and initial cost underestimation and subsequent re-specification of some projects.</P>
      <P>I am concerned that cost increases have reduced the quantum of output in the first three years of the plan. My Department commissioned evaluations of both the NDP roads and public transport programmes last year which analysed the reasons for increases in the cost of these programmes and put forward a series of recommendations in regard to project and programme management. These recommendations are now being addressed by the Department of Transport and the implementing agencies.</P>
      <P>In addition, Departments and implementing agencies are required to observe my Department's capital appraisal guidelines, the details of which I have set out in a separate reply to Question No. 31 on today's list. It is intended that revised capital appraisal guidelines will be issued by my Department later this year which will take account of experience in regard to NDP project management and appraisal, and compliance with which will be a condition of the agreement of a five year multi-annual framework for capital investment, which I also hope to conclude with my ministerial colleagues this year.</P>
      <P>Notwithstanding cost increases, very good progress has been made in the roll-out of the infrastructure programme of the NDP. In the first three years of the plan the Exchequer investment in infrastructure has amounted to &euro;9 billion or about &euro;1 billion more than the original commitment and the plan is delivering on projects of unprecedented size and scope. I have no doubt that by the end of 2006 the NDP will have brought about a real enhancement in the quality of our economic and social infrastructure.</P>

      <P>Does the Minister agree that an increase of 54% in the plan in only 24 months cannot be explained away by inflation in the sector, which was less than 10% in that period? Will he explain his reported comments that some of his ministerial colleagues are sponsoring proposals that are totally unrealistic? Will he give examples of these foolish proposals that are coming before Government and appear to be getting funding? Why is the taxpayer always the fall guy for all these overruns, whether they are explained by inflation, land costs or underestimates? Why is no one held accountable for the underestimation or mis-planning of these projects? When the cost of a project increases, will the Minister confirm that there is a genuine reappraisal to ascertain whether it should be dropped due to its <Col N="914" /> higher cost? Does that happen in Departments overseen by the Minister?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to the Deputy's first question concerning inflation, inflation in the construction industry in the period 2000 to 2002 was 30%.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB" hpid="Mr. R. Burton Mr. R. Burton">

    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pointing out what happened in these particular areas. As I set out in my reply there are increased costs in a wide variety of areas. I can give an example of what happened in regard to land costs in this period. With regard to land costs concerning the roads programme, while the average price of agricultural land was &euro;6,000 to &euro;8,000 per acre, there are incidents of the State having paid &euro;600,000 per acre in urban areas and &euro;30,000 per acre in rural areas.</P>
      <P>With regard to the Deputy's second question, I would not regard proposals put forward by Ministers as foolish, but not every proposal can be given number one priority. The Deputy and others have heard me say that on many occasions. This can be compared to what happens during an election. When a candidate calls to the door of a constituent, the constituent may promise the candidate his or her number one vote, but when the constituent votes he or she can only give his or her number one vote to one candidate and he or she can give his or her second, third and four preference to the other candidates. Ministers put a wide variety of proposals to Government, but given the economic and budgetary circumstances they must prioritise. One proposal must be number one, another number two, another number three, etc. Politicians the world over are loath to make those decisions. As I pointed out regarding this programme, the Exchequer contributed well over &euro;1 billion more than it was considered would be contributed at this stage.</P>
      <P>In my reply to Question No. 31, I provide guidelines as to the delegation of various Departments and the framework management regarding capital investment which involves matters to which the Deputy referred at various stages, including when the project is initiated and during the lead-up stages. Various delegatory functions are given to Departments to reassess projects at various stages, not only at the end.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>The cost of the roads programme is up 71%, the port tunnel project is up 300% and the Luas project is up 48%. It cannot be that these increased costs are simply overruns which could not be anticipated. Is part of the lack of realism to which the Minister referred the fact that the Government promised that, for example, hospital waiting lists would be eliminated in two years, that 200,000 people would be given a medical card and that an extra 2,000 gardaí would be on the beat? Is it not the case that Ministers and the Government, to which this Minister was <Col N="915" /> appointed, have created these expectations which they cannot now manage?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy is well aware, all those commitments are predicated on sound and sustainable public finances and economic growth levels to sustain them. Some of the proposals being put forward could not all be achieved in the same period even if we were to again experience average growth rates of 9% per annum for next ten years.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>As the House knows, Ireland has a very open economy which is more affected than many others by world economic conditions. The success of our economy relies significantly on continued inward investment and on the performance of the export sector in selling goods and services to other countries. My Department, therefore, keeps developments in the world economy under close and constant review.</P>
      <P>One of the most immediate issues for the global economic environment is how its prospects have been affected by recent development in relation to the war in Iraq. The assessment of my Department is that the implications of the war in Iraq for the world economy are closely linked to the impact on the price of oil. A sustained, significant increase in the price of oil, if it were to happen, would tend to reduce spending power and economic growth in our major trading partners. This would be likely to reduce our exports to those countries and could also add to inflation here. However, the House should note that there has as yet been no sustained significant increase in oil prices. The other main channels through which the war in Iraq could affect our economy are through consumer confidence levels, potentially lower foreign direct investment inflows and possible exchange rate developments. Given the uncertainty about possible developments in the Middle East, it is not possible to quantify with any accuracy what the overall impact on our economy might be.</P>
      <P>It should be remembered that the prospective outlook for the world economy was factored in to the budget day forecasts for the Irish economy. On budget day I specifically referred to the difficulties in the Middle East as one of the more obvious significant downside risks to those economic projections.</P>

      <P>Does the Minister accept that his statements on the economy at this point have as much credibility as the bluster from the gentle<Col N="916" /> man in the bunker in Baghdad, the Minister, Mohammed Saeed al-Sahaf? Does the Minister accept the true test of policy is when external conditions cease to be favourable and that he is failing the test spectacularly? Is he not concerned that the war is multiplying the problems for the Irish economy? Is he aware of the indicators every day &ndash; loss of jobs, serious loss of confidence among investors, loss of investments, loss of exports and loss of markets? Does he see that his policies are driving these indicators further downwards rather than helping to limit the damage the war is doing to the Irish economy?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>One can only judge the Irish economy on what happens here <i>vis-à-vis</i> other economies. The situation in Ireland is far more robust than in the case of any of our EU trading partners. For example, Germany has an unemployment rate of 10% and France has debt difficulties. Both have serious problems with the EU Stability and Growth Pact. My colleague in Britain, Gordon Brown, will present a budget tomorrow and will face a public sector borrowing requirement of approximately &euro;30 billion and rising, on top of a borrowing requirement this year of &euro;25 to &euro;30 billion. Unemployment in Ireland is approximately 5%, which is half the EU average.</P>
      <P>One should not talk the Irish economy down. Confidence is a very fragile thing. No matter how one measures growth prospects this year, the Irish economy will do better than that of any of our major trading partners in Europe. We are in a strong, healthy position to be able to adjust to whatever the world economic situation throws up. As ours is the most open economy in the EU, world trading conditions have an impact on Ireland. If we temper our expectations, do the sensible things and remain competitive we will survive this downturn in world economic conditions better than most.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB" hpid="Ms Burton Ms Burton">
      <NameTxt>Ms Burton</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that the most serious problem for the economy is the increasing rate of inflation, which is way above the indicated levels of inflation for other EU countries? The Government is driving that rate of inflation. Despite the risks of the war to the economy the Government appears to be taking no action. What action is it taking to lower the rate of inflation until it is more in line with our EU counterparts? That is the single biggest risk the economy is exposed to in the context of the war. Most of our inflation is Government-driven by the various taxes and price hikes the Administration has imposed since it was returned to office. Those hikes are contrary to the promises the Minister and his partners in government made to the electorate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a matter of statistical fact that most of the underlying causes of Irish inflation cannot be put down to the Government and its tax increases. The effect of the indirect tax increases I brought in through last year's budget <Col N="917" /> would amount to 0.85% to the consumer price index. I accept that inflation in Ireland is at a level we want to see moderated, as it is about twice that of the EU average. If we were to lose competitiveness at that rate there would be a consequential loss of jobs as we would lose export markets. I accept what the Deputy says.</P>
      <P>It is important to get our competitiveness in line and we can take the following matter forward: the European Central Bank will continue to have a policy of keeping EU-wide inflation at approximately 2% so unless we can get our inflation rate down to that level we will lose market share. However, it is also a factor that in any area which has to catch up there is higher inflation in some parts of that area. The Irish economy is in a strong position to withstand the exigencies of the war and the present economic situation.</P>

      <P>I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that a very significant body of instructions is issued to inspectors of taxes. The Deputy can get a flavour of these by referring to the freedom of information section on the Revenue website. In addition to the formal written instructions, extensive training is provided in accountancy, tax law and all aspects of tax administration. All operations carried out by inspectors of taxes are under the general control and management of the Revenue Commissioners. In line with best practice, all areas operate under the principles laid down in the Revenue statement of strategy and business plans addressing these principles.

      <P>I am grateful to the Minister for referring me to the freedom of information section of the Revenue website. Is the Minister satisfied, given the number of additional powers he has given the Revenue Commissioners in recent years, that full use is being made of all these powers? Is it not the case that while some of these powers have been used extensively, for example those relating to bogus non-resident accounts, some powers have been used marginally and some have not been used at all? One possible reason for this is the administrative make-up of the Revenue itself, where inspectors of taxes, at local decentralised level, often cannot operate on their own initiative and must refer decisions upwards. Many decisions seem to be getting stuck in the Office of the Chief Inspector of Taxes. Is the Minister satisfied the line of information in giving permission to take action against tax defaulters is sufficient to allow inspectors of taxes on the ground to do their jobs effectively?</P>

      <P>The inspectors operate in accordance with instructions and duties agreed with their managers. Within this structure inspectors have discretion to deal with matters coming before them except where they need advice or where the legislation or instructions require deferral to others. The additional powers I gave to the Revenue Commissioners since becoming Minister are very significant. In the last month I set up a Revenue powers group to review those powers to assess a number of matters, including an evaluation of whether the balance is just right. In 1999 I gave significant initial powers to Revenue and I have followed up on that since. I promised at the time I would set up such a group and it will report at the end of October.</P>
      <P>Significant new powers were given to the Revenue Commissioners in a variety of areas and it is the duty of Revenue to use those responsibly. There are different delegating sections under the powers given to the Revenue and in any big organisation, including the Department of Finance, people make decisions at different levels. That has always been the situation in the Revenue Commissioners and will continue to be, as is usual in any large organisations.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TomParlonPD" hpid="Mr. Parlon Mr. Parlon">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Finance (Mr. Parlon)</NameTxt>
      <P>As the House is aware, the Tolka river has a history of flooding going back many years. To devise a long-term solution to this problem the Office of Public Works concluded that a detailed study of the entire river catchment should be carried out so that a comprehensive flood relief scheme along the length of the river could be designed. This proposal was given added impetus following the floods in November 2002.</P>
      <P>At the same time, Dublin City Council, in conjunction with Fingal and Meath County Councils, was in the process of commissioning a study of the surface water and foul water drainage requirements of the greater Dublin area. This was known as the greater Dublin strategic drainage study. At the suggestion of the Office of Public Works the city council agreed to include the flood study of the Tolka in the GDSDS. This work commenced in June 2001 with the intention of producing a final report in May 2003. The Office of Public Works is funding the River Tolka element of the GDSDS at a total cost of &euro;870,000.</P>
      <P>Following the severe flooding along the River Tolka on 14 and 15 November 2002, the three local authorities concerned, Dublin City Council, Fingal County Council and Meath County Council, requested the consultants carrying out the study on flooding on the river to produce interim reports setting out what measures could be taken, in the immediate term, to alleviate flooding in the worst affected areas. The interim report for the Dublin City Council area was received in January and contained 21 recommendations on flood alleviation measures. This work was costed at approximately &euro;7.3 million.</P>
      <P>The report was presented to the members of Dublin City Council and was examined in great detail by council and Office of Public Works officials. A package of works in the Glasnevin and Drumcondra areas which could be implemented quickly was agreed. At the request of the city council, the Office of Public Works agreed to provide funding, personnel and equipment for the work.</P>
      <P>The programme of works entailed the replacement and raising of Woodville Road footbridge and the realignment of footpaths. Work on the new bridge started in early March. Part of the concrete bases has been poured and the bridge is expected to be completed in June when work on paths will begin.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Construction and raising of walls and embankments at various locations between Glasnevin and Drumcondra has also commenced. Work on the construction of a new 60 metre long wall at the BK Motors site adjoining Drumcondra Bridge has started and will be completed by the end of <Col N="920" /> June. Work on raising walls downstream of Woodville Road footbridge will commence after the bridge is replaced. The south bank wall will be 25 metres in length and the north bank wall will be 60 metres long.</P>
    <P>The ground level near senior citizens accommodation linking to the wall of Tolka Park has been raised and new revetment to channel to prevent erosion will begin in May. Work recently commenced on raising the bank and wall at the southern bank adjoining Drumcondra Bridge in the park.</P>
    <P>Other works, which have been ongoing since early January, include the cleaning of the channel from Distillery Weir, Drumcondra, to Glasnevin to remove accumulated silt and debris. The cleaning is practically completed. The construction of embankments along both sides of Griffith Park has also been ongoing since January. Material from the port tunnel excavation has been delivered and the south bank has been constructed and top soil laid. Landscaping will be ongoing for the next two weeks. The northern bank will be completed later in summer. The total cost of these works is likely to be in the region of &euro;700,000 to &euro;800,000.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Additional Information</i>A significant amount of other work is recommended in the interim report. Not all the recommendations are being implemented at this time, as they would take quite a considerable period to implement due to the requirements for site investigations, detailed design of the works and environmental considerations. The concern of the city council, with which I concur, was to agree on a meaningful package of works which could be carried out quickly in advance of next winter to provide some protection in the event of a recurrence of the flooding of last November. I am confident we will achieve this aim through the combined work of the city council and the Office of Public Works. We must also be mindful that the full report on the River Tolka catchment is due to be completed shortly. This should provide additional information on which decisions on the entire catchment can be made.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FinianMcGrath" hpid="Mr. F. McGrath Mr. F. McGrath">
      <NameTxt>Mr. F. McGrath</NameTxt>
      <P>How much funding was allocated to the Tolka flood relief scheme which was costed in the consultants' interim report at &euro;9 million? Was that amount allocated for the scheme? How much of the allocation has been spent to date? Is the Minister of State aware that local residents believe the only part of the River Tolka receiving proper attention is the stretch opposite the Taoiseach's office in Drumcondra? Is this fair? Why is no work being done between Drumcondra Bridge and East Wall or on behalf of the residents of Clonliffe Road, Richmond Road or Clonturk Park? I challenge the Minister of State to inform the House what is being done in these areas. What is being done about the major drainage problems in the area caused by antiquated drainage systems?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="921" />Is the Minister of State aware that no river wall is planned for the rear of numbers 1 to 27 Botanic Avenue despite the recommendation of consultants that one be built? Instead, the Office of Public Works wants to construct an embankment on this stretch of the river. Is the reason for this to save money? This is the only stretch along the River Tolka where there will be no wall.</P>
    <P>Will the Minister of State urgently listen to the views of local residents, many of whom have suffered tremendous hardship and serious damage to their kitchens and sitting rooms? Repair work to their homes is still ongoing and many residents are moving out of their homes for months to facilitate them. I urge the Minister of State to provide the funds necessary to assist these people.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomParlonPD" hpid="Mr. Parlon Mr. Parlon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Parlon</NameTxt>
      <P>The Office of Public Works responded to the request of Dublin City Council to come into the area. As the Deputy will be aware, the full report will be published in May. In terms of the urgency of the project, there was no point in waiting for environmental impact statements. I have visited the area and walked along the river bank to view the completed works. I am sure the Deputy will agree the cleaning of the full length of the river has made a tremendous impact.</P>
      <P>Work on the project is ongoing. The Office of Public Works, in conjunction with city council engineers, will undertake a review to establish what further work is required. The &euro;800,000 being spent is showing tremendous benefits. It appears, at least from my layman's perspective, that the works will hinder further flooding. When the full report is published in May, a decision will have to be taken on what further moneys need to be spent and if they are available.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. F. McGrath</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister of State for visiting the area. There is widespread anger and hurt among local residents who feel let down. I accept the Minister of State's point on the benefits of the works carried out on the River Tolka, which I have seen. On the issues of compensation and assistance and the prevention of further flooding, it is essential we all work with the Department and Dublin City Council.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 14 and 32 together.</P>
      <P>The Government is committed to moving forward the progressive decentralisation of Government offices and agencies taking the national spatial strategy into account. The decentralisation issue will be reviewed in light of recent developments relating to the spatial strategy. In addition, other matters which will impact on the success of a new decentralisation programme are under consideration. It is vital that all involved are consulted, be they staff concerned about their future or departmental management concerned about the delivery of the public services for which they have responsibility.</P>
      <P>Given these wide-ranging considerations, it is not possible for me to state at this time when the Government will be in a position to take a decision on the issue of decentralisation. Deputies may be assured that all of the submissions and representations which have been received by my Department, including those received on behalf of Listowel, Kilrush and Newcastle West, will be taken into account as part of the deliberative process.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB" hpid="Ms Burton Ms Burton">
      <NameTxt>Ms Burton</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that the promise to decentralise 10,000 Civil Service jobs from Dublin was first made in 1998? This is another promise, on which the Government has delivered nothing. Now that the national spatial strategy has been published, will the Minister inform the House when action will be taken or will the Fianna Fáil and Progressive Democrats parties wait until the next election to make another round of promises? Do they believe they can fool some of the people in the towns the Minister mentioned, all of the time? No action, except reviews and ongoing studies, has been taken while, at the same time, Dublin grows apace. The city is choked with traffic and people are unable to move around it while towns around the country are crying out for decentralisation. Is the Minister also aware that some of the decentralisation projects are now referred to as PPs &ndash; pet projects on which Ministers can play to their constituencies &ndash; rather than thought-out programmes?</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>Given that a number of budgets have been passed since the commitment on decentralisation was given, it could hardly be deemed to have been an election promise in the run-up to an election. It has taken considerable time to have the matter concluded, primarily due <Col N="923" /> to the fact that more than 120 urban centres decided to pitch for Government offices or agencies. We have received large numbers of representations on the issue, which stirred up a considerable degree of interest. The matter is desirous of close consideration.</P>
      <P>Apart from these factors, staff must be consulted. Decisions must be based on a consideration of all the issues I have outlined. I hope, I will dispose of the matter well before the next general election.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeymourCrawford" hpid="Mr. Crawford Mr. Crawford">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crawford</NameTxt>
      <P>The issue of decentralisation has caused great hurt in many areas. For instance, there were hopes in the Border region of Cavan-Monaghan that under the Good Friday Agreement it would benefit from becoming the location of a sizeable decentralisation project or cross-Border offices, of which one of the major ones has been located in Cork. There are some 60 young people from Clones, a town which recently lost 140 jobs, in the gallery today. Will the Minister give a commitment that the Border region will benefit from decentralisation?</P>
      <P>Our Taoiseach and two very important persons are meeting in Hillsborough today. On paper, there seems to be a major commitment to the Border region, both North and South. The young people in attendance today want answers. They want jobs and decentralisation is one way of providing guaranteed employment in Clones and the Border region.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>The facts to which Deputy Crawford refers will be taken into account. As I pointed out previously, I have gone to great pains not to exclude or include particular areas or draw up criteria that would include or exclude a particular area. I will certainly bear those matters in mind when the Government makes decisions about decentralisation to the Border region. I am conscious of the needs of the region, having shared an office for ten years with former Deputy, Jimmy Leonard, from Smithboro. I know more about areas of Monaghan than I do about other parts of the country.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanBoyle" hpid="Mr. Boyle Mr. Boyle">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boyle</NameTxt>
      <P>Is there a need for consistency in the spate of reports to Government on infrastructure in terms of combining them with the national spatial strategy? The strategy referred to certain towns becoming hubs and gateways, yet other studies, for instance, on the prioritisation of the roads programme under the national development plan and the strategic rail review published last week, make different comments about towns in various parts of the country. If a decentralis<Col N="924" /> ation programme is undertaken, where will be the consistency to make sure all these components are equal and the programme can be progressed as quickly as possible?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>My specific area of responsibility relates to the question of decentralisation and, in conjunction with my Government colleagues, I hope to finalise the programme in the very near future. Other aspects of Government policy will certainly have a bearing on decisions regarding decentralisation but they will not be the decisive criteria in decision-making on decentralisation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister agree the national spatial strategy has been contradicted by the strategic rail review, which was published last week? The rail review will not provide the network for the hubs, spokes and necklaces mentioned in the national spatial strategy. What system is in place to ensure the various departmental plans will build on the strategy? All Ministers are washing their hands by engaging expensive consultancy reports that produce proposals, which do not relate to the strategy at all. Someone needs to take the strategy by the scruff of the neck and drive it. Will it be the Minister or another specified Minister?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>The national spatial strategy is primarily the responsibility of the Minister for the Environment and Local Government. The deliberative process on the strategy was conducted by his Department and, therefore, questions on it should be put, in the first instance, to him.</P>
      <P>I accept these consultants' reports are expensive. Perhaps when Deputy Bruton and I leave the House, we can buy ourselves a word processor and produce many reports at enormous fees. We would make a much better living than we would in the House. A great deal of good can come out of consultants' reports but they are quite expensive. If one pays for expensive reports, one should make good use of them.</P>
      <P>The Deputy referred to the implementation of the national rail strategy in conjunction with the national spatial strategy. He should put those questions to my colleagues, the Ministers for Transport and for the Environment and Local Government.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB" hpid="Ms Burton Ms Burton">
      <NameTxt>Ms Burton</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is saying the strategic rail review, the national spatial strategy and the various expensive consultants' reports do not necessarily have an input into his selection of <Col N="925" /> areas for decentralisation. He received 1,000 submissions but if there are no criteria to determine which towns are selected, does he feel all those towns that went to the expense of commissioning consultants' reports in a bid to attract a Government office deserve to be treated with respect by being told what criteria the Government will use to draw up the list of towns for decentralisation?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>I said there is no exclusive list of criteria and since the announcement regarding decentralisation was first made I have been at pains to exclude any area or set out a list of qualifying criteria and give weightings to them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB" hpid="Ms Burton Ms Burton">
      <NameTxt>Ms Burton</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister saying there is a secret list?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no list, secret or otherwise. Deputy Crawford made a good point regarding why certain parts of his county should be included because they lacked economic and regional development and an even spread of public service jobs. The national spatial strategy, the strategic rail review, the proximity of third level educational facilities and access to Dublin will be taken into account and, most importantly, we do not want diminish effective administration. All these factors will be taken into account.</P>
      <P>It will not be like the changes made by the previous Government, of which Deputy Burton was a member, which woke up one morning and happened to put big slices of the Departments of Agriculture and Food and the Environment and Local Government in Wexford. It was no coincidence that the Ministers for Agriculture and Food and the Environment and Local Government were from Wexford. That would never happen on my side.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Deenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>He complimented the group who made the proposal on the quality of its bro<Col N="926" /> chure. If he takes issues such as unemployment, population loss and job losses into account when making decisions on decentralisation, Listowel should come strongly into the reckoning because the town has lost 600 jobs over the past five years. The recently published preliminary census report highlighted that Listowel was the only area in Kerry that suffered a loss in population and one of the few towns in the country to do so. Will the Minister give favourable consideration to the innovative proposal made by these three towns when he makes a decision?</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>The joint submission on behalf of Listowel, Kilrush and Newcastle West was of a high standard and I will certainly give it the consideration requested by Deputy Deenihan as I will in regard to the inclusion of other areas for decentralisation. The Deputy referred to criteria for that area but he should have a chat with Deputy Boyle to ascertain whether they will coincide with the criteria he requested for consideration in making such decisions. I hope we will be able to dispose of these matters in the near future.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 15 and 44 together.</P>
      <P>Discussions are ongoing with my ministerial colleagues on the reduction over the next three years of 5,000 in authorised public service numbers which I outlined in the budget. Departments and offices were asked in early March 2003 to examine the numbers in their areas of responsibility and to give details on how they proposed to contribute to the overall reduction for their Departments and for those parts of the public service for which their Departments were responsible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am currently reviewing all responses with a view to finalising my proposals on how the reduction should be achieved and will be putting my proposals to Government shortly. At this stage. no reductions in authorised numbers have taken place. A number of agencies have been pro-active in anticipating the contribution to the <Col N="927" /> reduction which will be required from them. This is a matter for individual management in the agencies and sectors concerned.</P>
    <P>The budget day decision on the reduction in the number of authorised posts in the public service focused on the absolute total number of the reduction rather than the distribution of the reduction across different grades. However, I intend that the reduction should be distributed appropriately across all grades and levels and I do not want a situation of &ldquo;grade drift&rdquo; to emerge whereby the reduction is concentrated in the more junior grades. I remain of the view that the reduction can be achieved through natural wastage and I will seek to avoid or minimise the effect on front-line staff providing a service to the public and to ensure that essential services to the public will not be affected by the reduction.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>If no reductions have occurred yet, what is the explanation for the ongoing cutbacks in home help services and closure of entire hospital wards? From what source is the drive for these massive cuts in front line services coming, if not from the Minister's proposals? What does the Minister mean by the term &ldquo;appropriately spread between the different groups within the public service&rdquo;? Has he in mind that a certain percentage of vacancies will not be filled? Will there be a uniform rule of that nature and how will that impact, in practical terms, on the delivery of services? Does he intend to delegate that entirely to front line management, or will he impose a rule based system?</P>

      <P>Any changes being made in the health areas to which the Deputy referred have nothing to do with the numbers policy, as of now, because no decision has been made in that regard. I assume &ndash; although this is really a question for the Minister for Health and Children &ndash; that such changes reflect management decisions by hospitals and other agencies within their total resources. That is quite separate from the numbers policy which I announced in the budget. With regard to the phrase which the Deputy quoted, what I mean is that when this is finalised, the parties concerned will not be free to implement the required adjustment by applying the reductions at a particularly low level which would involve a relatively small saving in terms of total cost. I intend that the adjustments will be spread across the services. I will have the proposals which come forward assessed quite thoroughly to ensure that there is no undue reliance by Departments or agencies on taking out people at one particular grade. It is intended that the reductions will be achieved through natural wastage, without any involuntary element in this regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This process has been in progress since late December. I find it difficult to have matters finalised with various Departments and agencies, <Col N="928" /> for whatever reason. During my time as Minister for Finance, an additional 50,000 persons have been recruited to the public service, bringing the total figure to around 280,000 at the end of 2002. That represents an increase of more than 20% within a short period of time. I intend to cap the figure at 280,000 and to achieve a modest reduction of 5,000 over a period of years by natural wastage. Following such a massive increase in numbers in recent years, it is not unreasonable to expect Civil Service Departments and agencies to come up with a realistic policy of adjustment over the next two years, on the basis of the natural wastage process. They have been given a reasonable period to finalise this matter, failing which we will finalise it for them.</P>

      <P>The process which the Minister stated commenced in December has now been in progress for four months. Clearly, some members of the Government must be rejecting the reduction in numbers which they are being asked to produce. If the reduction in numbers is to be provided by natural wastage and if, at the same time, front line jobs are to be protected as the Minister has indicated in relation to the health services, for example, how will the Minister ensure that his colleagues in Government will protect front line jobs? When front line employees of the health services retire, such as doctors and nurses in the Mater and, in my own constituency, the James Connolly Memorial Hospital which is facing a cut back of 40 nurses, how does the Minister intend to ensure that the reduction in numbers is not in front line services?</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>It will be a matter for individual public service managers in those areas to make those decisions. People will continue to be recruited to the public service, including the areas to which the Deputy referred. What I want from the organisations concerned is a schedule as to how we will arrive at the figure of 5,000, which is not very substantial in the context of the overall total. The adjustment will be achieved mainly by not filling vacancies in some areas, none of which will be in front line services. Accordingly, it is not correct to imply that vacancies will not be filled in the areas to which the Deputy referred. The negotiations have been taking place between my Department and the management of the various Departments, not with individual Ministers. We wish to see how this reduction will be achieved over the coming years. There is now a cap on overall numbers, as I announced last December and we will agree a schedule for the reduction of 5,000 over the next two years. I suggest that is a very modest reduction in the overall numbers.</P>

      <P>Is the Minister indicating that front line services will be protected? Can we take that to mean there will be no cuts in the number of gardaí, teachers, nurses, doctors or any such services dealing with the public? If all the cuts are to fall within the bureaucracy, does the Minister agree that one of the problems over the past five years is that he has bloated the bureaucracy? Does he agree that the real issue now involves serious reform of those structures, rather than some crude attempt to obtain a reduction of 5,000? Is it not a matter of reforming structures that are just not capable of delivering front line services efficiently?</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>There will not be a reduction in front line persons such as gardaí, nurses and doctors. There will be no decrease in those areas. The reduction will be achieved through natural wastage and it is up to each individual public sector manager to work within the parameters outlined to them. Of the increase of 50,000 persons over the past five years, some 40,000 were taken on in the health service area, indicating that 10,000 were taken on in other areas. Funds were allocated to the various Ministers who then decided how those funds would be allocated. Naturally, in people-oriented service areas such as health and education, it is clear that much of the additional funds will be expended on increased numbers of personnel. One does not have to be a mathematician to work that out.</P>

      <P>I am sure the phrase &ldquo;natural wastage&rdquo; will send a shudder of fear through many in the public service. Is the Minister prepared to admit that massive mistakes were made in the late 1980s in particular by adopting a straight line approach to reducing numbers in the public service? It is not only a matter of protecting the front line positions, as they have been described, of teachers, nurses and gardaí. Other positions have become vital in the running of our social infrastructure, including community and social workers. What priority is being placed on those interface positions with people and communities? Very little, I suspect. There is also a difficulty with regard to positions currently remaining unfilled due to other problems such as the lack of properly trained people within our education system. Will those necessary positions now be allowed to lie fallow &ndash; for example in the psychological area of the health service? What are the criteria <Col N="930" /> and what does the Government consider important in protecting jobs in the public service?</P>

      <P>Learning from the experience of the 1980s, the Government decision in the recent budget was based on a different approach. Due to the exigencies of the 1980s, particularly in relation to public finances, a very rough, crude approach had to be adopted in the area of public service recruitment. Numbers were simply cut. The decision as announced in the budget was that it would not be done in this way on this occasion. The numbers are capped at the level they are currently at and the total number will fall by 5,000 over the next two years through natural wastage.</P>
      <P>The second part of the Deputy's question relates to positions that will not be filled. This is a matter for public sector managers to decide in conjunction with their chief executives, and sometimes a Minister.</P>

The Commissioners of Public Works, acting on behalf of the agency, purchased Broc House on 30 June 2000 and Lynch's Lodge on 9 October 2000 for the purpose of accommodating asylum seekers. The total security costs paid to 31 March 2003 are: Broc House &ndash;&euro;298,798.34; and Lynch's Lodge &ndash;&euro;256,813.98.

Is the Minister of State not concerned at such a horrifying indication of public waste with a bill of more than &euro;500,000 for the security of buildings that are lying idle? There are many such examples around the country and most of them relate to the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform. The Minister for Finance has talked about trying to get public spending under control. The &euro;500,000 being spent on security could be spent on home helps. Does the Minister of State not agree this &euro;500,000 would be better spent on caring for our elderly? Is this not an example of a waste of public money?</P>

While I do not know if the security firm is a local one, it is certainly providing jobs in the area. While this is unfortunate it has to be done.

      <P>Will the Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment comment on the horrendous increase in violent assaults occurring on the streets of Dublin on a daily basis? Figures published during the week show a five-fold increase in violent assault in just two years. Does she agree that the Minister with responsibility in this area, far from responding to this, has sought to spread the blame by suggesting Opposition parties are holding up his programme of reform when the reality is that he is unable to present his proposals to the House? He has not yet completed his amendments. Does the Minister agree that is it is time the Minister in question took his responsibilities seriously and instead of publishing 50 proposals for legislation, started to get to grips with the real problems of crime on our streets and implement the laws that are already in place to make it safe to go out in cities, towns and rural areas?</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="The Tánaiste Mary Harney">
      <NameTxt>The Tánaiste</NameTxt>
      <P>I share the Deputy's concern at the increase in crime. It is a matter of concern to the entire community. To a large extent, data is now being recorded that was not recorded in the past. The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform has indicated he intends to publish the figures quarterly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A number of Bills will greatly strengthen the <Col N="933" /> powers of the Garda Síochána. For example, the new Criminal Justice (Garda Powers) Bill will give substantial additional powers to the Garda to investigate serious crime and the new public order legislation &ndash; currently going through the Oireachtas &ndash; will also enhance the power of the Garda in public order offences.</P>
    <P>The Ministers for Justice, Equality and Law Reform and Health and Children have spoken about issues around alcohol and the whole culture of alcohol consumption. Some of the measures that are to be introduced should be of help as a large proportion of crime arises from over-indulgence in alcohol and the combination of alcohol and drugs.</P>
    <P>Since 1997 the Government has substantially increased resources in this area. There are an additional 1,100 gardaí and more than 1,200 new prison spaces. The Garda budget has increased by 60% from under &euro;600 million to &euro;900 million annually. While I do not think it is a question of resources, the new legislation will help the Garda in its work.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister agree with me that part of the problem related to alcohol is the confusing approach from Government on alcohol policy? We often see Ministers photographed in pubs and other places of entertainment. The Government has extended the opening hours of public houses and expanded the availability of alcohol at every opportunity. The Government has no credibility in telling people that alcohol consumption needs to be curbed &ndash; it has lost its credibility in this area.</P>
      <P>What is the Minister's response to the Government's solemn commitment to the recruitment of an additional 2,000 gardaí. The Minister for Finance has just told us that he is struggling with other Departments to reduce public service numbers by 5,000. Is it not the case that this was a promise made to get over the election period and cover the absence of a strategy to deal with a burgeoning problem of violent assault on our streets?</P>
      <P>Does the Minister not agree that now is the time to implement the legislation that is already in force? For example, in relation to parents being involved in dealing with young offenders, the system that has been enabled by the juvenile justice legislation is still not being operated. Does the Minister agree that these are issues that need to be addressed rather than talking about café clubs and other kites she tries to fly from time to time?</P>

      <P>Does the Tánaiste welcome the Taoiseach's proposal to hold a constitutional referendum on the question of building land and the primacy of the public good over private property? Does she acknowledge the crisis in terms of access to affordable housing and that the price of building land is central to putting housing again within the reach of people on middle and low incomes? Will the Tánaiste confirm that this is a Government proposal? I presume it is not only a Fianna Fáil proposal. Do the Progressive Democrats support this proposition? What is the point in referring this to a Dáil committee? What is the advice of the Attorney General on the matter? Will she outline the shape of the proposal to address this issue which was raised as long ago as the late 1960s in the Kenny report? Give or take six months, when will this proposal be put before the Irish people and will her party join with Fianna Fáil, my party and other parties in the House in campaigning on this issue?</P>

      <NameTxt>The Tánaiste</NameTxt>

The common good must come first provided a person gets a reasonable return for property that has to be acquired &ndash; by that I mean reasonable, not the rates that have been paid in recent years.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy is aware, this issue has been long-fingered since the Kenny report. It would require a constitutional referendum. It is important, therefore, that the views of all parties in the House are sought if we are to proceed along that route. I do not believe a referendum would be easily carried unless the preparatory work is done in advance. The Taoiseach's approach to ask the all-party Oireachtas group to consider this as a matter of priority is the appropriate way forward. Hopefully the matter can be put to the people as soon as possible.</P>

Does she believe the five developers that own all the land in this county are likely to defeat the wish of the people generally? When the Tánaiste says she shares the Taoiseach's views, does that have any more meaning than the Taoiseach's off the top of his head thinking to RTE? The truth is the Taoiseach has no intention of putting such a referendum to the people. It would be against the interests of the people whose support he considers most valuable. Is it not the case that the record of the Government on housing is that one should abolish the first-time buyer's grant, <Col N="935" /> increase VAT, hand back 16,000 sites and introduce a stamp duty regime for investors and that it has no intention of addressing the matter? The Taoiseach's way of dealing with the matter is to refer it to a Dáil committee that will exist for the lifetime of the Government. This is off the top of his head populism with which the Tánaiste is now associating herself. Is there a Government proposal? That is a simple straightforward question. I am not interested in the Taoiseach's views. He has developed the habit of commentating on politics. Is there a proposal by the Government in this regard?</P>

      <P>Does the Tánaiste not recognise that the Taoiseach, Deputy Ahern, and the peace process are being cynically used? Is that not obvious to the world? If the Tánaiste woke up from a three week sleep and was told that one side of the conflict in Iraq killed fewer than 100 soldiers while the other side killed countless thousands of civilians and conscripts, who would she think possessed the weapons of mass destruction? Where are the weapons of mass destruction which allegedly prompted this invasion that she supports? If a dictatorship facing extinction does not use poisonous chemical warfare to save itself, is it credible that regime posed a mortal danger to the United States and Britain, which was the alleged cover for the criminal invasion of Iraq?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It appears increasingly likely that the smoking gun will have to be flown in from Texas where more of it exists than anywhere else in the world. How can the Tánaiste continue to justify this invasion? I want to finally ask a question which the Taoiseach did not answer last week. Is the Tánaiste revolted by the cynical battle behind the scenes among multinational oil corporations and western powers to get their hands on the Iraqi people's oil to boost their already swollen profits? <Col N="937" /> Does that revolt her in view of what is going on currently in Iraq?</P>

      <P>Nobody could be happy about what is happening in Iraq and we hope it all comes to an end very quickly. Given the progress that was made, I believe we can expect that. I do not accept what Deputy Higgins said. It is clear there are a considerable number of oil wells which have not been used. The fact that people have not used certain weaponry does not mean they do not have it. They might not be in a position to use it.</P>
      <P>Ireland's concern is a humanitarian one and we will play whatever role is required of us in that regard. We have already made commitments in relation to resources. We will make further resources available when they are needed. It is a positive development that the Taoiseach was able to talk to the two people primarily responsible&mdash;</P>

      <P>In page 14, line 19, after &ldquo;both,&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;fine to be index linked,&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>In recent years fines imposed for offences have tended not to stay in line with cost of living increases. These amendments are designed to ensure that the fines have a deterrent effect by keeping them in line with the consumer price index. I ask the Minister to accept these amendments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I support these amendments. Over the years I have favoured amendments along these lines, both in Government and outside it. My understanding is that the Parliamentary Counsel's office is having some difficulty accepting the notion that a fine should be set in terms of its real value rather than its monetary value. The truth is, however, that measures of real value are produced by the Central Statistics Office in the form of the consumer price index and this is a well established basis upon which one could revise fines annually, without the necessity of new legislation. This is an issue that should be addressed in any revisions of the Interpretation Acts, which concern the interpretation <Col N="946" /> of statutes. Deputy Allen has raised an issue which is important in the context of this legislation but it is also important generally.</P>
      <P>It is important to bear in mind the purpose of a fine. The purpose of a fine is to deter a person from future behaviour that is considered to be worthy of sanction by the community. The impact of fines, however, is different on different people. People who are well off can shrug off a fine, while people who are badly off may find a fine impossible to pay and have no option but to submit to incarceration. The impact of fines on individual people is a wider issue, which is not addressed in Deputy Allen's amendment. Should fines be related to the assets or income of a person or the scale of the person's operations? There are some cases in which the fines are so low in practice that the activity, albeit an illegal one, is worth continuing, because the fine is so low compared with the profits that can be made.</P>
      <P>Another advantage of Deputy Allen's amendment would be that if the fines are revised upwards in line with the CPI, the current intention of the Oireachtas in setting fines at a particular level, relative to the scale of the activity, would be maintained. The purpose of legislation is to give effect to the intentions of the Oireachtas and if we find that fines are falling badly over time due to inflation, the intention of the Oireachtas is no longer being fulfilled.</P>
      <P>It is appropriate that this amendment should be proposed in the current Dáil. At the moment, as the Minister is no doubt aware, the rate of inflation in this country is twice the European level and is increasing. This is a shame. We would not need to consider amendments of this nature in a country with low inflation, but we have disproportionately high inflation relative to other EU countries. This is yet another reason for supporting Deputy Allen's well chosen amendments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraicMcCormack" hpid="Mr. McCormack Mr. McCormack">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCormack</NameTxt>
      <P>Could the Minister tell us whether there is an ingrained resistance to index-linking fines? Why has it not been included in legislation such as this? Once this Bill is passed, it is to be hoped there will be no necessity for fines in respect of serious breaches of this legislation, so it might be put on a shelf and forgotten about for ten or 15 years, by which time the fines will be entirely out of date and somebody else will be legislating in the Dáil. What is the cause of this resistance in the Department to index-linked fines, particularly when it comes to a Bill such as this, which will not have too much use other than as a deterrent?</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatTheCope" hpid="Mr. Gallagher Mr. Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment and Local Government (Mr. Gallagher)</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not underestimate in any way the importance of the amendments being proposed by Deputy Allen. First, however, we must consider the backdrop to all of this. Section 15 sets out the penalties for offences.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On summary conviction we have decided on a fine not exceeding &euro;3,000 or imprisonment not <Col N="947" /> exceeding six months, on conviction and indictment &euro;1.3 million or imprisonment not exceeding two years and on summary conviction a fine not exceeding &euro;500 for each day on which the offences continue or on conviction and indictment &euro;13,000 for each day. While I fully support the principle of indexing the fines, this is the responsibility of the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, which has indicated it is at a very advanced stage of drafting a new fines Bill that addresses the issue of indexation for summary conviction offences.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatTheCope" hpid="Mr. Gallagher Mr. Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>The Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform is aiming to publish the Bill by the end of this year and it is essential that happens. It would be pointless to accept the principle of the Opposition amendments here without being serious about this. My officials in the Department of the Environment and Local Government as well as Opposition spokespersons will monitor this, as we are anxious to ensure it will be published by the end of the year and I hope it will be enacted early next year. The Department's advice supported by the Parliamentary Counsel is that we should await the enactment of the proposed fines Bill, which will deal with the issue of indexation across all Acts of the Oireachtas.</P>
      <P>Section 25 updates the fines of the Fire Services Act 1981 to bring them in line with current fines. Indexation of these fines in this Bill would not be appropriate having regard to the forthcoming fines Bill. While in principle I have no difficulty with what Deputy Allen proposes, the <i>modus operandi</i> for this will be through the fines Bill which will be published by the end of the year and which should, I hope, be enacted by early next year.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatTheCope" hpid="Mr. Gallagher Mr. Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>When this was debated at length on Committee Stage, I indicated that if following consultation I believed this provision would improve the Bill, I would have no difficulty in responding positively. However, it was necessary for me to receive some clarification. I consulted senior fire officers and the advisory staff of the Department, who considered powers to serve an improvement notice proposed in the amendment are unnecessary and undesirable. There are now wide-ranging options and powers available to the authorised person under section 18 of the Fire Services Act 1981, as amended under section 29 of this Bill. My intention in this Bill is not to shift responsibility for safeguarding persons or property against fire away from the premises owner to the fire authority. If I were to accept this amendment the authorised officer would be giving a directive rather than advice. The intention of this Bill is to ensure that responsibility is with the owner of the premises at all times. Anything other than that would contradict the advice we have been given.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Following the enactment of the Bill as drafted, the authorised fire officer will have a wide range of options available to him or her for dealing with fire safety on a premises, depending on the risk which may be identified by them on inspection of the fire safety available. The authorised officer may require the person in control of a premises <Col N="949" /> to carry out a safety assessment of such premises, provide warnings, either orally or in writing, and specify works to be carried out. I consider that this warning in writing will be a more efficient and effective way of dealing with the improvement works issue than using a formal improvement notice procedure as suggested by Deputy Allen's amendment.</P>
    <P>The method proposed in the Bill for dealing with the matter does not involve either party in the appeals process to the courts and will not result in consequent delays. Under the writing warning notice proposed in the Bill, if the person in control fails to comply &ndash; people usually comply &ndash; the fire authority still has the option of appearing at the annual licensing court, where appropriate, and objecting or taking proceedings under section 20 of the Fire Services Act by issuing a formal fire notice or by issuing High Court proceedings under section 23, if the situation so warrants. The Bill also provides for the issuing of a formal closure notice by the authorised person. The person proceeded against would have the right to contest these notices. It is expected that the threat of proceeding to use any of these powers should be sufficient to achieve the objective of public safety.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PadraicMcCormack" hpid="Mr. McCormack Mr. McCormack">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCormack</NameTxt>
      <P>I take it that the warning notices to which the Minister of State refers would be made before an event takes place and before any improvement works that might be recommended are carried out. That notwithstanding, what options does the authorised officer have at the commencement of an event or during it? Can he or she give any further warning notice, to state that it has been discovered that something has not been carried out, or is the only option at that stage to close down the venue?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>I support Deputy McCormack's point. It relates to an issue we discussed when the Bill was last debated which is the power or function of an authorised officer when an event is taking place. As I understand the legislation, the only power the authorised officer has once an event commences is to go in and order that the event ceases. In a previous amendment, I proposed that it would make more sense to allow the authorised officer the power, which officers under health and safety legislation have, to go in and direct that whatever is wrong is corrected, rather than use the nuclear option of ordering that a premises be closed down entirely.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When we last discussed the Bill, I was surprised the Minister of State said that it was not envisaged that an authorised officer would go in when an event was taking place but that all this would take place beforehand. This suggests that while legislation is being introduced and a pretence maintained that indoor events are being licensed and regulated, there is no serious intent on the Government's part to give any meaningful effect to it or have a regime in place whereby inspec<Col N="950" /> tions will be carried out while an event is occurring.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatTheCope" hpid="Mr. Gallagher Mr. Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>If it is the understanding, it is certainly not the intention of the Department for authorised officers not to go into events. The opposite is the case, otherwise it would undermine the Government's intentions and one of the main recommendations of the Hamilton report. Deputy Gilmore referred to an authorised officer being empowered to direct that something be done. If that were the position, the authorised officer would be accepting responsibility. However, the authorised officer can tell or advise the owner. If there are minor issues which can be resolved on the spot, they will be.</P>
      <P>This section proposes to amend section 18 of the Fire Services Act 1981 and ensure it is updated. The authorised officer can advise or tell the owner what to do. If a problem is resolved on the spot, there will be no necessity to close a premises down. However, if the problem is much more serious, it is in the interests of public safety that the authorised officer can issue the necessary closure notice. If a number of people are at an event on a particular premises, it does not follow that the authorised officer cannot issue a notice to close down. However, if the fire officer does not do so, there is not much else he or she can do during the event. That notwithstanding, all promoters will try to ensure that proceedings will not be issued against them at a later stage &ndash; it is a decision that individuals will have to take on the spot. If a closure notice is issued, they must take its seriousness into consideration. If he or she is committing an offence it can be dealt with at a later stage. However, if the issue is a minor one of moving chairs or putting in additional chairs, it is not the intention to cause problems for a promoter or the audience who are out to enjoy themselves. The intention of the Bill is to protect those who go out to enjoy themselves.</P>
      <P>The difference between directing, telling and advising is that if the authorised officer directs a promoter or owner, he or she is taking responsibility whereas if one tells or advises them, the responsibility remains that of the promoter or owner.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraicMcCormack" hpid="Mr. McCormack Mr. McCormack">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCormack</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept the Minister of State's contention that the intention of the Bill is to protect people going to functions and to ensure everything is safe. However, there is nothing in the Bill to provide for this. He said that the authorised officer would probably use his or her common sense in the case of minor problems. However, authorised officers will go by the legislation, particularly in relation to serious matters, and may say the only option they have under the law is to close down a premises. As has been pointed out earlier, that could lead to far greater problems than those which are perceived, such as there being not enough chairs or a locked door that should and could easily be opened. If 2,000 people were at an event and an authorised officer <Col N="951" /> closed the venue for some seemingly insignificant reason, there could be a riot. That could be potentially more dangerous than allowing common sense to apply. If we pass the Bill as it is worded, the authorised officer does not have any other option than to close the premises. We should correct that by providing for the authorised officer to use his or her discretion in such cases.</P>

      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I thank the Opposition for facilitating the debate on this legislation at this time.</P>
      <P>This is a short technical Bill which provides for the continued application of Part IV of the Local Government Act 1946 in relation to certain applications for bridge orders which authorise the construction of bridges. The Bill provides that Part IV continue to apply and be deemed always to have applied to an application for a bridge order made to and being processed by the Minister for the Environment and Local Government prior to the repeal of that Part and to a bridge order made subsequently on foot of such application. Transitional provisions to deal with such cases were not included in the Local Government Act 2001.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the basis of the advice available, it was considered that an application already made and processed and in respect of which a public inquiry had been held, could be brought to completion and final determination under Part IV. On this basis a bridge order was made earlier this year in respect of the proposed new Waterford city bridge to be constructed upstream from the existing city bridge as part of the N25 city bypass. However, subsequent legal advice, obtained in the course of the preparation of the State's defence in a court action con<Col N="952" /> cerning navigation rights on the river, raised concerns as to the soundness of an order in these circumstances. The aim of the Bill is, therefore, to remedy any deficiency which may apply by providing for the continued application of Part IV in any such transitional case.</P>
    <P>The bridge in question will, when constructed, be the fourth bridge to be built over the River Suir at Waterford. The first bridge, known as Old Timber Toes, was built more than 200 years ago in 1793 by Lemuel Cox. This was replaced in 1913 by Redmond Bridge. The third bridge at the same location, known as the Rice Bridge, was opened to traffic in October 1984. The need for a second crossing of the River Suir at Waterford was first mooted in the 1960s. It was first included in the city council's development plan almost 30 years ago, in 1974.</P>
    <P>The national primary route, N25, connects Cork to the port of Rosslare, via Waterford City. The existing route through Waterford city passes along the congested city quays and crosses the River Suir over an opening span bridge, the only bridge crossing for motor traffic in the city. The average daily traffic flow across Rice Bridge is 36,500 vehicles, with week day flows in excess of 40,000 vehicles a regular occurrence. The need for a Waterford city bypass and second river crossing has been identified in the development plans of the three relevant local authorities Waterford City Council, Waterford County Council and Kilkenny County Council.</P>
    <P>The objective of the N25 Waterford bypass is to provide a bypass of Waterford city for through traffic while catering for the needs of the city. The planned scheme extends from west of Kilmeaden in County Waterford to east of Slieverue in County Kilkenny. The route crosses the River Suir at Granny, close to the location of the existing N24/N9 junction to the north-west of Waterford city, thus providing Waterford with a second major bridge over the Suir and allowing traffic on the N25 Cork-Rosslare route to bypass the city. Overall the scheme comprises approximately 23 km of all-purpose dual carriageway and approximately 4 km of single carriageway construction. There is an additional 11 km of side roads and tie-ins. The Suir bridge element, to which this Bill relates, is approximately 475 metres in length.</P>
    <P>The N25 Waterford bypass scheme has been developed by Waterford City Council as lead local authority. The project management of the scheme has been carried out by the Tramore House Regional Design Office which carries out design and project management for national road projects in the counties in the south-east. The N25 scheme is also consistent with the national spatial strategy published in December 2002. Waterford is one of nine gateways identified in the strategy. Provision of a second River Suir crossing will be an important factor in delivering on a number of the key aims of the national spatial strategy for the south-east region.</P>
    <P>It should be noted that the N25 Waterford bypass scheme was also the subject of an environ<Col N="953" /> mental impact statement prepared pursuant to the Roads Act 1993, as amended by the Planning and Development Act 2000. The EIS was approved by An Bord Pleanála subject to modifications last October. The proposed new bridge and the N25 bypass of which it is a crucial part is significant not only to Waterford city and county but also to Kilkenny, the south-east region as a whole and far beyond. It is an essential part of our national infrastructure. The House will appreciate, therefore, the importance which attaches to safeguarding the bridge order by the passage of this Bill. I thank the House for facilitating its passage.</P>

      <P>The Fine Gael Party welcomes construction of the new bridge over the River Suir in Waterford. It is badly needed infrastructure in that area. If the first bridge was known as Old Timber Toes and was built in 1793, it is time Waterford acquired a second bridge.</P>
      <P>In 1997, the then Taoiseach, Deputy John Bruton, gave the go-ahead for the consultant's report on this bridge. Despite the six year delay since then, we welcome this legislation and I am glad Deputy Bruton is in the House to see the result of his foresight when he was Taoiseach in 1997. Commissioning the consultant's report was the first phase in getting the bridge constructed. The Minister acknowledged that it is 30 years since the bridge was first included in the Waterford city development plan. At last we have reached the stage where the bridge will be built.</P>
      <P>This bridge order was necessary before work could proceed. The Minister was a little premature in announcing it, although it was probably hard for him to resist the temptation to announce in his constituency that the bridge would be built even before the bridge order was passed in the Dáil. However, that is a technical matter. The bridge order will be passed by the Dáil so work on the bridge can proceed.</P>
      <P>In Galway, the Quincentennial Bridge was built in Galway's quincentennial year and it made a significant difference to traffic in the city. Rather than traffic having to go through the city it can bypass it to a certain extent. The same will apply with the new bridge in Waterford. Already the Quincentennial Bridge is outdated, however, because the volume of traffic has increased so much that an extra bridge will be required in Galway. The city is waiting for the finance for the outer bypass route, which will include another bridge across the Corrib near Glenloe Abbey. It got money this year for site investigation works but those works will not turn a sod, except to see what is beneath. No money has yet been allocated for work on the outer bypass road, which will include another bridge across the River Corrib.</P>
      <P>Galway is in a similar situation to Waterford. I am surprised that there has not been more pressure in Waterford for such a bridge.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to contribute to this debate for a particular reason. The bridge is most welcome and will make a significant difference to traffic in Waterford city, which has been particularly difficult. As we all know, Waterford is a medieval city with a corresponding road structure, yet it is being asked to cope with 21st century traffic volumes. A new bridge is needed to divert some of that traffic from the overly-congested city centre. As somebody who is not from Waterford, one might ask what I am doing contributing to such a debate but I have a considerable interest in history. I note that on one occasion in the not too distant past, there was a bridge known as Redmond Bridge in Waterford. When the new bridge was being provided, the majority on the city council decided that they would &ndash; in what I would regard as a small-minded approach &ndash; withdraw the name of John Redmond from the bridge and replace it with somebody so uncontroversial that nobody would complain. Ignatius Rice was a man of distinction and I have no doubt that the people of Waterford and Ireland in general are rightly proud of him. It was unfortunate, however, that at that time in Waterford's history there was not the tolerant atmosphere there is now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>John Redmond was a great Irish patriot who devoted his life to the service of Ireland and to Waterford, in particular. He brought significant benefits to Waterford city during the first 18 years of the 20th century and previously from the time he became leader of the united Irish Party, after the healing of the Parnell split. Redmond was probably one of the most influential figures in politics in northern Europe because of the pivotal role he played in the House of Commons where, at times, the continued existence of the Government of the day depended upon the support of the disciplined Irish Party under his leadership. <Col N="955" /> He used that role to promote home rule for Ireland, which he achieved. It is important to state that home rule was placed on the British statute book by John Redmond. We had obtained a substantial measure of independence in 1914, before the 1916 rising ever occurred. There are many who would argue that we might have done better to adhere to the peaceful path that John Redmond had set out for this nation and that we would have achieved as much in due course &ndash; perhaps not as quickly but without bloodshed. That is a matter of historical speculation, however.</P>
    <P>It obviously was not the view of the majority in Waterford city when they decided they would not name the new bridge after John Redmond. As Waterford people, they were perhaps told that they should be ashamed of John Redmond, in some way, and that they should not name the bridge after him.</P>
    <P>It would be wrong not to take this opportunity of ensuring that the contribution to public life of this great Irish patriot and man of peace is commemorated in the city he served so well. I know that, as a native of the south-east, you, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, will be interested in my final point. It is ironic that John Redmond is commemorated by a bust in Westminster, although he is not commemorated here in the assembly he did so much to bring about by peaceful means. We do not commemorate him in Leinster House but he is commemorated in an assembly he did not wish to be in&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>

Be that as it may, we now have an opportunity to redress that wrongful omission by naming the additional bridge in Waterford after Redmond. As someone who is proud to call myself a Redmondite, I am pleased to advocate that this great man should be commemorated in an appropriate fashion.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not have anything substantial to add to the debate. I appreciate the fact that the Minister contacted all of us at an early stage to explain the intricacies of the Bill. The Minister has acknowledged that some years ago my father brought Mr. Michael Tobin to the river when they were trying to find a suitable location for the second crossing. That was a long time ago. The Bill is a technical measure and it is neither partisan nor controversial.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In deference to the Minister &ndash; and I hope he will not mind me saying this &ndash; the people of Waterford city elected him, to a great extent, to improve the infrastructure in the urban area. He is trying to ensure that that happens and he deserves credit for the efforts he has made so far in this regard. There is always a song and dance <Col N="956" /> being made about something in the House and people are not too keen to give credit where it is due. I am prepared to give the Minister credit, however, as far as this matter is concerned. We do have problems around the city of Waterford, including the airport and the plans for the motorway. In addition, the port always needs extra cash. I join with other Members in supporting the Bill. Let us get on with it and get the bridge up.</P>

      <P>I am pleased to have an opportunity of speaking in the debate on this Bill. Like Deputy Deasy, I compliment the Minister, Deputy Cullen, on the way in which he handled this legislation, particularly by contacting his colleagues in other parties to explain the background to it. In that way, we recognised how important the Bill was and we were able to pledge our full support for the measure and facilitate its early passage through the House.  </P>
      <P>Deputy Bruton raised the issue of renaming the new bridge as the Rice Bridge. The decision to name the bridge was taken a short time before I was elected to the city council but I have no recollection of people being ashamed of John Redmond. I never remember that issue being stated. At that time, I recall there was a strong push by the Christian Brothers, and locally, towards the canonisation of Br. Edmund Ignatius Rice, which may have had some influence on the matter. I certainly have no recollection, however, of anyone wanting to cast any aspersions on John Redmond and all that he stood for. As Deputy Bruton knows, the Redmondite tradition is an honoured and respected one.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Shea</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure that Redmondite supporters of Fine Gael can be quite wise too, in other ways. Essentially, however, the Deputy is probably being a bit over-sensitive about this. At this point in the movement towards the new bridge it is not appropriate to become involved in a long debate about naming it. The Minister provided us with some of the historical details of the bridge. It is ironic to think that when Edmund Rice came from Callan in County Kilkenny in the latter part of the 18th century to take up employment in his uncle's business in Waterford, there was no bridge across the River Suir. I recall reading that he crossed the river in a boat. I also recall that there was a ford across the river at Grannagh &ndash; which is quite near to where the new bridge is to be constructed &ndash; which people paid to cross and there was another ford down river in the direction of Passage East. There is a good deal of <Col N="957" /> history and linkages in that area, but we are now focusing on the future.</P>
      <P>There is a traffic problem in Waterford city and there is a need to move the traffic along the N25 from Rosslare to Cork in a speedier fashion. I have a personal difficulty with the project in its totality. I made my case at the oral hearing on whether tolling should apply and I await the outcome of that hearing and the examiners' determination.</P>
      <P>An issue related to the new bridge is the planned new high class dual carriageway from Kilcullen to Waterford. While this does not come under the remit of the Minister's Department, I am aware that he is interested in it and I have no doubt he is doing everything he can to move it along. The most difficult part of the Waterford to Kilcullen route is from Paulstown to Waterford city. With the manner in which this project is progressing, it appears that construction will start from the northern rather than from the southern end. This is another project to be borne in mind. Like the Minister, Deputy Cullen, I travel up and down that road every week. As one travels south from Paulstown, on through Gowran and Thomastown, one can get caught in convoys of traffic. I encountered that last week. A few trucks were at the top of a convoy of traffic and the traffic moved slowly for long stretches of the N9 into Waterford.</P>
      <P>I do not intend to delay the passage of this Bill through the House and I assured the Minister, Deputy Cullen, of this privately and in the House. This legislation has the full support of the Labour Party and no amendments will be tabled to it. To facilitate the Government in moving forward this project, I will be as co-operative and helpful as possible.</P>

      <P>Any development that improves the traffic flow through Waterford city will be welcomed by the citizens of Waterford and the Deputies who represent them. As a public representative for County Wexford, I welcome these new roads, but I am also cautious about what is happening. Traffic in New Ross, which is regularly bottlenecked at rush hour, will only get worse when the ring road around Waterford city is completed. If a toll is applied to that ring road, that would probably make matters worse for New Ross because people would not be inclined to pay a toll to cross a bridge to come into Waterford city only to be delayed another hour crossing a bridge into New Ross.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The proposed bridge in New Ross is a substantial project even from the point of view of the National Roads Authority, which might not even have the necessary expertise to design and construct it. If the proposed bridge goes ahead to bypass New Ross, independent designers would <Col N="958" /> need to be contracted to complete its design stage. I can only imagine what that would cost.</P>
    <P>New Ross is in a strategic location in relation to the development of County Wexford. New Ross is on the N25 between Rosslare ferry port and Cork city. There is already substantial traffic, not only tourist traffic but freight traffic, on this route. If the flow of traffic is made easier &ndash; I take account of the complaints by Deputies representing Waterford to the effect that they would like traffic to move faster towards Dublin &ndash; this could disadvantage somewhere like Rosslare ferry port, if the proposed bridge for New Ross is not also taken into account in terms of the substantial project planned for Waterford city.</P>
    <P>There is already a perception among the people of County Wexford that they are being disadvantaged in favour of Waterford. I acknowledge the Minister present is not the relevant Minister to deal with these matters. If the Waterford project moves ahead at the speed at which it appears it will proceed, it will make the situation worse for the traffic flow through New Ross, which would also affect the future prospects of Rosslare ferry port, which we consider has been very much underdeveloped.</P>
    <P>While the Bill does not cover this matter, I take this opportunity to highlight the situation outside Waterford city and especially how such a proposed development will affect the people of south Wexford and the future development of Wexford in relation to Rosslare ferry port, which is a substantial and strategic link between this country and the British and European mainland.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanBoyle" hpid="Mr. Boyle Mr. Boyle">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boyle</NameTxt>
      <P>Given that I represent a city of 28 bridges, I do not begrudge Waterford its great and long-standing need of an additional bridge.  Facilitating the Minister in passing this Bill through the House should not be taken, as other Deputies mentioned, as an acceptance of how access to the proposed bridge will be determined and how a decision on hard tolling or soft tolling in that regard will be determined after the oral hearing. The principle should be that if tolling is to be applied it should be to discourage heavy goods vehicles from coming into the urban area rather than to discourage people from using a ring road or bypass. My party would welcome clarity on Government thinking in relation to that.</P>
      <P>Facilitating the passage of this Bill through the House should also not be taken as an indication of support for the type of roadways that will join the proposed bridge on either side. We are on record as saying that the need for motorway capacity on the national routes, as has been outlined by the national development plan, is open to question and is out of line with the national road needs survey. It is hoped that the bridge will be built and that the road infrastructure on either side of it would be appropriate to the traffic needs in the general area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards facilitating a commercial route between the Cork Port and Rosslare Port, we <Col N="959" /> would argue that there is already an infrastructure in place in terms of the rail link which is very under-utilised. In terms of relieving traffic congestion in and around Waterford city, improved Government policy in that area would be an advantage.</P>
    <P>I would like to address a question raised by Deputy John Bruton concerning the naming of the proposed bridge in terms of the historical context in Waterford. When two new bridges were secured for Cork in recent years that issue was solved by naming them the Michael Collins Bridge and the Eamon de Valera Bridge, but I do not believe that option exists in Waterford. Whatever title is given to a bridge by the local authority, the people of the area tend to give it another name. The Christy Ring Bridge is another recent bridge built in Cork which is always referred to as the Opera House bridge. I suspect that is the type of moniker that will eventually be attached to the new bridge in Waterford.</P>
    <P>The Bill will not be opposed by my party. We recognise the need for a new bridge in Waterford. I hope the Government will also take into account the need this bridge will generate for ensuring there is a proper and integrated approach to traffic management in the general south-east area.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CaoimhglinOCaolain" hpid="Caoimhghín Ó Caoláin Caoimhghín Ó Caoláin">
      <NameTxt>Caoimhghín Ó Caoláin</NameTxt>
      <P>I am contributing to this debate in the absence of my colleague, Deputy Morgan, who cannot be here and in response to concerns raised by party colleagues and others in Waterford who have been in touch with our offices.</P>
      <P>The construction of this proposed bridge, the second bridge over the River Suir, at Waterford is welcome. There is no doubt that the case for its necessity has long been established and I do not believe there will be any difference of opinion in that regard. However, I wish to register a concern. It is not only a cause of concern to people there but is echoed by others with a keen interest in infrastructural development, such as elected public representatives, the Automobile Association and others. The tolling of this bridge has already been mentioned.</P>
      <P>The concerns expressed today indicate that on the one hand there is a tremendous need for this second bridge but that tolling it will act as a deterrent to those who would wish to use it and will affect the bridge's potential. To use the Waterford example, imposing a toll means imposing a further taxation. It is estimated that a family car costs &euro;22,000 annually with vehicle registration, VAT on new cars, road tax, motor insurance and tax on petrol and diesel all going into Government coffers. Adding tolls for roads and bridges will have a further detrimental effect on the lives of ordinary people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister should clarify whether the Waterford city bypass, which includes the second crossing of the River Suir, is part of the national <Col N="960" /> development plan. What is the level of funding from the European Structural Fund for this project? Is there a sustainable argument that this bridge could and should be funded from public sources rather than going into the private sector? There are also indications that the proposed new motorway is to bear a toll. Many people from the Minister's area could then face a double toll on a single journey from Dublin to Waterford if the bridge and the new motorway are both tolled.</P>
    <P>I am not a supporter of this economic strategy. It will not relieve the current congestion. Instead by imposing a toll plaza, a further bottleneck will be created. Significant time is lost at such plazas where there is no fluid throughflow of traffic. We have all experienced such plazas in Ireland and overseas. They are impediments to the speedy throughput of traffic.</P>
    <P>It is interesting that a number of Government spokespersons suggested the use of tolling in Dublin city centre and a proposed congestion charge, similar to that introduced in London, to deter traffic from the city centre. When one considers the contradiction in this proposition &ndash; that tolls or congestion charges be introduced as a means of dissuading drivers from coming into a certain area &ndash; that surely underscores my argument that tolling a bridge is a deterrent to people using that bridge.</P>

      <P>According to my notes, my party colleagues in Waterford submitted to the National Roads Authority a petition opposing tolling with 5,000 signatures in April 2002. The Minister can correct me as I do not have hands-on information, but I understand all 15 city councillors, including the Minister's four Fianna Fáil colleagues, objected to tolling the bypass. That is on the record. The Minister was, I believe scathing about the position articulated by the 15 council members.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="961" />The fundamental difference between the Minister and I is reflected in his comments to <i>The Irish Times </i>of 5 November 2002: &ldquo;There will not be a roads project going forward in the future anywhere that will not include tolling. This is a fact as we move forward.&rdquo;  That is not the case, as the Minister well knows. Tolls are being introduced, though not in all cases, and my argument is that they should not be introduced in any case. Is the premise behind tolling related to whether this is a profitable proposition in which the private sector can make a killing? I appeal to the Minister on this, as I have been tasked to do.</P>
    <P>Because of the costs borne by the members of the Irish Road Hauliers Association they would be forced away from tolls. Tolls are a deterrent to its members. The AA's Conor Faughnan has put that organisation's view on record. It has come out against tolls, saying they are fundamentally flawed. Toll plazas are an impediment to the free throughput of traffic and the measure is counterproductive.</P>
    <P>I welcome the bridge and look forward to using it sometime. However, I hope in the meantime the Minister sees that public funds should finance the project. There should not be a further imposition of tax on road users.</P>

      <P>I am glad to support the legislation. There is no doubt a bridge in Waterford is an absolute necessity. Cork, Meath and Wexford have had their say here but I stress the importance of this new road and bridge for west Waterford. On countless occasions we have been told that the lack of such facilities has stifled industry, impeded traffic through the county and resulted in people staying away from the city. The benefits of this bridge will be enormous to the city and county. I will not become involved in the naming argument. Many great patriots have not been honoured in this House. It would be wise to build the bridge first as I have no doubt the people of Waterford will find a suitable name for it. I do not want to speak at length as everything I wished to say has been said. I commend the Minister and the legislation. Speed the day that we have a new bridge in Waterford.</P>

      <P>I thank all the political parties and the Independents for facilitating and supporting the legislation. I thank, in particular, my constituency colleagues, Deputy Wilkinson and Deputies O'Shea and Deasy on the Opposition benches. As Deputy O'Shea stated, given the Bill's importance, Members were keen to ensure it received a speedy passage through the House.</P>
      <P>I do not propose to address in detail the other issues raised by several Members. The bypass and bridge were proposed as projects under the public private partnership process. If this had not been the case, the House would not be discussing the project moving forward. There is no doubt the use of the PPP process for this and other projects allows us to accelerate a number of major national infrastructure projects.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="962" />Not every completed infrastructure project will be tolled. However, without public private partnerships, delivery of the required investment in infrastructure would proceed much more slowly. We are right to try to maximise the amount of private sector money available to complement public sector funding in order to accelerate projects and overcome, in large measure, our infrastructural deficit during this decade.</P>
    <P>Ireland was the lead country in Europe at a conference held in Poland on public private partnerships. Having visited most of the applicant countries in recent years, it is clear we will face stiff competition from the central and eastern European countries for finance and construction expertise. It is important, therefore, that we maintain momentum in driving forward these kinds of projects.</P>
    <P>I have always had time for Alderman Pat Hayes of Waterford City Council, whose term as mayor was one of the finest the city ever had. He has been most constructive and to the fore in driving forward this process, notwithstanding his views on some of its aspects. Old Timber Toes, the first bridge across the Suir built in 1793, which we discussed earlier, was a toll bridge until 1913. That is a long history of tolling, certainly longer than that of the current bridge in Waterford.</P>

      <P>As Deputy O'Shea stated, in those days rivers were crossed on small ferries, which amounted, in effect, to the imposition of a toll. County Waterford was no different and many such ferries operated on the River Suir from Piltown and Fidown upstream and further down the river as it meandered its way down to the estuary at Dunmore East. Tolls, therefore, are not new which suggests our forefathers were more innovative in maximising the use of available resources than we appear to be. Nevertheless, I respect the fact that there are arguments surrounding this issue.</P>
      <P>I agree with Deputy O'Shea that the motorway project must proceed once the bridge is completed. This is one of the key pieces of national infrastructure in the national development plan. Although we would like the project to start in Waterford, in some respects we miss the point. I hope and expect that, in future, one contract will be issued to cover entire projects. In the case of the motorway in question, this would make the end at which the motorway works begin irrelevant, given that one will not be able to drive on it until it has been completed in its entirety. We need to get away from building short bypasses and obtain value for money by completing these kinds of projects in one large contract.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I and, I presume, most Members have witnessed modern toll technology in other countries, particularly the United States, where one zips through them without stopping. One has a sticker on one's car windscreen which is automatically registered as one drives through. I sincerely hope this technology, which has been available for sev<Col N="963" /> eral years, will be employed in all such facilities here. We do not want bottlenecks to be created. Toll roads should have facilities to allow the vast majority of traffic to move through without needing to stop.</P>
    <P>I agree with Deputy Twomey's comments on New Ross. I am conscious the facility will not just be for Waterford. It is key infrastructure for the south-east region and, as such, part and parcel of delivering and enhancing the economic life of the area. Its scale also means it is very much part of the national infrastructure programme in the national development plan. All such projects, whether in road, rail, air or sea, are key elements in delivering the national spatial strategy for which I have responsibility.</P>
    <P>I thank Deputies from all parties, particularly my constituency colleagues, Deputies Deasy and O'Shea, and Deputy Wilkinson from west Waterford who provided assistance and support from the county perspective this evening.</P>

      <P>There are no adequate excuses for sub-standard school buildings. This is not an original statement by me, it is a quotation from the Fianna Fáil election manifesto of 1997, and it is absolutely true &ndash; there is no adequate excuse for sub-standard school buildings. There are hundreds of sub-standard schools around the country and hundreds of promises were made before the <Col N="965" /> election last year that these buildings would be replaced or refurbished. Many of those who made and broke those promises will be voting on this motion and I ask them now to face up to the enormous sense of betrayal that is felt by parents, teachers and school children who were told with absolute certainty that their school had the go-ahead at last.</P>
      <P>There is enormous frustration at the failure to live up to the promises made. Added to that is the uncertainty about when schools can expect to see progress. Parents and teachers have reached a point where they will not sit back and take it anymore and they have come together to form an organisation called TLC, Tuismitheoirí agus Teagascóirí Le Chéile, the objectives of which the Labour Party fully supports. I welcome the representatives of TLC and of teachers' unions in the Public Gallery.</P>
      <P>The environment in which our children spend most of their young lives must surely be a priority. It is almost inconceivable that this budget has been cut at a time when money can be found for public relations and photographs, for consultants and chocolates and for a new jet or maybe two. Over &euro;500 million was spent on the SSIA scheme last year and 0.5% of GNP annually is being put away for 2025. Would it not have been better to spend some of that money on leaking roofs and broken toilets in schools? There was a surplus of &euro;5.6 billion in last year's income-expenditure balance. Could some of that have been spent providing new classrooms in overcrowded schools?</P>
      <P>In our Private Members' time earlier this year, the Labour Party highlighted the failure to provide the &euro;35 million needed to address the immediate needs of people with disabilities. On this occasion, we are using the time to pressurise the Government to provide the funding for the urgent needs of schools. We do this straightforwardly and unashamedly because we believe that these fundamental needs must be prioritised. There has been an ideological shift to the right in the actions of the Government that no longer spends taxpayers' money, as a priority, on the basic needs of citizens.</P>
      <P>The 2003 school building programme was launched in January with proclamations of generosity and transparency. An examination of the document shows that it is neither generous nor transparent. It is a document of deceit and procrastination.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The total amount of money for primary schools in 2003 is &euro;167.7 million and there is &euro;172.2 million for post-primary schools. However most of this is already committed to projects already under construction from previous years. Only &euro;10.3 million at primary level and &euro;17.2 million at post-primary level is for new building projects. The schools that have been selected to proceed to construction in 2003 are listed in section 4 of the programme and they number 12 schools on the primary list and 14 on the post-primary list. The only other schools that will progress this year <Col N="966" /> are 20 small schools in section 8, which are in a pilot scheme for devolved construction. This scheme has been allocated a paltry &euro;5 million and it is interesting to note that 12 of the 20 schools are in the constituencies of Ministers and Ministers of State.</P>
    <P>While 46 schools have positive news, more than 550 others, many with guarantees from their local Deputy that the money was there for them, are stalled in the lengthy sections 6 and 7 lists of schools at architectural planning. Principals, teachers, parents, boards of management and children in these schools have absolutely no idea when funding will come through.</P>
    <P>In that architectural planning list, there are bands and stages in each of the two lists, sections 6 and 7. In terms of transparency, that sounds promising. I can find my school on the list and see what stage it is at and what band it is in. I assume all the schools in the same category as mine will steadily progress at the same pace and that when my school, and the others in the same band and stage as my school, get to the top, we will get funding.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately it is not quite so simple. First, appendix 2 states: &ldquo;The initial assignment of a project to a particular priority band does not preclude its subsequent re-assignment to a different band as circumstances change.&rdquo;  Therefore, my school may not retain its current priority. In addition, there are so many other schools in the same category as mine that at the current rate of funding, only a fraction of us will move on each year. For example, a school in section 6, which is the advanced section, at stage 4-5, which is the highest stage, and at band 2, which is the second highest band, might feel it is nearly there. It is described as &ldquo;very necessary&rdquo;. However, it is one of 60 in exactly that category and all those in band 1 of the same section and at the same stage are ahead in priority because they are &ldquo;extremely urgent&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>That is how bad it is for these schools. We simply cannot allow progress to stay at this snail's pace. The only way to relieve this traffic jam of schools is to assign adequate resources.</P>
    <P>The long-promised database of schools has not been carried out but the best estimate so far produced is that it will take &euro;1.5 billion at primary level and approximately the same at post-primary to bring all schools up to standard. That breaks down to &euro;600 million per year for five years. The &euro;343 million allocated for the school building programme this year pales into insignificance when one considers those sums.</P>
    <P>The current pace of progress is not only going nowhere for most schools, but is also wasting money. Designs and costings have to be redone because they are out of date by the time they come to tender and planning. Numbers, especially in expanding areas, have grown way beyond the original design. The amount of money spent on rental and prefabs during the years of waiting will, in many cases, be as much as the <Col N="967" /> school or extension would have cost if built when the need was first identified.</P>
    <P>I spoke to a principal last week who told me that he estimates that more than &euro;1 million will have been spent on rental of properties by the time his permanent school is built. He was offered a turn-key lease-back option that would have been cost effective and would have saved the rental, but the Department of Education and Science would not allow it. What a waste of money and what a shame that the children in this school are divided between two totally unsuitable buildings with no outdoor play area when an affordable solution is available. I have heard plea after plea from schools to be allowed to hire a local architect and builder at competitive rates. While the pilot initiative for 20 small schools this year is welcome, there is an urgent need to free schools from the shackles of the Department of Education and Science so that they can implement creative, innovative, cost-effective solutions.</P>
    <P>Next September, there will be a real crisis in school accommodation in many parts of the country. Populations are expanding and existing schools cannot cope. Thousands of pupils face chronic overcrowding and many classes will continue to be conducted in toilets and corridors, in principals' offices and in creaking prefabs. Thousands of students expecting to start school in September may not be able to because of a shortage of space and inadequate facilities.</P>
    <P>Last week I spoke to the principal of a school in Kildare who has obtained approval for an extra teacher and for furniture for the class but will have no classroom in which to put teacher, children and furniture. Are we back to the days of hedge schools? There is literally no place to put the children. This is completely farcical. A school in Donabate was officially opened last Friday but there is no actual school building there, not even a rented one. Its address is care of the sea scout den in Donabate. A letter that just came to me today from Holy Rosary primary school in Dublin 24 states:</P>
    <P>In September 2003 we have applications to fill three Junior Infant classrooms. Unfortunately, we can only cater for one. In September 2004 we will have application[s] for three more Junior Infant classes and again room for only one. This trend is set to continue for the next number of years. This does not take account of resource teachers working in broom cupboards/store rooms/corridors . . .  with inadequate ventilation and lighting and does not meet with health &amp; safety regulations.</P>
    <P>In applying our enrolment policy for the school we have discovered that not only will some Catholic children from the parish be refused admission but all of our non-national, non-catholic children from within the parish will have to be refused a place in our school. This reflects badly on our Government's policy <Col N="968" /> on integration and anti-racism and on the efforts made by the school to foster and promote an integrated community.</P>
    <P>Huge sprawling estates stretch out of Dublin into surrounding counties and while they have fancy shopping centres, there are no schools to which parents can send their children. Boards of management do not know what to do. The Minister for Education and Science has had numerous requests for meetings but he has blankly refused, even with the pleading of his party colleagues. He also refused a request to meet the lobby group TLC. In many instances, these same colleagues were only too eager to visit the schools last spring and summer with promises that were disgracefully broken after the general election. The former Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Woods, went on a spate of sod-turnings with his spade over his shoulder and promised many schools that they would have their new classrooms and buildings within months, but sadly the new Minister has let that spade grow rusty.</P>
    <P>Many treacherous letters were dispatched to schools by Government candidates before the election, now not worth the paper they are written on. To quote from one: &ldquo;I am pleased to inform you that approval has been given to go to tender which as you know has been outstanding for some time.&rdquo;  The school that got this letter from its local Fianna Fáil candidate, St. Killian's in Tallaght, is still at pre-tender stage and is listed in band 3, which is the third level of priority. The candidate, Deputy O'Connor, was elected in Dublin South-West.</P>
    <P>The problems are by no means confined to the greater Dublin area. The former Minister, Deputy Woods, wrote to the Fianna Fáil candidate in Wexford, Deputy Dempsey, about Gaelscoil Gharman, telling him that &ldquo;provision has been made for this major project as part of the 2002 Building Programme.&rdquo;  This school is still in band 2, the stalled list. Two Fianna Fáil candidates were elected in Wexford. A parent in County Galway told me that the principal of the school his children attend was told that if he bought a suitable site his TD, who is more senior than a backbencher, would arrange the funding for the school to be built. The principal got the site some time ago but there is no sign of the funding. Fianna Fáil candidates such as these were elected on deceit and misinformation and I challenge these Deputies to vote for the Labour Party motion tomorrow night to begin to redress this deceit and face up to the betrayal of schools in their constituencies.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a huge level of anger out there about these promises. What we know now is that while all these promises were being made to schools all over the country, the Minister for Finance was actually in the process of drawing up the memo to Government which spelt out where billions were to be cut from public spend<Col N="969" /> ing, including school buildings. A lot of people done, a lot more to do.</P>
      <P>The horror stories mount. There is a school in my constituency, St. Kieran's of Galvone, that is in such a bad state that the principal has been told by its insurance company that it will no longer be covered unless essential work on leaking toilets, subsiding floors and a dangerous playground is carried out by the new school year. Another Limerick school, St. Nessan's in Mungret, organised a protest last December. Its press release states:</P>
      <P>The building work for 6 new classrooms (to replace existing prefabs) and a new PE Hall double the size of the present hall, was due to commence in 1999 and to be completed by 2001. The Government had announced over &euro;2.15 million for the project. This was announced both on radio and in the newspapers. Since then not one cent has been spent.</P>
      <P>My colleague, Deputy Moynihan-Cronin, has given me a vivid description of the appalling conditions in Meánscoil an Leith Triúigh in Cloghane, County Kerry. This school, with many others, is under investigation by the Health and Safety Authority. She described how one pupil keeps his pencil case plugged in a hole in the wall as it keeps the main entry point for the rats closed up. No school likes to be spoken of as rat-infested, but the sad reality is that some schools have such small resources that they have difficulty in dealing with such problems. When we table parliamentary questions about these investigations we are told that individual schools are responsible for the safety and welfare of children in their care and that the annual devolved grant of &euro;3,809 per school and &euro;12.70 per pupil should be used for such purposes. In most cases, this is not nearly adequate for the work it must cover. To make things worse, the &euro;3,809 per school has been withheld this year while a review is carried out. This has been a cruel blow to small schools in particular.</P>
      <P>Parents and teachers have been driven by frustration and disappointment to organise into a determined lobby group, TLC. Since the group's formation less than two months ago it has grown at a phenomenal pace and struck a chord all around the country. People will not tolerate the state of our schools. They will not tolerate the length of time it will take to put them right. They will not tolerate the kind of priorities that put luxuries before essentials. Adequate school buildings are essential.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The motion before the House tonight seeks to address the needs of schools in a planned and transparent way. There are some that are so dilapidated, that need extra classrooms so badly that they cannot wait beyond the summer. The people who run these schools are at a loss. They must be given emergency funding. A database, established as quickly as possible, will provide the information on the work required to give all children a learning environment in which basic standards apply. The allocation of funding to meet the <Col N="970" /> needs will have to go hand in hand with a flexible and cost-effective system. School principals have a variety of practical proposals that could save time and money but their suggestions have come up against a blank wall and, as I said, the Minister has refused to meet them.</P>
    <P>I know that many of my colleagues on the Government benches feel ashamed that their promises were not kept. By voting for this motion, they will have the chance to show their unwillingness to be used for short-term electoral gain, which ultimately gives politics a bad name. All Members of this House were taught by their teachers to be honest. What kind of an example did Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats set for our children in their pre-election promise splurge? As the Labour Party slogan says in our campaign for better school buildings, before we can teach our children, we need to educate some adults.</P>
    <P>The Government Deputies, by voting on this motion, will have a chance to win back the faith of the children who are told that people should keep their promises but were led up the garden path by deceitful promises of sod-turnings and bricks and mortar which have not materialised. I commend the motion to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>I have been a Member of these Houses for 20 years and I am very proud to be an elected public representative. I am proud of our profession and of the vast majority of people who are attracted to serving in public administration. However, there is a cynicism among the general public about politics and politicians. A recent opinion poll published in one of the Sunday newspapers indicates the low regard people have for the business of politics and politicians. We reached this low because of the actions of some. We have allowed the profession of politics to be debased and brought into disrepute.</P>
      <P>Nothing has impacted more negatively on the business of politics and the service of the public than that catalogue of falsehoods that made up the Fianna Fáil manifesto at the last general election. In no area of that manifesto and in the plethora of promises that surrounded it was this more obvious than in the schools building programme of the Department of Education and Science. While promises galore were being dished out by the highest authorities, the Fianna Fáil-led Administration knew it had no intention of delivering, the Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, was preparing his cuts proposals as revealed by subsequent disclosures. At that very time Fianna Fáil candidates, aided and abetted by senior Ministers, were bringing the falsehood of promises to people who were working in dreadful conditions and allowing children to be used as pawns for their own re-election campaigns, so it is little wonder that our profession is debased and that our word has so little clout among the general public.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I will cite three examples in my constituency. Earlier my colleague, Deputy O'Sullivan, <Col N="971" /> referred to Gaelscoil Gharman in my home town Wexford. A few weeks before the last general election in May 2002, the front page of the <i>Wexford People</i> was adorned by the then Fianna Fáil Minister of State kissing the principal of that school under the headline &ldquo;Delivered&rdquo;, indicating the school would be done. To eliminate doubt, this was accompanied by a letter and a telephone call from the then Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Woods. Perhaps the electorate in Wexford have particular prescience and intelligence because that candidate was not elected, despite his appearance on the front page of the local newspaper. However, Fianna Fáil did get two seats in my constituency.</P>
    <P>Those people, who at the time worked so assiduously in a boys' clubhouse with one classroom on the school stage and others up a narrow metal staircase, were promised deliverance. Where are they today? Today that building is being refurbished and they have moved lock, stock and barrel to disused factory premises which the Wexford Deputies visited in recent days. They are scandalised by the con job perpetrated on them by Fianna Fáil last May.</P>
    <P>The principal of the CBS in New Ross was eloquent when speaking on the radio this morning. Clongeen national school received promises faithfully. The irony is that I received a telephone call from the chairman of the board of management of Clongeen national school, a friend of mine and of the Minister for Education and Science, a local Fianna Fáil councillor, Jimmy Curtis. He asked me to raise his story because he was led to believe before the last general election that this would be delivered. All this falsehood is having an impact, not only on our profession, but also on the quality of those children's education at which they get only one chance. I ask the Minister to adjust his priorities to ensure those promises are delivered.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RoisinShortall" hpid="Ms Shortall Ms Shortall">
      <NameTxt>Ms Shortall</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to debate this matter in the House. While there are many serious issues in the education system, undoubtedly the most serious and the biggest scandal is that at this stage of the country's development, having come through the phenomenal boom of recent years, thousands of our young people are still being taught in schools that are dilapidated, rat-infested, cold, damp and inadequate. At this stage in our development in 2003, that is shameful. For a country that has spoken so much about the importance of education, where we try to engender in our young people respect for education, how can we expect them to have any respect when the Government and the previous Administration have treated so many of our young people in such a disrespectful manner by leaving them in buildings that are so inadequate? Some buildings hark back to the 1940s and 1950s and many are unsafe, damp and inappropriate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While we should all be ashamed of this problem, the Government should be particularly <Col N="972" /> ashamed. In recent years the Government had at its disposal the resources to tackle this problem, but it wasted that opportunity. It opted to spend money on Ministers' pet projects rather than getting basic education facilities and accommodation right. Now when things are tough and money has dried up to a certain extent, those problems remain and the children are still in dilapidated classrooms.</P>
    <P>The problem has been compounded by the fact that Fianna Fáil candidates and sitting Deputies acted so cynically during the general election campaign. They went around the country telling schools they had the go-ahead. They contacted parents, teachers and pupils to tell them their schools would definitely proceed and, on the basis, they could put their trust in Fianna Fáil. That trust was bitterly dashed within months of the general election when their promises were found to be empty. They were found out for their deceit and lies. As other speakers have said that is doing damage to the reputation of politics.</P>
    <P>Thousands of students are affected by the schools on the schools building list that have stalled. I will refer to five such schools in my constituency, all of which are at the final stage where pre-tender documents have been submitted to the Department and approved. All five schools were told by the two Fianna Fáil Deputies in the Dublin North-West constituency that the building projects would proceed this year. All five were lied to and all five projects have stalled.</P>
    <P>I visited St. Canice's boys' school in Finglas last year. It has the worst school building I ever visited. I was ashamed to be a politician seeing a school in that condition in 2002. A year earlier the Department of Education and Science had arranged for asbestos tiles to be removed from the floor. The children were sitting in a school with bare concrete floors and they used samples of carpet to cover the space immediately under their feet. The school heating system was clapped out and did not work, the windows were draughty and every hour the teachers had to get the pupils to stand up, move around and exercise in order to keep their blood moving. The toilets were leaking into the wall in the school's main corridor so that there was a strong stench of urine throughout the building.</P>
    <P>This is a disadvantaged school and parents had gone to great lengths to get their children uniforms and books to allow them to participate. This is the response from a Government that had money to burn at that stage, but left the children in those conditions. Last year, that school was told it could go ahead and moved into prefabs, but it has now been told the building programme is gone. Beneavin De La Salle school in Finglas which is 40 years old is in an atrocious condition and has no science laboratory at a time when we are trying to promote science. Holy Spirit boys' and girls' schools in Ballymun and St. Michael's school in Finglas have been left high and dry and it is a tribute to those schools that parents have remained loyal because the quality of the school<Col N="973" /> ing is so good. The teachers in those schools are exceptional because no other group of workers would tolerate such conditions. It is now time for teachers to start taking action because if the Health and Safety Authority was brought into most of those schools, it would rightly condemn them. It is now time for action.</P>

      <P>St. Anne's national school in Shankill is number 38 on a list of 122 primary schools which appears under section 6 of the Minister for Education and Science's 2003 school building programme, entitled &ldquo;large scale primary projects that are at advanced stages of architectural planning.&rdquo;  It is a school I know I well because I call there every morning with my nine year old son and, like many other schools, it had plans to build an extension, refurbish the existing building and provide much needed facilities for staff and pupils.</P>
      <P>The school went through the patient ritual of getting the site, applying to the Department, applying for planning permission and getting architects' designs and so on. However, in the middle of 2001, it found that things had slowed down in its dealings with the building unit, so it began political lobbying. I raised questions in the House and raised the issue on the Adjournment and the principal and management of the school arranged through the Government Deputies in the House to meet with the then Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Woods. At that meeting in February of last year, the school authorities were told that the school would get its go-ahead and the Minister told them he expected to personally turn the sod before Christmas. As happened in so many other cases, a Government Minister came to visit the school a few weeks before the general election &ndash; in this case , the Government Chief Whip, Deputy Hanafin. I was there for the event and, unlike the example cited by Deputy Howlin, she did not seal the deal with a kiss but she received several bualadhs bos as she stood in the reflected glory of bringing the good news to the assembled pupils, teachers and parents. I expected her to do a lap of honour around the school yard at any moment. It was not the most comfortable place in which to be an Opposition Deputy a few weeks before the election. However, like everyone else in that room, I believed what she told us &ndash; that the Government had approved the school project, that it would be proceeding to tender and that the extension would be proceeded with &ndash; as did everyone else in that room that morning. That exercise was repeated all over the country, in school after school, constituency after constituency and it was a collective lie.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is one thing for election candidates, in the heat of electoral battle to make a promise which cannot be delivered. It is quite another to go out and enter into promises and commitments which the Government knows cannot and will not be delivered upon. As a result of this experience, principals, teachers, parents, friends of schools <Col N="974" /> and members of boards of management have come together in a movement, Teagascóirí agus Tuismitheoirí le Chéile &ndash; TLC &ndash; to remind the Government of the promises and commitments which were made just a year ago and ensure they are delivered in the interests of our children.</P>
    <P>In my own constituency there are many examples in the primary area such as Johnstown boys' national school and in the second level area &ndash; St. Brendan's College, Woodbrook; Newpark Comprehensive; Senior College, Dún Laoghaire; St. Laurence's College, Loughlinstown; Presentation Brothers; CBC Monkstown Park; Clonkeen College, Blackrock and several others, all of which are delayed at different stages in this planning process. All of these schools have real needs which are being neglected and ignored by the Government.</P>
    <P>I join with Deputy O'Sullivan in appealing to Government backbenchers and Ministers who made commitments this time last year to honour them by supporting this motion tomorrow night. I urge the Minister to, at the very least, meet with TLC and discuss with it the needs of schools and make a serious effort to implement the commitments entered into last year which teachers, parents and those involved in the management of schools genuinely believed.</P>

      <P>Cork people like to believe we are unique. A peculiar thing happened in Cork in 1997 which did not happen elsewhere in the country and was repeated at the last general election &ndash; Cork city returned six Fianna Fáil Deputies from the ten seats available. It was an outstanding performance and one would have thought that having rewarded the Taoiseach in such a way, the people of Cork would have been rewarded in return. Unfortunately, that did not happen. If one were to listen to those Deputies, particularly those who, like me, represent the north side of Cork City, one would think that everything necessary to upgrade the area would be delivered, but that has not been the case.</P>
      <P>St. Joseph's national school in Riverstown, Glanmire is not a complacent school. It is centred in the heart of one of the fastest growing areas in the country and it takes in all-comers. Like every other area in the country, people from many nationalities live in Cork city and St. Joseph's does not discriminate. The school was originally built with 12 classrooms but it now has 19 classes which means that children are being taught English in corridors, the principal's office is a closed-up hallway, the staff rest room is appalling and the board of management has reached desperation point.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The cynicism of what went on in the run-up to the general election is clear. The excellent board of management of the school records everything in writing. I will not go through the full list of procedures and hoops which they were forced to go through, but I will begin with the school's entry for February 2002 &ndash; that infamous month &ndash; which states that the school had received <Col N="975" />&ldquo;assurances from the Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Woods, that our school extension will proceed to preparation of tender documents and then to tender under the Government's expanded building programme.&rdquo;  One can imagine the delight in the area that, at long last, this dedicated group of people was about to get the extension they had sought since 1985. However, they were subsequently put through further hoops. They visited Tullamore but were kept on the long finger.</P>
    <P>Cork had been good to Fianna Fáil and, at one stage, had a Minister for Education and Science in Deputy Martin who is now the Minister for Health and Children. Cork also claims the Deputy Government Chief Whip, Deputy Kelleher, and the people expected that promises would be delivered on. However, as the school discovered in September 2002, &ldquo;the Department informed us there will be no further progress on our extension. No more money will be put into the project as the Department feels our needs will be different by the time it is ready to progress our project.&rdquo;  What does that mean? It means the Department and the Government know that by then the children of the people who are so intensely involved in this campaign will have left primary school. They are desperately hoping there will not be the same pressure.</P>
    <P>When I speak at public meetings I tell people I am a Labour Party Deputy. When I hear Fianna Fáil Deputies speak at public meetings, they are not a bit ashamed to stand and say they are members of Fianna Fáil, but if I were in their place and had made those promises, I would hang my head in shame. They have made cynics of an entire generation. They are a disgrace. To redeem themselves at this late stage I urge them to vote with the Labour Party for the motion.</P>

      <P>Deputy O'Connor will have his chance tomorrow night. He is well able to speak for himself. I welcome the opportunity this motion gives me to address the issue of the school building programme. The Government recognises that, despite the progress to date, more needs to be done in this area. It is not possible to wipe out in the lifetime of one or two Governments the cumulative deficit of generations and to deal with emerging needs at the same time. Despite the impression being created, the overwhelming bulk of the building programme is designed to deal with the emerging needs.</P>
      <P>Contrary to the impression some people are trying to create, only a small proportion of the schools in the building programme are in the &ldquo;dilapidated, rat infested category&rdquo; about which we so often hear. That is not to minimise the difficulties faced by these schools. For anybody directly affected, it is a difficult and emotional issue and one which I am fully committed to addressing.</P>

      <P>&mdash;it would be trite to say there are no problems when, quite clearly, there are children and teachers in buildings where conditions are far from the ideal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have accepted since my appointment that there are problems in the building area which need to be addressed. They are being and will be <Col N="977" /> addressed. The problems tend to overshadow the progress and commitment of this and the previous Government in tackling the issue of substandard school accommodation. This problem has to be addressed in the context of the overall financial situation which this country faces. I am determined to ensure that in the current circumstances the budget for school buildings is maintained in the years ahead.</P>
    <P>I am currently in discussion with my colleague, the Minister for Finance, to put in place a capital programme over the next five years which will tackle this problem in a planned and coherent manner. That five year programme will mean that schools, for the first time ever, will be able to track their project throughout the various stages. It will allow boards of management, parents and pupils to see the progress being made on their project. It will ensure that projects are advanced on the basis of an open and transparent system.</P>
    <P>It is widely recognised that major capital programmes are difficult to manage when funding is provided annually. The provision of a multi-annual capital funding envelope for the schools building programme will provide additional clarity for all education partners who are working with my Department to progress much needed projects. The publication of the 2003 primary and post-primary school building programme was designed to given the maximum amount of information to managers, boards of management, principals, parents and students and to give an assurance that the capital programme is being operated in an open and transparent manner. It clearly sets out the objective criteria used in prioritising projects. It shows the commitment of the Government to dispel fears that projects can somehow jump the queue.</P>
    <P>This year's school building programme gives an idea of how open and transparent that system will be. The Labour Party motion calls for transparency and nothing could be more transparent than what I am doing. Would that the Labour Party had adopted the same transparency when its Minister was in charge of this programme between 1992 and 1997? In 1997, the last time the Labour Party was in government and when there was a Labour Party Minister for Education, 30 school building projects were under way at primary level. At second level, only 12 projects were under way.</P>

      <P>Another innovative approach we are adopting is that of devising standard plans for various school sizes. These designs are being done in the Department and will enable us to reduce the substantial design fees that are incurred in each project &ndash; currently running at about 13% of project costs. This will mean that more money will be going into actual buildings, rather than design teams. A standard design for four, eight, 12 and 16-room schools will be devised. In addition to the savings on design fees, it will enable us to respond more quickly to building needs when money becomes available.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>I spoke earlier about the historic legacy of under investment. A further major factor propelling demand and change in the educational infrastructural landscape is changing demographics. As population shifts occur within regions and particularly in the larger cities, the result is often contraction among existing providers and new demands in rapidly developing areas. Meeting these new demands is not easy, particularly when sites have to be purchased, which is invariably the case. I would cite the example of Dublin where there are currently 10,000 vacant primary school places.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We must also acknowledge the real growth in teacher numbers that has taken place since 1997, supporting a Government-driven improvement in the overall quality of education provision and addressing special needs in particular. In the primary sector alone, teacher numbers have increased by 3,690 since 1997. This increase has been partly to meet emerging special needs provision, partly to lower pupil-teacher ratios and to reduce maximum class sizes. The pupil-teacher <Col N="982" /> ratio in primary schools in the current year is projected to be 18.4, the lowest it has ever been in the history of the State, and down from 21.7 in the 1997-98 school year when the last Labour Party Minister was in office.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EmmetStagg" hpid="Mr. Stagg Mr. Stagg">

    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. N. Dempsey Mr. N. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>The expansion in teacher numbers has also occurred at post-primary level where numbers have grown by 1,868 since 1996-97. I am sure that even the Opposition will appreciate the impact this enormous increase has had on accommodation requirements and I acknowledge that we are catching up in accommodation terms.</P>
      <P>A further influencing factor on the demand side has been the development of curricular diversity in post-primary schools. The coming on stream in recent years of the junior certificate schools programme, the leaving certificate applied programme, the leaving certificate vocational programme and the transition year, inevitably requires adequate accommodation for the delivery of these courses.</P>
    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. N. Dempsey Mr. N. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>Some of the these courses are directly targeted at providing pupils with a broader vocational training basis, thus leaving them better placed to either transfer from school with skills that are required in the jobs market or to progress to further training or apprenticeships. We sometimes forget the associated cost of providing strongly-based vocational education within the post-primary education system where specialist facilities are required to be in place and modern high standard equipment in use.</P>
      <P>The further education sector, too, has been the recipient of capital funding from the schools building programme &ndash; a fact that is frequently overlooked.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">

    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. N. Dempsey Mr. N. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>The pursuit of post-leaving certificate courses also provides a mechanism for students who might not otherwise have attained college entry requirements to proceed to third level. Supporting post-leaving certificate courses is an expensive proposition, particularly for equipment, since many of these courses are heavy users of ICT equipment and specialist machinery.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In addition to all the issues I have raised, I must remind Deputies of the decision in 1999 to acquire sites for all new schools. Prior to that date, the burden of acquiring a site for a new primary or secondary school rested with the school's trustees. This substantial burden on the promoters of a school was completely removed in January 1999 when it decided that the State would acquire sites for all new schools. At the same time, in a further visionary policy directive, the local contribution that school managerial <Col N="983" /> authorities were required to pay towards the capital costs of a school was reduced.</P>
    <P>The standard of accommodation now being provided to schools has also been dramatically improved. When building new post-primary schools, a broad range of specialist accommodation is provided related to the curricular options on offer at the school.</P>
    <P>In general, a new post-primary school would qualify for a multimedia language laboratory equipped with 31 personal computers, a computer room equipped with 31 personal computers, science laboratories, home economics rooms, facilities for teaching technology subjects, administration accommodation, pastoral care offices, rest area, a PE hall, special needs accommodation and a general purpose and dining area. In the case of all new schools, all habitable rooms are networked for ICT with associated equipment provided.</P>
    <P>No short cuts are taken in regard to the external environment. When acquiring a site, every effort is made to acquire one that is sufficiently large to provide for a playing pitch, hard play areas, adequate car parking, a bus turning bay and enough room for possible future expansion. In designing and planning a new school or an extension to an existing school, every effort is made to create a warm, welcoming, inclusive and positive environment.</P>
    <P>In addition to all those demands I outlined, there are three further ongoing programmes. There is an asbestos remediation programme, a radon remediation programme and a programme to control airborne dust levels in woodwork rooms in post primary schools&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">

    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. N. Dempsey Mr. N. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;all of which take up the capital budget.</P>
      <P>The Opposition has tried to denigrate this Government's and the previous Government's commitment to education. It has questioned how we used the &ldquo;unprecedented resources . . .  since 1997&rdquo;. The answers are simple and straightforward. We have increased overall funding for education by 87%, from &euro;2.9 billion to &euro;5.4 billion, in that period. Capital funding has increased almost four fold, by 338%, from &euro;124 million to &euro;608 million. Funding for youth work programmes increased by 38% to &euro;25 million. Capitation funding for primary schools has increased by 80%, from &euro;57 to &euro;101 per pupil. Some 2,276 schools have been targeted for support packages for disadvantaged children.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The capital programme for 2002 covered projects in about 1,100 schools and the programme for 2003 will cater for a similar number. Primary teacher training places increased by 288%. Some 2,500 additional special needs assistants have been put in place. The allocation for adult literacy <Col N="984" /> programmes have been increased 15-fold. There has been a massive increase in support for third level access programmes, from a miserly &euro;500,000 when our socialist friends were in government&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="EmmetStagg" hpid="Mr. Stagg Mr. Stagg">

      <P>It is laughable that the Labour Party which had a total of 42 projects on the books in 1997 should criticise the programme in place this year. It may claim that money was not as plentiful in 1997, but Fianna Fáil quadrupled the number of building projects at post-primary level and almost doubled the number of projects at primary level within six months of coming to office.</P>
      <P>Since 1997 there have been over 1,000 large-scale primary and post-primary projects approved to go to contract. All those actions are a firm and clear indication of our commitment to ensuring an ongoing substantial building programme. I intend to ensure that programme will continue in 2003 and in subsequent years. I commend the amendment to the House.</P>

      <P>I welcome the opportunity to speak on this motion. I commend the Minister on his stewardship of the Department of Education and Science since he was given that portfolio. The Minister acknowledged there are problems in the building area. I am sure there is not a public representative, Deputy, Senator or county councillor who has not been approached or made aware by parents, teachers or boards of management of shortcomings and areas where school buildings, in particular, need attention. I have been a public representative long enough to know that in the 1980s the major item of discussion during Private Members' time was the pupil-teacher ratio. We cannot mend and rectify all the difficulties in a sector, particularly in the education sector, overnight. I am sure that under the Minister's stewardship and by the time he leaves office he will have made an honest attempt to rectify these problems.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under the five year capital building programme outlined by the Minister, for the first time schools and parents will be able to track the progress of their school through the various systems. As a backbencher I was aware, as I am sure were many Opposition Deputies, that it was <Col N="985" /> alleged that certain schools in Ministers' constituencies were able to leapfrog other projects. I do not know and am not privy to whether that allegation was correct, but I commend the Minister on being honest enough to produce this programme. It will now be possible for people to check how projects are progressing.</P>
    <P>There has been a transition in recent years from a primary and secondary education system dominated by religious orders to one run by lay people. When there is a move from a system that was in place for 100 to 150 years, it takes a good deal of effort and time to settle into the new system. We must give the Minister with responsibility for this sector a chance, let him see how the system works and check his record when he moves on from that portfolio &ndash; if the Minister was a member of the Labour Party or the Fine Gael Party, I would say the same.</P>
    <P>There are great opportunities available for young people. From a time in the 1950s and 1960s when we exported many people to the UK to become labourers and the lucky ones became carpenters or plumbers, we now have a system where we educate our young people who graduate with good, sound qualifications, many of whom go abroad to work not only in the UK but in Europe, the United States and further afield. They are the envy of many countries. That position must continue.</P>
    <P>Part and parcel of this has been the investment made in education at primary level, second level and, more importantly, in third level institutes. I am glad to note that investment in institutes of technology, which has increased from a &euro;50 million capital programme in 1998 to almost &euro;140 million last year, is paying off. There are great opportunities for school leavers. Some 30 years ago 60% of pupils left school at the age of 14 or 15 while now approximately 70% to 75% of pupils go on not only to second level but to third level. This is an important development which should be encouraged.</P>
    <P>One area the Minister should examine, which has not been given enough attention and in respect of which we have taken our eye off the ball, is that of sport. More people should be encouraged to participate in sport. It would not only have the effect of keeping them off the streets and out of pubs, but it is a healthy part-time to which, to an extent, not enough attention has been given.</P>
    <P>From a time when we supplied the UK market with unskilled labour, we now have the best educated young people in the world. It would be wrong to reverse that trend. I encourage the Minister to negotiate with his colleague, the Minister for Finance, to ensure the ongoing capital investment in our schools continues.</P>
    <P>The secondary school system has changed enormously from the old technical schools to the vocational sector which caters not only for secondary school leavers but adults. Adult education programmes are run by all the vocational education committees. The programmes run in <Col N="986" /> my constituency are extremely popular, particularly in rural towns. Many housewives, in particular, have availed of opportunities they may not have had the chance to avail of when they were younger. They had families, but now they are availing of opportunities provided by these programmes. The vocational education committees must be congratulated on providing courses which these people enjoy. They are practical courses and they are also a form of social integration. I met a lady recently who told me that she was a member of a class of 12 widows who meet five days a week and that she enjoys the course in the vocational school concerned.</P>
    <P>I commend the Minister on the work he is doing in the Department. Under his new five year programme, there is a transparent system in place so we can track how various projects are progressing. I wish the Minister well with this programme and with other challenges in the Department of Education and Science.</P>

      <P>I propose to share my time with Deputies Stanton and O'Dowd. I compliment Deputy O'Sullivan for tabling this motion. It is disappointing that due to Government inactivity and apparent inability to improve conditions in our schools, the Opposition is forced to use Private Members' time again to try to achieve some improvement in this area. On the last occasion the Minister accused me of being led up the garden path by my colleagues and in this debate he accused Deputy O'Sullivan of being politically motivated, but he was wrong on both counts.</P>
      <P>It is time to face reality on this issue. The Minister published the schools building programme at the end of January this year, allocating &euro;342.9 million. Whether he or Deputies opposite accept it or not, the programme was cut in this year's Estimates. If Deputies opposite prefer to hanker back to 1997 they can do so, but those figures represent the country of its time and the economic landscape has changed in the meantime. The cost of completing any project has risen by a significant amount since then.</P>
      <P>Much was made of the Minister securing an extra &euro;20 million. We should remember that was not secured from the overall Department of Finance budget but from the third level building fund &ndash; a typical case of the Government robbing Peter to pay Paul. In his programme the Minister announced that 149 large-scale building projects would be funded this year. Many of these projects have been started previously and will run for a number of years. The harsh reality of the 2003 schools building programme is that 12 primary and 14 post-primary schools will be started this year. There are 3,172 primary schools in this country and 750 second level schools. This means that 0.37% of primary schools and a whole 1.86% of secondary schools have had new works sanctioned for this year. That is what the Minister sees as the way forward.</P>

      <P>The Minister trawled through the schools building programme but little has been done to progress any project. Schools now know how far down the list they are but they have little or no idea of what that actually means. The callous way the schools building programme was announced is an example of the failure of the Minister and his colleagues to grasp the despair many of parents and teachers are feeling. A letter dated January 2003 was sent to each chairperson or principal &ndash; not by name &ndash; stating that the Minister intends publishing his programme on Wednesday 22 January 2003; it told them they could look up the website. How can this be described as openness and transparency? School principals and parents rushed to look up the Department's website which, due to a technical hitch, was not operating for a few hours on the day in question, but none of them were any the wiser as to where their schools stood. The use of the word &ldquo;programme&rdquo; is nonsense. A programme is something with a beginning, middle and an end and there is certainly no end in sight for many of the schools listed, not to mention the hundreds not even listed in the 2003 programme. There is not even a beginning for the majority of schools on the programme.</P>
      <P>Making a list is not providing a programme and it is certainly not providing transparency. The Minister said in his foreword that, &ldquo;because the programme is now being published in full I hope it will dispel the fears that any school or project can jump the queue.&rdquo;  Nobody knows where the queue begins or ends and between bands and stages no-one knows where they are. One's school can be the most urgent case at band 1 but it may not even have its pre-tender documents lodged. However, technically it is nearer to the top of the list than a band 2, 3 or 4 schools where documents have been requested, received and approved. So, under this transparent programme, designed as the Minister said to give the maximum amount of information, perhaps the Minister or one of his colleagues can explain exactly which of these schools will dealt with first. How does this fit in with the Minister's assurances that the building programme will be objective?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the Minister's speech in this House on 11 December he addressed almost every aspect of <Col N="988" /> primary education, with a few concluding remarks on the school building fund. He at least admitted then that progress was somewhat slower than he would have liked and then talked about historic under-investment in similar terms to those he used in this debate. He seemed to forget that he has been a member of Government, with the exception of a brief spell, in various shapes and forms since 1991 and that his party has been in Government for 15 of the last 17 years. There has been historic under-investment in that period.</P>
    <P>The Minister said last December that it was his Department's intention to release the projects in architectural planning to construction on a phased basis over a number of years with due regard to the availability of capital funding. It is time we accepted that the whole purpose behind the building programme &ndash; as is being said to me and my colleagues by parents, students and teachers across the country &ndash; is to stall the process, to slow it down and to make it as difficult and time consuming as possible to get through, so that the significant amounts of money required do not have to be expended at present.</P>
    <P>The Minister has more than once blamed schools for the condition in which they find themselves. He has not blamed all schools but he has referred to certain boards of management, stating that they receive capitation grants and that they should be using these to ensure schools are in compliance with health and safety regulations. He is effectively passing the blame for the state of schools to boards of management rather than himself and his Government. The reality is there are a number of schools that simply cannot comply with health and safety regulations because their conditions are impossible. In his reply to a parliamentary question I put down on 25 March relating to health and safety in schools, the Minister said that individual school authorities are responsible, in the first instance, for ensuring the safety and welfare of children and others in their care. The grant scheme for minor works is largely irrelevant when compared to the scale of this problem. The contingency sum of &euro;8.7 million to deal with emergency works is equally irrelevant when one considers the scale of the emergency facing so many buildings. The entire programme, and the many schools not listed in the programme, is in a state of emergency and &euro;8.7 million would not even be seen to make a difference.</P>
    <P>A survey conducted recently of 44 schools in Galway highlights the despair felt by teachers, pupils and parents. The comments of the teachers and pupils surveyed are indicative of public feeling. There is concern in many schools that projects will never happen, that their projects will be dropped or overlooked due to falling numbers and that they will be neglected. Schools using numerous buildings on different sites have students facing unnecessary risks in going from location to location rather than being taught in a secure, safe environment. Schools which have been given pre-fab accommodation are worried <Col N="989" /> they will be left on the long finger and that they have been fobbed off with pre-fabs.</P>
    <P>There are schools losing teachers and pupils because of theses conditions and I understand why people believe that there is an unwritten policy to try and close schools by refusing improvements, thereby effectively reducing the numbers attending. I know the Minister will reject this and I accept that he may not have made a calculated decision to move in this direction. However, intentional or otherwise he is moving in this direction.</P>
    <P>In his address to the Union of Students in Ireland in Killarney recently the Taoiseach said that we will not rest until we have provided every child with the opportunity to develop to its full potential and be prepared for a long and fruitful career. How does he expect the parents and teachers listening to this debate to react to such a statement? His aspirations are admirable but the lack of action is appalling. No child in a substandard school without the most basic requirements of space, heat, appropriate sanitary facilities, play and PE areas can be expected to achieve his or her potential; no child in this situation has any realistic chance of competing, let alone preparing for a long and fruitful career.</P>
    <P>Parents are no longer prepared to tolerate such levels of inactivity from this Government. Not only has it decided to take a rest, what will be achieved under this year's programme is so little it looks like it has fallen asleep.</P>
    <P>My colleagues have cited many examples of school conditions around the country and I will not go through others. Last December we heard much about the Give Children an Even Break programme from Government members. Now some schools have learned in recent weeks that the additional teachers promised to them are being withdrawn from September of this year. This makes a joke of any commitment from the Government to disadvantaged children.</P>
    <P>The Minister promised schools substantial levels of funding for IT infrastructure, outlining the levels of funding schools would receive and promising in black and white that grants in 2003 will be at a similar level. Where is the 2003 grant? Department staff do not even know if it will be paid. Schools have invested in this infrastructure and have borrowed while expecting payment of this grant in 2003. I have a letter from one school enclosing its loan credit agreement with its bank &ndash; an agreement entered into following the Minister's commitment.</P>
    <P>It is time the Minister took responsibility for his actions and promises. Last year's election saw a litany of promises made up and down the county; almost every school has its own story. I have an example of electioneering Fianna Fáil style, where progress was made, &ldquo;Following further discussions I had with the Minister.&rdquo;  This letter was sent to every house in one part of Cavan.</P>
    <P>The time for delivery of these promises has arrived and is now past. People are demanding <Col N="990" /> action. I welcome new initiatives but those are all coming out of the one budget. The Minister is always looking for constructive suggestions from the Opposition and we have been consistently calling for a multiannual programme to deal with school buildings.</P>
    <P>The Government in its amendment and the Minister in his speech are asking the Dáil to consider that such a programme is required. All Members on this side of the House have believed this to be the case for a considerable time. While we would support such a programme, we cannot support the Minister's approach as we cannot see results.</P>
    <P>Where lie the discussions between the Department of Education and Science and the Department of Finance and their respective Ministers, Deputies Noel Dempsey and McCreevy? Will the Minister for Finance, in voting for the Government amendment, signal he is about to sanction funding for this approach or will he consider his vote on the amendment as a totally separate and unconnected action?</P>
    <P>Parents and teachers, the representatives of the hundreds of schools who have joined TLC, are in the gallery. They will no doubt have been glad to hear the Minister outline the facilities in all the brand new schools, that is, those not being provided in their children's schools. Neither they nor the Opposition will accept the Minister's inaction any longer. We want and demand a real response for the sake of these children.

      <P>The Minister compared the position in 1997 when his party came to power with the position today. I would like to do the same. When the Fianna Fáil Party took office, the economy was in good order and there was a great deal of money around. That lasted until the election earlier this year after which we discovered that after five years of Fianna Fáil Party rule, the economy is in rag order due to the political choices the Government made.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Finance, for instance, decided to put at least &euro;500 million into the special savings investment accounts scheme. The Minister opposite is now short of money as a direct result of this policy and other activities of the Minister for Finance. Miscalculation for political ends has been the hallmark of the Fianna Fáil Party down the years. It is what separates it from other parties in the House. The party uses and abuses, calculates and miscalculates for electoral gain.</P>
      <P>Before coming to the House I attended a meeting of people with disabilities in the Mansion House at which a frightening comment was made, namely, that those providing services for people with disabilities will not voice their needs and concerns because they are afraid they will be punished by the Government for doing so.</P>

      <P>For years, parents and teachers were in the same position. They are no longer afraid, have joined forces and are, at last, rising up. They have had enough and will not take any more from the Government. The Minister is sitting back, relaxed and unconcerned by what is taking place around him. He knows that the belts will be tightened for two or three years and then loosened come the next election. Everything will be rosy and the Government will be returned to power, but people will have longer memories this time. The way they were treated will stick in their minds for a long time.</P>
      <P>The Minister mentioned in passing that he has allocated additional funding to youth work and youth services. Does he not realise there is a development plan in place, but no money to implement it and so, like many other proposals, is sitting on the shelf?</P>
      <P>As colleagues have stated, there are many schools which are forced to teach children, particularly those with special needs, in broom closets, principals' offices, staff rooms and corridors. This is not good enough. Children with special needs should receive the most assistance.</P>
      <P>The Minister has acknowledged his failure to persuade his colleagues in Government to provide a multi-annual capital funding envelope for the schools building programme. Despite being discussed for a long time, the Minister has not been able to deliver on the issue. The mandarins in the Department of Finance have refused to provide it, forcing the Minister to make cutbacks around the country.</P>
      <P>The Minister told us the Department has published a transparent list of schools which will benefit from building works. Large numbers of people, including principals, boards of management, parents and teachers, worked extremely hard to get their schools into a position in which they thought they would at long last receive an extension, a new school or a proper, warm, comfortable, dry, safe building for their children. Now they have been told this will not happen and they will have to wait indefinitely. Youghal in my constituency badly needs a second level school. The plans have been put on hold and may proceed this year or the year after. Nobody, including the Minister, knows when it will be built.</P>
      <P>I commend the Labour Party for tabling this motion. It is the second time since the start of the year that a motion of this kind has been brought before the House. It shows the level of anger, concern and need. Despite the significant amount of work done in this area, which I acknowledge, much more work is required. My worry and fear is that the money is not being made available. Without money the work cannot be done, regardless of how well intentioned Members of the House are. The Minister must go back to the Minister for Finance and fight his corner. He must obtain extra finance to ensure schools are built or are made safe, comfortable and usable. Otherwise, we will be forced to call on him to consider his position.</P>

      <P>Education is equally important for all our children. All our primary schools should be fit for the purposes for which they are intended, that is, to educate young children of legal school going age in a proper, safe and healthy environment. In the few minutes left to me I wish to highlight the case of Fatima national school in Drogheda. I begin by citing a letter dated 18 October 2000 from the former Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Woods, to the then Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs, Deputy Dermot Ahern, in which he states:</P>
      <P>I am now pleased to inform you that a new school based on a building brief of 16 classrooms will be provided to replace the existing school. I hope you will be pleased with the news.</P>
      <P>The whole town, not just the Minister, was delighted to find that the school in question would be replaced as the building was a serious fire hazard. Some of the Minister's constituents in County Meath attend the school. Everybody was happy and little attention was paid to the next letter which was sent by the building unit one month later. This was related to the building regulations and fire safety at the school and stated:</P>
      <P>As Planning have recommended a new 16 Classroom school to replace the existing leased premised the expenditure outlined in the attached report is difficult to justify due to the short-term nature of the current arrangement. If however the existing accommodation is to remain in place for the foreseeable future then serious consideration should be given to implementing the fire safety improvements works in a scaled back manner if necessary depending on funding.</P>
      <P>A year later, when faced with a general election, the Taoiseach, the then Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs, Deputy Dermot Ahern, and the local Fianna Fáil Party candidates and followers visited the school. As everybody believed a new building would be built, all was fine. The parents were codded and conned. They are now faced with new circumstances arising from a letter from the Health and Safety Authority dated 3 April 2003, which outlines the precise nature of the problems in the school. It states:</P>
      <P>The fire escape from the school building (North wing) linked to the convent fire escape has corroded joints/brackets and must be assessed by a competent person for stability and remedial work carried out as necessary. . .</P>
      <P>The fire escape route steps from St. Anne's are uneven and bent and are a trip hazard. These steps must be assessed by a competent person for stability and remedial work carried out as necessary. . .</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The desk in Ms. Brannigan's classroom that partially obstructs the fire escape route must be <Col N="993" /> relocated so as to remove the partial obstruction. . .</P>
    <P>Numerous fire exits are partially obstructed by heating pipes that also represent a trip hazard. These pipes must be relocated or covered in such a way that access to the fire exit is not impeded and the trip hazard removed. . . </P>
    <P>The structural integrity of the bowing ceiling in the toilets adjoining Ms Cahill's and Ms McSweeney's classrooms must be assessed by a competent person for stability and remedial work carried out as necessary. . . . </P>
    <P>The fire exit step in Ms. Redding's class is approximately 19 inches high and this must be assessed as to whether this would impede emergency egress. . . . </P>
    <P>A fire exit in Ms. Keogh's classroom is blocked by the teacher's desk due to, it appears, space constraints. . . . </P>
    <P>The adequacy of the fire emergency egress route at the rear of the PE hall must be assessed for adequacy by a competent person.</P>
    <P>Everybody, including the Minister and his Department, is aware the building is a fire hazard. Just last weekend a large piece of metal guttering fell some 20 or 30 metres from the roof onto the school yard. Children would have died if it had been a school day and they had been playing in the yard. Their parents are fed up with the current position. It is unacceptable that so many false promises have been made. The Government has been shown up for what it is &ndash; a shame and a disgrace. It allowed this scenario to continue having made promises and not keeping them. However, the people will give the Government its answer shortly.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Ceann Comhairle for giving me the opportunity to raise this issue. A total of 19 schools in my constituency are eligible for various improvements, including the provision of new buildings and extra facilities. I was alarmed recently to discover that Robertstown national school is in the same position it was ten years ago in terms of the provision of accommodation. Robertstown is located in a small rural area. The school was built in the 1940s. In 1984 it was found that it did not have adequate accommodation and provision was requested for extra <Col N="994" /> accommodation. Prefabs were transferred to Robertstown from a nearby school, where they had been in use for a long time.</P>
      <P>It was 1998 before the accommodation issue was revived and the prefabs were condemned. An extension to the school was sanctioned in September 1998 and new prefabs were provided indefinitely. Recently, planning permission was granted by Kildare County Council for more prefabs but, alas and alack, they have not come on stream. Indications have been given that nothing will happen in terms of the provision of permanent classrooms or even temporary accommodation.</P>
      <P>The school requires five new classrooms, a library, library storage, a general purpose room, toilets, PE equipment store, multi-purpose room, administration and general office room, teachers' room, staff toilets and a general storage area. The school has three rooms and has no facilities for children on wet days. The children must sit in their seats all day long as there are no physical education facilities. It must be a great place for discipline.</P>
      <P>The Minister's reply will outline, as I have heard many times previously, the great work that has been done since 1997, but time has moved on. We have experienced the greatest industrial revolution since the foundation of the State. We have witnessed more spending in every location in the Kildare constituencies than ever before. A classic example of this spending was the relocation of offices from Abbotstown to Celbridge. Strangely enough, a promise was made in this regard before the general election and, lo and behold, bulldozers appeared on the site instantly. That building is well advanced but all the schools building projects for villages such as Robertstown have been frozen in time. The people have been given no hope for the future nor have they received an indication that something will happen. There is a general consensus on the part of the Government that the schools building programme is not important. Why does the Government decide to switch the programme on and off at will to suit the public finances?</P>
      <P>This issue is about the standard of accommodation and education in our schools and not about finances. Robertstown national school, like many others in my constituency, cannot comply with health and safety standards. I have a picture of the school corridor, which shows 14 or 15 children attending class, where health and safety standards cannot be met. In recognition of the dire circumstances in which the school finds itself, the Minister should make an exception, move the schools building programme forward and provide Robertstown national school with the accommodation it requires.</P>

      <P>I am glad the Deputy has given me the opportunity of outlining to the House the Department's current position regarding the allocation of funding for schools building projects. <Col N="995" /> Despite his eloquent plea, I have made it clear I do not intend to move projects forward under the schools building programme as a result of political lobbying or otherwise. They will proceed on the basis of established, objective criteria.</P>
      <P>The 2003 capital programme has been published and full details regarding individual projects are available on my Department's website at www.education.ie. The programme is designed to give the maximum information to managers, boards of management, principals, parents and students. The criteria used for selecting projects have also been published for the first time. This year's building programme amounts to &euro;342.9 million, four times the amount allocated in 1997, when the Deputy's party was last in power. The 2003 programme will deliver more than 140 large-scale projects at primary and post-primary level. In addition, more than 400 schools will benefit in some way from the capital programme and all primary schools benefit directly from the devolved grants scheme for minor works.</P>
      <P>Robertstown national school in County Kildare is at stages 4 and 5 and is contained in section 6 of the programme. It is at pre-tender stage, an advanced stage of architectural planning. The budgetary allocation for 2004 and subsequent years will determine the rate of progress on schools currently in architectural planning, including Robertstown national school. The management authorities at individual schools should continue to use funds from their devolved grant to deal with urgent health and safety matters.</P>

      <P>I raise this issue not only because I am chairperson of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Arts, Sport, Tourism, Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs but also as someone who has a keen interest in marine issues. I refer to the need for support for sea angling vessels by the Departments of Communications, Marine and Natural Resource and Arts, Sport and Tourism through the improvement of facilities and the provision of new boats.</P>
      <P>Our marine resource is underdeveloped and undervalued and, while the Government has invested significantly in renewing the fishing fleet, the opportunity that exists in the marine leisure sector is underexploited in most parts of the State. The potential is available to accommodate cruise liners and ferries. We do not have a water use plan and the aquaculture, marine leisure and fishing sectors co-exist but I wish to focus on sea angling.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Sea angling has been at the centre of major festivals in many locations along the coast near where I live. It was a tourist attraction as well as providing an opportunity for those involved in the sport of sea angling. It brought people into an area even though they were not sea angling enthusiasts. This year, it has almost disappeared &ndash; it has gone completely in some areas. It should <Col N="996" /> not be let go and if it has gone in some areas, it should be brought back. The current problem relates to the acquisition of boats. I am aware of safety issues nationally and, of course, any drowning is one too many. However, we may be in danger of throwing the baby out with the bath water by excluding people who were traditionally involved over many years and had an exemplary record in sea angling. They now find themselves in a situation where they have not been given a passenger licence and, therefore, cannot operate this year. If they go, a very important marine tradition will die with them.</P>
    <P>Accordingly, I am raising two issues tonight, the first of which is the easier one. In my area, people can acquire boats for sea angling from places in the North of Ireland, such as Portrush and Portstewart. Their difficulty is not with licensing which, I am informed, is far more strenuous under the UK regulations whereby they have to be licensed for up to 60 miles off-shore. Sea angling generally takes place much closer to shore, within about three miles, yet these people are having their licences questioned by the Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources. If a licence is issued by the UK authorities, or any other authority operating to an accepted standard, the Department should not impose additional inspections.</P>
    <P>In the short-term, I am requesting that the issue of the Department's specifications be addressed. Under the Good Friday Agreement, we are supposed to be working in co-operation towards integration of the two systems. The activity is seasonal, not all year round, and it is not sufficiently profitable for people to go into it on a full-time basis. Some commercial boats are adaptable and there should be some support to enable them to be upgraded so that they can obtain passenger licences and retain their traditional activity. The value and attraction of this sport should be recognised on a wider scale. Appropriate support should be introduced to upgrade existing boats and to purchase better boats, as was done with the white fishing fleet.</P>
    <P>While I am disappointed that the Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources is not present tonight, I know the Minister of State, Deputy O'Malley, who is standing in for him, will convey my message. We have a greatly under-developed marine sector, with a vast potential for tourism, both in economic terms and from the visible excitement of the activity created in our coastal towns and villages. I urge that we take the bull by the horns in this regard. We should look to the amalgamation of the two systems on either side of the Border, recognising the validity of the boats operating under UK regulations. Supports should be provided to enable people to upgrade good, traditional boats to the safety standards required under the new legislation.</P>
    <P>I am also concerned that access for boats to the Foyle may be seriously affected by the development of a wind farm in that area. I intend to draw <Col N="997" /> the Minister's attention to a letter which was recently discovered from the consortium which was sent out to look at the situation objectively but is now actively canvassing support for the project in a manner which, in my view, is less than objective. I will raise that matter separately with the Minister.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TimOMalleyPD" hpid="Mr. T. O'Malley Mr. T. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children (Mr. T. O'Malley)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Keaveney for raising this matter on the Adjournment. The Merchant Shipping (Passenger Boat) Regulations 2002 came into effect on 1 January last. The commencement date of the regulations was brought forward in light of the terrible tragedy which took place at Fethard on Sea last July. The new regulations require that all passenger boats, including boats with on board passengers for the purpose of sea angling and vessels used in sea angling festivals and competitions, comply with stipulated safety requirements. In 2001, there was widespread consultation on the drafting of these regulations with relevant groups, including the Irish Federation of Sea Anglers, IFSA. The Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources received a considerable number of submissions, the majority of which welcomed and acknowledged the need for the regulations and these also informed the process of finalising the regulations.</P>
      <P>In an effort to facilitate boat owners affected by the regulations, the Department organised five information seminars around the country last autumn. A further two seminars were organised for interest groups in Oughterard and Westport earlier this year. I understand that officials of the Department also met a delegation from the Belmullet sea angling club in advance of the Westport information seminar. The purpose of the seminars was to provide information on all aspects of the regulations to assist boat owners with compliance, to answer questions that arose and to emphasise the importance of safety at sea and on inland waterways.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I understand that the new regulations will have implications for some boats used in sea angling festivals and competitions, in particular fishing boats in respect of which there may be difficulties in bringing them up to the required safety standard. I fully appreciate the contribution that sea angling makes to the tourism industry, particularly in peripheral areas. However the primary concern of the Minister is to enhance safety at sea and on inland waterways. The advice available to him is that the new regulations are in accordance with relevant best international practice. The regulations will provide a uniform level of safety for all passengers and crew, regardless of the purpose of their journey. There is no justifiable argument for having different levels of safety simply because passengers are involved in different activities. While sea angling festivals are of importance in tourism terms, we cannot build our tourism industry on a poor safety regime. There is a long-term benefit to the tourism industry in <Col N="998" /> being able to demonstrate that the highest safety standards are adhered to in sea angling.</P>
    <P>The Minister has already informed the House that he has made available a once-off grant of up to &euro;20,000 to the IFSA towards the cost of acquiring licensed boats for the world boat angling championships to be held in Downings, County Donegal, this summer. The IFSA has also been informed that a boat licensed to operate in a particular area would be given the flexibility to operate in a different area solely for the purpose of a sea angling competition. In addition, the Department will also consider, subject to certain criteria, applications for a dual licence, for example, a boat licensed as a fishing vessel may also apply for a licence for use as a passenger boat.</P>
    <P>The Department does not have funding at its disposal to assist the sea angling sector. However, BIM operates the fisheries inshore diversification and safety programme, the aim of which is to assist in diversification from the inshore fisheries sector into sea angling and marine tourism. The scheme includes grant aid for the introduction of both new and modern second-hand vessels and for the purchase and fitting of safety and life saving equipment. I emphasise that the overall aim of the Merchant Shipping (Passenger Boat) Regulations 2002 is to provide an effective safety regime for both passengers and crew alike and to assist in the reduction of the all too frequent number of tragic accidents.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PaudgeConnolly" hpid="Mr. Connolly Mr. Connolly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connolly</NameTxt>
      <P>The proposed withdrawal of public liability insurance cover by health boards from funeral directors and embalmers amounts to an off-loading of insurance costs from the health boards to those professions. Health boards are, in effect, acting as insurance agents for the insurance companies. They have, traditionally, borne this cover in their overall public liability insurance. It appears that public bodies have to work with the level of cover previously provided, while the cost of insurance continues to rise and the level of cover is reduced. Health boards now regard funeral directors and embalmers as outside contractors. The concept of contractual arrangements with the health boards is being pushed too far. Embalmers will, apparently, have to bear the brunt of those costs. I am not aware of any insurance company in Ireland providing this type of cover to the embalming profession. Funeral directors and embalmers are now to be considered as outside contractors, on the same basis as building contractors, plumbers, electricians or carpenters.</P>
      <P>I understand the necessity for public liability for such people, as there are risks involved in the type of work they carry out. Can anybody tell me the level of risk involved in removing a dead person from a mortuary to the point that one needs cover ranging from &euro;6.4 million to &euro;12.7 million? We are starting to lose the run of ourselves.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="999" />One reasonable expectation would be for the health board to insist on its insurers accepting this level of liability under a hospital's insurance policy. Health boards are effectively complicit in helping insurance companies extend their tentacles into new areas. What other Departments will follow suit? Will we see the Department of Education and Science insisting on national school pupils bringing public liability indemnity documents to school with them? We are seeing the development of a sinister practice.</P>
    <P>Having to shoulder the burden of increased insurance costs, funeral directors and embalmers will inevitably have to pass it on to bereaved families. By offloading these costs, health boards will be targeting these families at a most vulnerable time. People are traditionally reluctant to query funeral expenses. While I could understand the development of this new practice if undertakers had made many claims against hospitals or health boards, I have seen no evidence of this. It seems a florist who delivers a wreath to a mortuary will have to pass on a public liability insurance document stating he or she is covered to do this kind of work. It is a dangerous practice. Will visitors have to do the same kind of thing?</P>
    <P>This is a national issue that is about to surface. Health boards and hospitals will soon be demanding that people have policies offering cover ranging from &euro;6.4 million to &euro;12.7 million. We should insist that this practice stops now. The insurance industry is destroying our small business sector and is now starting to gets its tentacles into health services. It is a dangerous practice and could be the thin end of the wedge.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TimOMalleyPD" hpid="Mr. T. O'Malley Mr. T. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to address the House on this issue. I will outline for the Deputy the current arrangements regarding public liability cover in health boards and the Eastern Regional Health Authority. It is my understanding that public liability insurance cover is currently obtained through Irish Public Bodies Mutual. Given the importance of risk assessment, and recognising best practice in managing such risk, the health boards were advised that when placing contracts for services, including service contracts for such services as cleaning, maintenance, etc., they should be conscious of the need to require such operators to maintain independent public liability cover up to a minimum financial level.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1000" />The necessity to require contractors to have the necessary personal cover is considered by health board insurers as representing the insurers best professional advice and seeks to transfer the risk to the appropriate party. In this way health board premiums properly reflect the cost of appropriate cover and this is important, not alone from the perspective of possible litigation, but also in the context of value for money and good practice. My understanding is that the present public liability cover does not provide for indemnifying independent contractors, nor has this ever been the case. Therefore, the question of withdrawal of cover is not an issue for such contractors, including contractors mentioned in the Deputy's statement and the question of offloading premium costs from health boards to providers does not arise.</P>
    <P>I am sure the Deputy is aware that the cost of public health liability cover to the boards has increased significantly in the last two to three years. In terms of the overall compensation for non-pay inflation included in the overall health Estimates, health boards were required to seek substantial efficiencies within their non-pay budgets to allow them meet these increasing premium costs. It is estimated that public liability premiums recorded increases of up to 40% year-on-year between 2000 and 2002. It is clear that health boards need to ensure that public liability cover reflects their needs but cannot include excesses in cover which otherwise would be appropriate to independent contractors. In this manner boards are not in any way placing an improper burden on such contractors, rather, they are merely applying what is standard practice to the process of placing contracts for services.</P>
    <P>It is incumbent on health boards to follow best procurement practice when seeking to place contracts for goods and services. When professionally advised by their insurers that they should seek evidence of independent cover from contractors, I think the Deputy will agree it is reasonable to act on such advice. I have no doubt that in acting in this way boards would bring a level of practicality to bear on the process of procuring services, given the mix of requirements and the value of contracts. In following the professional advice given and best practice in the procurement process, health boards are not in any way withdrawing public liability cover, as this was never provided for within health boards public liability arrangements.</P>

      <P>As the Deputy is aware, section 24 of Finance Act 2003 extends the current scheme of capital allowances for buildings used as private hospitals to hospitals providing certain acute services on an day case basis. The only change made to the provision is that, in the case of a day case hospital, the minimum bed requirement is being reduced to 40 beds from the 70 bed requirement that applies generally.</P>
      <P>The Exchequer cost of the extension of the capital allowances regime to private day care hospitals is dependent on the number and size of hospitals constructed under the scheme. As far as I am aware, there is only one such hospital planned at present. If the hospital construction cost was about &euro;22 million, this would result in an Exchequer cost of &euro;1.3 million per annum for a seven year period, giving a total of &euro;9 million on the basis of a 42% marginal tax rate for the investors who would claim the capital allowances. The annual cost of &euro;1.3 million would not commence until the hospital opened in 2004 or 2005. If one assumed that there could be in total seven such hospitals at an average building cost of &euro; 22 million per project, this would give a total Exchequer tax cost of about &euro;9 million per annum over a seven year period or longer, depending on the phasing of the construction of the various hospitals involved.</P>
      <P>I expect to receive proposals for tax reliefs on a wide range of issues in any budget or finance Bill process which I consider in that context. As I indicated on previous occasions, I am a supporter of properly focused, clearly defined reliefs where the benefits of the reliefs outweigh the cost and other factors.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">

      <P>Tax loopholes are provisions in the tax code which are <Col N="1002" /> exploited in a manner not intended by the Legislature in order to allow certain individuals, companies or other entities minimise their tax liability. As Minister for Finance, I have always moved swiftly to close off such loopholes when they come to my notice and will continue to do so.</P>
      <P>Tax incentives are provisions in the tax code designed mainly to meet a need in the economy by incentivising behaviour on the part of the tax paying public. They are spread throughout the tax system and are found under all tax headings, including income tax and corporation tax, the capital taxes and indirect taxes. They take a number of forms and have different, and sometimes several, objectives. These objectives include to: encourage investment in certain activities or geographical areas, for example, the business expansion scheme, film relief and urban, rural and town renewal schemes; reduce the cost of capital and thereby encourage business investment, for example, interest relief and various capital allowances; encourage certain expenditures, for example, contributions to pensions and medical insurance; encourage saving, for example, the special savings incentive accounts; assist in reducing particular costs incurred by individuals, for example, mortgage interest relief and health expenses; assist certain individuals, or activities, for example, the Revenue job assist scheme for the long-term unemployed.</P>
      <P>Reliefs and tax incentives, however desirable, narrow the tax base and, therefore, must be subject to ongoing review. I announced, in budget 2003, the abolition of capital allowances for investment in registered holiday cottages and the reduction in capital allowances for hotels to the rate applying generally to industrial buildings. I also indicated that a range of reliefs would not be extended beyond their end-2004 termination date. However, as I am also on the record as saying, I am a supporter of properly-focused, clearly-defined and specific reliefs. The Deputy's question would seem to suggest that all tax incentives should be phased out. I would not accept this nor would I accept that new incentives should not be introduced where the potential benefits outweigh other factors. I would like to assure the Deputy that all tax incentive schemes are kept under review, especially in the context of the annual Budget and Finance Bill process, to ensure they continue to meet the purpose or purposes for which they were introduced.</P>

      <P>In its programme, the Government reaffirmed that the Stability and Growth Pact provides the overall framework for Ireland's budgetary policy. The <Col N="1003" /> essential message of the Stability and Growth Pact is that, through fiscal prudence, we can ensure economic growrth and fiscal stability. At the recent spring European Council meeting in Brussels in March, Heads of State and Government approved a report from the ECOFIN Council on strengthening co-ordination of budgetary policies. The report stated that there is no need to change either the Treaty or the Stability and Growth Pact, nor to introduce new budgetary objectives or rules. However, the report made some recommendations regarding the effective application of the stability and growth pact. The main recommendations in this regard included the following: first, that the economic cycle should be taken into account when assessing compliance; second, countries with deficits exceeding the close to balance or surplus requirement must improve their budgetary position by an annual minimum of 0.5% of GDP; third, member states should avoid pro-cyclical policies; and fourth, greater attention will be paid to analysing the long-term sustainability of public finances and greater emphasis will be placed on reducing debt levels and the quality of public finances. I believe that the discipline of the Stability and Growth Pact has been good for Europe and for Ireland. We are not following these policies simply because of EU rules, but because they make good sense in themselves.</P>

      <P>On budget day, inflation, as measured by annual changes in the consumer price index, CPI, was projected to average 4.8% in 2003. This forecast was, as always, based on the technical assumption of unchanged interest rates. My Department will publish a revised estimate in the Economic Review and Outlook in the summer. It is expected that inflation will moderate this year from March, reflecting, first, the fact that last year's increase in VAT will fall out of the annual comparison; second, that services sector inflation is moderating and, third, the recent interest rate cuts. In terms of EU comparisons, the appropriate measure of inflation is the harmonised index of consumer prices, HICP. HICP inflation for Ireland for 2003 as a whole was forecast to be 4.2% on budget day. The Commission's autumn forecast was that euro area inflation would average 2% this year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1004" />The Irish price level has risen against that in the euro area in recent years and I am aware of the Central Bank's comments in this regard. The Irish price level has risen because Irish inflation has been exceeding the EU average for some time. This has been due partly to external factors such as the exchange rate, partly to the process of Ireland catching up in productivity terms with the rest of Europe and partly to domestic factors. However, we need to bring inflation down to levels comparable with those of our EU partners in order to maintain our competitiveness and to ensure that jobs are not lost. We must, therefore, concentrate our efforts on targeting domestic sources of inflation.</P>
    <P>In this context, the pay arrangements set out under the draft new social partnership agreement, Sustaining Progress, are important. By ensuring that wage increases are kept to sustainable levels, we can continue to focus on our competitiveness and avoid losing jobs. Also important will be the implementation, over the next 18 months, of the anti-inflation initiative agreed by Government, employers and union leaders to target key domestic sources of inflationary pressure. I am also aware that keeping public expenditure on target will be important if our inflation rate is to moderate and new management and control mechanisms have been put in place to this end.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy)</NameTxt>
      <P>Average disposable income, in the terms in which it is described by the Deputy, is not measured by my Department. However, it is the case that, for indicative purposes, my Department compiles data over time on what would be in any year the average tax rate for a single person on the average industrial wage. The average tax rate is the aggregate value of income tax, health levy and PRSI deductions as a percentage of gross income but it takes no account of particular additional credits etc. that might be claimed. It is influenced by changes in the average industrial wage as well as changes in the income tax, health levy and PRSI regimes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A figure for disposable income, being the gross wage less aggregate deductions, is produced. As this figure relates to the &ldquo;average&rdquo; industrial wage, it is not unreasonable that it might be regarded as &ldquo;average disposable income&rdquo;, that is the disposable income of a person on the average industrial wage. However, as is clear from my explanation, the figure does not take account of expenditure incurred by that person and any changes in expenditure that might be affected by fees, charges, or indirect taxes in the terms described by the Deputy. In addition, I might <Col N="1005" /> point out that the annual budget booklet contains tables which indicate the changes, since 1997, in the average tax rate on a number of sample income levels for various classes of income earner. These tables do not include any data relating to disposable earnings.</P>
    <P>I understand that the Central Statistics Office measures average weekly disposable income in the context of its household budget survey, which is currently carried out every five years. The survey, which is based on a representative sample of about 8,000 households, collects detailed information on all sources of household income and related taxes, which allow the calculation of gross and disposable income. For the purposes of the survey, household disposable income is defined as gross income less direct taxation &ndash; i.e. income tax, social insurance and levies. However, indirect taxes such as VAT and duty or fees and charges are not included in this measure.</P>
    <P>I might point out also that the OECD, in its annual publication &ldquo;Taxing Wages&rdquo;, usually produces comparative data on the average tax rate relating to the average production worker. Here again, however, the emphasis is on the level of taxation and social insurance type contributions rather than on disposable income.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>The examination of the State property portfolio by the Commissioners of Public Works with a view to identifying vacant, under-utilised, under-developed or surplus property is continuing. To date the process has produced a number of properties deemed suitable for detailed assessment to determine their potential for disposal or redevelopment. In assessing these particular properties, a range of considerations are being taken into account, including: (i) the planning issues in the context of their development potential; (ii) their overall condition; (iii) the extent to which decisions on decentralisation might impact on them; (iv) the alternative uses to which they might be put, including the possibility of their <Col N="1006" /> being used for housing purposes and (v) their market value.</P>
    <P>The first of the properties to come on stream is Ladd Lane, Baggot St., formerly a maintenance depot and stores for the building maintenance services of the Office of Public Works. Following the assessment process it has been decided to sell this property on the open market. It is proposed to use the proceeds from the sale of Ladd Lane to: (i) contribute towards the cost of fitting out accommodation acquired by the Office of Public Works to meet the local and regional requirements of the national education psychological service; (ii) purchase sites for Garda stations; (iii) fund priority refurbishment works on Garda stations throughout the country and (iv) fund the buy-out, where appropriate, of leasehold interest in properties currently bring rented by Office of Public Works for customer Departments. It is expected that decisions concerning a number of other properties-sites will be announced over the coming months.</P>

      <P>As outlined in a response to a parliamentary question on 25 February, the Revenue Commissioners have initiated discussions with the Cayman Islands for the negotiation of a tax information exchange agreement, TIEA. First round negotiations have not yet taken place. TIEAs are based on the OECD model agreement on exchange of information in tax matters, which was published in April 2002. The purpose of the model agreement is to promote international co-operation in tax matters through exchange of information. Any TIEA based on the model agreement will require jurisdictions, on request, to exchange bank information as well as information regarding the beneficial ownership of companies, partnerships and trusts. Exchange of information will be required for information relevant to criminal tax matters from 1 January 2004 and from 1 January 2006 for civil tax matters.</P>
      <P>In addition to the Cayman Islands, Revenue has initiated discussions with its counterparts in the Isle of Man, Guernsey and Jersey. The Deputy may wish to note that section 38 of the recently enacted Finance Act 2003 contains a provision permitting the Government to enter into tax information exchange agreements.</P>

To date, Revenue has collected &euro;44.57 million in tax, interest and penalties as a result of the investigations.

Of these, 15 involve relatively small sums and are unlikely to involve significant liability. Six cases are being dealt with in the Revenue prosecution division and three of these are currently before the courts. One pleaded guilty and the case is adjourned for sentence. The other two cases were referred to the Circuit Court for trial. The remaining three cases are under ongoing investigation with a view to prosecution.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 26, 51 and 84 together.</P>
      <P>One of the key principles underpinning the National Pensions Reserve Fund Act is the fact that the fund is managed by commissioners who are independent of Government. The commissioners control and manage the fund with discretionary authority to determine and implement an investment strategy. The Act required the commission to follow a strictly commercial investment mandate with the objective of securing the optimal return over the long-term subject to prudent risk management. In following this mandate, the commission has decided on a long-term asset allocation of 80% equities and 20% bonds.</P>
      <P>These features of the National Pensions Reserve Fund Act are similar to the trustee arrangements which exist in private pension funds. Along with the statutory prohibition on drawdowns from the fund prior to 2025, they insulate the fund from day to day pressures on government and enable the commission to take a long-term view. This is essential if the purpose for which the fund was established, to meet as much as possible of the cost to the exchequer of pension payments from the year 2025 until at least the year 2055, is to be achieved. I do not intend to propose any change to the provisions of the National Pensions Reserve Fund Act 2000 to direct the commissioners to invest fund moneys in any particular way. There is, of course, nothing to prevent the commissioners from investing in housing or other infrastructural projects in Ireland should they be satisfied that such investments are likely to yield a commercial return.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>By end-December 2002 a total of &euro;8,163 million had been paid into the NPRF since its inception in April 2001 by way of capital contributions from the exchequer. A further capital contribution of &euro;276 million was made in March 2003 bringing the total exchequer contribution to &euro;8,439 million. The provisional market value of <Col N="1009" /> the fund at end 2002, the latest date for which figures have been published by the commission, was &euro;7,426 million, i.e. there has been a decline of &euro;737 million between the capital contributions to end 2002 and the year-end value of the fund. This represents a return of -13.3% since the fund's inception, as opposed to a return for the fund's strategic benchmark of -24.4% and a return for the average Irish managed pension fund of -19.3%.</P>
    <P>The National Pensions Reserve Fund Act places a statutory requirement on the minister for Finance to make a payment of 1% of GNP into the fund each year. I have no plans to introduce amending legislation to change this requirement. To leave discretion in the making of the 1% contribution would, I am convinced, undermine the whole basis of the fund. If discretion were left in the making of the payment of the 1% contribution, it is likely that future Governments would come under pressure to prioritise shorter term economic goals at the expense of making the payment. It is essential that the mandatory contribution be maintained. Once it is breached for one purpose, it is more likely that it will be breached again.</P>

      <P>The targets set out in budget 2003 relate to a full year. At the end of the first quarter, the Exchequer position, including expenditure and tax receipts overall, are in line with expectations. In overall terms, tax receipts to end-March were in line with the profile published in January. Tax revenue, at &euro;6,956 million was 22% of the budget day target. Year-on-year, tax receipts were 11.9% higher than the same period in 2002. The full year budget target for tax revenue is an increase of 8% over 2002.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Individual tax heads varied in performance. Stamp duty and VAT performed particularly well. Corporation tax and income tax performed less well. To end March, income tax receipts were down 6.8% on the same period last year and a budget target of an increase of 2.7% for the whole year. Corporation tax to end March was 31% below profile. However, it was significantly up on the same period last year, an increase of 146.4%. This compares to a budget target of an increase of 5.5% for the whole year. The large year-on-year increase is due to an advance of preliminary tax payment date. However, it should be noted that the months of May, June and November all have much higher corporation tax targets than the cumulative amount collected in the first three months of 2003. The amounts collected in these months will influence 2003 prospects <Col N="1010" /> much more than will the amount collected in the first quarter.</P>
    <P>Public spending to end-March was within profile. The Revised Estimates for public services published last February provided that net voted spending on services will be &euro;30.8 billion or 6.7% more than provided in 2002. Year-on-year expenditure to end-March is 11.8% higher than the first quarter of 2002. Net voted spending on services to end-March was &euro;6.83 billion, 22.2% of the 2003 Estimate &ndash; some &euro;440 million below the profile for spending by Departments and offices to end March. However, this divergence is explained by timing factors. As I said in my press statement of 2 April, there are some spending pressures emerging but it is up to each Department to manage within their 2003 allocations.</P>

      <P>During the period 1995 to 2001, exports of goods and services rose by 15.4% per annum in real terms. In 2002, there was some slowing down in the rate of growth, predominantly due to the deterioration in international economic conditions. On budget day last year, my Department estimated that, for last year as a whole, exports of goods and services would rise by 4.6%. The most recent data for goods and services published by the Central Statistics Office shows that in the first three quarters of 2002 exports of goods and services were 6.7% higher than in the same period a year earlier. At budget time last year, the forecast for 2003 as a whole was for real export growth of 5%. Provisional figures for the month of January 2003 published by the CSO show that the value of merchandise exports fell by 8.6% in month-on-month terms; this is a fall of 24.4% when compared with the figure in the same month last year.</P>
      <P>As the House knows, Ireland has a very open economy which is more affected than many others by world economic conditions. The success of our economy relies significantly on continued inward investment and on the performance of the export sector in selling goods and services to other countries. In the context of the slowdown in the global economy and the recent appreciation of the euro, it is therefore increasingly important that the competitiveness of the economy improves in order to be ready to take advantage of the upturn in the global economy when it emerges.</P>

      <P>In terms of comparing living standards between countries, the cost common method is to consider gross domestic product, GDP, <i>per capita,</i> measured in purchasing power standards. On this measure, which corrects for differences in price levels between countries, Irish income <i>per capita</i> was 19% higher than the EU-15 average last year according to EUROSTAT. On this basis, only Luxembourg had a higher <i>per capita</i> income than Ireland in 2002.</P>
      <P>In Ireland, the gross national product, GNP, measure of national income provides a more accurate measure of the income levels accruing to Irish residents. The latest full year national income and expenditure data show that Irish GNP was 85% of Irish GDP in 2001. Adjusting the foregoing EUROSTAT figure accordingly, Irish income <i>per capita</i> measured in purchasing power standards was just above the EU-15 average last year. On this basis, <i>per capita</i> income here would appear to be well ahead of that in three still converging countries, similar to a middle group of six member states, and behind those in five wealthier EU countries. Income levels of Irish residents have improved from around 83% of the EU-15 average in the mid-1990s to reach the average last year according to the same EUROSTAT data, demonstrating the soundness of policy in recent years.</P>

      <P>The ECOFIN Council of 7 March last examined stability and growth programmes relating to Luxembourg and Portugal. This exercise took place in accordance with the Stability and Growth Pact, which requires member states to present annually updated stability and convergence programmes to the Council and the Commission. The aim of these programmes is to provide information on how member states intend to meet the objectives of the pact, in particular the medium term goal of a budget being close to balance or in surplus. They also provide an indication of how the member states have complied with the relevant recommendations of the broad economic policy guidelines.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards Luxembourg and Portugal, the Council examined the recommendations issued by the Commission on 19 February 2003 and approved opinions for them, on the basis of work carried out by the economic and financial committee. The opinions broadly stated that Luxembourg conforms to the requirements of the Stab<Col N="1012" /> ility and Growth Pact and that Portugal has reduced the general government deficit below 3% of GDP in 2002, the maximum level set out in the pact.</P>
    <P>The other main item at the ECOFIN Council was preparation for the spring European Council which took place in Brussels on 20-21 March last. The main purpose of the spring European Council is to push forward the Lisbon Process, a ten year programme to make the EU the most competitive economy in the world. A number of reports were examined and endorsed in this context, including a key issues paper on the broad economic policy guidelines; a report on strengthening the co-ordination of budgetary policies; a report on adequate and sustainable pensions; and a report on supporting national strategies for the future of health care and care for the elderly. As regards the report on the co-ordination of budgetary policies, the ECOFIN Council agreed with the Commission recommendation in the report that there was no need to change either the Treaty or the Stability and Growth Pact or to introduce new budgetary objectives or rules.</P>
    <P>The ECOFIN Council also discussed proposed new voting modalities in the governing council of the European Central Bank. Subsequently, an amendment of the voting modalities of the ECB governing council was agreed at the heads of state and government council meeting of 21 March. Finally, progress was made on the tax package and on EU budget issues, including guidelines for the EU budget for 2004. Overall, the ECOFIN Council meeting made good progress on the agenda items, in particular making an important contribution to the European Council later in March on the Lisbon process.</P>

      <P>In accordance with the principles underlying the strategic management initiative, my Department has been for some time pursuing an active policy of maximum delegation to Departments. In relation to large capital programmes therefore, responsibility for individual projects is generally delegated to the relevant Department. The role of my Department is to set out a clear framework in relation to the management of capital investment. In managing capital projects, Departments and implementing agencies are required to comply with my Department's guidelines for the appraisal and management of capital expenditure proposals in the public sector.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These guidelines, which are currently under review by my Department, set out four main stages of project appraisal and management. (1) The appraisal stage aims to provide a basis for a decision on whether to approve a project in prin<Col N="1013" /> ciple. This stage includes an assessment of uncertainty and risk. (2) The planning stage involves the establishment of a project management structure, preparation of a design brief, detailed planning and design of the project and a review of costings. If changes are proposed to the project in the course of the planning stage, the guidelines make it clear that the cost implications should be fully appraised and the approval of the sanctioning authority should be sought before proceeding. On receipt of a tender price and other relevant information, the case for proceeding with the proposal is again subject to review. Where it is proposed, following such reappraisal, to go ahead with a project at a price higher than that originally proposed, a decision will again be required by the sanctioning authority to proceed. (3) The implementation stage begins once the final approval for the award of a contract has been secured. If adverse developments occur, including unforeseen costs increases, which call into question the desirability or viability of the project, the sponsoring agency should consider necessary measures to rectify the situation. Where, despite these measures, increased costs are likely to arise, the approval of the sanctioning authority for the extra expenditure should be obtained before any commitment is made to accept cost increases. The viability of the project, given the changed circumstances, should also be reported. (4) The final stage following the completion of a project, is post project review. Such a review is recommended to evaluate both the outturn and the effectiveness of appraisal and management procedures.</P>
    <P>I am confident that the steps outlined in the guidelines provide sufficient guidance to Departments and agencies for the re-evaluation of projects at key points in the decision making process. I would stress that the onus is on Departments and implementing agencies to comply with these guidelines. My Department will be reinforcing this requirement in the context of the revised guidelines, which are expected to issue this year, and in the context of the five year multi-annual capital investment framework, which it is intended to agree with Departments also later this year.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy)</NameTxt>
      <P>In responding to this question, I consider it important to explain the context of the link between the implementation of the recommend<Col N="1014" /> ations of the Public Service Benchmarking Body and the modernisation agenda set out in the public service pay agreement under the social partnership agreement 2003-2005, Sustaining Progress. The recommendations of the Public Service Benchmarking Body were based on a comparison of pay and jobs across the public service and the wider economy. However, the body pointed out that change is accepted as an essential and ongoing criterion of survival, growth and prosperity in the private sector and said that the same considerations were a key requirement in the achievement of greater efficiency and effectiveness in the public service. Accordingly, the body said that implementation of its pay awards should be made conditional on agreement on issues of adaptability, change, flexibility and modernisation. The body further recommended that appropriate validation processes be established in this context.</P>
      <P>As Sustaining Progress has only just been ratified, it is premature to assess the impact of the public service modernisation provisions that it contains in terms of output or service improvements. I can say, however, that securing improvements in the quality and effectiveness of public services is central to achieving the agreed objectives of Sustaining Progress. This is reflected in the large number of commitments applying to the public service in the agreement on co-operation with flexibility and ongoing change, satisfactory implementation of the agenda for modernisation, the maintenance of stable industrial relations and the absence of industrial action. The implementation of these commitments will result in very considerable improvements in output and quality right across all sectors of the public service over the duration of the agreement and which will also continue into the foreseeable future.</P>
      <P>The active pursuit by the Government of this modernisation programme in order to achieve better value for money is an important element in the agreement. The Government's determination to ensure value for money is also reflected in t he provision in the agreement that the payment of, not only the final two phases of the benchmarking increase but also the general round increases of the agreement is dependent &ndash; in the case of each sector, organisation and grade in the public service &ndash; on verified satisfactory achievement of the commitments which it contains. I am satisfied that the outcome of the improvements arising from the implementation of the modernisation commitments in Sustaining Progress will be a public service comparable in quality with that in any other country.</P>

      <P>Following the recommendations of the review body on higher remuneration in the public sector in its report dated 25 September 2000, the Government decided to replace the then existing scheme in the civil service with a new scheme of performance-related awards and to introduce the new scheme in the Garda Síochana and the Defence Forces. The new scheme applies to Civil Service posts at the levels of assistant secretary and deputy secretary and to comparable posts in the Garda Síochána and the Defence Forces. The scheme applies with effect from 1 January 2002 in the Civil Service and with effect from 1 May 2002 in the other areas.</P>
      <P>Decisions on performance-related awards for individual posts are made by the Committee for Performance Awards based on recommendations from Secretaries General in the case of the civil service, the Garda Commissioner or the Chief of Staff of the Defence Forces. The committee comprises the Secretary General, public service management and development, Department of Finance, the Secretary General to the Government and three members from the private sector. The funding for awards is based on 10% of the payroll for the posts covered by the scheme. Within this overall limit, payments of up to 20% can be made to individuals.</P>
      <P>The Committee for Performance Awards has recently approved awards for the posts covered by the schemes of performance-related awards. To date, the awards approved cover 210 people. Of these 187 were in the Civil Service, 12 were in the Garda Síochána and 11 were in the Defence Forces. The awards made in respect of 2002 amounted to just under &euro;2 million. This amount comprised approximately &euro;1.8 million in the Civil Service, approximately &euro;79,000 in the Garda Síochána and &euro;57,000 in the Defence Forces. The overall amount of the awards represented 9.7% of the relevant pay bills.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The recommendations made to the Committee for Performance Awards by Secretaries General, the Garda Commmissioner or the Chief of Staff of the Defence forces in relation to awards for individuals were based on assessments of performance against pre-set objectives for 2002. The individual objectives vary from area to area, but are designed to go beyond the normal require<Col N="1016" /> ments of the jobs and are derived from the strategy statements for the organisations.</P>

      <P>Generally speaking building costs for projects and rental charges in rural towns are lower than in the capital city. The current average rental charges for Dublin office accommodation <Col N="1018" /> can be broken down into the following main categories &ndash; (i) third generation city centre @ &euro;500 per sq. metre, (ii) second generation city centre @ &euro;275 per sq. metre, and (iii) suburban @ &euro;130 per sq. metre. Current rental costs in the larger provincial towns and cities range from &euro;129 to &euro;226 per sq. metre. In general, maintenance costs tend to be specific to the building and the main contributory factors would be its age, condition, status etc. Building location would not have any substantial effect on the cost of ongoing maintenance.</P>
      <P>Factors which would need to be taken into account in determining possible savings to the Exchequer are as follows: building design and market forces; double overheads for a period during the move and until subsequent disposal of the old space; effective e-working; communication with headquarters; whether transfer of part or entire Department; training costs; and natural wastage &ndash; redistribution of staff. In the absence of such details it is not possible at this stage to state what Exchequer savings, if any, could be retained by a decentralisation programme.</P>

      <P>Section 24 of the Finance Act 2003 extends the current scheme of capital allowances for building used as private hospitals providing certain acute services on a day case basis. The only change made to the provision is that, in the case of a day case hospital, the minimum bed requirement is being reduced to 40 beds from the 70-bed requirement that applies generally.</P>
      <P>As far as I am aware, there is only one such day hospital planned at present under the recent changes made by Finance Act 2003. As the Act became law on 28 March 2003 it seems unlikely that any actual applications for tax relief were made to date.</P>

      <P>As I indicated in my reply to Parliamentary Question No. 170 of 25 February last, the current estimated cost of implementing the economic and social infrastructure operational programme of the NDP is &euro;40 billion in 2002 prices as compared to an original estimate of &euro;26 billion. The reasons for the increase cost are: construction industry inflation over the first three years of the plan was considerably in excess of that assumed; land costs, which impact heavily in the roads programme in particular, have also increased significantly; delays due to factors such as foot and mouth disease, environmental and archaeological factors and general planning considerations; and initial cost underestimation and subsequent re-specification of some projects.</P>
      <P>I am obviously concerned that cost increases have reduced the quantum of output in the first three years of the plan. My Department commissioned evaluations of both the NDP roads and public transport programmes last year which analysed the reasons for increases in the cost of these programmes and put forward a series of recommendations in regard to project and programme management. These recommendations are now being addressed by the Department of Transport and implementing agencies.</P>
      <P>In addition, Departments and implementing agencies are required to observe my Department's capital appraisal guidelines, the details of which I have set out in a separate reply to Question No. 31 on today's Order Paper. It is intended that revised capital appraisal guidelines will be issued by my Department later this year which will take account of experience in regard to NDP project management and appraisal, and compliance with which will be a condition of the agreement of a five year multi-annual framework for capital investment which I also hope to conclude with my ministerial colleagues this year.</P>
      <P>I should point out that, notwithstanding cost increases, very good progress has in fact been made in the roll-out of the infrastructure programme of the NDP. In the first three years of the plan the Exchequer investment in infrastructure has amounted to &euro;9 billion or about &euro;1 billion more than the original commitment and the plan is delivering on projects of unprecedented size and scope. I have no doubt that by end 2006, the NDP will have brought about a real enhancement in the quality of our economic and social infrastructure.</P>

      <P>As the House knows, Ireland has a very open economy which is more affected than many others by world economic conditions. The success of our economy relies significantly on continued inward investment and on the performance of the export sector in selling goods and services to other countries. My Department therefore keeps developments in the world economy under close and constant review.</P>
      <P>One of the most immediate issues for the global economic environment is that of how its prospects have been affected by recent developments in relation to the war in Iraq. The assessment of my Department is that the implications of the war in Iraq for the world economy are closely linked to the impact on the price of oil. A sustained, significant increase in the price of oil, if it were to happen, would tend to reduce disposable spending power and economic growth in our major trading partners. This would be likely to reduce our exports to those countries and could also add to inflation here. However, the House should note that there has as yet been no sustained significant increase in oil prices. The other main channels through which the war in Iraq could affect our economy are through consumer confidence levels, potentially lower foreign direct investment inflows and possible exchange rate developments. Given the uncertainty about possible developments in the Middle East it is not possible to quantify with any accuracy what the overall impact on our economy might be.</P>
      <P>Whether the war in Iraq impacts on the public finances will essentially be a matter of how the conflict impacts on economic activity here. In order to be as helpful as I can to the Deputy, I might point to the sensitivity analysis completed for the Irish stability programme update and published on budget day. This analysis calculated that a 1% impact on the GDP growth rate would change the general Government balance by about 0.5% of GDP.</P>

      <P>The seaside resort scheme was announced in the 1995 budget and commenced on 1 July 1995. It was extended on two occasions and terminated on 31 December 1999.

    </Speaker>
    <P>As the Deputy may be aware, I confirmed in my latest budget the termination dates for a range of incentive schemes including the urban renewal, rural renewal and park and ride schemes.

    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that the Customs and Excise Service and the Garda Síochána have a shared responsibility for drugs enforcement within the State. The Customs and Excise Service has primary responsibility for the prevention, detection, interception and seizure of controlled drugs intended to be smuggled or illegally imported into the State. The Garda Síochána has responsibility for the investigation of any related offences and also for post-importation offences. Having regard to the international dimension to drugs trafficking, and recognising that both-agencies have an important contribution to make, clear liaison arrangements exist to promote the highest degree of co-operation to prevent and to detect drug trafficking offences. Significant seizures of cannabis, cocaine, ecstasy and heroin in recent weeks are an illustration of the successes of both agencies and of the high level of co-operation which exists.</P>
      <P>In the past two years illegal drugs with a street value of &euro;94 million were seized by the Customs and Excise Service at points of entry into the State. The Garda Síochána seized drugs with a similar street value post-importation. While the availability of drugs clearly indicates that consignments do get through controls, I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that it is not possible to state with any degree of certainty the number of such consignments or the percentage of consignments that are not detected. There is no intelligence, international studies or analyses to suggest that 80% of illegal drug shipments bound for Ireland get through the law enforcement agencies undetected.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Drug trafficking has become increasingly globalised in its nature and criminal organisations employ a myriad of methods and constantly change their routings in their efforts to evade detection as they move illicit drugs across international frontiers. In recent times drug consignments destined for Ireland have been intercepted by law enforcement officers on the Continent and in Britain. Similarly, intelligence available indicates that several of the consignments seized in this jurisdiction did not have Ireland as their intended final destination. Therefore, national <Col N="1024" /> drug detection statistics often do not show the wider picture.</P>
    <P>The Government's response to the problem of drug abuse is set out in the &ldquo;Building on Experience&rdquo; document published in May 2001, which sets out the national drugs strategy 2001-2008. The strategy, which is overseen by the Cabinet Committee on Social Inclusion, is based on the four pillars of supply reduction, prevention, treatment and research. It details 100 specific actions that need to be implemented across the pillars. On the supply reduction side, the overall strategic aim is &ldquo;to reduce the availability of illicit drugs&rdquo;. Specific supply reduction targets have been set for the law enforcement agencies, the Garda Síochána and the Customs and Excise Service. The NDS commits these agencies &ldquo;to increase the volume of opiates and all other drugs seized by 25% by the end of 2004 and by 50% by the end of 2008, using 2000 seizures as a base&rdquo;. Considerable progress has already been made in delivering on these targets.</P>
    <P>Senior Customs and Excise and Garda officers attend the interdepartmental group of the NDS, which consists of high-level representatives of key Government Departments with a role to play in addressing issues related to illicit drug use. The Customs and Excise Service and the Garda will also be represented on all the regional drugs task forces that are currently being established. I am advised that the Revenue Commissioners have taken a number of specific initiatives in order to improve the effectiveness of the Customs and Excise Service in preventing the illegal importation of drugs. These include: an enhanced drug detector dog programme; re-launching of the customs drugs watch programme; the expansion of the memorandum of understanding programme; the drug precursor programme in liaison with the chemical industry; and the establishment of the national freight intelligence unit.</P>
    <P>The Revenue Commissioners has recently published its statement of strategy for 2003-2005. The strategy underlines the office's continued commitment to drugs enforcement and takes on board the supply reduction targets set out in the NDS as mentioned above. In addition to the measures already implemented, the commissioners are considering the acquisition of additional technical and other equipment in order to enhance the ability of the customs service to detect illegally imported drugs.</P>

      <P>As the Deputy is aware, transfers to the dormant accounts fund began on 1 April. As of last Friday, approximately &euro;80 million had been transferred to the fund. However, the institutions have until end-April to effect full transfer of all their dormant moneys, so I will not know until end April exactly how much has been realised.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am satisfied with the operation of the dormant accounts scheme. As I have said on many occasions in this House and elsewhere, the primary goal was to reunite people with money that they may have forgotten about or that they have inherited unbeknownst to them. I am delighted to report that it appears that almost 60% of the money estimated to be dormant in March of last year has since been reactivated. I think it is fair <Col N="1026" /> to say this means that the scheme has been a great success and has achieved its main purpose.</P>
    <P>As regards changes to the system now in place, my colleague, the Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs, has primary ministerial responsibility for the scheme, and it would be a matter for him to bring forward proposals.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 56 and 66 together.</P>
      <P>When the current ECB President Mr. Wim Duisenberg tendered his letter of resignation to the Secretary General of the European Council earlier this year, he indicated that while his preferred date for his resignation to come into effect would be 9 July 2003, his 68th birthday, he was agreeable to a later date being chosen.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Article 11.2 of the Protocol on the Statute of the European System of Central Banks and of the European Central Bank, clearly sets out the criteria under, and process by, which a successor to Mr. Duisenberg will be chosen. It states that the president, the vice-president and the other members of the executive board shall be <Col N="1027" /> appointed from among persons of recognised standing and professional experience in monetary or banking matters by common accord of the Governments of the member states at the level of Heads of State or Government, on a recommendation from the Council, after it has consulted the European Parliament and the governing council of the ECB.</P>
    <P>Given, therefore, that the formal process of appointment for a new ECB president will take some time to complete, it would seem doubtful at this stage that the post could be filled by early July. It was, therefore, agreed unanimously during the special ECOFIN meeting which I attended on Saturday last, to propose to the Heads of State or Government that they ask Mr. Duisenberg to remain in his current position until a duly elected new president is appointed. Mr. Duisenberg indicated that he was willing to do so. In my view, this is a prudent measure.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 57 and 73 together.</P>
      <P>On budget day, inflation, as measured by annual changes in the consumer price index, CPI, was projected to average 4.8% in 2003. This forecast was, as always, based on the technical assumption of unchanged interest rates. My Department will publish a revised estimate in the Economic Review and Outlook which will be published in the summer. It is expected that inflation will moderate this year from March, reflecting: first, the fact that last year's increase in VAT will fall out of the annual comparison; second, that services sector inflation is moderating; and third, the recent interest rate cuts.</P>
      <P>In terms of EU comparisons, the appropriate measure of inflation is the harmonised index of consumer prices, HICP. HICP inflation for Ireland for 2003 as a whole was forecast to be 4.2% on budget day. The Commission's autumn forecast estimated that euro area inflation would average 2.0% this year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Irish inflation has exceeded the EU and euro area average for some time now. This has occurred for a variety of reasons, both external <Col N="1028" /> and domestic. It is on those domestic sources of inflationary pressure that we must focus our attention if we are to bring inflation down and thereby maintain the competitiveness which has been key to our economic development. In this context, the adoption of the pay arrangements set out under the draft new social partnership agreement, Sustaining Progress, is significant as is the implementation over the next 18 months of the anti-inflation initiative agreed by Government, in conjunction with the social partners.</P>
    <P>I am also aware that keeping public expenditure on target will be important if our inflation rate is to moderate and new management and control mechanisms have been put in place to this end.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 58 and 61 together.</P>
      <P>I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that 18 applications for orders under Section 908 Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 have been sought by Revenue and have been granted by the High Court. The applications sought orders in respect of 26 financial institutions. A large volume of information has been and is being supplied to Revenue on foot of the orders.</P>
      <P>Following on the receipt of information from the financial institutions inquiry letters were issued, in October and January last. The inquiry letters relate to some 35.000 non-resident accounts that had 70,000 Irish addresses connected with them. Further inquiry letters are to issue shortly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The total amount received to date by Revenue in respect of its bogus non-resident investigations is &euro;385 million, inclusive of interest and penalties. This comprises &euro;227 million from 3,675 taxpayers under the 15 November 2001 voluntary disclosure <Col N="1029" /> arrangements and a further &euro;158 million since then. No precise data is yet available for the number of post-15 November 2001 settlements, but the &euro;158 million was made up of 3,850 payments. It is also clear that a significant number of cases to whom inquiry letters were issued have no additional tax liability.</P>
    <P>It is too early at this stage to estimate with certainty the amount of future settlements or the timing of the receipts from this ongoing investigation.</P>

Accordingly, I can only reply to this question in general terms.</P>
      <P>I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that the criteria governing the compilation and publication of lists of certain tax defaulters are set out in section 1086 of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997. This section imposes an obligation on the Revenue Commissioners to publish in <i>Iris Oifigiúil</i> a list, within three months of the end of each quarter, of the name, address and occupation of every defaulter who falls within the relevant criteria. The section also provides for certain exclusions from publication in certain cases such as those involving full voluntary disclosure in advance of an investigation, cases in which tax amnesty legislation applies or where the settlement does not exceed &euro;12,700 or the fines and penalties do not exceed a certain proportion of the tax included in the settlement.

      <P>Agreement between the public service employers and public service unions on the implementation of the benchmarking body's report has been reached in the context of the new national agreement, Sustaining Progress.

      <P>The agreement also sets out the conditions applying to the payment of the increases, other than the first quarter, as recommended by the benchmarking body. Briefly, the payment of the increases is dependent on industrial relations stability, co-operation with change and flexibility and on achievement of a number of specific commitments in each sector. The adherence to these conditions and their timely achievement will be verified by a process set out in section 26 of the Agreement. This should ensure that the payment of the increases will only be made on the basis of real and verified changes as recommended by the Benchmarking Body.</P>

The purpose of the review is to assess the extent of the flooding problem, clarify roles and responsibilities among the various State agencies involved in the issue of flood relief and recom<Col N="1031" /> mend practical action to deal with the problem more effectively in the future.</P>
      <P>The review group, which I chair, comprises the Office of Public Works, Department of Finance, Department of the Environment and Local Government, Dúchas, Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources, Department of Agriculture and Food, the County and City Managers Association, IBEC, and the IFA. The first meeting of the group took place on 17 January 2003, following which an advertisement was placed in the three national daily newspapers inviting submissions from all interested individuals and bodies wishing to have their views considered by the review group. The deadline for receipt of submissions was Friday, 28 March.</P>
      <P>In addition, the review group also identified a number of key stakeholders whose inputs they believe are important to the development of future policy and these bodies were approached directly for their comments.

      <P>I provide every support I consider appropriate to the Revenue Commissioners in carrying out their task of ensuring that everyone is tax compliant, and as I confirmed in response to earlier questions on this matter on 10 December 2002 and 25 February 2003, the commissioners consider that ongoing implementation of the efforts and initiatives which they are putting in place should result, over time, in a significant improvement in compliance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Revenue Commissioners have at their disposal a significant body of enhanced audit and <Col N="1032" /> investigative powers, much of which was provided during my term of office as Minister for Finance. I also provided them with over 400 additional staff in the past two years, most of which have been deployed in the audit and compliance areas.</P>
    <P>The Commissioners' Statement of Strategy 2003-05, published on 3 March last, contains a very strong emphasis on maximising compliance with tax and customs legislation and outlines a number of related key objectives and supporting strategies. As I outlined in my earlier responses, the commissioners inform me that they have recently advanced a number of key developments which will have a significant impact on tax compliance: an investigations and prosecutions division has been established to deal with prosecution of persons involved in serious tax evasion. Additional staff have been allocated to that division to give it the extra capacity it needs and to ensure that a reasonable number of serious evasion cases are investigated each year with a view to prosecution; a large cases division has been established with specific focus on large companies and wealthy individuals. This division is preparing a comprehensive analysis of the issues relating to large companies and wealthy individuals, in particular those which pose a risk to tax revenues across all the taxes and duties payable to the Exchequer; a computerised risk based selection system is under development and will be brought into operation this year. When fully operational, this system will allow for the screening of all tax returns against sectoral and business profiles and will provide a sophisticated selection basis for cases for audit; a new code of practice for Revenue audits is now in place. This outlines clearly the consequences of non-compliance and the penalty provisions which apply in such cases; increased resources have been applied to audit programmes and ongoing training programmes are in place to ensure that all Revenue auditors have the necessary knowledge and skills to audit effectively and efficiently; and a comprehensive strategy to improve tax returns compliance is at an advanced stage of consideration.</P>
    <P>As I also mentioned previously, the Revenue Commissioners are undergoing a fundamental restructuring with a view to increased efficiencies in managing the tax system and this restructuring advanced significantly to the implementation stage on 18 March. I have also, as Minister for Finance, given approval to the Revenue Commissioners to proceed with substantive integration of the taxes departmental and the general services grades in Revenue. The Revenue Commissioners have informed me that this restructuring and integration will facilitate the delivery of a sharp, uncompromising response to evasion and default while providing high quality services to the compliant. There will be a more integrated approach to case monitoring and more flexibility in focusing resources non-compliance in all its formats.</P>
    <P>The commissioners consider that the implementation of these efforts and initiatives will <Col N="1033" /> result, over time, in continued improvement in compliance.</P>

      <P>I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that they are in contact with the Portuguese authorities regarding the commencement of negotiations for a protocol to the Ireland-Portugal double taxation convention which has been in force since 1995. First round negotiations are expected to take place towards the end of May 2003.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will also be aware of an amendment to Irish domestic law that is contained in the Finance Act 2003. In certain circumstances, section 69 of the Finance Act will impose a capital gains tax charge in respect of a deemed disposal of certain assets owned by an individual on the last day of the last year of assessment for which the individual is taxable in the State, prior to becoming taxable elsewhere, where the individual disposes of these assets while resident outside the State and returns to the State within five years.</P>

      <P>The arrangements for appointments to the boards of State bodies are normally set out in the legislation establishing the bodies in question and are designed to ensure the efficient management of the organisation. Appointments to the boards are generally made by the Minister with responsibility for the body in question, subject to the consent of the Minister for Finance.</P>
      <P>In making appointments, Ministers seek to ensure that the people appointed bring a diverse range of relevant skills and experiences to the body. Ministers also take account of any specific legislative or policy requirements such as those contained in the Workers Participation (State Enterprises) Acts or the Government's policy on gender balance on the boards of State bodies.</P>
      <P>Where appropriate, Ministers may also consider representation from the different strands of society such as the business community, consumers, trades unions or the other social partners.</P>
      <P>I am happy that the present arrangements are working well and that people with the required skills and experience are appointed to State boards. I have no plans at present to introduce a procedure whereby appointments to State boards would be referred to the appropriate Oireachtas committee before confirmation in their positions.

      <P>Amendments to the voting modalities of the ECB governing council are necessitated by the pending accession of ten countries to the EU, their expected participation in ERM II, although not necessarily immediately after accession, and their expected ultimate adoption of the euro. The possibility of Sweden, Denmark and the UK adopting the euro, and of Bulgaria and Romania doing so should they accede to the EU in 2007, must also be allowed for. If the Council is to operate effectively and efficiently in such an expanded environment where there could be up to 27 euro area countries, some rotation of voting rights is required. Amendments to the voting modalities were allowed for in Article 5 of the Treaty of Nice.</P>
      <P>The governing council is the ECB's most important decision-making organ. It is composed of the six members of the executive board together with the governors of the different national central banks of the member states belonging to the euro area &ndash; 12 governors at present. In the current system, each member of the governing council has a single voting right, giving a total of 18 votes in all. The governing council's role is not solely confined to the setting of interest rates.</P>
      <P>ECB Recommendation ECB/2003/1 proposed amendments to the voting modalities of the ECB's governing council, through limiting the total number of voting rights in the governing council to a maximum of 21. While the six members of the executive board would benefit from a permanent right to vote, only 15 national governors at most would be able to exercise their voting right at any given time. Governors would be allocated to one of three groups &ndash; although until there are 21 of them there will only be two groups &ndash; on the basis of the relative rank of his or her country as measured by a composite indicator, based on GDP and on the importance of the financial sector in the country, and would vote on a rotating basis according to the share of the 15 votes assigned to their particular group.</P>
      <P>This new voting arrangement will not come into effect until such time as the Governors of at least 15, and possibly up to 18, national central banks sit on the ECB's governing council, that is when at least 15 member states have adopted the euro as their domestic currency. It will be some time, therefore, before it comes into operation. It would be expected that the Irish Governor would be in the second group, which is to eventually have 14 members sharing eight voting seats, and therefore to vote 57% of the time. It should be emphasised that the governors vote in their capacity as members of the governing council, and not as national representatives.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Once the Commission and the European Parliament had extended their opinions on the <Col N="1036" /> ECB's recommendation, it was discussed by the ECOFIN Council, where I supported the ECB's proposal on the basis that it provides a flexible yet robust structure capable of coping with the unpredictable sequencing of euro area enlargement. Then, as required under the relevant treaty provisions, it was put to Council at the level of the Heads of State or Government. This discussion took place at the Council meeting of 21 March 2003, where it was also agreed to. I will arrange for the Deputy to be provided with a copy of the ECB's proposal.</P>

      <P>The State Claims Agency has been in operation since December 2001. Since its establishment, it has taken over the management of 1,539 employer's liability, EL, and public liability, PL, claims.</P>
      <P>Some 66 EL and PL claims have been closed by the State Claims Agency at a cost of &euro;1.14 million. Of this amount, 27% was paid in legal fees and in fees to other experts such as medical and engineering consultants. An additional 66 EL and PL claims have been settled or have been the subject of court awards but final costs figures are not yet available as legal costs in these cases are still under negotiation.</P>
      <P>Prior to the establishment of the State Claims Agency, claims were not centrally co-ordinated and, because the agency has been in existence for only a relatively short period of time, it is not yet in a position to identify any trend in terms of the total cost of claims. However, this is something my Department will be monitoring in conjunction with the agency, and I am particularly determined that compensation claims will be vigorously defended and to eliminate any perception that the State might be perceived as a soft touch for such claims.</P>

      <P>I am satisfied that the improved expenditure monitoring and control arrangements which I announced in the House on 19 November last are being <Col N="1037" /> implemented in all Departments and offices. As part of this process I report on the expenditure position to the Government on a monthly basis and the Ministers for Health and Children, Education and Science, Social and Family Affairs and Justice, Equality and Law Reform submit separate reports to the Government on a bi-monthly basis.</P>
      <P>The expenditure monitoring and control arrangements required Departments and offices to provide timely information on their monthly spending; improve their risk assessment measures and introduce contingency planning to cater for unforeseen pressures which may emerge as the year progresses; and manage spending on demand-led schemes as effectively as with other spending programmes.</P>
      <P>In addition, Government has agreed incentives to improve efficiency and cost-effectiveness. For example, where Departments or offices secure savings as a result of efficiency measures or steps they have taken to curtail a programme, these savings should, as a general rule, be available for other high priority programmes within the same Department or office.</P>
      <P>While spending at the end of the first quarter was ahead of the year-on-year increase provided for in the revised estimates, it was behind profiled spending for that period. As I said in my press statement of 2 April, there are some spending pressures emerging but it is the responsibility of each Department to manage within their 2003 allocations. As such, although the percentage increase in departmental spending for the year to date is higher than shown in the Revised Estimates, the level of spending to date is broadly in line with expectations.</P>

      <P>The Revenue Commissioners are engaged in the implementation of an organisational restructuring which involves a wide-ranging programme of change to their current structures. The changes are designed to improve both the efficiency and effectiveness of the Revenue organisation.</P>
      <P>A key element of the restructuring is the focusing of resources within Revenue on areas which present the greatest potential risk of tax evasion or avoidance. In pursuit of this objective a number of specialist units are being established both at regional and national levels, whose role will include monitoring and enforcement of tax compliance among high wealth individuals and the gathering of intelligence relating to business and economic activity in particular sectors.</P>
      <P>While the vast majority of high wealth individuals are fully tax compliant, these units will identify and monitor the cases within that category which are seen as posing the greatest potential revenue risk. The units will ensure a timely and robust response where tax compliance problems develop.</P>
      <P>These units are not operational at this point. The process of implementing Revenue's new organisational structure is now under way but will continue for some months yet.

      <P>The commitments to modernisation set out in Sustaining Progress represent an ambitious agenda for change in the public service within a tight timeframe. In order that the commitments are met within this timeframe it is essential that there is no delay in implementing them. To this end, all secretaries general and other heads of offices have been requested by my Department to take early action to put in place the necessary measures to ensure that their organisations, other bodies under their aegis and the other sectors of the public service for which they are responsible will deliver on the change and modernisation commitments set out in Sustaining Progress. The SMI implementation group of secretaries general has also taken on the crucial roles of promoting the modernisation agenda over the duration of the agreement, of ensuring that action is taken to meet the commitments in the agreement, and of monitoring progress in this regard.</P>
      <P>Payment of the final two phases of the benchmarking increases and the general round increases is dependent, in the case of each sector, organisation and grade in the public service on verification of satisfactory achievement of the various commitments in the agreement, including satisfactory implementation of the agenda for modernisation. The parties to the agreement have therefore agreed to put appropriate arrangements in place to verify that the conditions for the payment of these increases have been met.</P>
      <P>The central feature of these arrangements is the establishment of performance verification groups for each sector of the public service which will make an assessment of progress no later than one month before each of the four payment dates specified in the agreement. These assessments will be made in relation to action plans for each organisation derived from the commitments in the agreement which have been agreed by each performance verification group, as well as on an assessment of progress achieved in the relevant sector provided by the secretary general responsible. The agreement also provides that each sectoral performance verification group will maintain close contact with each of the organisations under its remit throughout the reporting period; this degree of contact will also help ensure that action to implement commitments will be early, consistent and effective.</P>
      <P>Work has begun in my Department &ndash; and in each of the Departments responsible for the other sectors of the public service &ndash; to ensure that, as provided in the agreement, each performance verification group will be in place not later than one month after ratification of the agreement.</P>

      <P>In its programme, the Government reaffirmed that the Stability and Growth Pact provides the overall framework for Ireland's budgetary policy.</P>
      <P>The essential message of the Stability and Growth Pact is that through fiscal prudence we can ensure economic growth and fiscal stability. At the recent spring European Council meeting in Brussels in March, Heads of State and Government approved a report from the ECOFIN Council on strengthening co-ordination of budgetary policies. The report stated that there is no need to change either the treaty or the stability and growth pact, nor to introduce new budgetary objectives or rules. However, the report made some recommendations regarding the effective application of the stability and growth pact. The main recommendations in this regard included the following: first, that the economic cycle should be taken into account when assessing compliance; second, countries with deficits exceeding the close to balance or surplus requirement must improve their budgetary position by an annual minimum of 0.5% of GDP; third, member states should avoid pro-cyclical policies; and fourth, greater attention will be paid to analysing the long-term sustainablility of public finances and greater emphasis will be placed on reducing debt levels and the quality of public finances.</P>
      <P>The discipline of the Stability and Growth Pact has been good for Europe and for Ireland. We are not following these policies simply because of EU rules, but because they make good sense in themselves.</P>

      <P>Progress under the National Development Plan 2000-06 &ndash; NDP &ndash; is reported to the NDP-CSF monitoring committee on a bi-annual basis and the most recent progress report for the NDP was presented to the NDP-CSF monitoring committee on 29 November last. This progress report illustrates that the plan is generally achieving good financial progress. Cumulative expenditure under the <Col N="1041" /> national development plan to the end of June 2002, the latest figure available, is over &euro;15.4 billion. It is estimated that expenditure to the end of 2002 will total almost &euro;20 billion.</P>
      <P>NDP Exchequer investment in the key area of economic and social infrastructure &ndash; ESIOP &ndash; is well ahead of target. Taking account of the 2003 NDP capital provisions, including the budget day addition of &euro;209 million, it is estimated that by the end of 2003 ESIOP Exchequer investment will be &euro;12.2 billion, almost &euro;1.9 billion more than profiled. I acknowledged in my Budget Statement that cost increases have impacted adversely on the output and timescale of the NDP infrastructure programme, but nonetheless significant physical activity is in progress under the programme, including some projects unprecedented in scale and size.</P>
      <P>As regards the rest of the NDP, the Employment and Human Resources Development Operational Programme is making good progress and cumulative expenditure is expected to be about &euro;6 billion by the end of this year. The Productive Sector and Regional Operational Programmes are behind target levels due to the downturn in the global economy and factors such as delays in State aids approval from the EU and the impact of the foot and mouth crisis.</P>
      <P>The progress reports for each of the NDP's operational programmes are currently being compiled and they will be presented to each of the monitoring committees later this month. These progress reports will relate to progress under the NDP to the end of 2002 and can be provided following consideration and approval by each of their respective operational programme monitoring committees. A comprehensive progress report covering all of the NDP's operational programmes will be considered by the NDP-CSF monitoring committee in the middle of June.</P>

      <P>The terms of reference are as follows: (1) to enquire into the main statutory powers available to the Revenue Commissioners to establish tax liabilities including investigation with a view to prosecution of Revenue offences; (2) to advise the Minister for Finance as to the effectiveness of these powers, the appropriate balance between the need to secure the revenue of the State and the rights of the taxpayer, whether there is a need for further powers or streamlining of existing powers, comparable powers in other jurisdictions and other regulatory agencies in the State and the appropriate appeal or review mechanisms that should be applied in the exercise of these powers; and (3) to report on the results of their inquiries and considerations and to make such recommendations as they think fit to the Minister of Finance by 31 October 2003.</P>
      <P>The 31 October 2003 deadline is so that the group's recommendations can be considered, as appropriate, for the budget and Finance Bill 2004.</P>

      <Quest>the number of special savings investment scheme accounts opened at 31 December 2002, based on the annual returns for 2002 made by SSIA managers; the average amount of savings per investor per month; if, on the basis of such figures, his Department can give a definite figure for the likely cost to the Exchequer of the special savings investment scheme; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy)</NameTxt>
      <P>The 2002 annual returns by all special savings incentive account &ndash; SSIA &ndash; managers, which were due for submission to the Revenue Commissioners by 28 February 2003, are at present being analysed by them. However, in the meantime, I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that, based on manual declarations made by all qualifying savings managers at 31 December 2002, the total number of active accounts at 31 December 2002 was 1,147,962, as compared to 1,170,208 at 30 April 2002, a reduction of 26,246. Also, the average subscription per month at 31 December 2002, as derived from these manual declarations, was &euro;158. These figures are based on information provided to date by all qualifying saving managers in their 2002 declarations and revisions may be necessary if amendments to those declarations are received at a later date.</P>
      <P>It is impossible to give a definitive answer as to the eventual cost of the scheme as it is subject to a number of variables such as where participants die or where they withdraw from the scheme or vary their monthly contributions. The most recent monthly figures available in respect of the scheme are the subscriptions to 28 February 2003. The monthly tax credit pay-out made in March 2003 was &euro;44.1 million. It should be pointed out, however, that this is lower than the figures for January and February 2003 and the reduction is mainly due to adjustments made in respect of January 2003 claims by some financial institutions. On that basis, if the current average monthly payment for the first three months of 2003 continues for the full year, the annual cost in 2003 would be approximately &euro;530 million. This, however, is not a conclusive figure, and the final figure may be higher than that, if account holders increase their monthly contributions.</P>

      <P>The Equality Authority's report &ldquo;Building an Intercultural Society&rdquo; recommends that organisations <Col N="1044" /> should consider actively recruiting staff from black and minority ethnic groups to posts in the public service.</P>
      <P>The equality unit in my Department, which has general responsibility for equality issues in the Civil Service, is aware of this recommendation and will be taking it into account in the development and implementation of policy.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy will be aware, Civil Service policy in this area is set out in Diversity in the Civil Service, a policy on equality of opportunity covering all nine grounds under the Employment Equality Act 1998, which I launched last year. The policy firmly commits the Civil Service to ensuring equality of opportunity across all the human resource management areas, including recruitment, for all members of our society. This approach is in line with best practice in human resource management and also with the statutory obligations placed on employers by the Employment Equality Act 1998.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that the role of their offshore assets group is to identity the methods and means through which tax is evaded and avoided by transferring assets abroad; to develop appropriate and effective measures to counter this evasion and avoidance; and to develop systems to identify persons who use or have used these means of evasion and avoidance.</P>
      <P>While there are legitimate commercial and other reasons why individuals or companies hold assets offshore, it is clear also that offshore locations have been used to conceal income, profits and gains which should have been subjected to tax in this State.</P>
      <P>Due to the different types of assets, the various worldwide locations and the secrecy which surrounds offshore activity, it is not possible to identify the total value of assets held abroad by Irish residents or the level of tax evasion on such assets.</P>
      <P>Recent developments, both at EU and OECD level, in the fields of taxation of savings and exchange of information are designed to enhance the availability of financial information for Revenue authorities. In this context the Revenue Commissioners have initiated discussions with their counterparts in the Isle of Man, the Cayman Islands and the Channel Islands for the negotiation of tax information exchange agreements. It is expected that these developments will assist the work of Revenue's offshore assets group and impact on tax compliance generally.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy)</NameTxt>
      <P>The main focus of my role in the banking sector is the delivery of an appropriate legislative framework for prudential supervision. Once that statutory basis has been put in place, it is up to the Central Bank to operate the day-to-day prudential supervision of the banking sector. The quality of our system of financial supervision is widely recognised abroad. This is one of the reasons that Ireland is seen as a location to establish financial enterprises.</P>
      <P>As regards the core of the Deputy's question, it is not clear whether he has in mind the banks' competitiveness from the perspective of the provision of services to consumers or in terms of their ability to compete against other financial institutions internationally.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1046" />The Deputy will be aware that the Competition Authority is currently carrying out a study of competition in the provision of banking services in the State. I understand that the study covers the markets in which the clearing banks operate, including other participants in those markets such as the credit unions and An Post, but does not include investment banking. The study will seek to identify both the degree of rivalry between participants and any barriers to the entry of new participants. In the final analysis, it is the efficient operation of market forces that will ensure that there is effective competition between the banks in the services they supply to their customers.</P>
    <P>I would also refer the Deputy to the strategic review of banking undertaken by officials of my Department and of the Central Bank, and which was published in August 2000. It recommended that the regulatory authority for financial services should be mandated to monitor and report on competitiveness in the financial sector as it affects bank customers. I have accepted this proposal, and a provision to this effect is contained in the Central Bank and Financial Services Authority Bill 2002, which is currently before the Seanad.</P>
    <P>On the wider question of the ability of the banks to compete against their industry peers both domestically and internationally, this is primarily a matter for the banks themselves. However, the Deputy will be aware that I regularly make appropriate legislative changes to support the position of Ireland as a centre of excellence in financial services.</P>

      <Quest>the instances where communications between Ministers in relation to a particular matter which has been submitted to the Government for its consideration, have been released under the Freedom of Information Act 1997 where the public interest was not on balance better served by granting rather than refusing the request; and in each case if this release was made by the head of the public body, or on appeal to the Information Commissioner.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 92 to 96, inclusive, together.</P>
      <P>With regard to the matter of communications between Ministers, the application of specific exemptions or interest tests, other than those with general application, does not arise under the Act.</P>
      <P>Section 19 of the Act provides exemptions to records of the Government, which includes committees appointed by the Government with a specified membership. That section does not provide for the application of a public interest test, except in so far as it relates to the disclosure of the existence of a record. Access to the records of Government is generally refused under the provisions of the Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The 1997 Act sets out the basis for application of exemptions to records relating to security, defence, international relations, information obtained in confidence, commercially sensitive information and the deliberative process. Decisions on the application of those exemptions under the Freedom of Information Act 1997 and on how relevant public interest tests should be applied are made by desig<Col N="1049" /> nated decision-makers to whom the powers of Heads of Departments have been generally delegated.</P>
    <P>Where a particular exemption was applied, this would occur only after the decision-maker concluded that the application of any relevant public interest test did not outweigh invoking the exemption.</P>
    <P>The numbers of FOI requests refused under the relevant sections of the Act are not available in this Department.</P>
    <P>There were two instances in which such decisions to refuse access have been overturned by the FOI Commissioner where the reason given by the Commissioner related to the application of the public interest test.</P>
    <P>Information would generally not be available in relation to instances where a decision-maker had concluded that application of a public interest test warranted not invoking a potential exemption and releasing a record. Decision-makers usually record only grounds on which records are not being released.</P>

      <P>Any company proposing to write insurance business in Ireland, including health insurance, must have an authorisation either from my Department or from the authorising authority in another member state. If the insurance in question is regarded as substitutive health insurance, in that it may serve as a partial or complete alternative to the health cover provided by the statutory social security system, the insurance company is subject to specific provisions in the Health Insurance Acts and regulations 1994 to 2001. The EU non-life insurance directives provide that the Voluntary Health Insurance may operate in the market without an insurance licence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The purpose of the authorisation and subsequent supervision of insurance companies is to ensure that they comply with the requirements of the Insurance Acts and regulations so as to <Col N="1053" /> remain solvent and meet the expectations of policyholders and claimants.

      <P>The management of the industrial property portfolio is a day to day matter for IDA Ireland and not one in which I have a direct function. The total amount available to IDA Ireland in 2003 for building operations is &euro;35 million, which is made up of &euro;3 million in voted exchequer funding and &euro;32 million from its own resources, through sales of fixed assets.</P>
      <P>I have not received any requests for funding from the IDA in relation to the remedial works for the sewer and services at Ballybrit. I understand that the services in question were constructed by IDA Ireland in the mid-1970s and involved bringing foul sewer-surface sewer and water services from the existing services at IDA Ireland's Ballybrit industrial estate to service new lands acquired by the agency at Parkmore, located to the west of Galway city. These services are owned by IDA Ireland and are the sole means of providing these services to the Galway business and technology park, known as Parkmore East and West. At the time of construction, all costs attributed to the development of these services were borne by IDA Ireland.</P>
      <P>While IDA Ireland has indicated it has no objection in principle to the taking in charge of these services by Galway County Council, it must be noted that this would represent no strategic benefit to the agency in its industrial development remit. Thus, it is the view of the IDA that, in any such transfer, a proportion of the remaining capacity in both the foul sewer and the water supply must be available to industry locating on the business park. This remaining capacity is vital for the future marketing and development of the park, which is dependent on having a water supply and foul disposal capability that meets with the potential needs of IDA client companies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Galway City Council has informed IDA Ireland that it requires the agency to undertake approximately &euro;391,000 of remedial works to the services infrastructure prior to Galway City Council taking the services in charge. The works in question relate to parts of the infrastructure which may need future replacement in the short to medium term due to its age. It is the view of IDA Ireland that this level of expenditure is not warranted at the present time and that the services infrastructure does not require remedial <Col N="1054" /> work of the magnitude envisaged by Galway City Council. IDA has no plans to fund the costs of any remedial works over and above the level of works that they envisage. In the event of agreement being reached between IDA and Galway City Council regarding the scale of remedial works necessary in order to have the services taken in charge, funding for the works could be provided from within the IDA property budget.</P>

      <P>A comprehensive set of measures is contained in An Agreed Programme for Government the underlying purpose of which is to bring about an improvement in the functioning of the insurance market and in the system itself. In this context I announced last October a comprehensive programme for the fundamental reform of the insurance market. This includes publication of the report of the Personal Injuries Assessment Board implementation <Col N="1055" /> group, establishment of the PIAB on an interim basis and priority drafting of legislation to establish the PIAB on a statutory footing. The implementation group report was published last October and I appointed the Chairperson and ordinary members of the interim PIAB on 27 November. Legislation to establish the PIAB on a statutory basis is currently being prepared.</P>
      <P>It is generally acknowledged that the medical and legal costs associated with the settlement of insurance claims are disproportionately high. The PIAB is being established in order to bring about a reduction in the delivery costs of compensation in personal injuries cases. It will provide an alternative avenue through which claimants can obtain an assessment of the compensation appropriate to their particular injury, outside of the legal adversarial system.</P>

      <P>I am very much aware of the high cost of insurance in the State and I am concerned about the serious problems this is causing for many businesses and individuals.</P>
      <P>On 25 October last I announced my programme for fundamental insurance reform. The programme reflects the commitments given in An Agreed Programme for Government and comprises a comprehensive set of inter-related measures designed to improve the functioning of the insurance market. The key measures include: establishment of a ministerial committee, chaired by myself, to oversee implementation of the reform programme, including the 67 recommendations contained in the Motor Insurance Advisory Board report. This committee meets on a monthly basis; publication of the action plan to give effect to the MIAB recommendations within a target time frame This report was published last October. A number of the recommendations have already been implemented, some by the insurance industry and some by the relevant Departments. Progress on the other recommendations is continuing; publication of the report of the implementation group on the PIAB. This report was published last October; establishment of the PIAB on an interim basis. The chairman and ordinary members of the interim PIAB were appointed on 27 November 2002. Agreement on the initial drafting of legislation to put PIAB on a statutory basis has been reached and the general scheme of the Bill for the establishment of the PIAB on a statutory basis is intended to be published around the summer of 2003, after Government has given approval for drafting.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1056" />I am committed to bringing about improvements in the functioning of the insurance market. My Department, in conjunction with the Competition Authority, is undertaking a joint study into insurance. The study will identify and analyse barriers to entry and limitations on rivalry in the insurance marketplace. It is envisaged that the bulk of the work will be completed this year and that a report will be produced in the early part of 2004. While EU law precludes the imposition of price controls on insurance, I have made it clear that I expect reduced premiums from the insurance industry in response to the reform programme.</P>
    <P>The insurance industry's response will be carefully monitored. The acid test will be the impact felt in the consumer's pocket. In this regard, it is heartening to note the recent reported comments from a number of the major motor insurers here that further increases in premiums may not be necessary at present and, in one case, that they have already reduced premiums since the beginning of this year. As implementation of the measures contained in the reform programme continues, I expect this trend to continue.</P>

      <P>On 15 January 2003 I approved in principle the report of the Reserve Defence Forces review implementation board for the implementation of the recommendations of the special steering group on the Reserve, which had reported to me in September 1999. The Permanent Defence Force is now organised in a three-brigade structure and a defence forces training centre. The Reserve Defence Force will be similarly reorganised and restructured and it is envisaged that the implementation of these changes in the Reserve Defence Force will take place over a period of approximately six years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The White Paper on Defence recognised that a notable and important feature of the existing FCA organisation is its countrywide, geographical spread. This particular aspect will, in general terms, be retained in the future. The full organisational and establishment details of the new Reserve will be determined in the course of the ongoing detailed implementation process. Plans are currently being prepared within each brigade for the amalgamation of FCA units in line with the proposals outlined in the steering group report. The objective of this process is to ensure <Col N="1057" /> that better training and other facilities will be provided to members of the Reserve Defence Force. No decisions have yet been taken on the location of the proposed new amalgamated units but the military authorities have advised me that all proposed amalgamations will provide an optimal environment for personnel in the relevant areas to partake in the new enhanced Reserve Defence Force.</P>
    <P>Members of the FCA are already seeing the benefits of the reorganisation process in terms of better clothing and improved equipment and more and better quality training. As the process develops we will see additional benefits in terms of a clearer role for the Reserve, a better overall organisation structure and opportunities for suitably qualified Reserve personnel to serve overseas. We will also see benefits from the closer integration of the Reserve with the Army.</P>
    <P>I am mindful of the need to preserve and to retain the many traditional and well established strengths of the current Reserve system in Athenry, not least the admirable spirit of individual voluntary commitment, close social links with local communities and a good depth and scope as regards nation-wide geographical spread. No decision has yet been made on the future of the FCA in Athenry, but it is not proposed to reduce the number of FCA personnel who report for training there.</P>

      <P>In December 1997 a steering group was established to oversee a special study of the Reserve Defence Force. The objective of the study was to develop a blueprint for a more effective, efficient and value for money Reserve Defence Force. The group reported in August 1999. In July 1998 the Government approved the appointment of an interdepartmental task force on the future management and development of the Curragh of Kildare. The task force report was presented in June 1999. The report, while not published, was made available to the public in May 2000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In July 1999, Sir Frederick Snow and Partners was commissioned to report regarding air safety at Casement Aerodrome, Baldonnel. The final report was issued in November 1999 and was made available in March 2000. In August 1999, a review group was established to undertake an <Col N="1058" /> examination of the full range of medical services provided for members of the Defence Forces and to make recommendations as to the most economical, effective and efficient arrangements by which medical services can be delivered to the Defence Forces and, having regard to the Defence Forces review implementation plan, the future organisation, staffing, resources roles and responsibilities of the Medical Corps. The group reported in July 2000. In March 2001 an independent air accident safety audit of the Air Corps was commissioned, as recommended by the air accident investigation unit report into the Tramore accident. The final report of the consultants was received in July 2001. There are no plans to publish the report.</P>
    <P>In August 2001 a special steering group, comprising members of the Defence Forces and civilian experts, was established to study the nature and extent of bullying and sexual harassment in the Defence Forces, to review existing policies and procedures and to make recommendations on strategies and programmes of awareness and education in the area. The report was presented in March 2002 and has been made available. The Government task force on emergency planning was set up in October 2001 following the events of 11 September 2001. The work of the task force is ongoing and it has made three confidential reports to Government.</P>
    <P>Earlier this year, an inter-departmental committee on the national military archives was established, comprising representatives from my Department, the Defence Forces, the Departments of the Taoiseach and Arts, Sport and Tourism, the Office of Public Works, the National Archives and the National Museum, to examine and to advise on the best means of protecting and safeguarding the national military archives for the future. A report should be finalised before the end of the year.</P>

      <P>My Department received a draft Bill entitled Exotic and Dangerous Wild Animals Bill 1998 from the Irish Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals in May 1998.</P>
      <P>The position is that responsibility for exotic animals is shared by a number of Departments. The Department of Environment and Local Government is responsible for matters relating to the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species, CITES, and the Wildlife Acts 1976 to 2000 and is also the competent authority in relation to the transposition and implementation of Council Directive 1999/22/EC of 29 March 1999, which concerns the keeping of wild animals in zoos. One of the measures to be taken by member states under this directive is to prevent the escape of animals in order to avoid possible ecological threats to indigenous species and to prevent the intrusion of outside pets and vermin. The Office of Public Works has responsibility for Dublin Zoo.</P>
      <P>The area in which my Department has a responsibility in relation to exotic animals is in respect of compliance with animal health regulations regarding veterinary certification at time of import and export. Provided there is compliance with such veterinary rules, there can be no restriction in inter-Community trade in exotic animals. With regard to the suggested legislation submitted by the Irish Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, it should be noted that the situation with regard to the keeping of animals in zoos is now subject to the provisions of Council Directive 1999/22/EC of 29 March 1999 concerning the keeping of wild animals in zoos. I understand that the Department of Environment and Local Government is currently transposing this directive into Irish law.</P>

      <P>As the Mid Term Review proposals are still under discussion it is not possible to provide a definitive assessment of the position of individual producers at this stage.</P>
      <P>According to the Commission proposals, a person who sold his or her entire milk quota in the 2002-03 milk quota year would not have any entitlement to a dairy cow premium since the premium is to be based on the quota available on the holding on 31 March 2004. A person who received payment under the slaughter premium scheme in the reference period, would on that basis, have established an entitlement to payment under the proposals.</P>

      <P>Under the Animal Remedies Regulations 1996, a veterinary medicine can be allocated to one of six possible routes of supply. These are: veterinary surgeon only; prescription only; prescription only exempt; pharmacy only; licensed merchant; and companion animal medicine. The decision to allocate a particular veterinary medicine to a specific route of supply is taken on the basis of the criteria contained in Regulation 13 of the regulations following a detailed science-based evaluation of the product in question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The licensed merchant category describes a category of retail outlets which are licensed by the Minister for Agriculture and Food having met <Col N="1062" /> prescribed standards particularly in terms of premises and record keeping. It is a requirement that sales from such outlets must be by, or under the personal supervision of, a responsible person, being a person who has undergone an approved training course in the proper and safe handling and storage of veterinary medicines. By definition, the persons described are restricted to selling medicines allocated to either the licensed merchant or companion animal route of supply.</P>
    <P>There is a general prohibition under Regulation 36 of the Animal Remedies Regulations 1996, as amended by the Animal Remedies (Amendment) Regulations 2002 on the sale of any category of veterinary medicine other than from fixed premises. This prohibition does not apply to the sale by a veterinary surgeon of a veterinary medicine in the course of the provision of a professional service in respect of the treatment of animals under his or her care and about which he or she has been consulted in a professional capacity.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture and Food (Mr. Walsh)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Question Nos. 117 and 118 together.</P>
      <P>There are nine policy working groups and a steering group on animal health established under North-South arrangements. The remit of the groups includes TB and brucellosis, TSEs, other animal diseases, veterinary medicines, disease surveillance, animal welfare, import and export of live animals and animal products, animal identification, traceability and cross-Border aspects of fraud.</P>
      <P>Since the September 2002 meeting of the North South Ministerial Council, the policy working groups have progressed a number of initiatives towards the development of common animal health policies for the island of Ireland as a whole. This has involved the identification of areas meriting convergence of policies and establishing a timetable for implementation of convergence measures.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Specifically in regard to disease prevention, the disease surveillance group has been tasked with developing and agreeing by the end of this year <Col N="1063" /> the priorities within an animal disease surveillance strategy for the island as a whole, linking, where possible, with the disease surveillance strategy in Great Britain. This work is ongoing and takes into account the proposed strategy for enhancing veterinary surveillance in the UK.</P>
    <P>The policies on bovine TB in the North and South comply with the requirements of relevant EU directives. However, there are a number of policy differences with regard to testing of inconclusives, wildlife as a reservoir of infection, and valuation and compensation arrangements. The objective is to align the policies in both jurisdictions with a view to developing a common all-island framework for TB and brucellosis control.</P>

      <Quest>if a milk quota was allocated from the hardship reserve to a person (details supplied) in County Limerick in 2002.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture and Food (Mr. Walsh)</NameTxt>
      <P>Allocations of milk quota from the national reserve are granted on the basis of recommendations from the Milk Quota Appeals Tribunal. The tribunal is a body established to consider and advise on applications for additional quota from individual producers who have suffered severe hardship in the context of the milk quota system. My Department did not receive an application on the grounds of hardship from the person named in 2002. He may, however, apply to the tribunal in the 2003-04 milk quota year when the application forms become available. The forms will be available in the autumn from his co-operative or dairy or from the milk policy division of my Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The person named applied for additional milk quota under the recent scheme for the allocation of 32 million litres of milk quota to committed small and medium scale milk producers who satis<Col N="1068" /> fied certain criteria as set out in Public Notice No. 94/15. As the conditions of the scheme were not satisfied, an allocation was not made. An appeals procedure for this scheme exists and the person named has submitted an appeal. When the appeals process is completed each appellant will be notified of the outcome.</P>

      <Quest>if he will outline the proposals to be implemented in relation to food labelling following on the report of the food labelling group; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>
      <QRef>[10083/03]</QRef>
    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture and Food (Mr. Walsh)</NameTxt>
      <P>The proposals with the report of the food labelling group are as follows:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The following labelling information should be provided on foods sold loose: minimum durability; name; and ingredients liable to cause allergies. The amendment to Directive 2000/13/EC relating to allergies awaits adoption by the Council and European Parliament. In addition, in the case of processed meat products <Col N="1069" /> or food products with meat as an ingredient, sold loose, the total meat content broken down by species should be provided. This latter provision should also apply to the food service sector.</P>
    <P>The following labelling information should be provided on unprocessed poultry meat sold loose: the poultry class; price per weight unit; condition, fresh or frozen; recommended storage temperature; registered number of slaughterhouse; and country of origin if imported from a third country.</P>
    <P>The full list of ingredients liable to cause allergies or intolerances should be provided on pre-packaged food labels and in the food service sector. Misleading or ambiguous nutritional claims, health claims, functional claims, etc., should be prohibited. The EU proposal for a regulation which will address these issues should be fully supported by the Government. All food and drink labels must be clear, accurate and easy to read. A voluntary code of practice should be adopted by the food and drinks industry to ensure that all labels meet these criteria.</P>
    <P>The co-ordination and development of policy on food labelling should as far as possible be centralised in the Department of Agriculture and Food and the Department of Health and Children. A mechanism should be devised to facilitate full consultation between the authorities and all stakeholders in the adoption and implementation of any new regulation in this area including the recommendations in this report.</P>
    <P>The FSAI should have overall responsibility for the enforcement of the general and related specific labelling legislation by way of service contracts with the enforcement agencies. Synergies between the agencies, the avoidance of overlap and the use of risk management techniques should be key factors in ensuring an efficient and effective enforcement strategy. The FSAI should promote a culture of compliance with regard to food labelling legislation in all sectors. Adequate resources should be provided to ensure that legislative requirements regarding the inspection and analysis of food labelling are fully implemented.</P>
    <P>All enforcement officers including laboratory staff should be adequately trained in labelling. There should be a one-stop shop to deal with consumer inquiries and complaints regarding food labelling. It is recommended that the FSAI should carry out this role. Reports on the enforcement of the food labelling regulations should be published regularly by the FSAI. The transposition of EU legislation into national law, where necessary for the purpose of enforcement, should be done as soon as possible after the adoption and publication of such EU legislation.</P>
    <P>As part of its overall education policy, the Department of Education and Science should incorporate a module on food safety, labelling and consumer issues into the primary and secondary school curricula.</P>
    <P>Ongoing research into food labelling should be carried out to establish a scientific base for con<Col N="1070" /> sumers concerns in this area. The consumer liaison panel should examine this issue and draw up an appropriate research strategy.</P>
    <P>Safefood, the food safety promotion board, should, as part of its all-island food safety remit, initiate a public awareness campaign about food labelling, allergens, etc. and about consumers' legal entitlement to clear accurate labelling. Educational and promotional material and access to website information should be made available to consumers.</P>
    <P>The responsibilities of the food sector in producing safe food and providing accurate information on the label should be emphasised. The food sector should also play a leading role in educating the consumer about labels.</P>
    <P>Information on the origin of fresh, chilled and frozen sheep meat, pig meat and poultry meat sold in retail outlets, pre-packaged or otherwise, should be declared. Information on the origin of the primary meat protein source, beef, sheep meat, pig meat, poultry meat sold in the food service sector should be provided to the consumer.</P>
    <P>Consumer research should be carried out to establish: how origin should be defined in respect of fresh, chilled and frozen sheep meat, pig meat and poultry meat sold in retail outlets; how origin should be defined in respect of the primary meat protein source, beef, sheep meat, pig meat, poultry meat, sold in the food service sector; and the usefulness and effectiveness of the beef labelling regulations from a consumer perspective.</P>
    <P>Only where an imported food product undergoes substantial transformation in the importing country can the name of the importing country be given as the country of origin on the label or at the point of sale or consumption. To this effect substantial transformation should be clearly defined and harmonised across all EU member states.</P>
    <P>I have recently agreed a strategy for the implementation of these recommendations and to this end an interdepartmental and agency committee has been established to monitor implementation.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 124 and 125 together.</P>
      <P>The EU Programme for Peace and Reconciliation in Northern Ireland and the Border Region of Ireland, PEACE II is a unique EU funding programme for all of Northern Ireland and the Border region of Ireland &ndash; Cavan, Donegal, Leitrim, Louth, Monaghan, and Sligo. PEACE II aims to help Northern Ireland become a peaceful and stable society and to promote reconciliation in Northern Ireland and the Border region of Ireland. The programme runs from 2000 to 2004 and will provide around &euro;707 million for projects of which &euro;141 million will be spent in the Border region.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The PEACE 11 programme has five main themes or priorities. They are: economic renewal; <Col N="1072" /> social integration, inclusion and reconciliation; locally based regeneration and development strategies; outward and forward looking region and cross-Border co-operation.</P>
    <P>The following tables gives details as at 4 April 2003 for PEACE II, both in Northern Ireland and in the Border region of Ireland. The first table shows, for the five priorities listed, the number of applications received, number of applications approved and the average amount of grant awarded. The second table shows, again for the five priorities, the types of organisations who have been successful. The total in this second table does not exactly match the total of approved projects in the first table as organisations can record more than one category of sector and this leads in some cases to double counting.</P>

    <P>Prior to the establishment of the State Claims Agency, claims were not centrally co-ordinated. Because the agency has been in existence for only a relatively short period of time and in view of the small number of claims closed, it is not yet in a position to identify any trend in terms of the total cost of claims. However, this is something my Department will be monitoring in conjunction with the agency, and I am particularly determined that compensation claims will be vigorously defended to eliminate any perception that the State might be perceived as a soft touch for such claims.</P>

Since budget day, the ECB have reduced interest rates, and this will have a favourable impact on the CPI this year. Furthermore, Irish inflation will benefit from the recent appreciation of the euro and the easing of domestic inflationary pressure. On the other hand, oil prices remain a risk to the inflation outlook. My Department will publish a revised estimate in the economic review and outlook which will be published in the summer. Overall, I expect the inflation rate to moderate over the remainder of the year.</P>

      <P>Transfer pricing rules provide in general that transactions between connected companies must be priced at arm's length prices. Transfer pricing rules have existed for activities in the IFSC and for manufacturing companies for a number of years. In order to qualify for the 10% rate, IFSC companies must furnish a certificate from their auditors stating that their dealings are at arm's length. Manufacturing companies availing of the 10% rate must comply with legislation which requires generally that sales between connected parties must be priced on an arm's length basis. This provides for an appropriate amount of profits being taxable in Ireland.</P>
      <P>Transfer pricing rules do not allow foreign companies route profits through Irish subsidiaries in order to avail of low corporate tax rates as stated by the Deputy. Transfer pricing rules of any country are designed to ensure that taxable profits in that country are not understated. Transfer pricing is a complex area and any modernisation would need to be considered carefully. My officials have met the Institution of Taxation to discuss the issue. I assure the Deputy that, if I consider changes to be needed in this area, I will arrange for consultations with relevant experts on any proposals.</P>

      <P>In general terms, there is no distinction made between new and second-hand goods for VAT purposes. The rate of VAT that applies to sales of goods is the same whether those goods are sold new or second hand.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is not clear that the proposal being made by the Deputy would be in line with EU VAT law with which Irish VAT law must comply. It is not possible to introduce new zero rates, as we can only retain the zero rating that was in existence on 1 January 1991. This applies for the most part to food, oral medicines, books, children's clothes <Col N="1077" /> and shoes. Likewise, it is only possible to introduce reduced rates where they are specifically provided for in existing VAT law.</P>
    <P>There is a scheme for sales of movable second-hand goods which are sold by an auctioneer-dealer. Under this scheme, the auctioneer may charge VAT on the profit margin only. Generally the rate applicable to that sale is the rate which applies when the goods are sold as new. However, there are some exceptions, the main ones being works of art, antiques and collectors items. These goods are normally liable at the rate of 13.5%, but they become liable at the 21% rate when sold under the auction-margin scheme.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy)</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no plans at this time to make tax credits refundable. The essential purpose of the tax system is to raise revenue to provide funding for the services of the State. Changes to the income tax system determine how that contribution is collected from those paying tax. I would not accept that persons should necessarily have to gain from such budgetary changes if they are not paying income tax. They may, of course, benefit where their incomes are increasing and budget changes in relation to income tax keep them out of the tax net. In addition, they may benefit from changes in relation to social welfare, for example, as a result of increases in pensions, child benefit and family income supplement.</P>
      <P>The general issue of refundable tax credits was examined by a working group established under the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness and comprising representatives of the social partners and relevant government Departments. I understand that the report of the working group is being finalised at present and is expected to be available shortly. I await the report with interest.</P>
      <P>I understand from the Revenue Commissioners that, depending on the assumptions made, to make the basic personal and PAYE credits refundable would cost in the region of &euro;41.3 billion in a full year.</P>
      <P>Finally, I would draw the Deputy's attention to the fact that over my last six budgets, more than 380,000 income earners have been removed from the tax net altogether and the estimated total number of those who are exempt from taxation now stands at over 680,000 representing over 36% of all income earners. This compares with a figure of 380,000 &ndash; representing 25% of income earners &ndash; before the 1998 budget.</P>

I have been informed by that Minister that Mallow was designated for tax incentives under the 1999 urban renewal scheme. Designations under the scheme were based on integrated area plans (IAPs) submitted by local authorities and were in line with recommendations made by the independent expert advisory panel on urban renewal, which was established to assess all of the plans submitted. Under the Urban Renewal Act 1998, it was a matter for the relevant local authority to recommend sub-areas for designation within the area covered by the integrated area plan. Specific tax incentives were not sought by Cork County Council in respect of either of the two areas in question when the integrated area plan was originally submitted to the panel. The expert panel was confined to examining those proposals put forward by the council. Proposals which were not received at the time cannot now be considered. The recommendations made by the expert panel were accepted in full and that is the basis on which designation is now being implemented.</P>

      <P>I take it the Deputy's questions relate to voted current and capital expenditure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The revised Estimates for public services published last February provides that net voted spending on departmental services will be &euro;30.8 billion or 6.7% more than provided in 2002. Net voted expenditure to end March is 11.8% higher than the first quarter of 2002 but this, by itself, does not indicate an end year excess on departmental spending as compared with the revised Estimates projection of 6.7%. In fact, spending <Col N="1080" /> by Departments and offices to end March is some &euro;440 million less spending than projected in the spending profiles for Departments which I published on 31 January last. Spending by the Department of Social and Family Affairs is slightly ahead of profile by &euro;18 million against a total allocation of &euro;1.3 billion. This is due to timing factors. Spending by all other ministerial vote groups is within profile at this point in the year.</P>
    <P>As regards the sustainability of Government spending and income tax receipts, the end quarter Exchequer returns for both overall spending and tax revenue were broadly in line with expectations.</P>

      <P>The rate of inflation in Ireland has remained considerably above the EU average for some time now. The most recent CSO data show that Irish HICP inflation was 5.1% on February 2003, compared with a euro area average of 2.4%.</P>
      <P>I am conscious of the fact that Ireland's rate of inflation must be reduced as soon as possible in order to improve our competitiveness and ensure that jobs are not lost. It is essential that services sector inflation, which has been the main driver of domestically generated inflation, moderates. Adherence to the pay increases agreed under the new partnership agreement, Sustaining Progress, together with the implementation of the anti-inflation initiative is extremely important in this context. I am also aware that keeping public expenditure on target will be important if our inflation rate is to moderate and new management and control mechanisms have been put in place to this end.</P>

      <P>The budget day target for income tax in 2003 is &euro;9,307 million. At the end of the first quarter of 2003, the Exchequer had received &euro;2,012 million in income tax or close to 22% of the target for the year. In terms of the Revenue Commissioners' profile of tax revenue in 2003, published in January this year, Exchequer income tax receipts were some &euro;152 million below the net receipts for income tax which had been expected to be collected by Revenue in the first three months of the year.</P>
      <P>Certain other taxes, including corporation tax, are also currently performing below the collection targets set by the Revenue Commissioners while others, including VAT, are performing above the targets set.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 147 and 148 together.</P>
      <P>The targets set out in budget 2003 are annual targets for 2003 as a whole. At the end of the first quarter, the Exchequer position, including expenditure and tax receipts overall, is in line with expectations.</P>
      <P>In overall terms, tax receipts to end March were in line with the profile published in January. Tax revenue, at &euro;6,956 million was 22% of the budget day target. Year-on-year tax receipts were 11.9% higher than the same period in 2002. The full year budget target for tax revenue is an increase of 8% over 2002. Individual tax heads varied in performance. Stamp duty and VAT performed particularly well. Corporation tax and income tax performed less well.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To end March, income tax receipts were down 6.8% on the same period last year and a budget target of an increase of 2.7% for the whole year. Corporation tax to end March was 31% below profile. However, it was significantly up on the same period last year, at an increase of 146.4%. This compares to a budget target of an increase <Col N="1082" /> of 5.5% for the whole year. The large year on year increase is due to the advance of preliminary tax payment date. However, it should be noted that the months of May, June and November all have much higher corporation tax targets than the cumulative amount collected in the first three months of 2003. The amounts collected in these months will influence 2003 prospects much more than will the amount collected in the first quarter.</P>
    <P>Public spending to end March was within profile. The revised Estimates for public services published last February provided that net voted spending on services will be &euro;30.8 billion or 6.7% more than provided in 2002. Year on year expenditure to end March is 11.8% higher than the first quarter of 2002. Net voted spending on services to end March was &euro;6.83 billion, 22.2% of the 2003 Estimate. That is &euro;440 million below the profile for spending by Departments and offices to end March. However, this divergence is explained by timing factors.</P>
    <P>As I said in my press statement of 2 April, there are some spending pressures emerging but it is up to each Department to manage within their 2003 allocations. Overall, the first quarter results do not raise a question about the achievement of the 2003 budget target.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>For the first time, at last year's session of the UN Commission on Human Rights a number of Cuba's Latin American neighbours sponsored a radically different kind of resolution on human rights in Cuba. Instead of the adversarial indictments of previous years, the resolution took due account of Cuba's remarkable achievements in terms of health and education &ndash; which have been maintained as far as possible in spite of the unilateral embargo against the island, to which Ireland and the EU remain steadfastly opposed &ndash; and invited the Cuban authorities to emulate their own achievements in the field of social rights by efforts towards matching advances in the sphere of civil and political rights, in accordance with the provisions of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. In particular, the resolution encouraged the Cuban Government to accede to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights as well as the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights. The resolution also requested the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights to send a personal representative to Cuba to pursue the implementation of the resolution.</P>
      <P>Ireland welcomed this Latin American resolution as a fresh, constructive and non-confrontational new departure. In that spirit, and with the human rights of all Cubans at heart, it was decided to co-sponsor the resolution. On 27 January 2003, the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, Mr. Sergio Vieira de Mello, designated Ms Christine Chanet as his personal representative for Cuba. However, the Cuban Government, in a letter dated 11 February 2003 from the Minister for Foreign Affairs to the high commissioner, has said that it will refuse her entry to Cuba for the purpose of complying with the mandate laid down by the resolution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On 18 March 2003, in what Amnesty International has described as &ldquo;a massive crackdown on dissent&rdquo; a wave of arrests began to take place across the island of Cuba against what Amnesty International has identified as &ldquo;independent journalists, members of human rights groups, political activists and other perceived dissidents&rdquo;. As a result of these detentions, Amnesty International fears that, &ldquo;there may be as many as 77 new prisoners of conscience on the island&rdquo;, to add to those already in prison for, &ldquo;the non-violent exercise of their rights to freedom of expression and association&rdquo;. In addition to the detentions, Amnesty International also reports that two of Cuba's most distinguished human rights activists, Mr. Elizardo Sanchez and Mr. <Col N="1085" /> Oswaldo Paya, recipient of the European Parliament's Sakharov prize, are being subjected to systematic harassment.</P>
    <P>On 26 March 2003, the European Union condemned the arrests and demanded the release of the detainees &ndash; whom it regards as prisoners of conscience &ndash; without delay. The detainees have since been put on trial behind closed doors. Journalists, members of human rights groups and foreign diplomats have been denied access to the proceedings. Yesterday, 7 April 2003, the court began handing down long prison sentences.</P>
    <P>The Government recognises the idealism which inspired the Cuban revolution and respects its undoubted social achievements. However, we believe it is necessary to match those egalitarian accomplishments with similar advances in the sphere of human rights and fundamental freedoms. It is against the background of these factors that Ireland is approaching the discussions on the question of human rights in Cuba at the current session of the UN Commission on Human Rights.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 154 and 155 together.</P>
      <P>The PEACE II programme, worth &euro;707 million, aims to help Northern Ireland become a more stable and peaceful society and to promote reconciliation in Northern Ireland and the Border region. Discussions on how to maximise accessibility to the programme have been ongoing for some time.</P>
      <P>The possibility of simplifying the procedures and the application forms was raised by Finance Ministers at the last meeting of the North/South Ministerial Council in its special EU programmes body sectoral format on 9 October 2002 and was also discussed at the PEACE II monitoring committee meeting held on 13 November 2002, at which my Department is represented as an observer. Arising from these decisions, the SEUPB, which is the managing authority for the PEACE II programme, has taken steps to ensure that the application procedures are simplified.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>First, the option of a &ldquo;small grants scheme&rdquo;, for projects which are under an indicative threshold of &euro;15,000/stg £10,000, has been introduced. This enables an implementing body to utilise much simpler application forms. This method <Col N="1086" /> offers smaller projects much easier access to the PEACE II programme and a number of grants have already been approved using this procedure. Second, an overall review of the application form was undertaken which resulted in a particular recommendation to clarify the questions relating to &ldquo;peace distinctiveness&rdquo; on the application form. These questions have been adjusted to make evaluation clearer, so that the applicant can now better appreciate which distinctive elements from the project to identify in replying to this section of the form. The amended form is now in use.</P>
    <P>The special EU programmes body, as managing authority for the PEACE II programme, has overall responsibility for monitoring the operation of the programme and these simplification procedures will be kept under ongoing review by the SEUPB. The monitoring committee will also be following developments closely to see how effectively the new procedures are operating. My Department will be kept informed through its observer seat on the monitoring committee. The next meeting of the PEACE II monitoring committee is scheduled for 30 April in Fermanagh.</P>

      <P>The task force on policy regarding emigrants was established in December 2001 and presented its report to me at the end of August 2002. The report was also published at the same time. In March 2002, the communicating Europe group, chaired by the Department of Foreign Affairs, commissioned an independent report on a comprehensive communications strategy aimed at improving the transmission of information about the European Union to the Irish public. A report entitled Raising Awareness and Understanding of the European Union among the General Public &ndash; A communications Strategy was presented to the Department of Foreign Affairs in July 2002. The Government is continuing to review the manner in which information about the European Union is transmitted to the public, including the recommendations outlined in the report.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Against the backdrop of rapid expansion and projected growth in our national programme of assistance to developing countries, the Government commissioned an independent review of Ireland Aid in December 2000. A comprehensive report presenting a wide range of recommendations was published on 27 March 2002. A review of the human rights and democratisation scheme under the Ireland Aid programme was carried <Col N="1087" /> out in the second half of 2002. The report of the review was published in December 2002.</P>
    <P>An informal task force on agriculture and the private sector was established in December 2002 to develop ideas as to how Ireland Aid could assist the indigenous private sector in its partner countries to fulfil its essential role in the development of agriculture. Arising from the work of this task force, a number of pilot projects are to be implemented. There is no formal report by the task force.</P>
    <P>In December 2002, the Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs, Deputy Kitt, established a task force to advise him on the integration of information and communication technologies &ndash; ICTs &ndash; into Ireland Aid's activities in the six programme countries of sub-Saharan Africa in which it operates and to identify, launch and implement a number of specific projects in the ICT and development area. The task force is scheduled to complete its draft ICT and development strategy by the end of October 2003.</P>

      <P>Officials from my Department are making inquiries about this project and I will communicate with the Deputy in relation to it as soon as possible. From the initial papers received in this matter, it would appear that the most likely avenue of potential funding for this project would be the new missionary development fund recently announced by the Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs, Deputy Kitt, which will facilitate missionaries in their important development activities. The establishment of this fund means missionaries will have, for the first time, a dedicated budget designed to help them carry out development projects at community level. The new fund will be administered by the Agency for Personal Service Overseas which has established a close working relationship with missionaries over many years.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>Under the UN Charter, the Economic and Social Council, known as ECOSOC, is responsible for <Col N="1088" /> promoting higher standards of living, full employment and economic and social progress; identifying solutions to international economic, social and health problems; facilitating international cultural and educational co-operation; and encouraging universal respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms.</P>
      <P>ECOSOC has taken a lead role in key policy areas in recent years. For example, at recent annual sessions, Ministers have proposed specific actions to address the digital divide which are currently being acted upon by the international community and the UN system. In 2002 ECOSOC gave the first formal international endorsement of the new partnership for Africa's development &ndash; NEPAD. At this year's annual ECOSOC meeting, Ministers will consider how to promote an integrated approach to rural development for poverty eradication and sustainable development.</P>
      <P>There have been several reforms in recent years, including by the UN Secretary General, which have resulted in the streamlining of ECOSOC's working methods and made its work programme more relevant. These have included efforts to bring the council closer to the Bretton Woods institutions. ECOSOC has since 1998 held a high level meeting each April with the finance ministers who chair key committees at the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund and with the chair of the General Council of the WTO. Any more fundamental changes leading to a substantial alteration of the Council's mandate would require amendments to the relevant provisions of the UN Charter.</P>
      <P>Ireland has been elected by the General Assembly to take up a three-year term on the 54 member Council from 2003 to 2005. We will use our membership to continue to support the efficient and effective functioning of ECOSOC in accordance with its mandate under the UN Charter. The issue of ECOSOC's transformation into a permanent economic and security council has been discussed from time to time at the UN, most recently in the debate at the international conference on financing for development in April 2002. There has, to date, been no consensus on the proposal.</P>
      <P>Ireland believes the UN General Assembly, to which ECOSOC reports, which includes all member States of the UN, is the appropriate forum for high level debate on the issues which fall within ECOSOC's remit. We are not convinced that the proposal to establish a Permanent Economic and Social Council is either politically achievable or necessary. Such a body would, in our view, conflict with the present role of the General Assembly and would not necessarily be in the interests of all UN member states, particularly small member states.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Instead we prefer to work for improved coherence between the UN, including ECOSOC, the Bretton Woods institutions and the World Trade Organisation. The International Conference on Financing for Development agreed measures to strengthen this coherence to which all of the rel<Col N="1089" /> evant institutions have subscribed and which are now being implemented. Efforts to strengthen coherence between these institutions will be examined at a special high level meeting including ECOSOC, the Bretton Woods institutions and the WTO in New York on 14 April and at a ministerial meeting during the General Assembly in October 2003.</P>

      <P>At the Earth summit in Johannesburg in 2002 the Taoiseach re-iterated Irelands commitment to achieving, by 2007, the UN target of spending 0.7% of GNP on overseas development assistance. Total ODA increased from &euro;320 million (0.33% of GNI) in 2001 to some &euro;420 million (0.41% of GNI) in 2002. A further increase was provided for in 2003 bringing the total allocation for ODA to an expected &euro;450 million, the highest ever allocation in the history of the programme. Current indications are that we will again reach 0.41% of GNI in 2003. Maintaining our contribution as a proportion of GNI in these difficult times is a measure of the Government's clear commitment to the aid programme and to achieving the UN target of 0.7%.</P>
      <P>The scale and timing of future increases in funding required to achieve the UN target will be reviewed on an ongoing basis.</P>

      <P>The vocational training opportunities scheme, VTOS, which is operated by vocational education committees and funded by my Department, is open to adults aged 21 or over, who have been in receipt of an eligible social welfare payment for at least six months. Eligible payments consist of unemployment assistance/benefit, one-parent family payments, disability assistance/ benefit, invalidity pension, widow/widower's pension, deserted wife's allowance/benefit. Those signing for credits and dependent spouses of the above are also eligible.</P>
      <P>VTOS participants who have been in receipt of unemployment assistance or unemployment benefit receive a training allowance from the VEC in lieu of their social welfare entitlement.

      <P>Some 6,000 part-time places have been provided in the further education sector this academic year under a new back to education initiative which is aimed at providing flexible learning opportunities for those in employment, unemployed or not in the labour market. Provision is free for medical card holders, the unemployed and those in receipt of means-tested welfare payments, and their dependants; there is a reduced charge for other unwaged people with less than upper secondary education, and the remainder pay fees.</P>

      <P>I presume the Deputy is referring to the grant scheme for minor works the details of which are set out in the 2003 schools building programme which was published in January. The programme shows that &euro;18.1 million has been provided for the payment of this full grant. The programme also identifies explicitly that there are two parts to the grant &euro;12.5 million for payment of the standard grant of &euro;3,809 to each school and &euro;5.6 million for payment of the per capita element at &euro;12.70 per pupil.</P>
      <P>The published programme also made clear that an expenditure review of the scheme, involving inspections of up to 300 schools would be undertaken in the early part of the year. The purpose of the review is to ensure that the best use is being made of these funds by schools and to adjust the scheme in line with any recommendations that arise from the review. The review is about ensuring best practice and making the scheme as effective as possible. The published programme unambiguously states that the review is in the context of maintaining overall expenditure on the scheme at the same levels as in previous years. Arrangements for this review are being finalised at the moment. It is intended to complete it before the end of the current school year.</P>

      <P>The school in question currently has <Col N="1093" /> a staffing complement of a principal and three mainstream teachers based on pupil enrolment figures. The school also has the services of two full-time resource teachers on a shared basis and two full-time special needs assistant posts in order to cater for pupils with special educational needs.</P>
      <P>One of the special needs assistant posts was sanctioned to help cater for the needs of the pupil in question. This pupil has also been sanctioned 7.5 hours resource teaching support per week together with ten hours per week home tuition. My Department is satisfied that this level of support meets the needs of the pupils in question.</P>

      <Quest>the number of boys of secondary school age currently without a school placement; the number of these who have been diagnosed with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder or with specific learning disability and behavioural problems; and the action he proposes to take to deal with the problem.</Quest>

      <P>My Department does not have details of cases of children without a school placement except where the assistance of my Department has been sought in the matter by the parents or guardians of such children.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My Department gives assistance in securing placement in individual cases where, for whatever reason, a pupil is without a mainstream school place and the parents or guardian seek my Department's assistance. This can arise where a pupil has been excluded as a result of disruptive behaviour and where alternative arrangements need to be made. In these circumstances, my Department endeavours through a process of consultation with schools and through the inspectorate to assist his-her placement in another school. There are 91 placement cases currently in <Col N="1094" /> progress at post primary level. Some 76 relate to boys and 15 to girls. My Department does not differentiate in any way on the basis of gender in dealing with these cases. Many of these cases can be characterised by specific learning disability and behavioural problems, including attention deficit hyperactivity disorder.</P>
    <P>Section 29 of the Education Act 1998 provides for an appeal to the Secretary General of my Department where a board of management of a school or a person acting on behalf of the board refuses to enrol a student; suspends a student for a cumulative total of more than 20 days in an academic year; or expels a student from the school. An independent appeals mechanism is in place to deal with section 29 appeals. Under the Act, an appeal must be dealt with within 30 days with a provision for a 14 day extension to this period if required.</P>
    <P>The Education (Welfare) Act 2000, which came into effect on 5 July 2002, provides for the introduction of a comprehensive school attendance service, with responsibility for school attendance being given to a newly established body &ndash; the National Educational Welfare Board. An educational welfare officer will be assigned to every school for the purposes of the Act. The Act requires schools to draw up school attendance strategies in order to promote regular attendance and to foster an appreciation of learning amongst the students. The strategy will focus on arrangements for the identification of children who are at risk of dropping out of school at an early stage so that appropriate interventions may be put in place. The board will also assist schools in discharging their responsibilities under the Act.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 173, 213 and 214 together.</P>
      <P>An annual allocation of teaching posts is made by my Department to each vocational education committee based on nationally applied criteria. These criteria have been notified to school authorities and are also available on my Department's website. These criteria regulate the allocation of posts including remedial/learning support, additional provision for pupils with special needs and for schools which are designated as disadvantaged. Subject to the approved allocation it is a matter for the chief executive officer and the vocational education committee to deploy resources having regard to the priority needs of pupils and schools.</P>
      <P>Currently there are over 200 second level schools designated under the disadvantaged areas scheme. There are no plans in my Department to designate further second level schools as disadvantaged. However, I wish to assure the Deputy that the needs of Curragh post-primary school will be considered in the context of any future review of the disadvantaged scheme at second level.</P>
      <P>My Department allocates resource teaching posts, special needs assistant posts and additional teaching hours to vocational education committees and other second level school authorities to cater for special needs pupils. Each case is considered on its merits and additional allocations are made on the recommendation of the psychological service. My Department is currently processing a request by the relevant vocational education committee for additional teaching resources in respect of pupils in the school in question.</P>
      <P>This year I have introduced a new appeals procedure in regard to teacher allocations for second level schools. If a VEC is of the view that the allocation of teaching posts made for 2003-04 is not in accordance with the criteria, it may appeal to an independent appeals board.</P>

      <P>The position regarding the grant scheme for minor works is set out in the 2003 <Col N="1097" /> school building programme which was published in January.</P>
      <P>The programme shows that &euro;18.1 million has been provided for the payment of the full grant. The programme also identifies explicitly that there are two parts to the grant &ndash;&euro;12.5 million for payment of the standard grant of &euro;3,809 to each school and &euro;5.6 million for payment of the per capita element at &euro;12.70 per pupil.</P>
      <P>The published programme also made clear that an expenditure review of the scheme, involving inspections of up to 300 schools, would be undertaken in the early part of the year. The purpose of the review is to ensure that the best use is being made of these funds by schools and to adjust the scheme in line with any recommendations that arise from the review. The review is about ensuring best practice and making the scheme as effective as possible. The published programme unambiguously states that the review is in the context of maintaining overall expenditure on the scheme at the same levels as in previous years.</P>
      <P>Arrangements for this review are being finalised currently. It is intended to complete it before the end of the current school year.</P>

      <P>My Department's office in Tullamore advertised in early March 2003 to recruit temporary clerical officers to meet local requirements for short-time vacancies which may arise. Applicants were required to have a good general education, an aptitude for clerical work, good computer/ keyboard skills and interpersonal/customer service skills. Applicants were advised that shortlisting may take place in advance of the interview, depending on the number of applicants.</P>
      <P>The closing date for receipt of completed application forms was 28 March 2003 and due to the significant number of applications received, shortlisting will be required prior to the interview process. The criteria to be used for the shortlisting will be (i) education, (ii) identified clerical/ office work skills/experience, (iii) identified computer/keyboard skills/experience and (iv) identified interpersonal/customer service skills/ experience. It is expected that interviews to establish a panel will be held before the end of April 2003.</P>

      <P>Under my Department's higher education grant schemes, maintenance grants are available to eligible students pursuing approved undergraduate courses in other EU member states, including the UK. In general, approved courses are those pursued in a third level institution, which is maintained or assisted by recurrent grants from public funds.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1102" />Students attending approved courses in other EU member states are subject to the same conditions of funding as students attending approved courses in the State. The main conditions of funding relate to age, residence, means and nationality. Also, tax relief on tuition fees is available in respect of approved courses at undergraduate and postgraduate level in other EU member states.</P>
    <P>In recent years, the UK authorities introduced a number of changes in the financial support arrangements for students pursuing courses at further and higher education institutions. This included the introduction of an annual tuition fee for students entering further and higher education institutions for the first time from the 1998/99 academic year and the replacement of maintenance grants by student loans to be phased in from that year also. All EU students, including Irish students, are eligible for grant assistance towards the tuition fee, subject to the same conditions as apply to UK students.</P>

      <P>The position regarding the grant scheme for minor works is set out in the 2003 school building programme which was published in January. The programme shows that &euro;18.1 million has been provided for the payment of the full grant. The programme also identifies explicitly that there are two parts to the grant &euro;12.5 million for payment of the standard grant of &euro;3,809 to each school and &euro;5.6 million for payment of the per capita element at &euro;12.70 per pupil.</P>
      <P>The published programme also made clear that an expenditure review of the scheme, involving inspections of up to 300 schools would be undertaken in the early part of the year. The purpose of the review is to ensure that the best use is being made of these funds by schools and to adjust the scheme in line with any recommendations that arise from the review. The review is about ensuring best practice and making the scheme as effective as possible. The published programme unambiguously states that the review is in the context of maintaining overall expenditure on the scheme at the same levels as in previous years. Arrangements for this review are being finalised at the moment. It is intended to complete it before the end of the current school year.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 197 and 198 together.</P>
      <P>In October 2000, my Department introduced an annual physical education grant for all primary schools. Since the introduction of the scheme, my Department provided in excess of &euro;5.5 million in grant aid to primary schools under this scheme for schools to provide coaching or mentoring in connection with physical education or for the purchase of resource materials associated with the provision of physical education. Materials and equipment purchased by schools in previous years will generally be available to them for the current year.</P>
      <P>Under this grant scheme primary schools designated as disadvantaged schools were entitled to a grant of &euro;1,270 while other recognised primary schools were entitled to a grant of &euro;635. Approximately &euro;2.4 million was allocated to schools in 2002 under this scheme.</P>
      <P>In the light of the current budgetary constraints, I decided to withdraw payment of this grant to all primary schools for 2003. I will keep the position under review for future years. A corresponding grant for physical education was never introduced for second level schools.</P>

      <P>My Department funds three means-tested maintenance grant schemes for third level education students in respect of attendance on approved courses in approved third level institutions and one grant scheme in respect of post leaving certificate courses: (a) the higher education grants scheme, (b) the vocational education committees' scholarship scheme, (c) the third level maintenance grants scheme for trainees and (d) maintenance grants scheme for students attending post leaving certificate (PLC) courses.</P>
      <P>Where a student is already in receipt of a grant under one of these schemes, he or she may apply to the relevant local authority or VEC for the special rate of grant. Decisions on applications are taken by these bodies, based on the conditions and terms issued by my Department. These bodies do not refer individual applications to my Department except, in exceptional cases, where, for example, advice or instruction regarding a particular condition is desired.</P>
      <P>If an individual applicant considers that s/he has been unjustly refused the special rate of maintenance grant, s/he may appeal to the relevant local authority or VEC.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Where an individual applicant has had an appeal turned down, in writing, by the relevant <Col N="1107" /> local authority or VEC, and remains of the view that the body has not interpreted the conditions correctly in his/her case, a letter outlining the position may be sent to my Department. The student referred to by the Deputy submitted an appeal to the student support unit of my Department. The decision of the local authority to refuse the additional grant was upheld, as the reckonable income exceeded the income threshold specified in the scheme.</P>
    <P>It is not open to me or to my Department to depart from the terms of the schemes in individual cases.</P>

      <P>The position regarding the grant scheme for minor works is set out in the 2003 schools building programme which was published in January. The programme shows that &euro;18.1 million has been provided for the payment of the full grant. The programme also identifies explicitly that there are two parts to the grant &euro;12.5 million for payment of the standard grant of &euro;3,809 to each school and &euro;5.6 million for payment of the <i>per capita</i> element at &euro;12.70 per pupil.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The published programme also made clear that an expenditure review of the scheme, involving inspections of up to 300 schools, would be undertaken in the early part of the year. The purpose <Col N="1109" /> of the review is to ensure that the best use is being made of these funds by schools and to adjust the scheme in line with any recommendations which arise from the review. The review is about ensuring best practice and making the scheme as effective as possible. The published programme unambiguously states that the review is in the context of maintaining overall expenditure on the scheme at the same levels as in previous years. Arrangements for this review are being finalised at the moment. It is intended to complete it before the end of the current school year.</P>

      <P>My Department has grant-aided the provision of the new school building for North Kildare Educate Together which is now nearing completion. My Department has also recently advised the school that it can apply for a once-off start up grant of &euro;6,500 for the special class for children with autism. Based on the budgetary allocation, a sum of &euro;1.2 million was allocated towards the cost of providing furniture in primary schools in 2003. The Deputy will, therefore, appreciate that it is not possible, at this stage, to provide grant aid towards the cost of replacing furniture at the school. However, the school may use funds allocated by my Department under the terms of the grant scheme for minor works to purchase additional furniture, provided such funds are not required for more urgent and immediate works.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Mr. N. Dempsey)</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy is aware, a review was carried out by the national educational psychological service, NEPS, and covered a total of 788 applications from schools for resource teacher <Col N="1111" /> and-or special needs assistant support received by my Department between 21 October and 8 November 2002. The applications in question involved a total of 1,590 individual pupils in respect of whom support was sought.</P>
      <P>Of the 1,590 pupils involved, the review concluded that the applications in respect of 948 &ndash; 60% &ndash; of these pupils conformed to departmental circulars and the resources sought in these cases have been sanctioned. Deficiencies were identified in the remaining 642 cases. Where possible in such cases, NEPS made a recommendation as to the nature and level of the resources that should be provided and such resources have been sanctioned. However, in some cases, for example, where the school was unable to produce the relevant assessment report, no recommendation for resources could be made.</P>
      <P>The procedures which schools are required to follow in applying for the supports in question involve the completion of a standard application form in respect of each child and a summary application form covering all the children included in the school's application. The individual pupil form requires particulars of the child's name, address, age, category of disability under Circular 08/02 and the nature and level of the supports being sought in respect of the child. The summary application form requires particulars of the overall number of pupils in respect of whom support is sought, the total supports being sought in respect of those pupils and the total resources already sanctioned at the school to address special needs.</P>
      <P>Where an application seeks the allocation of resources on a shared basis with other schools, particulars of those schools is sought. The summary application form contains a declaration by the school principal confirming that the application has been discussed with the parents-guardians of the children and that their consent has been obtained to apply for the support being sought; the application is supported by the chairperson of the school's board of management; in making the application, full regard has been had to any support services already allocated to the school; the application is based on relevant assessment reports presented in respect of the pupils in question and available for inspection by the Department; where a shared post arrangement is proposed, the authorities of the other participating schools are in agreement with the proposal.</P>
      <P>The main deficiencies identified in the NEPS review related to situations where the level of support sought in respect of individual pupils in a particular disability category did not conform to the support levels identified in the circulars as applicable to the disability category in question, and circumstances in which the relevant assessment reports required to support the application were not available at the school for inspection by NEPS.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1112" />Applications for resources, received by my Department between 11 November 2002 and 14 February 2003, amounting to some 2,858 individual applications, have been forwarded to NEPS. The applicant schools have been asked to submit relevant supporting documentation directly to NEPS and will be notified of the outcome in the near future. I am satisfied that a comprehensive approach is being taken by Department and NEPS to respond to the needs of pupils with special educational needs in ordinary national schools.</P>

      <P>I understand that the Deputy is referring to the provision of temporary accommodation to schools in need of such facilities. My Department endeavours to provide adequate accommodation at primary and post-primary level by way of the provision of permanent accommodation where possible, or alternatively, by way of rental and-or purchase of temporary classroom facilities. The number of temporary units provided at any one time varies depending on the number of building projects completed and the number of new applications received.</P>
      <P>The number of primary schools which received funding for rental of temporary school premises in 2002 was 466. The total expenditure on the rental of temporary school premises in 2002 was &euro;8.4 million. Statistics on the number of schools which received funding under the rental scheme for 2001 are not readily available. However, expenditure amounted to &euro;6.3m in that year. With regard to the purchase of temporary accommodation for primary schools, expenditure in this area amounted to approximately &euro;5.5 million in 2001 and &euro;17 million in 2002. Statistics on the number of schools which benefited are not readily available.</P>
      <P>At post primary level, expenditure on the rental of temporary accommodation amounted to &euro;274,000 in 2001 and &euro;423,000 in 2002.

      <P>The mainstream staffing of a primary school is determined by reference to the enrolment of the school on the 30 September of the previous school year. The number of mainstream teaching posts sanctioned is determined by reference to a staffing schedule, which is finalised for a particular school year following discussions with the education partners. The staffing schedule for the coming school year is outlined in a circular which has recently been issued by my Department to all boards of management. Accordingly, all boards will be aware of the actual staffing position for their schools.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is the responsibility of the managerial authorities of schools that are not in a position to admit all pupils seeking entry to implement an enrolment policy in accordance with the Education Act. In this regard a board of management may find it necessary to restrict enrolment to children from a particular area or a particular age group or, occasionally, on the basis of some other criterion. In formulating an admissions policy a school must, however, ensure it is lawful. In particular, it must act in accordance with section 7 of the Equal Status Act 2000 which, subject to very limited exceptions, prohibits schools from discriminating against people in relation to a number of matters including the admission or the <Col N="1114" /> terms or conditions of admission of a person as a student to the school.</P>
    <P>Where a board of management refuses to enrol a student in a school the parent of the student or, where the student has reached 18 years of age, the student, following the conclusion of any appeal procedures at school level, has a statutory entitlement under section 29 of the Education Act to appeal that decision to the Secretary General of the Department of Education and Science. A committee is established to hear the appeal with hearings conducted with a minimum of formality. In most cases appeals must be dealt with in 30 days. Where appropriate, the Secretary General may give whatever directions to the board of management that are considered necessary to remedy the matter complained of.</P>
    <P>In addition, in cases where parents experience difficulties in having their child admitted to the school system, my Department gives assistance in securing a suitable school placement through the involvement of the inspectorate in a consultative process with the school authorities. In relation to the provision of extra facilities, the 2003 school building programme has now been published and full details in relation to individual projects are available on my Department's website at www.education.ie. On the basis of the budgetary allocation it was not possible to include any further projects in 2003. The budgetary allocation for 2004 and subsequent years will determine the rate of progress on applications-projects that could not be included in this year's programme.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Mr. N. Dempsey)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 220 and 221 together.</P>
      <P>My Department does not engage in direct consultations with the Department of the Environment and Local Government in relation to the planning or control of increased housing provision. The process of assessing the need for educational facilities at primary or second level in any given area entails consideration by my Department of all relevant factors, including enrolment and demographic trends, housing developments and the capacity of existing schools to meet the demand for places.</P>
      <P>As part of this process, my Department monitors county development plans and area action plans and meets with local authorities as required to establish the location, scale and pace of major housing developments. Liaison with existing schools is important, also, and these would usually alert my Department where the need for additional accommodation is anticipated. My Department also obtains statistical information from the Department of the Environment and Local Government on a quarterly basis, relating to house completions by sector, area and type.</P>
      <P>An assessment is carried out of the likely implications of major housing developments in relation to the capacity of any existing schools. In the event that the level of development and population growth in an area indicates a likely long-term need for additional primary or second level educational provision, a decision is made on the means by which that need should be met. Generally, this involves the provision of permanent accommodation in the form of a new school or an extension to existing facilities. Where appropriate, the local authority is requested to reserve a site for educational purposes and the Department acquires the site for school building purposes, in due course. Temporary or prefabricated accommodation is normally provided to alleviate short-term accommodation needs.</P>

      <P>Psychological reports are highly confidential documents with a restricted circulation. Their primary purpose is to provide advice to the adults who are mainly concerned with children who have been assessed. Normally, these reports are supplied to the school attended by the child and-or to the child's parents.</P>
      <P>When a child is about to leave primary school, the parents of children who are the subject of any confidential reports should be contacted. They should be given the option of either taking the reports themselves, or of giving written consent to the primary school principal to send the reports, to the relevant post primary school. In no circumstances should schools forward psychological reports to other schools or agencies unless they have written parental consent to do so. It should be noted that, if a psychological report is more than two-three years old, its usefulness is likely to be limited. My Department has no plans to arrange for the automatic transfer of psychological reports from primary to post-primary schools.</P>

      <P>I presume the Deputy is referring to the grant scheme for minor works, the details of which were set in the 2003 school building programme, which was published in January. The programme shows that &euro;18.1 million has been provided for the payment of the full grant. The programme also identifies explicitly that there are two parts to the grant &euro;12.5 million for payment of the standard grant of &euro;3,809 to each school and &euro;5.6 million for payment of the <i>per capita </i>element at &euro;12.70 per pupil. The published programme also made clear that an expenditure review of the scheme, involving inspections of up to 300 schools would be undertaken in the early part of the year. The purpose of the review is to ensure that the best use is being made of these funds by schools and to adjust the scheme in line with any recommendations that arise from the review. The review is about ensuring best practice and making the scheme as effective as possible. The published programme unambiguously states that the review is in the context of maintaining overall expenditure on the scheme at the same levels as in previous years. Arrangements for this review are <Col N="1117" /> being finalised at the moment. It is intended to complete it before the end of the current school year.</P>

      <P>For the purposes of the post-primary education scheme, the country has been divided into catchment areas, each of which has its own post primary centre. The Adare and Kildimo areas are in Limerick city centre. Pupils from these areas mainly attend schools in Limerick city, including the Villiers school. There are two contractors' buses and a scheduled service operating from Adare to Limerick city and a scheduled service from Kildimo to accommodate these pupils. School bus services from Adare and Kildimo do not operate to any specific post primary school in Limerick as travel entitlement is to Limerick centre. From the centre pupils may avail of scheduled city bus services and auxiliaries to those services to individual schools, including Villiers post primary school, on payment of the school child fare. There are no plans to establish a school bus service from Adare or Kildimo directly to Villiers, to do so would be in contravention of the school transport scheme.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. N. Dempsey Mr. N. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Mr. N. Dempsey)</NameTxt>
      <P>Under the terms of my Department's third level maintenance grant schemes, a mature student is defined as a candidate who is at least 23 years of age on 1 January of the year of entry or re-entry to an approved course. Mature students are categorised as either independent mature students or mature students dependent on parents. An independent mature student is defined to mean a mature student who was not ordinarily resident at home with his-her parents from the October preceding their entry or re-entry to an approved course. Independent mature students are assessed without reference to either their parents' income or address.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When assessing the means of students other than independent mature students, the schemes specify that the students' means and those of their parents or guardians must be below a prescribed limit. This provision requires that parental income be taken into account irrespective of the <Col N="1119" /> individual circumstances in any case where the student is not an independent mature student. Generally speaking, candidates continue to be assessed under the terms and conditions of the scheme appropriate to their year of entry. Accordingly, candidates who were not classified as independent mature students at the time of entry to an approved course may not generally be assessed as such for the duration of their courses.</P>
    <P>There is, however, provision under the terms of the schemes for candidates who are re-entering as mature students, following a break in study of at least one year, to pursue or complete an approved course for the first time. Such candidates may be assessed under the terms of the scheme appropriate to the year in which they re-enter. In addition to the three third level maintenance grant schemes, my Department also funds a maintenance grant scheme in respect of students attending approved post-leaving certificate courses in approved PLC centres. A year spent pursuing an approved PLC course, which has attracted Exchequer funding, does not constitute a break of one year as defined under the terms of the third level maintenance grant schemes. Such students may, however, be assessed under the terms and conditions of the scheme appropriate to their year of entry to an approved third level course.</P>

      <P>The national lottery funded sports <Col N="1128" /> capital programme, which is administered by my Department, allocates funding to sporting and community organisations at local, regional and national level. Projects must be directly related to the provision of sport and recreation facilities and be of a capital nature which, for the purpose of the programme, is defined as: expenditure on the improvement or construction of an asset and includes any costs directly incurred in this process; and purchase of permanently based sports equipment, that means that it is securely housed, and will remain in use for five years or more.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1129" />The programme does not assist in the purchase of sites, premises or personal equipment, such as sports kits, gloves and personal protective clothing.</P>
    <P>One of the main objectives of the sports capital programme is to prioritise the needs of disadvantaged areas in the provision of facilities. Funding of up to 80% of the total project cost is available towards projects in areas of disadvantage and the minimum local contribution to be raised by applicants is 20% rather than the 30% in non-disadvantaged areas. In terms of the assessment of applications, location in a disadvantaged area is one of the assessment criteria and therefore projects located in disadvantaged areas automatically receive points in terms of the overall assessment score, the number of points being dependent on the disadvantaged rating of the location.</P>
    <P>For the 2003 sports capital programme disadvantaged areas have been defined as those areas that have been designated by Government for special support through the local drugs task force, RAPID 1, RAPID 2 and CLÁR programmes.</P>
    <P>I advertised and invited applications to the 2003 programme in the national newspapers on 23 and 24 March. The deadline for receipt of completed applications is 5 p.m. on Friday, 25 April. Application forms are available on request from my Department and are also available on my Department's website at www.arts-sport-tourism.gov.ie.</P>

      <P>A grant of &euro;25,395 was provisionally allocated to Knockavilla Donaskeigh Kickhams GAA Club under the 2000 sports capital programme operated by my Department towards pitch development. The grant was subject to the terms and conditions of the programme and on the basis of documentation received from the club two payments totalling &euro;19,000 have been made to date. The balance of the grant will be released when the club submits a certificate of completion from its technical supervisor and when an acknowledgement is received for a payment of &euro;10,333 made to the club in February.</P>

      <P>The national lottery funded sports <Col N="1130" /> capital programme, which is administered by my Department, allocates funding to projects which are directly related to the provision of sport and recreation facilities and are of a capital nature. Funding can be allocated to the following organisations under the programme: voluntary and community organisations, including sports clubs; in certain circumstances, schools, colleges and local authorities; and national governing bodies of sport and third level education institutions where it is evident that the proposed facility will contribute to the regional and/or national sporting infrastructure.</P>
      <P>The funding allocated to sports club projects located in County Dublin in the past five years is as follows: 1998 &ndash;&euro;1.58 million; 1999 &ndash;&euro;6.47 million; 2000 &ndash;&euro;15.58 million; 2001 &ndash;&euro;13.91 million; and 2002 &ndash;&euro;23.02 million.</P>
      <P>In relation to the 2003 sports capital programme, I invited applications by advertisement in the national newspapers on 23 and 24 March. The deadline for receipt of completed applications is 25 April. I will decide soon on the level of project approvals to be authorised this year having regard both to the quality of the applications received under the 2003 programme and the pattern of grant drawdowns on foot of approvals made in earlier years.</P>

    <P>My Department understands that there was a useful meeting between the company's chief executive and an official from the South East <Col N="1131" /> Regional Tourism Authority on 7 April. During the meeting the chief executive outlined his concerns and received advice on his existing business model and its possible future development. Bord Fáilte has indicated that if the company considers it useful it will convene a further meeting with it. As my Department does not provide grant aid or support to individual enterprises, I do not consider that a separate meeting with the company would serve any useful purpose.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Arts, Sport and Tourism (Mr. O'Donoghue)</NameTxt>
      <P>Following examination of available records and consultation within the main functional divisions which constitute my Department, which was established in June 2002, I have formulated the following list of task forces, con<Col N="1132" /> sultant reviews, review groups, tribunals, inquiries and similar bodies set up since July 1997.</P>
      <P>On 10 February 1998 the Government decided that an independent inquiry into matters relating to child sexual abuse in swimming be carried out by Dr. Roderick Murphy, SC, Chairman of the Chartered Institute of Arbitrators. In arriving at its decision the Government took account of all issues arising, including the concerns of victims, the desire for privacy of a number of victims and their families and the wider policy issue of how best child sex abuse cases should be handled in such circumstances in future. The report was made public by the Oireachtas Joint Committee for Tourism, Sport and Recreation on 17 June 1998.</P>
      <P>The committee which drew up the code of ethics and good practice for children's sport in Ireland was re-convened in 1998 to review its contents in the light of the Murphy report. A new code was launched on 7 November 2000.</P>
      <P>The Irish Sports Council was asked in October 2000 to undertake a review of Ireland's participation in the Sydney Olympics. The purpose of the review, which was carried out by a steering group appointed by the council, was to learn from the experiences of Sydney 2000 and to develop a strategy, based on the analysis of the factual information gathered during the review, for the preparations towards Athens 2004. The review was published on 6 February 2001.</P>
      <P>An interdepartmental review of the sports capital programme, operated by my Department, was carried out in 1998 and published in December l998.</P>
      <P>An interdepartmental working group was set up in August 1999 to develop guidelines and advise on the other key issues for the operation of a public private partnership approach in relation to swimming pools. The group was chaired by the Department and comprised of members from the Department of the Environment and Local Government, the Office of Public Works and representatives from three local authorities. This report will assist my Department in formulating future policy on swimming pools in the context of an expenditure review of the local authority swimming pools programme which is being carried out this year.</P>
      <P>In November 2000 the former Department of Tourism, Sport and Recreation commissioned Capita Consultants to prepare a report on business analysis and reform of the financial management function as part of the planned implementation of the management information framework in the Department. Capita Consultants submitted its final report in August 2001.</P>
      <P>An overview of the cost of the proposed Stadium and Sports Campus Ireland project was undertaken by consultants, High Point Rendel. Its report was published in January 2002.</P>
      <P>In January 2002 an implementation group was requested to prepare a report on the establishment of the new tourism development authority. The group produced its report in April 2002.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1133" />On 19 December 2002 I announced the establishment of a high level steering group to oversee a major review of tourism policy. I have asked that the group report to me with initial views by the end of April, if at all possible. I expect to receive its final report during the summer.</P>
    <P>In 1998 it was decided to establish the film industry strategic review group. It was asked to take a long-term strategic view of Ireland's film and television industry. The group commenced its work in the summer of 1998 and reported in August 1999.</P>

A packet containing six potassium iodate tablets BP85mg was to be delivered to each household. This is sufficient to provide a single dose for each member of an average sized household.</P>
      <P>On 21 October 2002 my Department placed a public notice in national newspapers advising persons who did not receive a supply of tablets or who did not receive a sufficient number of tablets via the postal distribution, to contact their local health board and arrange for the collection of the additional tablets required. Contact details for each health board were included in the public notice.</P>

      <P>Under the Health Insurance Acts 1994 and 2001, health insurance is specifically regulated in the context of safeguarding and sustaining established common good principles of the system, community rating, open enrolment and lifetime cover. The legislation also includes provision for risk equalisation which is necessary to support community rating.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Health Insurance Authority was established in February 2001. It has key functions under the Acts in relation to proposed risk equalisation arrangements; registration of health insurers; monitoring of health insurance business and developments; and advising the Minister on his functions under the health insurance Acts, its own functions, and health insurance generally. <Col N="1136" /> The legislation also provides for the Minister to assign additional functions to the authority.</P>
    <P>The prudential regulation of health insurance undertakings is subject to the EU Council directives on the regulation of non-life insurance. Pursuant to the directives, VHI is exempt from the authorisation requirements therein for the purposes of conducting business here. BUPA Ireland, which operates here as a branch of the British United Provident Association, is regulated by the relevant UK authorities on the principle of home State regulation under the common EU passport in non life insurance.</P>
    <P>In light of the above, there are no plans for the regulation of the existing health insurers by the single financial services regulator.</P>

In general these are allocated at the time of the Estimates. In recent years I have been happy to secure extra funding to aid expansion of these projects. Their aim is to provide adequate and appropriate out of hours care for medical card and private patients. The services have proven to be efficient, effective and easily accessible. Independent evaluations of the services have shown that the level of patient and service provider satisfaction with the service is high.</P>

      <P>The national cancer strategy commenced in 1997. Since then there has been a cumulative additional investment of approximately &euro;400 million in the development of appropriate treatment and care services for people with cancer. This includes &euro;29 million which was provided this year to ensure that we continue to address increasing demands in cancer services in such areas as oncology-haematology services, oncology drug treatments and symptomatic breast disease services.</P>
      <P>Since the implementation of the strategy there has been a total additional cumulative investment of &euro;135.4 million in cancer services in the ERHA region. This figure includes additional funding allocated to cancer services in the ERHA in 2003 of &euro;9.78 million as follows: &euro;6.24 million in relation to oncology-haematology services, including oncology drug treatments; &euro;2.65 million to ensure adherence to quality standards as set out in the report of the sub-group of the national cancer forum on the development of services for symptomatic breast disease; &euro;0.75 million for designated national centres for cancer services; and &euro;0.14 million for radiotherapy services in St. Luke's Hospital.</P>
      <P>This funding has enabled the appointment of an additional 24 consultant posts, together with support staff in the ERHA region in key areas such as medical oncology, histopathology, radiation oncology, haematology and palliative care.</P>
      <P>In recognition of the need to further develop cancer services, the strategy identified the need for the preparation of a new one. The 2003 strategy is being developed by the national cancer forum in conjunction with my Department. It will build on the progress that has been made during the implementation of the first one. The strategy will also set out the key investment areas to be targeted for the development of cancer services in the years to come. It will also make recommendations in relation to the organisation and structure of cancer services nationally.</P>

      <P>Guidelines on the recruitment and selection of staff in children's residential centres were issued by my Department in November 1994. Under these guidelines employers must obtain Garda clearance on all staff being considered for appointment to a children's residential centre. In September 1995 these were extended to the recruitment of staff to any area of the health services where they would have substantial access to children and vulnerable individuals including, where appropriate, external agencies funded by the health boards to provide services in respect of children and vulnerable adults. The guidelines also stress the importance of employers validating information supplied by candidates and verifying references pro-actively.</P>
      <P>Children First: National Guidelines for the Protection and Welfare of Children recognises the need to support community and voluntary groups develop best practice in their dealings with children. A document entitled Our Duty to Care was published in April 2002. It is based on Children First and on Northern Ireland's Our Duty To Care document and is available to all groups. Essentially it promotes good practice and procedures for organisations dealing with children and consists of a booklet and factsheets covering areas such as safe recruitment practice, developing safe management practices and policies and raising awareness of child abuse among volunteers and staff. It also provides advice on how to report concerns to the health boards. This is an extremely useful tool for voluntary organisations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Our Duty to Care gives guidance and suggested procedures for developing safe recruitment practices. The following key processes should be included in an organisation's recruitment procedures: clear definition of role of employees or <Col N="1139" /> volunteers; an application form with a clear job description and information about the organisation should be supplied; all applicants should be required to sign a declaration stating that there is no reason they would be unsuitable to work with young people and declaring past criminal convictions or cases pending against them. The organisation must have a clear policy regarding the type of factors that would exclude applicants; all applicants should be interviewed by a panel comprising of at least two representatives of the organisations; an applicant should be expected to supply the names of two referees, not family members, who will testify to their character and their suitability for the role of employee-volunteer. An acceptable reference will indicate that the person is known to the referee and is considered suitable by them to work with young people. All references should be received in writing and later confirmed by telephone, letter or personal visit; and the organisation should ensure that the identity of the applicant is confirmed against some documentation which gives his or her full name, address together with a signature or photograph.</P>
    <P>My colleague the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy McDowell, has informed me that it was envisaged that when the central vetting unit became operational and all its backlogs were cleared that a phased extension of the clearance arrangements to other groups, such as voluntary and community groups, would take place. To this end the Garda Commissioner has established a working group to examine the issue. It will take account of all aspects of the vetting of persons coming in contact with children and vulnerable persons. At present its work is ongoing.</P>

      <P>Arising from the health strategy, Quality and <Col N="1140" /> Fairness &ndash; A Health System For You, one of the key actions for dealing with public hospital waiting lists was the establishment of the national treatment purchase fund &ndash; (NTPF). The NTPF was set up in April 2002 and referred its first patients for treatment at the end of June. A total of 1,920 patients received treatment under the NTPF initiative in 2002. Since the NTPF commenced arranging treatments approximately 3,400 patients, who have been waiting longest, have received treatment.</P>
      <P>The provisional out-turn for the NTPF in 2002, as published in the Revised Estimates Volume, was &euro;5.012 million. Funding of some &euro;31 million has been provided for the NTPF in 2003 for what will be the first full year of operation of the fund.</P>

      <P>The administration of the registration system is statutorily a matter for An tÁrd-Chlaraitheoir, Registrar-General; of Births, Deaths and Marriages and for registrars who operate under his general direction.</P>
      <P>I have had inquiries made with An tÁrd-Chlaraitheoir and he has informed me that the aim of the General Register Office is to treat each of its customers in an equitable and impartial manner.</P>
      <P>The Social Welfare (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2002 provides for the creation of an electronic database of historical paper based records, and electronic searching of records. The search process under the new system is based on the inclusion of a minimum amount of information. This information must include either the surname of the child, or the name of a parent. With regard to adopted people who may not possess the minimum information required to access the details of their birth record, the Government has recently approved wide ranging consultation on all aspects of legislation in relation to adoption.</P>
      <P>A working document, which will set out a number of issues for consideration, will be published as soon as possible. Written submissions will be invited. These will be followed by an oral consultation. An independent legal expert, after examining all the various submissions, will develop the working document.</P>
      <P>This consultation process is to be short and highly focused. The intention is that it will be finalised by July. It is expected to result in workable proposals to bring to Government, which will lead to a new, modern and appropriate legislative framework for adoption, including provisions relating to access to birth records by people who were adopted.</P>

      <P>My Department and the Department of Social and Family Affairs are engaged in a major project to modernise the civil registration service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The cost of the introduction of new information systems, to facilitate the electronic registration of vital events including births, stillbirths, deaths, marriages and adoptions and the electronic production of certificates to date is &euro;9.15 million and the estimated additional investment cost to complete this work is &euro;2 million. In addition the archival records held by the General Register Office and the associated indexes are being converted to an electronic format in a separate project in Roscommon. The cost of this <Col N="1142" /> work to date is &euro;8.76 million and the anticipated additional cost to complete the capture of the records is estimated as &euro;2.3 million.</P>
    <P>The legal changes necessary to enable the direct electronic registration of births and deaths and the holding of birth, death and marriage records in an electronic format were included in the Social Welfare (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2002. Further provisions, required to facilitate the wider modernisation of the registration service, are being included in a new Civil Registration Bill, the drafting of which is currently being finalised.</P>
    <P>The implementation of a modern civil registration service is at the heart of providing better public services to citizens through the Government's modernisation programme. It is a key building block underpinning the integration of public service delivery and e-Government objectives of providing more convenient access to services. The new service will facilitate the sharing of information between Government agencies. Future registration of vital events will include a personal public service number, PPS No., which will be used as a unique customer reference number by public service providers, thereby facilitating opportunities for the streamlining the provision of services from other Departments and public service organisations, as appropriate.</P>
    <P>The new system has been successfully piloted during December 2002 to January 2003 and it is planned that the roll-out of the system to offices throughout the country will begin in June 2003 and should be completed by the end of the year.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children (Mr. T. O'Malley)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware of the concerns expressed regarding services to persons with an intellectual disability and those with autism.</P>
      <P>Additional funding of &euro;13.3 million has been allocated to services for persons with an intellectual disability or autism in 2003 to meet the full year cost of the 2002 developments and to further enhance the health related support services to children with an intellectual disability or autism. This funding is in addition to the very significant revenue investment, amounting to &euro;188 million, which has been made in these services since 1997 and which is built into the ongoing budget base.</P>
      <P>The additional funding provided by this and the previous Government between 2000 and 2002 was used to put in place, in addition to a range of other services, over 900 new residential, 380 new respite and around 2,000 new day places for people with an intellectual disability and those with autism.</P>
      <P>Despite this very significant investment, demographic factors are contributing to growing waiting lists for residential services in particular even though the number of people in receipt of services, including full time residential services, continues to increase. The increased birth rate in the 1960s and 1970s has resulted in large numbers of adults in their late 20s and early 30s requiring full-time residential services. In addition, people with an intellectual disability are living longer than previously, adding to the need for services compared to previous generations. This has also been the international experience in service provision to this population.</P>
      <P>The overall economic position in 2003 has had implications for all aspects of public investment, and this is reflected in the Estimates and budget adopted by the Government for 2003. Within this overall framework, however, some two-thirds of the additional funding available for non-capital investment in services has been allocated to the health services.</P>
      <P>This funding is being applied largely to maintaining existing levels of service across all service programmes including services for people with an intellectual disability or autism. While it is regrettable that the level of investment in these services achieved in recent years could not be maintained in 2003, my Department will work closely with the health boards and other service providers in relation to service provision this year.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>BreastCheck, the national breast screening programme commenced in March 2000 with phase one of the programme covering the Eastern Regional Health Authority, Midland Health Board and North-Eastern Health Board areas. Screening is being offered free of charge to all women in those areas in the target age group 50 to 64 years of age. The target population consists of approximately 140,000 women and it represents about 50% of the national target population. By end December 2002, 110,636 women had been called for screening and 83,000 women had been screened. This represents an uptake of 75%.</P>
      <P>In February, I announced the extension of BreastCheck to a further three counties. Approximately, 19,000 women in the 50 to 64 age bracket in Counties Wexford, Kilkenny and Carlow will be invited for screening. Last month, I announced further plans for the national extension of BreastCheck. The BreastCheck clinical unit in the Western area will be at University College Hospital Galway, with two associated mobile units. The area of coverage is counties Galway, Sligo, Roscommon, Donegal, Mayo, Leitrim, Clare and Tipperary North. The BreastCheck clinical unit in the southern area will be located at South Infirmary-Victoria Hospital, with three associated mobile units. Counties covered include Cork, Kerry, Limerick, Waterford and Tipperary South.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under the extension, approximately 130,000 women in the target population 50 to 64 years of age will be eligible for screening. The programme <Col N="1148" /> expects to diagnose approximately 400 cancers per annum among this population.</P>
    <P>Following such extension and when the programme is sufficiently developed and it is assured that a quality service can be delivered at national level, consideration will be given to including older women and continuing the screening of women already in the programme who have reached 65 years of age.</P>
    <P>Any woman irrespective of her age or residence who has immediate concerns or symptoms should contact her GP who, where appropriate, will refer her to the symptomatic services in her area.</P>

    <P>The annual report is compiled from the regional datasets provided by the Eastern Regional Health Authority and the health boards.

    <P>In April 2000, information from the national intellectual disability database indicated that in the period 2000 to 2004, 1,711 new residential places were required to meet the identified needs for these services.</P>
    <P>While the impact of the 2000 development programme is reflected in the 2001 data, there are still a significant number of persons seeking residential services in particular.

A review of the waiting lists between 1997 and 1999, conducted by the Health Research Board and published in the 1999 annual report from the national intellectual disability database, showed that while 269 people from the original waiting list of 1,439 received full time residential services in the period, the waiting list had grown by an additional 238 places, i.e. 507 had joined the waiting list in the period. This has also been the international experience in service provision to this population.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children (Mr. T. O'Malley)</NameTxt>
      <P>Additional funding of &euro;13.3 million has been allocated to services for persons with an intellectual disability or autism in 2003 to meet the full year cost of the 2002 developments and to further enhance the health related support services to children with an intellectual disability or autism. This funding is in addition to the very significant revenue <Col N="1153" /> investment, amounting to &euro;188 million, which has been made in these services since 1997 and which is built into the ongoing budget base.</P>
      <P>The additional funding provided by this and the previous Government between 2000 and 2002 was used to put in place, in addition to a range of other services, more than 900 new residential, 380 new respite and around 2,000 new day places for people with an intellectual disability and those with autism.</P>
      <P>Despite this very significant investment, demographic factors are contributing to growing waiting lists for residential services in particular even though the number of people in receipt of services, including full time residential services, continues to increase. The increased birth rate in the 1960s and 1970s has resulted in large numbers of adults in their late 20s and early 30s requiring full-time residential services. In addition, people with an intellectual disability are living longer than previously, adding to the need for services compared to previous generations. This has also been the international experience in service provision to this population.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The overall economic position in 2003 has had implications for all aspects of public investment, and this is reflected in the estimates and budget <Col N="1154" /> adopted by the Government for 2003. Within this overall framework, however, some two-thirds of the additional funding available for non-capital investment in services has been allocated to the health services.</P>
    <P>This funding is being applied largely to maintaining existing levels of service across all service programmes including services for people with an intellectual disability. While it is regrettable that the level of investment in these services achieved in recent years could not be maintained in 2003, my Department will work closely with the health boards and other service providers in relation to service provision this year.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 280 and 299 together.</P>
      <P>Significant progress has been made in addressing the human resource requirements of the health service in the area of psychology. In the year to end-2001 there has been an increase of more than 100% &ndash;  +30 posts to approximately 60 &ndash; in the number of trainee clinical psychologists employed. A further 12 trainee clinical psychology posts were created earlier this year through the recommencement of the doctorate in clinical psychology at TCD. The Deputy may also wish to note the significant increase, in excess of 30% &ndash;  +91 to 380 &ndash; over the past two years in the numbers of fully qualified psychologists working in the health service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The report of the joint review group on psychological services in the health services was published in March 2002.

    <P>I understand that, following a request received from my Department, the director of the health boards executive has undertaken to work with the directors of human resources in the health boards to develop an approach to facilitate the implementation of the recommendations of the joint review group. This will be undertaken in light of service imperatives, funding priorities and relevant developments such as the recommendations on investment in education and training included in the action plan for people management published in November 2002.</P>

      <P>The development of services for people with Alzheimer's disease is based on the action plan for dementia published by the National Council on Ageing and Older People, in 1999. Considerable progress has been made in service development since the publication of the report. However, there is need to continue with the provision of respite services in order to provide relief to carers, the development of day hospitals and day-care facilities, the provision of support to carers, including training programmes, and the development of the old age psychiatry programme to its full potential. It will be my policy to prioritise these issues as resources permit.</P>
      <P>As I stated in my reply to a somewhat similar question from the Deputy, on 25 March last, Alzheimer's disease does not, sadly, confine itself to older people. Information available to me suggests that service providers do not deliberately discriminate against persons under 65 years of age.</P>

      <P>In addition to the existing services provided in relation to infectious diseases, an infectious disease screening service is provided for asylum see<Col N="1156" /> kers newly arrived in this country. Infectious disease screening is a voluntary and confidential service offered free of charge to asylum seekers shortly after their arrival here. The purpose of screening is to detect and treat certain infectious diseases in the interests of the asylum seekers and their families, as well as the community in general.</P>
      <P>Initial screening usually takes place at reception centres in Dublin where asylum seekers may reside for five days or more and continues when they are relocated to other health board regions. Those who do not receive screening in Dublin are offered this service following dispersal. Screening is provided for the following: TB, Hepatitis B, Polio virus and Varicella Zoster virus. HIV testing is also offered.</P>
      <P>A group representative of the directors of public health and the Department of Health and Children reviews the approach adopted to communicable disease screening for asylum seekers on an ongoing basis. The current guidelines were issued in September 2001.</P>
      <P>There are no plans at present to extend this screening service to any other group.</P>
      <P>I have not received any report recently specifically dealing with the testing for and treatment of infectious diseases among populations newly arriving in Ireland; however, from time to time my Department receives submissions from health boards in relation to asylum seeker issues in general.</P>

    <P>The working group found that the internationally acknowledged best practice for the provision of child and adolescent psychiatric services is through the multi-disciplinary team. In 2002, additional revenue funding of &euro;6.061 million was allocated to provide for the appointment of additional consultants, for the enhancement of existing consultant-led multi-disciplinary teams and towards the establishment of further teams. A further &euro;1.64 million was allocated in 2003.</P>
    <P>The health strategy, Quality and Fairness &ndash; A Health System For You, includes a commitment to the implementation of the recommendations of the working group's report.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children (Mr. T. O'Malley)</NameTxt>
      <P>Additional funding of &euro;13.3 million has been allocated to services <Col N="1158" /> for persons with an intellectual disability or autism in 2003 to meet the full year cost of the 2002 developments and to further enhance the health-related support services to children with an intellectual disability or autism. This funding is in addition to the very significant revenue investment, amounting to &euro;188 million, which has been made in these services since 1997 and which is built into the ongoing budget base.</P>
      <P>The additional funding provided by this and the previous Government between 2000 and 2002 was used to put in place, in addition to a range of other services, more than 900 new residential, 380 new respite and around 2,000 new day places for people with an intellectual disability and those with autism. Despite this very significant investment, demographic factors are contributing to growing waiting lists for residential services in particular even though the number of people in receipt of services, including full time residential services, continues to increase. The increased birth rate in the 1960s and 1970s has resulted in large numbers of adults in their late 20s and early 30s requiring full-time residential services. In addition, people with an intellectual disability are living longer than previously, adding to the need for services compared to previous generations. This has also been the international experience in service provision to this population.</P>
      <P>The overall economic position in 2003 has had implications for all aspects of public investment, and this is reflected in the estimates and budget adopted by the Government for 2003. Within this overall framework, however, some two-thirds of the additional funding available for non-capital investment in services has been allocated to the health services. This funding is being applied largely to maintaining existing levels of service across all service programmes including services for people with an intellectual disability. While it is regrettable that the level of investment in these services achieved in recent years could not be maintained in 2003, my Department will work closely with the health boards and other service providers in relation to service provision this year.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will appreciate that I cannot give specific commitments for 2004 and onwards in relation to any element of the health services as these issues form part of the estimates and budget discussions between my Department and the Department of Finance.</P>

      <P>Responsibility for the recruitment of radiogra<Col N="1159" /> phers and for monitoring the level of vacancies lies with the individual employing health agency. The Deputy may wish to note the increase of 57 in wholetime equivalent terms to 814 in the number of radiographers employed in the health service in the two year period to end-2001. Information in respect of end-2002 is currently being compiled by my Department and will be available shortly. In 2002 there were seven graduates from the B.Sc. in Therapeutic Radiography at TCD and seventeen graduates from the B.Sc. in Radiography at UCD. With regard to the expansion of radiography places, the plan is to increase the intake of radiography students from 30 per annum (i.e. 10 in TCD and 20 in UCD) to 65 by taking in an extra 15 in TCD and an extra 20 in UCD. The additional 15 commenced in TCD in October, 2001 and they will graduate in the summer of 2005. The first five of the extra 20 places at UCD commenced in October, 2002 and planning is continuing to admit the full complement in September 2003. My Department does not routinely collect data on vacancy levels in individual grades, including radiographers. Discussions are ongoing with the chief executive officers of the health boards in relation to the measures required to ensure the most effective and timely monitoring of employment trends. In addition, continued investment in information technology together with the development of integrated workforce planning for the health service on a national basis &ndash; a key action specified in the health strategy &ndash; is expected to make a major contribution in the future to the provision of quality employment-related information and the development of a human resource inventory for the health service.</P>

The investment package was targeted at a number of areas, including recruitment of additional accident and emergency consultants and consultant anaesthetists contracting of places in private nursing homes for patients who had completed the acute phase of treatment. My Department has been advised by the Eastern Regional Health <Col N="1160" /> Authority (ERHA) and by the health boards that, to date, an additional 19 accident and emergency consultants and 18 consultant anaesthetists have been appointed under this initiative. A number of additional consultant appointments are being progressed by the health boards and ERHA.</P>
      <P>In addition, more than 700 additional private nursing home places were purchased by the Eastern Regional Health Authority and the health boards under this initiative for patients whose acute phase of treatment had been completed, but who required additional care in an alternative setting.</P>

      <P>The information which the Deputy is seeking is not readily available in my Department. However, the Health Service Employers Agency (HSEA) undertakes a quarterly survey of nursing resources. The most recent survey was published in March 2003 and provides national data and analysis on the nursing workforce on 31 December, 2002. A copy of this survey will be forwarded directly to the Deputy.</P>
      <P>The main findings of the survey are as follows. There were 1,642 extra nurses employed in the health service in the year ending 31 December 2002 &ndash; a 4.54% increase in the nursing workforce; 1,660 nurses were recruited from abroad in the year ending 31 December 2002; in addition, 346 nurses work every day in the hospitals as agency nurses; health boards have increased their nurse staffing by 787 in the year, voluntary hospitals have recruited 803 additional nurses and the learning disability sector has boosted its staffing by 52 in the year; the vacancy rate now stands at 2.8%.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While all sectors reported that recruitment was well ahead of resignations-retirement, employers reported that 1,021 vacancies existed at 31 December 2002. However, the combination of utilising agency nurses and overtime working provides the equivalent of around 1,141 full-time nurses to the service to compensate for shortages <Col N="1162" /> while employers continue the recruitment process to fill vacancies.</P>

      <P>As the Deputy is aware, the provision of orthodontic treatment to eligible persons is the responsibility of the health boards-authority in the first instance. I have taken a number of measures to improve orthodontic services on a national basis.</P>
      <P>The grade of specialist in orthodontics has been created in the health board orthodontic service. This year, my Department and the health boards are funding 13 dentists from various health boards for specialist in orthodontics qualifications at training programmes in Ireland and at two separate universities in the United Kingdom. These 13 trainees for the public orthodontic service are additional to the six dentists who commenced their training last year and one dentist whose specialist training is nearing completion. Thus there is an aggregate of 20 public service dentists currently in training for specialist in orthodontics qualifications. These measures will complement the other structural changes being introduced into the orthodontic service, including the creation of an auxiliary grade of orthodontic therapist to work in the orthodontic area.</P>
      <P>Orthodontic initiative funding of &euro;4.698 million was provided to the health boards-authority in 2001 and this has enabled health boards to recruit additional staff, engage the services of private specialist orthodontic practitioners to treat patients and build additional orthodontic facilities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1163" />In June 2002, my Department provided additional funding of &euro;5 million from the treatment purchase fund to health boards specifically for the purchase of orthodontic treatment. This funding is enabling boards to provide both additional sessions for existing staff and purchase <Col N="1164" /> treatment from private specialist orthodontic practitioners.</P>
    <P>The chief executive officers of the health boards have informed me of the following information on their orthodontic waiting lists as at the end of the December 2002 quarter, the latest date for which figures are available:</P>

    <P>Patients in Category A require immediate treatment and include those with congenital abnormalities of the jaws such as cleft lip and palate, and patients with major skeletal discrepancies between the sizes of the jaws. Patients in Category B have less severe problems than Category A patients and are placed on the orthodontic treatment waiting list.</P>
    <P>Finally, the chief executive officers of the health boards/authority have informed me that at the end of the December 2002 quarter, there were 20,151 patients receiving orthodontic treatment in the public orthodontic service. This is an increase of approximately 2,856 patients in orthodontic treatment when compared with the number of patients receiving treatment in December 2001. I expect that the number of patients receiving orthodontic treatment in the public orthodontic service will continue to increase as the measures that I have taken impact further on the service.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 300 and 301 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1165" />Responsibility for the provision of services to persons with an intellectual disability and those with autism in the County Dublin area is a matter for the Eastern Regional Health Authority. My Department has therefore asked the regional chief executive of the authority to investigate the matters raised by the Deputy and reply to him directly.</P>

      <askee>Minister for Health and Children</askee>
      <Quest>if his attention has been drawn to the continuing concerns of parents and families of children and adults with intellectual disabilities, and in particular their concerns that the development programme be extended for another two years; if he will take steps to ensure that the additional moneys are provided to ensure that the necessary respite care and training and day places for these persons will be provided; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>
      <QRef>[10086/03]</QRef>
    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="TimOMalleyPD" hpid="Mr. T. O'Malley Mr. T. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children (Mr. T. O'Malley)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware of the concerns expressed in relation to services to persons with an intellectual disability and those with autism.</P>
      <P>In 2003 additional funding of &euro;13.3 million has been allocated to services for persons with an intellectual disability or autism to meet the full year cost of the 2002 developments and to further enhance the health related support services to children with an intellectual disability or autism. This funding is in addition to the very significant revenue investment, amounting to &euro;188 million, which has been made in these services since 1997 and which is built into the ongoing budget base.</P>
      <P>The additional funding provided by this and the previous Government between 2000 and 2002 was used to put in place, in addition to a range of other services, over 900 new residential, 380 new respite and around 2,000 new day places for people with an intellectual disability and those with autism.</P>
      <P>Despite this very significant investment, demographic factors are contributing to growing waiting lists for residential services in particular even though the number of people in receipt of services, including full time residential services, continues to increase. The increased birth rate in the 1960s and 1970s has resulted in large numbers of adults in their late 20s and early 30s requiring full-time residential services. In addition, people with an intellectual disability are living longer than previously, adding to the need for services compared to previous generations. This has also been the international experience in service provision to this population.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The overall economic position in 2003 has had implications for all aspects of public investment, and this is reflected in the Estimates and budget adopted by the Government for 2003. Within this overall framework, however, some two-thirds of the additional funding available for non-capital <Col N="1166" /> investment in services has been allocated to the health services.</P>
    <P>This funding is being applied largely to maintaining existing levels of service across all service programmes including services for people with an intellectual disability. While it is regrettable that the level of investment in these services achieved in recent years could not be maintained in 2003, my Department will work closely with the health boards and other service providers in service provision this year.</P>
    <P>The Deputy will appreciate that I cannot give specific commitments for 2004 and onwards in relation to any element of the health services as these issues form part of the Estimates and Budget discussions between my Department and the Department of Finance.</P>

      <P>The lighting requirements for motor vehicles are set out in the Road Traffic (Lighting of Vehicles) Regulations 1963 to 1996. These regulations provide, <i>inter alia,</i> that headlamps operating on dipped beam shall be incapable of dazzling a person more than 25 feet away from the headlamp and in a specified position, which approximates to that of the driver of an oncoming vehicle. The regulations also provide that the beams of light from headlamps, when dipped, shall be capable of illuminating the road for 100 feet in front of the vehicle at night time in clear weather.</P>
      <P>Headlamp alignment is one of the items examined as part of the NCT. As a result of the phased implementation of the NCT, test failure for light alignment reasons does not at present constitute a reason for refusal of a test certificate. Nevertheless, the owner of a vehicle with misaligned lights is obliged to remedy the defect.</P>
      <P>It is the intention that the remaining &ldquo;fail advisory&rdquo; test items, including headlight alignment, will become &ldquo;fail refusal&rdquo; reasons from 1 June 2003. The values for headlight alignment specified in the Department's national car test, NCT, manual were determined by reference to the statutory requirements.</P>

      <P>A consultation process involving my Department, the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform and the Garda Síochána in relation to the establishment of a dedicated traffic corps is being progressed. The furtherance of this proposal raises a range of challenging issues. Of particular importance will be the questions relating to the governance of the corps. Central to that issue is the question of the relationship that the corps will have with the Garda and in particular whether it will be under the overall control of the Garda Commissioner. The establishment of a dedicated traffic corps will require the introduction of legislation, in particular to establish powers and functions of the corps and its accountability. Establishment of the corps will be progressed in tandem with the preparation of the necessary legislation.</P>

In such areas, taxis may stand for hire at appointed stands, taxi ranks operate in pursuance of a contract of hiring made at an appointed stand with the driver of the vehicle, and may ply for immediate hire.</P>
      <P>Hackneys are prohibited from providing services based on such hires. There are no proposals to alter this situation.</P>
      <P>In the event of there being a perceived need for an on-street public hire service in any area, it is a matter for the local authority concerned to consider the need for the declaration of a taximeter area for the area in question.</P>

      <P>In the context of taxi liberalisation it was recognised that there is a need to promote and incentivise the provision of wheelchair accessible taxis and, accordingly, the fee for the grant of a new wheelchair accessible taxi licence is fixed at &euro;125, with a &euro;6,300 fee for ordinary taxi licences.</P>
      <P>The programme for Government also establishes a number of commitments in relation to taxi services including a specific commitment to continue the process of making taxis wheelchair accessible. Acting on another of the commitments in that programme, on 19 November 2002 the Government approved the establishment of the office of the national taxi regulator and a taxi advisory commission, initially on a non-statutory basis, pending the development of legislative proposals.</P>
      <P>The preparation of the necessary legislation is proceeding as a matter of urgency in my Department with a view to the formal establishment of a commission for taxi regulation and a taxi advisory council. The role envisaged for the commission includes the setting of national standards of entry into the industry, standards for taxi, hackney and limousine vehicles including the implementation of the proposed wheelchair accessible taxi policy as well as the setting of standards for customer service and for meeting the needs of people with disabilities.</P>
      <P>As an interim measure, I have recently appointed Mr. Jimmy Farrelly, former Secretary General of the Department of the Environment and Local Government, as an interim chairman of the commission for taxi regulation pending the recruitment of a statutory chairman.

      <P>The Dublin Transportation Office strategy document A Platform for Change recommends that, based on projected population and employment levels, a rail line to Navan be constructed from the Maynooth line near Clonsilla via Dunboyne in the period post 2010.</P>
      <P>The recently published strategic rail review provides a strategic policy framework for the future development of the rail passenger and rail freight sectors in Ireland, based on future land use development as proposed in the national spatial strategy. The report includes an assessment of many rail proposals which took account of the submissions received as part of a public consultation process. A rail link from Navan to Kingscourt is not among the many proposals assessed by the consultants. I understand also from Iarnród Éireann that the development of such a line is not among the company's current priorities.</P>

      <P>The Supreme Court gave its judgment in the cases of L and O on 23 January 2003 and found that the Minister was entitled to deport the persons concerned who are the parents of Irish born children. At that time there were more than 11,000 applications on hand in respect of which no decision has been made. The case to which the Deputy refers is one of those cases.</P>
      <P>No further processing is taking place on these cases pending a determination by Government on the general policy to be adopted. I have given the Government a preliminary assessment of the implications of the judgment and, in the near future, I intend to bring to Government a more comprehensive assessment and proposals for action on foot of it.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 322, 350, 363, 366, 367 and 373 together.</P>
      <P>I am informed by the Garda authorities that the activities of known drug dealers in the Dublin area are monitored continuously by specialised district drugs units with the assistance of the Garda national drugs unit. Arrests are made, as appropriate, resulting in successful prosecutions.</P>
      <P>In addition, significant seizures of major drugs continue to be made. In the first few months of 2003, the Garda Síochána have seized more than &euro;23 million worth of cannabis, more than &euro;1.5 million worth of cocaine and more than &euro;15 million worth of ecstasy. These seizures are in line with a key objective of the national drugs strategy which is to reduce significantly the volume of illicit drugs available.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards violent and drug-related crime, operation encounter addresses the issue of street violence. Changes in policing practice, including operation encounter, are reviewed regularly to ensure that the most effective outcome is obtained from the deployment of Garda resources. Various drugs initiatives, involving local communities as appropriate, are also in <Col N="1174" /> place from location to location to target drug use and drug related crimes.</P>
    <P>I have also taken a number of steps to counteract the negative effects of the drink culture which contribute to street violence. The Criminal Justice (Public Order) Bill is currently going though the Oireachtas. I will also bring proposals to Government in the near future to address recommendations in the final report of the Liquor Licensing Commission which have implications for tackling crime and public order offences, including measures to address under age drinking.</P>

      <Col N="1176" />I have been informed by the Garda authorities that Garda district boundaries differ from the boundaries of electoral districts and wards used by the Central Statistics Office to compile population statistics for each census. A Garda district can cover several electoral boundaries and an electoral boundary can cover more than one Garda district. The Garda Síochána has been working with the CSO on the calculation of population at Garda district level, but not at Garda sub-district or station level. Consequently, the information sought by the Deputy is not available in the detail sought.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. McDowell Mr. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. McDowell)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to answer Questions Nos. 343, 351, 364 and 376 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1181" />I am informed by the Garda authorities that no increase has been noted in the number of unauthorised takings of mechanically propelled vehicles in the Crumlin and Drimnagh areas of Dublin and that the indications are that such crimes have decreased in the Kevin Street, Kilmainham and Ballyfermot areas recently. I am also informed that in the Kevin Street-Kilmainham district, talks are given by the Garda, including the juvenile liaison officer and community policing gardaí, to juveniles in local schools to educate them on the dangers associated with the unauthorised taking and driving of cars. Gardaí also encourage young people to participate in the motor appreciation courses which take place in the area.</P>
    <P>I am assured that the Garda has a number of strategies in place to combat the problem of stolen cars, including, where necessary, the use of targeted operations put in place by local Garda management in areas that have been identified as potential hotspots for joyriding. Specialist patrols and vehicles are concentrated in these areas to deal with public order and joyriding incidents. The Garda is constantly liaising with community groups and a number of projects are in operation which have proved valuable in dealing with offenders. In addition, the Garda and local authorities are working together in relation to estate management and reducing the opportunities for joyriding.

    <P>In relation to abandoned cars, the Waste Management Act 1996 specifically prohibits the abandonment of vehicles on any land and empowers local authorities to deal appropriately with the abandoned vehicles.

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 368 to 371, inclusive, together.</P>
      <P>I am informed by the Garda authorities that the number of physical assaults recorded in the Ballyfermot and Drimnagh areas during the first three months of this year are in fact lower than in the corresponding period in 2002. The figures for the south-west inner city area of Dublin do not indicate any significant increase, while in Crumlin a slight increase was recorded.</P>
      <P>I am also informed that in all four areas, the local gardaí are targeting areas where there is a potential for anti-social behaviour or assault such as late night venues, fast food outlets and areas subject to complaints as a result of groups of teenagers gathering.</P>
      <P>Such areas are constantly monitored by the Garda in the community policing unit who also take action, where necessary, under the Public Order Act 1994, by moving troublemakers on. Where offences occur, arrests are made subject to sufficient evidence for a court prosecution. The Garda at Ballyfermot has recently set up a public order unit to patrol the sub-district. A community garda assigned to the Drimnagh area is constantly monitoring the activities of young people in the area, in close association with local residents.</P>
      <P>I am also informed that there is a high detection rate for reported assaults and that each case is investigated and criminal proceedings instituted where there is sufficient evidence available.</P>

This involved the transfer of four Garda personnel of all ranks from Ballyfermot to Clondalkin Garda station.

      <P>The information as requested by the Deputy in relation to waiting times for legal services at the Kildare Centre, Newbridge, County Kildare, is outlined below.</P>
      <P>As at 28 February 2003, the length of time the person longest on the waiting list has waited for legal services at the Newbridge law centre, is 3.75 months.</P>
      <P>I can inform the Deputy that the Legal Aid Board does not routinely collect information relating to an average waiting time for people seeking its services. However, it does record the length of time the person longest on the waiting list has waited, hence the information supplied to the Deputy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should also mention to the Deputy that the board operates a procedure whereby priority is accorded for certain categories of cases over other cases, for example, domestic violence, child care and cases where there are time limits. These <Col N="1189" /> cases are dealt with immediately. In 2002, the total number of priority appointments offered by the law centres was approximately 1650, or almost 22% of the total number of appointments offered to new clients during the year.</P>
    <P>I can also inform the Deputy that the board continuously monitors the operation of its law centre network and where waiting times, for whatever reasons, become excessive, the position is examined by the board with a view to taking remedial action.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. McDowell)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Question Nos. 389, 395 and 405 together.</P>
      <P>As the Deputies are aware, in 1998 my predecessor requested the Garda Commissioner to undertake a comprehensive review of Garda clearance arrangements in the child care area generally.</P>
      <P>Arising from this review it was decided that a central vetting unit would be set up to deal with the, then known, demand for clearances. In July 2001 sanction was received for the recruitment of additional staff for the new unit to be based in Garda headquarters and following recruitment and training of the new staff, the unit commenced operations on 2 January 2002.</P>
      <P>The unit currently processes clearance requests in respect of prospective employees entering full time employment in the health care area who have substantial unsupervised access to children or vulnerable persons. In its first year of operation, the unit dealt with about 70,000 vetting and data protection requests. The time taken to process vetting requests for Irish workers was reduced to about a three week period.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When the central vetting unit became fully operational and backlogs were cleared, it was envisaged that a phased extension of the clearance arrangements to other groups would take place. To this end a working group has been established by the Garda Commissioner to examine the issue, taking account of all aspects of the vetting of persons coming in contact with children and vulnerable persons &ndash; be they full-time, part-time, voluntary or community workers, or students on placements. To assist the group in its <Col N="1191" /> deliberations, the Department of Education and Science and the Department of Health and Children have been requested to provide information on the potential number of additional persons who may need to be cleared or vetted.</P>
    <P>The work of the working group is ongoing at present and I will provide the Deputies with further information when I have had an opportunity to consider the commissioner's report in the matter.</P>

      <P>The person concerned arrived in the State on 27 April 1998 and claimed asylum. His claim for refugee status was refused by the Office of the Refugee Applications Commissioner on 11 October 1998 and he was notified of this decision on 3 December 1998. This letter was re-issued on 2 July 1999. The applicant appealed this decision on 13 July 1999. The Refugee Appeals Tribunal affirmed the decision of the Office of the Refugee Applications Commissioner and he was notified of this decision on 18 October 2000.</P>
      <P>In accordance with section 3 of the Immigration Act 1999, the person concerned was informed on the 18 October 2000 that the Minister proposed to make a deportation order in his case. In accordance with the Act, he was given the options of making representations within 15 working days setting out the reasons why he should be allowed to remain temporarily in the State; leaving the State before the order was made, or consenting to the making of a deportation order. Representations were received as to why the person should be allowed remain in the State.</P>
      <P>His case was then examined under section 3 of the Immigration Act 1999 and section 5 of the Refugee Act 1996 &ndash; Prohibition of Refoulement.

He was removed from the State on 23 August 2002.</P>
      <P>Last January representations were received from his wife's legal representative requesting that the deportation order be revoked as he had married an Irish national in Kosovo following his deportation. I reconsidered the case file and I affirmed the deportation order on 11 March.</P>

      <P>A computerised FOTS system for the Garda Síochána would facilitate the introduction of the penalty points system. A notice <Col N="1194" /> advertising the competition for the development of such a system was published in the Official Journal for the European Communities on 12 May 2001.</P>
      <P>The request for tender specified that the contract be awarded from the qualifying tenders on the basis of the most economically advantageous tender, applying the following award criteria in order of importance: quality and merit of the proposed solution and how well it meets the requirements as set out in the RFT; the proven experience and track record of the respondent, including the quality and relevance of reference sites, in undertaking comparable assignments involving: relevant technologies, police systems and change management; the level and degree of relevant experience and balance of skills of the personnel proposed to undertake the work; change management strategy; ability to meet project schedule; cost; project plan including reporting structures and methods; and development methodology. Six companies submitted tenders by the closing date of 29 June 2001.</P>
      <P>The tenders were evaluated by an evaluation team of ten Garda personnel drawn from the information technology division, the change management division, the Garda national traffic bureau and Garda operational areas. The outcome of the evaluation process was endorsed by a project board made up of representatives from the Garda Síochána, and Departments of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Finance and the Environment and Local Government. The approval of the Government contracts committee was also obtained before the award of contract. The total contract price is &euro;7.4 million plus VAT.</P>
      <P>I expect that implementation of the system will commence in the second quarter of 2004 with the progressive extension of the system to cater for all penalty point offences taking place as quickly as possible thereafter.</P>

      <P>I have been informed by the Garda authorities that the person referred to by the Deputy wrote to the Garda Síochána about this matter. He was offered an opportunity to view his personal file but he did not avail of it. In August 2002 the person was forwarded a copy of his personal file and his marriage file. He acknowledged receipt of these files. He also submitted a request, under the Freedom of Information Act 1997, for access to all records held by my Department that related to him. My Department's file in this matter has been released in full under the provisions of the Act.</P>

      <P>I am informed by the Garda authorities that three burnt out cars were removed from the estate in question by Dublin City Council on 31 March-1 April. The Garda is currently investigating whether these cars were reported as stolen.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am assured that the Garda has a number of strategies in place to combat the problem of stolen cars including, where necessary, the use of targeted operations put in place by local Garda management in areas that have been identified as <Col N="1196" /> potential hotspots for joyriding. Specialist patrols and vehicles are concentrated in these areas to deal with public order and joyriding incidents. The Garda is constantly liaising with community groups and a number of projects are in operation which have proved valuable in dealing with offenders. In addition, the Garda and local authorities are working together in relation to estate management and reducing the opportunities for joyriding. For example, physical changes, such as barriers and speed ramps, are being used to reduce access to areas frequented by youths engaged in these activities.</P>
    <P>In relation to abandoned cars, the Waste Management Act 1996 specifically prohibits the abandonment of vehicles on any land and empowers local authorities to deal appropriately with them. The enforcement and implementation of these provisions is a matter for local authorities. Those that provide this service have entered into agreements with locally permitted operators to take the vehicles in question for dismantling and/or recovery.</P>

    <P>The charters were necessary as commercial airlines refused to carry some of the deportees concerned following earlier disruptive and threatening behaviour by them while on board regular scheduled flights.</P>
    <P>The Garda National Immigration Bureau is responsible for effecting removals from the State including the escorting of deportees while on flights. The number of escorts accompanying a deportee is an operational matter for the Garda and is based on a prior risk assessment carried out by them. I am informed by the Garda Commissioner that figures for the number of escorts used in 2002 are not readily available, except in relation to the three charter flights mentioned in the table above. The Garda will endeavour to compile this information as soon as possible, upon receipt of which I will forward to the Deputy.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment and Local Government (Mr. Cullen)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government's national climate change strategy, published in November 2000, sets a ten year policy framework for achieving the necessary greenhouse gas reductions towards Ireland's compliance with the Kyoto Protocol. Implementation of the strategy must be intensified and I have initiated a review which I expect to finalise by the middle of the year. I am satisfied that full implementation of the strategy over the remainder of the decade, together with any additional measures which may be identified in the review, will ensure that our Kyoto obligations are met by the 2008-12 period.</P>
      <P>Chapter 3 of the strategy deals with Government policy in regard to the use of cross-sectoral instruments, including taxation of greenhouse gas emissions which was to be addressed subject to a number of important considerations regarding the design of such taxation. The Minister for Finance announced in the budget that the Government had asked the relevant Departments to advance the plans for a general carbon energy tax, with a view to introducing this from the end of 2004. Given the many implications of such a tax, both environmental and economic, he indicated that there would be full consultations with interested parties on the design of the tax and a reasonable period is being allowed for its effective introduction.</P>
      <P>Chapter 4 of the strategy deals with the energy supply sector and the policies and measures being put in place to reduce emissions in this sector, including in the contexts of security of energy supply and the development of alternative energy sources. The design and implementation of specific policies in this area is a matter for the Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources.</P>
      <P>A copy of the national climate change strategy and the progress report on its implementation published in May 2002 are available in the Oireachtas Library.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 413, 421 and 422 together.</P>
      <P>A working group was established some time ago comprising representatives from my Department, the Department of Agriculture and Food, the main farming organisations and BirdWatch Ireland. Its task was to agree recommendations for the management of callow land within the middle Shannon Callows special protection area and in particular for management of corncrakes and breeding waders. The measures involved are envisaged for application under the rural environment protection scheme or farm plans approved by my Department.</P>
      <P>To assist the working group an expert team, comprised of two nominated Teagasc specialists and two specialists from a firm of agricultural consultants, was commissioned to prepare a report on losses and costs that would arise from implementation of the draft prescriptions in respect of the types of farming activities carried out on the callows. This report, dated September 2002, is now to hand.</P>
      <P>My Department has examined aspects of the report. A meeting of the working group is planned in the near future to advance its agenda to conclusion.</P>

      <P>The European Environment Agency notes, in its environmental signals report for 2002, that municipal waste generation continues to increase across the EU. The <Col N="1203" /> EU's sustainable development strategy and the 6th environmental action programme recognise, as an important objective, the need to break the link between economic growth, the use of resources and the generation of waste. I will work closely with the European Commission and Council of Ministers over the coming year in regard to policy development towards thematic strategies on sustainable use and the management of resources and on recycling. This will include proposals to reach the objectives set out in the 6th environmental action programme.</P>
      <P>At national level An Agreed Programme for Government sets out our agenda for better waste management over the Government's term of office, including enhanced prevention, reuse and recycling. More particularly, in line with the policy statement Preventing and Recycling Waste: Delivering Change, the EPA is developing the detailed arrangements to give effect to the national waste prevention programme included in the statement. I shall continue, with the relevant sectors, to place a high priority on the completion of producer responsibility initiatives for significant waste streams as these have the capacity to provide a direct economic incentive for waste prevention.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelAhern" hpid="Mr. N. Ahern Mr. N. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs (Mr. N. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy will be aware, the Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs is responsible for a wide range of schemes designed to support the social and economic development of communities both urban and rural, across the country. The range of these schemes has been outlined to the House on a number of occasions by my colleague, the Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs, Deputy Éamon Ó Cuív, most recently in his response to Parliamentary Question No. 142 of 26 March in which he outlined those schemes designed to support the social and economic development of communities both urban and rural, across the country.</P>
      <P>Against this background I am pleased to provide the Deputy with the following brief summary of those measures within the aegis of the Department which are most relevant to his inquiry.</P>
      <P>The local development and social inclusion programme (LDSIP) is delivered across three sub-measures &ndash; services to the unemployed, community developmen, and community based youth initiatives. The programme is delivered on the ground by 38 partnerships and 33 community groups. There is a provision of &euro;44 million approximately in my Department's vote for this programme in 2003.</P>
      <P>The local drugs task forces (LDTFs) operate in areas experiencing the worst levels of drug misuse, particularly heroin. In total, the Government has allocated over &euro;62.5 million to the implementation of projects local drugs task force areas since 1997. The total 2003 allocation for drugs related projects is &euro;16.159 million, the bulk of which is for LDTF projects.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The young people's facilities and services fund was established in 1998 as part of the Government's overall strategy to tackle drug misuse. The <Col N="1207" /> fund aims to assist in the development of youth facilities, including sport and recreational facilities and services in disadvantaged areas where a significant drug problem exists or has the potential to develop. An amount of approximately &euro;68 million has been allocated to date under the first round of funding. Some &euro;15.877 million has been provided for the fund in 2003.</P>
    <P>Over &euro;21 million has been provided for 2003 under the community development support programme and programme of core funding for community and family support groups, administered as part of the social inclusion measure of the National Development Plan 2000-06.</P>
    <P>The community development programme is designed to develop a network of community development projects in communities experiencing high unemployment, poverty and disadvantage. The programme provides funding towards staff overhead and administration costs associated with running a resource centre. There are currently 138 projects receiving funding or approved in principle for inclusion in the programme. The programme of core funding for community and family support groups provides support for smaller scale self-help work in specific target groups that experience disadvantage. At present, there are some 50 groups participating in the programme or in the process of being set up. Funding under these programmes assists in relation to the needs of women and children, those with disabilities, the homeless, lone parent families, the elderly, the unemployed, young people at risk, Traveller and other disadvantaged groups. In addition, a further &euro;2.4 million is being provided in 2003 for grant schemes which concentrate on a wide range of supports for local self help groups and community development.</P>
    <P>The scheme of community support for older people provides funding for initiatives to improve the security and social support of vulnerable older people. Under the terms of the scheme, grant aid is available towards the once-off costs of purchase and/or installation of small-scale physical security equipment and socially monitored alarm systems. Some &euro;3.444 million has been made available for grant aid under the scheme in 2003.</P>
    <P>The EU Leader programmes administered by my Department provide funding to local groups to develop their own areas. In line with the bottom up philosophy of Leader the local group is the decision-making authority on funding for projects in their own locality, subject to compliance with EU rules and regulations. There is a strong community focus in the programmes and substantial funding is directed towards community type projects.</P>
    <P>While the programmes do not have a special focus on areas of disadvantage the activities of Leader groups in implementing projects have a positive effect on areas of disadvantage. Youth is singled out for special attention under the programmes and all groups must target this category <Col N="1208" /> for grant awards. An amount of &euro;11.806 million has been allocated for this programme in 2003, while a further of &euro;9.457 million has been allocated to the area based rural development initiative which focuses on the development of integrated area based strategies to address rural disadvantage.</P>
    <P>The scheme to enhance training capacity in the community and voluntary sector stems from the White Paper on Supporting Voluntary Activity. The scheme was advertised on 25 March 2002 with a closing date of 7 May 2002. Applications received under this scheme are currently being assessed.</P>
    <P>The scheme to support the role of federations, networks and umbrella bodies in the community and voluntary sector, also stems from the White Paper. This scheme was advertised on 12 March 2003 and the closing date for receipt of applications is 11 April 2003.</P>
    <P>While these two schemes are not specifically targeted at the groups referred to by the Deputy, groups from those categories may receive funding under these measures.</P>
    <P>My Department is also responsible for the administration of a range of measures designed to facilitate and support the development of Gaeltacht and island communities.</P>
    <P>Capital grants are available in Gaeltacht areas for the development of maritime works, the improvement of Gaeltacht roads, the provision and improvement of Gaeltacht housing for qualified applicants, the provision and improvement of amenities, such as community halls, sports fields and other facilities. By improving the infrastructure, these grants add to the social, cultural and economic life of the Gaeltacht areas, as well as strengthening Irish as the community language within such areas. A provision of &euro;14.294 million has been made for these schemes in 2003.</P>
    <P>Údarás na Gaeltachta also promotes and supports community development and pursues a range of language and cultural activities involving individuals, community groups and industries throughout the Gaeltacht. Current funding of &euro;8.72 million and capital of &euro;24 million has been made available to the Údarás in 2003.</P>
    <P>My Department also has &euro;8.479 million funding in 2003 for islands to advance the development of infrastructure and services in support of communities on offshore islands.</P>

      <P>My Department has responsibility for the administration of the scheme of community support for older people (CSOP). Under this scheme, funding is directed through voluntary groups towards the provision of socially monitored alarms and small-scale physical security equipment, to older vulnerable people in the community.</P>
      <P>Under the 2002 CSOP, various regional offices of the Department of Social and Family Affairs, who administered the scheme on behalf of my Department in 2002, received applications from the organisation referred to by the Deputy.</P>
      <P>It is a condition of the scheme that payment can only issue where expenditure of previous grants has been fully accounted for. My Department, in association with the Department of Social and Family Affairs, has initiated an inspection of the books, records and returns of the organisation mentioned in the Deputy's question, specifically in relation to the usage of grants paid to that organisation under the 2000 CSOP scheme. When this issue has been resolved, consideration will then be given to further grant aiding the organisation.</P>
      <P>All other applications that came within the remit of the scheme were processed and paid before the end of 2002.</P>
      <P>Invitations to apply for funding under this scheme in 2003 will be advertised in the national and local papers later in the year.</P>

      <P>The Deputy will be aware that ADM manages the local development social inclusion programme on behalf of my Department. Allocations from within the budget available for the programme in 2003 were agreed by the board of ADM and notified to each partnership and community group recently.</P>
      <P>As you will appreciate, ADM must manage the programme from within the budget available in my Department's Vote. Reductions in available funding for 2003 are being managed on a sliding scale, ranging from 4%-7%, depending on the annual budget of the partnership or community group.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1210" />Adjustments to specific programmes and, in some cases, deferral of expenditure may be necessary.  However, I am working with ADM and the partnerships to minimise as far as possible the impact of the reductions in the programmes and services provided.</P>

      <P>I would refer the Deputies to the reply to Questions No. 108, 115, 126, 137, 139 and 141 of 26 March 2003 which described the form the consultation process with the providers of schemes and programmes and the social partners will take.

    <P>In relation to the issue of endorsement of plans by city and county development boards (CDBs), the position is that this will take place within the <Col N="1211" /> broad framework of the county or city strategies for economic, social and cultural development produced by each CDB and the need to ensure maximum co-ordination of services at local level. Having regard to the various constituent groups which make up the CDBs, the nature of their strategies and the boards' focus on the co-ordination of services at local level, I have every confidence that they have the capability and expertise to fulfil this role.</P>

      <P>My Department operates a number of rural development programmes including the CLÁR programme, the Leader programmes and rural development initiatives under the PEACE and INTERREG programmes.</P>
      <P>In regard to CLÁR, the measures introduced under the programme were decided after consultation with the communities in the areas concerned. In general, the measures are implemented by local authorities or other official agencies and not by my Department. This ensures efficiency and effectiveness as well as meeting the needs of the people in CLÁR areas.</P>

      <P>These Leader programmes are operated in accordance with the bottom-up philosophy of rural development, with the local Leader group being the decision-making authority in relation to approving actions falling within its business plan.</P>

Officials of my Department are also on hand to assist and advise Leader groups on the rural development schemes and procedures in place for them.</P>
      <P>The EU Programme for Peace and Reconciliation is a distinctive European Union Structural Funds programme aimed at reinforcing progress towards a peaceful and stable society and to promote reconciliation in Northern Ireland and the Border region of Ireland.

      <Quest>the way in which a decision was reached in relation to a carer's allowance claim when the actual recipient of the care was not brought to the oral hearing; the reason for bringing the person who is providing the care to the oral hearing and not bringing the person who needs the care when this would outline how much care exactly is needed; whether the care recipient should be brought to the oral hearing to show to the appeals officers just how much care and attention they need; and, further to medical evidence which was submitted in this case, the way in which the Department came to the decision to refuse this claim.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social and Family Affairs (Mary Coughlan)</NameTxt>
      <P>The application for carer's allowance of the person concerned was disallowed by a deciding officer who, having considered the medical evidence furnished in support of the claim, and the views of the Department medical advisor decided that the care recipient was not in need of full-time care and attention as prescribed in the statutory provisions. This decision was appealed to the social welfare appeals office and in the context of the appeal the care recipient was examined by a medical assessor of my Department who also expressed the opinion that she was not in need of full-time care and attention. Following an oral hearing and having carefully considered all the available evidence, including that adduced <Col N="1220" /> at the hearing, the appeals officer disallowed the appeal.</P>
      <P>The question as to who should be required to attend an oral hearing is for the appeals officer to decide. In the circumstances of this particular case the officer decided that, in view of the extensive medical evidence that was available to him, it was not necessary for the person being cared for to attend.</P>
      <P>Under social welfare legislation decisions in relation to claims must be made by deciding officers and appeals officers. These officers are statutorily appointed and I have no role in regard to making such decisions.</P>
