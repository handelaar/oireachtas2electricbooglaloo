    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 1 to 6, inclusive, together.</P>
      <P>I am pleased to have this opportunity to make a statement to the House on the implementation of An Agreed Programme for Government between Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats. Our programme for Government is both clear in intent and specific in detail. It is the agreed agenda for this partnership Government over five full years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The starting point for the current programme for Government was rooted in a recognition that there is more to do. In an ever changing world, the reform process is never over. As a Govern<Col N="3" /> ment, we are determined to keep driving forward. In implementing this programme for Government, we will not rest on past successes. Instead, we will build on the solid foundations we have put in place since 1997. In setting out to implement our commitments, we will bring forward and progress the most ambitious legislative programme in the history of the State. Since the Government took office on 6 June, 22 Bills have been published; 12 Bills have been enacted; and, in addition, there are 37 Bills before the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>Given the scale of the Government's legislative programme and the large number of specific commitments set out in the agreed programme, it would be impossible in the time allotted to fully detail the progress delivered. Requests for the details would, in any event, be more appropriately addressed to individual Ministers. The cornerstones of An Agreed Programme for Government are based on our desire to build a better Ireland for everyone and our promises to protect and expand prosperity for all, strengthen peace and reconciliation, guarantee improved pensions, reform and develop our health services and invest in better public services.</P>
    <P>Without economic strength, there will never be an Ireland where everyone can prosper and fulfil their potential. A key objective of our programme for Government is to sustain a strong economy and &ldquo;keep the finances of general Government close to balance or in surplus&rdquo;. In that regard, I congratulate the Minister for Finance on his achievement of an end of year Exchequer surplus of &euro;95 million. By continuing to provide strong leadership and managing our way through this period of uncertainty, the Government will ensure Ireland will be well poised to take best advantage of the inevitable upturn when it comes.</P>
    <P>The key areas for which my Department is responsible in terms of An Agreed Programme for Government can be broadly summarised as follows: supporting the development and implementation of policy in a co-ordinated way across Departments, including servicing the activities of relevant Cabinet committees; working with the British Government and the pro-Agreement parties to achieve the implementation of the Good Friday Agreement in all its aspects; co-ordinating the e-Government initiative to bring about an expansion in the range and quality of on-line Government services; and ensuring that Ireland's objectives in the European Union are carried forward in the context of my role as a member of the European Council and the forthcoming Irish Presidency.</P>
    <P>Our overriding priority, as set out in the programme for Government, is to secure lasting peace in Northern Ireland and we have worked tirelessly towards this objective. On European affairs, we honoured our commitment to submit the Nice treaty on enlargement to the people in a referendum in a way which addressed the con<Col N="4" /> cerns of the people as expressed during the previous referendum and in the National Forum on Europe. We are committed to playing a full part in the European Convention and the Europe-wide debate on the future shape of the European Union which is being spearheaded in part by the work of the Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs, Deputy Roche.</P>
    <P>On social partnership, the terms of the draft agreement, Sustaining Progress, are being considered by the various parties and I trust that they will be seen as a reasonable basis for continuing the partnership process. I hope the farm organisations will reconsider their position and decide to pursue their goals within the framework of social partnership.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny" hpid="Mr. Kenny Mr. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not sure if the Taoiseach has taken speed reading lessons, but that was a well practised reply.</P>
      <P>Is it not a fact that the programme for Government is a thoroughly discredited document? It is obvious to every Deputy who travels from constituency to constituency that Ministers in the current Government have left a litany of broken promises in every parish, townland and county. A specific commitment was given that hospital waiting lists would be eliminated in two years. Is it not a fact that that has not happened? Is it not a fact that cancer patients, who have had to travel 400 mile round trips for radiotherapy treatment, have had to take court cases to obtain their rights? Is it not a fact that children have to wait eight years for orthodontic treatment? Is it not a fact that the programme for Government committed expenditure for the recruitment of 2000 extra gardaí and that this process had not yet commenced? Expenditure for this year has risen by only 2% over the past year.</P>
      <P>Is it not a fact that capital expenditure on primary schools is down by 4%? In virtually every county and parish commitments were given by members of the current Government to parents, boards of management and groups that no child would be educated in sub-standard facilities under the current programme? Given all of that and more to come, is it not a fact that the programme for Government is completely and utterly discredited and that the landscape, economically and socially, has changed since these promises were made?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I know Deputy Kenny realises it was not our intention to have the programme for Government completely implemented by the end of February 2003. We have been moving apace in implementing it across a range of areas. I am not here to answer for every one of them but Deputy Kenny will know that in health, despite the fact that there has been a considerable economic slow-down across the world, including in Ireland, we have been able to resource a substantial capital programme. We are spending double that of most other countries with the exception of Luxembourg. What we are spending <Col N="5" /> under the capital programme is helping in the areas of health and infrastructure. It is also helping in the area of education with more than &euro;300 million being spent there. That is slightly less than last year but taking account of what has been spent in recent years, it is a substantial figure. First and second level education are receiving priority in this regard. More than 55,000 houses were built last year. Employment levels continue to hold despite obvious difficulties particularly in the manufacturing sector.</P>
      <P>On services, we have introduced the treatment purchase fund and more than 11,000 extra staff were recruited to the health services sector in the past year. Any reasonable assessment on the basis of what has been happening in more difficult times will illustrate that the Government is fulfilling its commitments. Things are a little slower than if the economy was growing at 12% but that is not the case anywhere in the world.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Taoiseach agree it would be more honest for the Government to tear up the programme for Government and to admit that the people were conned? Does he challenge the assertion that there is no point in persisting with a programme that now counts for nothing? How many of the promised 2,000 additional gardaí have been recruited so far? How many will have been recruited by the end of the year? How many of the promised 200,000 medical cards have been issued so far and how many does the Taoiseach expect will be issued in 2003?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not intend to answer individual questions for every Minister. My view of the matter is totally different from that of Deputy Rabbitte. The programme for Government has started quite well, in a difficult climate across a range of areas. There is a substantial capital programme and a substantial improvement in the health service, where the large increase in resources is reflected in staffing levels, the capital programme for health and the treatment purchase fund. I spoke yesterday to people who are working in that unit and are dealing with over 3,000 cases. The Minister for Health and Children made clear last year that he would be unable to make progress in relation to the medical card area at this stage. The economy was growing by 10% or 12% at the start of 2001, but the latest figures, for the end of last year, indicate that it is now growing by under 1%. I do not think Deputies should try to fool people by saying that the same things can be achieved when the economy is growing at 12% as when growth is 1%.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wish to make clear that the programme for Government is moving ahead within resources, in line with the growth and stability pact and within or close to surplus. Some &euro;36 billion is being spent, although it has to be somewhat more prudently spent. I hope we will continue to spend the money in the right way, unlike other countries that are building up enormous deficits that will <Col N="6" /> be tied around their necks. We made a similar mistake in this country in the past and we know that other countries will be caught out by the burden of debt. We intend to continue to decrease the national debt and to keep the debt GDP ratio at a low level so that we will be able to cope when problems arise. We are not going to move from that path.</P>
    <P>Ireland has to take account of events in the international community. It is not my role to give a lecture in economics as Deputies are aware that no economy is doing well at present. Although Ireland's level of economic performance is quite low, it is the best in the OECD. The Government's task is to manage the economy effectively. It may be some time before things improve, however, as a result of what is happening in the United States, Japan and elsewhere in the Far East. Events in such places affect the Irish economy as Ireland is the most globalised country in the world, according to recent data. We have to manage our economic affairs in a prudent manner so that we can operate on a different level when things improve. The programme for Government will continue to be implemented, initiative by initiative, in a manageable way and within the resources that are available.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent" hpid="Mr. Sargent Mr. Sargent">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach has said he is somewhat surprised that the reality of the post-election world does not align with the fantasy he presented to the electorate prior to the general election. Given that he now appreciates that fact, will he tell the House if he intends to bring forward an amended programme for Government to deal with the reality he now accepts? Does he accept that the false programme currently before us is doing nothing except annoying and incensing people and making them realise that the Government is not living in the real world? Will the schools building programme, which has been cut back, be considered so that the most urgent cases involving essential education for children with special needs will not be affected in the same way as schools that do not have facilities for those with special needs? Will the Taoiseach bring some prudence to that area?</P>
      <P>Does the Taoiseach accept, given that the programme for Government states that there will be incineration only when there is prior extraction from the waste stream of recyclables and problematic materials like metals and batteries, that this is not the case at present? There is only a 15% level of recycling. Does the Taoiseach accept that incineration should not be on the agenda, even within the terms of the programme for Government, until we reach the proper recycling levels promised in the programme?</P>
      <P>Will the Taoiseach say whether the programme will be adhered to, given its unreal nature and the promises for 2,000 extra gardaí, which is now known to be fantasy? Will he stick to the programme or amend it to bring it into line with reality? Neither is happening at present.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Rabbitte asked about the number of gardaí. The figure is currently 11,900 and the Government will bring that to 12,200, including recruits in Templemore and those who will arrive there during this year. I apologise for confusion on that.</P>
      <P>I disagree with Deputy Sargent's analysis. I do not want to go back over old ground but, regardless of the arguments, I cannot agree with something that is not true. If I was to accept the Deputy's analysis of the economic situation, I would have to accept that it was only late last year that the economic downturn occurred, but that is not the case.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>They did. That is why I am on this side of the House while the Deputy is on the other. With regard to the environment, the Government's intentions are set out in the programme for Government. Deputy Sargent might not agree with all those but the Minister for the Environment and Local Government, Deputy Cullen, is attempting to move the environmental programme on in a substantial way.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>That is useful and the Minister has outlined a range of areas on which he hopes to make progress.</P>
      <P>I do not disagree with the Deputy with regard to the schools building programme. It is unlikely that the substantial increases of previous years can be continued so resources should be spent on schools most in need. The Minister for Education and Science has categorised the priority areas, for which the House has asked for some time. I agree that schools for those with special needs should be helped and the Minister has categorised them in order of need. Schools that have come on to the list in recent years should not get priority over older schools or those in bad condition.</P>
      <P>Thousands of schools have benefited from construction and refurbishment in the past decade, particularly in the past five years. Many of those have applied again for extensions and other improvements. Schools that are on the priority list or are categorised as being in need of repair should get priority.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeHiggins" hpid="Mr. J. Higgins Mr. J. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Taoiseach aware that principals, parents and students in schools throughout the country are angry that letters from him and members of his party dated last May outlining promises to provide funding for badly needed school repairs and extensions have not been honoured? How can he claim to be vigorously implementing the programme for Government when huge numbers of people have been bitterly disappointed?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>After almost a year in Government, the Taoiseach has done nothing to represent the thousands of workers, young people and students who are being grievously exploited by private landlords. Does he agree that the package of reforms for the rented accommodation sector, outlined in An Agreed Programme for Government, should be implemented as a matter of urgency given that in this city, people are paying &euro;600 or &euro;700 per month for a bedsitter that would hardly be used as a coalshed in other contexts? Will he indicate when action will be taken to curb the activities of rack-renting landlords, who are making life such a misery for many thousands of working people? <Col N="9" /> The Taoiseach promised to help them but he has not delivered.</P>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The schools building programme contains a commitment to ensure that every school attains modern standards. This is underlined by the allocation of &euro;343 million to the programme in what is a difficult year in financial terms. It is an enormous sum of money compared to what was allocated a few years ago. While it is insufficient and there is a waiting list, we must ensure that funding continues to be provided to the capital programme. Small as is the country, we are still spending substantially more on infrastructure than most others. We need to do that, and will continue to do so across a range of capital programmes, including education. Funding for the capital programme this year is approximately &euro;5.4 billion. The priority areas have been identified and they will be addressed as times improve.</P>
      <P>On the private rented sector Bill and the issues raised by Deputy Higgins, I gave a commitment. I promised that we would deal with the issue. I acknowledged that since the 1960s, no action has been taken to address problems in the private rented sector. During the term of the last Government, I established a commission of all the interested parties to work to try to find a solution to that problem. It prepared a report which I accepted. I gave an undertaking that legislation would be introduced. The Bill will be before the Dáil during this session.</P>

      <NameTxt>Caoimhghín Ó Caoláin</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Taoiseach recall that the first section in An Agreed Programme for Government is entitled Building Peace and Justice and that it directly refers to the peace process and the Good Friday Agreement, areas covered by the Taoiseach's Department? The programme commits the Government to the full implementation of the Agreement and the consolidation of its institutions. Will the Taoiseach provide an overview of where this commitment now stands?</P>
      <P>The last point in this section of the programme refers to the commitment by Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats to improving North-South infrastructure links and facilitate cross-Border planning. Does the Taoiseach agree that this is mere aspiration and that nothing of substance has been done by the Government? This is evidenced in the publication of the national spatial strategy in November 2002, which barely acknowledged the idea of all-Ireland planning and infrastructure links. There was nothing at all in the strategy, yet it is supposed to be a 20-year plan, within which time I would hope to be living in all-island circumstances in a united Ireland.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>That is all I asked. The national spatial plan has designated a number of areas in the north of the country and in Deputy Ó Caoláin's own constituency which are to benefit from growth over the next 20 years. We have already seen considerable development in the areas in question, many of which were enhanced by designated status and other tax-driven policies. Decentralisation must be considered in this respect.</P>
      <P>The infrastructural programme operates on an island economy basis, to which I totally subscribe. A decade ago, the trade that took place between Dublin and Belfast was only 25% of that between two similar cities in mainland Europe. That was an appalling statistic. An all-island approach has been adopted in a number of areas. In the tourism sector, marketing is done on such a basis, and there is closer co-operation between our statutory agencies, North and South, regarding foreign direct investment into Europe and the United States. There are very close relationships in the agricultural sector in good and bad times, as there are in the fisheries sector.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The largest physical infrastructural projects that have taken place anywhere on this island are taking place on the Dublin-Belfast road. A sum of &euro;600 million is being spent on the tunnel, which is to allow free access to the port mainly by trucks and traders because the cost for cars is prohibitive. Work on the airport, Lissenhall and Dundalk-west bypasses is being carried out. Projects have already been completed in Dunleer, Drogheda, Balbriggan and on the Newry Road. These developments, which involve about &euro;1.5 <Col N="11" /> billion in terms of road infrastructure alone, are enormously progressive and allow for the expansion of work on an all-Ireland basis. I agree with the Deputy in respect of the national spatial strategy which was launched only three months ago in mid-November. It opens up opportunities, which I hope will be enhanced.</P>
    <P>The Deputy knows that considerable effort and commitment are being made by everybody although it is too early to say whether we can achieve any major breakthrough. He will be aware that people have been putting in an enormous number of hours in recent weeks to see if we can make progress across all parties, including his own. Time will tell whether we succeed in implementing the programme.</P>

      <P>Page 24 of the programme for Government states that the Government parties stand for a society in which all people can feel safe in their communities, their businesses and their homes. Recently, a young man had his throat slit while taking money out of an ATM. Every night on our streets unprovoked acts of violence take place in which people are kicked to death or close to it, but not one of the extra 2,000 gardaí mentioned in the programme has been recruited. The entire Garda pay for December is to come out of this year's budget and the force is suffering greatly from a lack of spare parts for its communications system. The Garda is being beaten hands down by organised crime. Is that not an indictment of the zero tolerance policy espoused by the Taoiseach and his Government over the past five years?</P>
      <P>Fianna Fáil Members create the illusion of completion of works. The Minister for Defence sat before the parents and management of Littleton national school last year and told them that the bulldozers would be in the yard in three months.</P>

    <P>The programme for Government promises a reduction in the cost of insurance claims through the reform of civil law procedures. What reforms have taken place? The programme also promises a metro link to Dublin Airport by 2007. Can any Government Member explain why it will cost 12 times more per kilometre than a similar project <Col N="12" /> in the United States of America? Is construction inflation rampant or is there no one on the benches opposite with an understanding of how to keep costs down in terms of making commitments and devising projects? Are we to believe Government sources who say it is impossible to complete this project by 2007? Surely all of this discredits the programme document. The matters I have outlined comprise a litany of broken promises which were given to the people last April and May by a Government that knew the truth.</P>

      <P>Commitments under the last programme for Government were met and exceeded. Likewise we will make a genuine effort to honour our commitments over the five year term of this Administration, not over a period of eight months.</P>
      <P>There is crime but we have increased Garda funding from under &euro;600 million &ndash; its level when we first took office &ndash; to nearly &euro;1 billion. This represents an increase of 56%. We are committed to prioritising recruitment to bring the force's strength up to 12,200. The Garda is not losing the battle against crime.</P>

      <P>Operation Encounter targeted public order incidents of the sort referred to by Deputy Kenny. The Garda is doing its very best to focus on the night-clubs, licensed premises and fast food outlets where substantial crime takes place. The Garda is also tackling drugs which are the source of much criminal activity. We have put in place a national drugs strategy which will build on our experience to create a comprehensive framework from various elements of drugs policy. Other initiatives we have taken to tackle crime are working very well and Members will have an opportunity to discuss them with the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform in the House this evening.</P>
      <P>The Deputy is aware that infrastructural inflation has risen greatly. I quoted a figure of 37% to 38% in a reply to a question in the House recently. The level of costs for every kilometre of construction of roads, pipelines and such like is more than we would ever have estimated. Costs rose because of full employment and high wages in the construction industry and the agreements made on compulsory purchase orders of land. These are the factors that eroded the programme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Examination of the metro project is ongoing but there is no doubt that it is a very costly project. The figures for phase one of construction of the metro are enormously high and will need to be closely examined, and the Minister is doing that. Some of the figures quoted by the international consortia are based on their assessment of what it will cost to do the job in Dublin, and it is very costly for a short construction area from the city centre to the airport. The costs are frightening and we must examine them very carefully. <Col N="13" /> If the programme goes ahead we will have to consider what will be the effect of that level of expenditure on the rest of the country.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Taoiseach agree that he is doing himself an injustice when he says that he was the bottom of the class last May? Does he recall who made the promise to end hospital waiting queues within two years? Does he not recall that it was he who made the commitment? Does he recall who made the commitment to increase eligibility for medical cards to an additional 200,000 of our citizens? Who made that promise but the Taoiseach himself? Does he not recall that in a moment of excitement he actually committed to the recruitment of 2,000 additional gardaí in year one and the Department of Finance had to issue a statement saying that Templemore could not churn out 2,000 in one year? Who made these commitments but the Taoiseach?</P>
      <P>Would he not be better admitting that in terms of promising 3,000 additional beds he has not provided one additional bed this year? Does the Taoiseach agree that he has not provided one euro this year for new services for people with disabilities? Would it not be better for the Taoiseach to go back to the people and say: &ldquo;We fooled you, we did not really mean any harm by it, we were only doing it to buy the election, we got back into power, the whole thing was a mirage and the programme for Government does not mean anything&rdquo;?</P>
      <P>Now that the Minister for Finance has arrived in the House, is it not the case that the Taoiseach put together the programme for Government at a time when that Minister's Department was preparing an announcement of a forecast of &euro;750 million deficit in the public finances at the end of the year? Notwithstanding that, the Taoiseach went ahead and prepared this programme for Government. The result was a dramatic reversal of engines by the Minister for Finance when he cut spending from 23% to 14%, imposing extraordinary hardship on a range of people. The real programme for Government now is the new programme for sustainability which is about to be agreed with the social partners, an austerity programme on everything except pay increases. At this stage would it not be better if the Taoiseach told the people that he got away with it and he fooled them? His party and the Progressive Democrats conned them and now they are living with the consequences.</P>

An enormous range of small, medium and large size construction programmes in the health services is under way. More than 3,000 people have now had treatment under the treatment purchase fund. The commitment of &euro;10 for pensioners has been maintained although people thought we would not manage that. There have been increases of &euro;8 and &euro;10 in child benefit, increases for widows and widowers and increases in care grants. There have also been changes in tax credits and PRSI for lower paid workers.</P>
      <P>I am amazed that Deputy Rabbitte deems this an austerity programme. I know he does not mean it. He excluded pay but as a former trade unionist he would know that the programme gives not alone 7% in pay but about &euro;1.5 billion to public service workers and a benchmarking deal.

      <P>The public service pay agreement under the proposed <Col N="17" /> social partnership agreement, Sustaining Progress, provides for a pay increase of 7% over an 18 month period with an initial six months pay pause. This increase is to apply as follows: 3% from 1 January 2004; 2% from 1 July 2004; and 2% from 1 December 2004. It is estimated that the cost of implementing these increases is &euro;548 million in 2004 and &euro;928 million in 2005.</P>
      <P>In addition to this increase the awards recommended by the Public Service Benchmarking Body would be implemented as follows: 25% of the increases in 2003 backdated to 1 December 2001; 50% of the increases from 1 January 2004; and 25% of the increases from 1 June 2005. The estimated cost of implementing the benchmarking increase is &euro;565 million in 2003, of which &euro;290 million relates to arrears from 1 December 2001, &euro;825 million in 2004 and &euro;985 million in 2005. In the public service the payment of the increases will be dependent on the achievement of measures to modernise the public service and the maintenance of industrial peace.</P>

The Minister is asking everyone to sign up to the partnership agreement. He is the one person to whom we look to estimate the costs. Why does he not know what those costs will be? Surely <Col N="18" /> this is not an acceptable basis on which to ask taxpayers and consumers to accept an agreement that may well mean far greater charges and taxes for them? </P>
      <P>Does the Minister agree that the combined cost of the allocations to pension funds and SSIAs will impose huge burdens on the Exchequer in the next two or three years? There is a need for a realistic assessment by the Minister of the tax implications of all of those proposals. The Minister does not seem to be willing to offer that.</P>

      <P>The overriding fiscal requirement in An Action Programme for the Millennium relates to compliance with the terms of the stability and growth pact. This agreement is also predicated on keeping the fiscal position on a sustainable basis. As the Deputy is aware, making predictions of the level of growth in the Irish economy and of the factors which will affect levels of economic activity and other such guesses are not wise. I can give the Deputy figures for the various items in terms of present day cost, but it would be speculative to imply from such figures that one has to increase or decrease tax rates or to assume what the Government's commitment regarding taxation will be. The Government makes decisions each year in the light of the prevailing circumstances.</P>

The Government stands over its commitments but they are to be met over a period of time and they depend on the overall economic situation. The Government is firmly committed to implementing the proposals in the agreement and will honour them.

That being said, the Government hopes to do all of these things within the resources available to it. That is the commitment the Government has made.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>In February 2001 the Government approved proposals for a residential institutions redress scheme which formed a major part of its general approach to try and bring some healing and closure to victims of child abuse, recognising its own responsibilities to those victims. These proposals were approved by the Oireachtas in the subsequently enacted Residential Institutions Redress Act, 2002.</P>
      <P>It was considered by Government that the religious congregations should be asked to make a meaningful voluntary contribution towards the cost of the scheme. However, it should be emphasised that the Government had already decided to go ahead with a redress scheme even if the religious congregations were not to contribute to it. Having regard to the nature of the scheme, and given that it was a voluntary contribution, the issue of requesting an assessment of the assets held by the congregations was considered but the exercise was not regarded as being relevant.</P>
      <P>Following the Government approval of the redress scheme a group of officials from the Department of Education and Science, my Department and the Office of the Attorney General met representatives of the religious congregations on a number of occasions during the period February 2001 to October 2001 to explore whether they would make a contribution. It was clear from the early stages of the negotiations with the congregations that they would not participate and contribute to the scheme, without a cap and an indemnity. The decision was taken, following earlier clearance at ministerial level, that the negotiators could propose an approach based on a 50:50 contribution with a cap of £100 million &ndash;&euro;127 million, together with an agreement in principle to an indemnity to be subsequently drafted between the parties. This was put to the religious congregations at the meeting of 16 October 2001 but was not accepted by them at that stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Following further direct discussions between representatives of the congregations and the Minister for Education and Science during December 2001 and January 2002, the Minister announced, on 30 January 2002, that the Government had agreed in principle to a set of proposals whereby the congregations would contribute &euro;128 million to the scheme in return for the indemnity <Col N="20" /> by the State, the details of which had to be subsequently drafted.</P>
    <P>An official from my Department attended a meeting with representatives of the Department of Education and Science and religious congregations in mid-March 2002 to advance matters. This was followed by meetings between officials from the Department of Education and Science and the Office of the Attorney General and representatives of the religious congregations on the detailed provisions of the indemnity scheme. Officials from my Department were not in attendance at those meetings. However, my Department was kept informed of developments generally and met officials from the Department of Education and Science and the Office of the Attorney General in mid-May, with a view to concluding matters at official level so that the agreement could be formally submitted to Government.</P>
    <P>As at 5 June 2002, when the Government agreed the indemnity agreement, the best information available from the Department of Education and Science was that the estimated cost could be in the range from £200 million to £400 million &ndash;&euro;250 to &euro;500 million euros The cost could be higher or lower depending on the actual number of cases and the awards made. The final cost will not be known until the redress board has completed its work, which will be at least three years hence.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB" hpid="Ms Burton Ms Burton">
      <NameTxt>Ms Burton</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for his answer. He referred to the negotiations of March 2002, of which his officials were informed, and the negotiations of mid-May 2002, in which his officials took part with officials of the Office of the Attorney General. Did the staff of his Department and of the Office of the Attorney General not carry out a due diligence examination of the resources and assets of the religious congregations, with a view to determining how much they could pay?</P>
      <P>The Minister indicated that the religious congregations capped their contribution at £100 million, which subsequently became &euro;127 million. Did the Minister's Department carry out an assessment of the assets of the religious congregations, of their capacity to pay and of whether what they were offering to pay was reasonable in the circumstances? The Minister, as an accountant, will know that a due diligence examination is a common feature of such agreements.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the face of it a 50:50 sharing arrangement appears to be reasonable. Why, then, did he and his officials abandon that strategy? Two types of abuse were taking place in these institutions. There was what could be described as the ordinary abuse in which people were beaten, starved and deprived of family life and for which, without a doubt, the State carried partial responsibility. The religious institutions insisted on the right to control education and health. There was also the question of sexual abuse. There are numerous reports which suggest that no reasonable inspec<Col N="21" /> tions by the Department of Education and Science at the time could have reasonably uncovered the sexual abuse. Why did the Department of Finance decide, effectively, to let the religious off the hook and allow the taxpayer to bear the brunt of the cost of this extraordinary deal?</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy made three points. The first point raised was whether an assessment of the assets held by the congregations was required. As indicated in my reply, having regard to the nature of the scheme the issue of requesting an assessment of the assets held by the congregations was considered but the exercise was not regarded as relevant. I emphasise again that, in any event, what was sought from the congregations was a voluntary contribution, not one contingent on an assessment of their assets and liabilities.</P>
      <P>May I say to the Deputy, who has followed this issue for some time, that it was the Government decided as an act of retribution to the individuals concerned that we would have this non-adversarial system. It was the Government that decided to go ahead with a compensation scheme, even if the Government had to meet 100% of the cost of all awards. It was then considered that we should request the congregations to make a meaningful contribution. The next stage was that the congregations had to make up their minds as to whether they wanted to make a meaningful contribution. They had a decision to make, which I am sure they considered over a long period, whether to participate in the Government's scheme by making a contribution or to fight all these cases individually. That is the basis on which the negotiations took place and that is not widely appreciated.</P>
      <P>The Deputy's second question was in regard to the 50:50 sharing arrangement that I requested at the start of these negotiations. Any Minister for Finance &ndash; I speak for all my predecessors in this office &ndash; seeks the maximum amount of contribution from everyone bar the taxpayer or the Exchequer. If in any situation 100% of the cost can be met by somebody else I would gladly proceed in that way, otherwise I would be failing in my duty. We put forward that idea. At earlier meetings the congregations said &ldquo;No&rdquo; because they always had the option of fighting these cases independently. We can discuss this matter on a later occasion. We put forward that proposition but the congregations said they would not participate unless there was a cap on their overall contribution and an indemnity.</P>
      <P>The Deputy asked about the forms of abuse in these institutions. I am not <i>au fait</i> with the relevant details in the Department of Education and Science stretching back over 40 years but I am led to believe there was evidence on the files of the Department of Education and Science that these institutions were not policed in the proper manner. The State has a very serious responsibility in this regard.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>The vacancy on the six member executive board of the European Central Bank to which the Deputy is referring arises from the expiry of the non-renewable term of office of Ms Sirkka Hamalainen on 31 May next.</P>
      <P>On the last occasion that such a vacancy arose, in May of last year, Mr. Lucas Papademos of Greece replaced Mr. Christian Noyer of France, and while at the time I did not propose an Irish candidate for that position, I indicated that Ireland would put forward a candidate for the vacancy caused by the ending of Ms. Hamalainen's term.</P>
      <P>Article 11.2 of the Protocol on the Statute of the European System of Central Banks and of the European Central Bank states: &ldquo;. . . .  members of the Executive Board shall be appointed from among persons of recognized standing and professional experience in monetary or banking matters. . . . .&rdquo;  It is clear from the appointments made to date that this treaty requirement in regard to both qualifications and standing is being interpreted strictly. Of the original six members and one replacement appointed to date, three have been central bank governors, three others held very senior positions in a central bank and the only person who did not hold a position in a central bank, Mr. Noyer, was formerly head of the French Finance Ministry.</P>
      <P>Against that background, where the number of credible candidates any member state can put forward is very limited, where a number of highly qualified candidates are already in the field, and moreover, where the eight year term of office for all new members is so lengthy as to effectively rule out some qualified persons, I recently considered whether an Irish candidate of sufficient standing and closely relevant experience, who was willing to allow his or her name to go forward, might be found. Despite informal approaches being made to a number of people, no such candidate was found.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanBoyle" hpid="Mr. Boyle Mr. Boyle">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boyle</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad to hear the job specification for entry to the European Central Bank seems to have been tightened up in recent years. Is the Minister confident that if such a candidate was found an Irish nominee would be accepted? The reality is that there is a degree of semi-detachment between Ireland and the European Central Bank, to which the Minister has helped <Col N="23" /> to contribute in recent years. This semi-detachment is unhelpful in terms of our economic well-being and development. If the Government wants to be at the heart of Europe the development of a European monetary policy to a single European currency is being affected by not having Irish people in the midst of the decision-making process.</P>
      <P>What steps does the Minister intend to take in the near future to ensure Ireland is not compromised in terms of a system that already weights against us in terms of the type of economy we have, how we are structured, where we stand in the economic cycle and how decisions are being made in the European Central Bank that will affect us in the short-term without, seemingly, a proper influence from an Irish Government perspective?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>With all due respect, I think the Deputy misunderstands how the European Central Bank operates. The European Central Bank has a six member executive board but decisions are made by the 15 members of the European Central Bank. There are 18 members in total of the European Central Bank. We have one representative, namely, the Governor of the Central Bank, Mr. John Hurley. The only previous person there was the previous Governor, Mr. Maurice O'Connell. The executive board comprises six people. They sit with the European Central Bank in conclave and make the decisions. In the six member executive board Ms Hamalainen, the Finnish representative, represents the constituency of some of the smaller member states. When her vacancy arises it is considered that this position should be filled by the smaller member states. Austria and Belgium have put forward candidates and I have decided to support the Austrian candidate, Ms Gertrude Tumpel-Gugerell. However, this matter must be dealt with by unanimity and much negotiations will take place before that decision is made.</P>
      <P>We are not semi-detached from the operations of the European Central Bank. The European Central Bank meets every second Thursday of the month. The Governor is continually out there and he is part of the process that makes this particular decision, but the executive board is made up of six people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When the membership of the EU is more than 15, there are proposals on the table which will allow for a rotation of positions regarding membership of the council of the European Central Bank. There will be the large member states in one constituency, smaller member states in the second constituency and smaller again in the third constituency. Under the proposals already on the table we are in the second constituency at present. When there are more than 15 member states of the EU we will be rotating our position, more or less on the lines of the proposals put forward to deal with the commissionerships and so will the larger member states. Therefore, we do <Col N="24" /> not have a semi-detached position from the European Central Bank. The Deputy may have been slightly confused with another European institution in the earlier part of his question.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanBoyle" hpid="Mr. Boyle Mr. Boyle">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boyle</NameTxt>
      <P>I know the difference between the EIB and the European Central Bank. I was just reminding the Minister of the differences in job specifications. The question the Minister did not answer is what role the Irish Government is playing within the European Central Bank to ensure the differences between the Irish economy and the general European economy are understood within the decision-making structures of the European Central Bank?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy has raised a very interesting topic. The Governor of the Central Bank is totally independent in the exercise of his functions and the members of the European Central Bank board, of which Governor Hurley is one, operate completely independently. There has been a debate from the initiation of the concept of the euro as to the role of Ministers for Finance in influencing what central bankers do. We had this debate in the House during the term of the last Government and it boiled down to what I would term loosely as, the German and French ways of dealing with the Central Bank. Perhaps I am summarising it too smartly, but the Irish Central Bank has always been independent, set interest rates and devalued the currency in whatever way was necessary. Germany's Bundesbank operated in more or less the same way. The French position is somewhat different.</P>
      <P>Prior to the setting up of the euro there was a great debate about what role Ministers for Finance should have. There is an arrangement whereby euro group ministers meet and, while they do not influence the operations of the Central Bank, the President of the European Central Bank attends the meetings and takes on board what is said. The European Central Bank is totally independent of Ministers for Finance, who play exactly the same role as everyone else.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>For a variety of reasons, our inflation has been exceeding the EU norm for some time. Some of this has been due to external factors, some is due to the process of Ireland catching up in growth terms with the rest of Europe and some due to domestic factors. The last is where we must concentrate our efforts. That is why the adoption of the pay arrangement set out under the new social partnership agreement, Sustaining Progress, is important. By ensuring that wage increases are kept to sustainable levels, we can continue to focus on our competitiveness and avoid losing jobs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="25" />I welcome the aims of the anti-inflation provisions in Sustaining Progress. The Government, along with IBEC and ICTU, will work together to keep downward pressure on inflation, particularly over the next 18 months. I am pleased that the rate of inflation fell to 4.8% in January, despite many predictions that it would rise to around 5.5%. I also note that some commentators see inflation dropping sharply by the end of the year. I will not make a prediction except to say that the trend will be downward during the course of the year.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaulMcGrath" hpid="Mr. P. McGrath Mr. P. McGrath">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. McGrath</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister referred to the fact that the social partnership agreement included measures that would try to control inflation. Is that credible given that he and the Government have been the main drivers of inflation in recent times? For example, VAT has increased, which has increased the price of everything. Motor tax and hospital charges have increased, the drug refund scheme is much more expensive, VHI, bank charges, bin charges, ESB, college fees and bus fares have all increased with the approval of the Government. Today, an increase in gas prices was announced. What does the Minister intend to do about the way in which the Government is driving inflation to its current rate? Given that manufacturing inflation is down 3% since last April, it is incredible that the Government can enter an agreement with the social partners to control inflation when they are the main drivers of it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>I can give the Deputy the breakdown of the various impacts on the consumer price index. However, it would be correct to say that they do not make up the bulk of the increase in the consumer price index over the past year or so. The main factor driving inflation upwards is the services sector. The Deputy is correct that in the new document, Sustaining Progress, there is a commitment to setting up an anti-inflation group consisting of the Government and the social partners, which will address all the issues in that context. If anyone on the opposite side of the House has any brilliant ideas regarding reducing inflation, we will be gladly take them on board.</P>
      <P>The effect of my budgetary measures in regard to excise duty and other increases will add approximately 0.8% to the consumer price index, which is not the dominant factor in the increase in the CPI.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaulMcGrath" hpid="Mr. P. McGrath Mr. P. McGrath">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. McGrath</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister asked for suggestions on how we might control inflation. The first suggestion is to get rid of the Government, because it is inflationary in everything it does. He said that his budgetary measures will add 0.8% to the consumer price index, but what about all the other increases, including colleges fees, the knock-on effects of the VAT increases, ESB increases, gas increases and so on? He is not taking these increases into account. When the <Col N="26" /> Minister referred to the 0.8%, he is not being absolutely up-front to the House and the taxpayers because he knows that many of the measures he introduced will have knock-on effects, which is what is driving inflation to its current level. Does the Minister think it is credible to enter into an agreement with themselves to control inflation given that the Government is the main driver of it?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept what the Deputy said about the importance of keeping down inflation. If we can bring down inflation to the levels of our European partners, we will no longer lose competitiveness to them, which will have a beneficial effect on the Irish economy. There are many reasons for high inflation in Ireland. As we are now part of a single currency area, there will automatically be differences in this area, therefore, there is an element of catching up. It is in all our interests to reduce inflation to the same level as our European partners. The <i>raison d'être</i> of the European Central Bank is to keep inflation at approximately 2% per annum, and it will endeavour to achieve that figure. Therefore, if our inflation is higher than 2% per annum we will get into difficulties. The European Central Bank recently forecast that the rate of inflation will be slightly above the 2% figure this year. Therefore, we must reduce inflation, because if we do not do so, we will lose competitiveness.</P>
      <P>The Deputy is correct in saying that manufacturing prices are not increasing. They will not increase in the coming years because capital will be used to set up businesses in places that will keep prices down, particularly in the Far East and other eastern European countries. Even when eastern European countries come up to the level of Europe, manufacturing prices will be kept down due to competition from the Far East. The market share will go to the Far East unless Europe, particularly Ireland, can keep prices down.</P>

Does the Minister agree that when the history of this era is written, one name will stand out, that of the former Minister of State, Eithne FitzGerald, who introduced this groundbreaking Act? Does he agree it has been one of those Acts which has characterised the movement of Irish society from a rather closed and backward looking one to a international one which can compete with the best in the world and which is not afraid that the arrangements, deals and thinking of Government and of Departments of State are subject to full scrutiny? In the modern world, to be subject to full scrutiny means to be subject to the scrutiny of the media and journalists and that is in the interests of the public.</P>
      <P>The Minister should bear in mind that the United States, that great democracy, has operated a freedom of information Act for the past 50 years and that another great democracy, Sweden, which has a high wage and high productivity economy, has operated a freedom of information system for the past 250 years. I ask the Minister not to close the door in a retrograde way on freedom of information given the very successful period of implementation of the Act. Does the Minister agree that any minor problems with the Act would be relatively easily addressed, but only after appropriate consultation with the interested party?</P>

      <P>The position is that prior to the changes to income tax announced in budget 2003, it was estimated that some 29.96% of income earners would be liable to the higher rate of income tax at the end of 2003.</P>
      <P>After the budget 2003 changes, it is now estimated that some 29.77% of income earners will be liable to the higher rate of tax by the end of 2003. This small reduction arises from the budget increase in the age exemption limits.</P>
      <P>The budget estimate is based on historical Revenue data for the tax year 1999-2000 adjusted to take account of assumed growth in incomes and in the number of income earners to end 2003. The data refers to tax cases rather than individuals and includes both employees and the self-employed and those on other income, for example, pensioners. The data is subject to revision over time and the next revision to take account of actual data for the 2000-01 tax year is likely to be available during the second half of 2003.</P>

      <P>Does the Minister agree that the reason so many people are still paying tax at the top rate, despite this Government's promises in the run-up to the election, is due to the failure of this Minister to index tax credits and the tax system for inflation in the budget and the Finance <Col N="29" /> Bill 2003? Does he agree that the Government has repeatedly made commitments to the social partners and others to ensure that 80% of taxpayers pay tax at the standard rate, including a commitment in An Agreed Programme for Government and in the social partnership agreement? Does he agree that these commitments are meaningless until such time as he decides to index tax allowances and credits in relation to the standard rate tax band? </P>
      <P>I contrast the deal the ordinary taxpayer has received from this Minister in regard to paying tax to the favoured treatment members of the wealthy elite receive. Is the Minister aware that through the use of special tax avoidance mechanisms, many wealthy people, as statistics from the Revenue Commissioners show, pay little or no tax and that an extraordinarily low number of people declare incomes of over &euro;100,000?</P>

      <P>We had a similar debate on Committee Stage of the Finance Bill 2003. As the Deputy is aware, the changes we have made to the taxation system since we came into office in June 1997 have been immense and much appreciated by the ordinary taxpayer. The success of our tax programme has been such that recent OECD reports, which I am sure the Deputy has read and which have been commented on in the newspapers, show that Ireland has the lowest tax wedge of any OECD country. That has been the case for some time. One holds on to more of one's income&mdash;</P>

      <P>To all taxpayers. After deductions for tax and social insurance contributions, we have by far the most effective system. That has occurred since we came into power in June 1997. As a result of that and on a post-budget basis, approximately 680,000 people are outside the tax net. On a previous occasion, I gave the amount per week on which a single person paid tax when I became Minister for Finance and the amount per week at which single people now come into the tax bracket.</P>
      <P>Deputy Burton referred to the goal of 80% in regard to the standard rate. That was in the 1997 Fianna Fáil election manifesto, was carried over into the programme for Government and was worked into the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness when it was negotiated. It was not something which came out of the other social partnership process.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to ask the Minister about his ambitions for the tax system going forward. Is it his aim that this Government will reduce the proportion of people paying tax at the top rate <Col N="30" /> to 20%? Is that still the Government's ambition? Does he believe there will be further opportunities to reduce the rates of income tax, as has been the hallmark of his policy in recent years, or does he believe the recent collapse in income tax revenue signals the end of that strategy as a way forward and that we are now looking towards a different approach to income tax?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a completely different economic scenario now and this will continue for the next number of years. That being the case, the scope for massive tax reductions will not be the same as it was in the past five years. Following on from that, I do not envisage a situation in the immediate future where tax rates will reduce any further. However, it depends very much on economic conditions going forward. It is still the Government's goal that only 20% of people will pay at the top rate of tax but the main thrust of Government policy will be to endeavour to exempt those on the minimum wage and to remove them from the tax system altogether. The latter is the number one priority and other goals in the taxation area must come second to that.</P>
      <P>It is only fair to point out to the Deputy and the House, as I did in the run-up to the last budget, that the era of massive tax reductions is at an end. We should try to consolidate our position and keep our unemployment rate and tax rates at present levels. Unquestionably, the Government's proactive tax policy over the past number of years has contributed to our economic success.</P>

      <P>Tax receipts received by the Exchequer to the end of January 2003 totalled &euro;2,808 million, an increase of 10.3% on the &euro;2,545 million received in the same month in 2002. As regards the performance of the more significant tax heads, income tax receipts in January at &euro;712 million were 10.4% down on the &euro;795 million received in the same period last year. Corporation tax was down 5.5% on the same period last year. On the other hand, VAT was up 30.4% on last year's figures with receipts of &euro;1,507 million compared to &euro;1,156 million in January 2002. Excise duties also increased by 1.6% compared to January 2002.</P>
      <P>The January figures for any year are not necessarily a reliable indicator of a trend for the year as a whole. No reliable predictions can be based on one month's figures. For example, total tax receipts in January 2002 showed a fall of 5.7% on the same month in 2001, while receipts for 2002 as a whole were almost 5% higher than in 2001.</P>

      <P>I advert to income tax and corporation tax. The Minister rightly quoted the fig<Col N="31" /> ures in his reply. He published his expected profile for revenue under these taxes for the first time this year and significantly, the returns in January fell well short of what his officials predicted. What is his assessment of that finding? Does it indicate that the trend of collapse in income tax receipts, which has been a feature of the past two years and which has substantially been put down to factors such as the SSIAs and reductions in bonuses and overtime, is continuing? Has he over estimated income tax receipts again this year? Does he anticipate the need to take corrective measures?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy will appreciate, it is dangerous to extrapolate from one month's figures on the likely outturn of income or expenditure. We will have to wait for a number of months to elapse before a reliable estimate can be made as to what the position will be for the entire year. It would be foolish to make an estimate based on the first month. However, it is something we are keeping under review. If one had compared January 2002 to January 2001 one would have arrived at a totally false outturn for 2002.</P>
      <P>Income tax receipts have been disappointing for almost two years. Furthermore, corporation tax receipts for 2002 were less than had been anticipated and the Deputy will have noticed that the graph of tax receipts has been heading steadily downwards in the US and other European countries for a considerable time and they have been far below the expectations and tax profiles of those countries. The Deputy will appreciate that making an extrapolation from one month's figure is not a reliable method going forward. However, we will keep a close eye on tax receipts.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 119 and 120 together.</P>
      <P>I presume that Deputy Morgan's reference to plans for energy taxes relates to carbon energy taxes. As I said in my budget speech on 4 December 2002, Ireland has international obligations under the Kyoto Protocol to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. For this reason, the Government has asked the relevant Departments to advance the plans for a general carbon energy tax, with a view to introducing this from the end of 2004. Given the many implications of such a tax, both environmental and economic, there will be full consultations with interested parties on the design of the tax and a reasonable period is being allowed for its effective introduction.</P>
      <P>It would be inappropriate for me to speculate at this stage as to what specific taxation measures may or may not be introduced, or whether any revenue from carbon energy taxation would be used to reduce existing taxes or would be used to fund necessary public services. In developing any tax, a range of issues will need to be considered including the effect on those on low incomes. With regard to the issue of ring-fencing revenue from carbon energy taxation my general approach is that I am opposed to hypothecation, that is, the earmarking of certain tax revenues for certain expenditures. It removes flexibility in public expenditure decision-making, which should generally be on the basis of the most cost effective outcomes, and ties the Government's hands in deciding priorities as part of the budgetary process. Another weakness in the effectiveness of hypothecation as a means of allocating expenditure is that, while the required expenditure may match the likely income from a particular tax in a given year, this is unlikely to remain the case in the long-term and both figures may diverge.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I am unhappy with the Minister's response because he has given no signal as to his intentions. This is in sharp contrast to the Department of the Environment and Local Government, which has made its intentions clear. Does the Minister support the Department's proposal to increase basic fuel costs? For example, the cost of peat would increase by 28%, coal by 26%, gas by 17% and home heating oil by 19%. Is that an appropriate range of increases? Does the Minister agree there would be a great deal of suspicion and resentment among the public regarding new taxes if they do not add to the Minister's coffers but are used to reduce other taxes or introduce energy improving taxes? Does he accept this is a different circumstance in terms of the general principle he espouses because he would increase the cost of living in terms of critical fuels? Does he also agree there must a <i>quid pro quo</i> for people who will have to pay these new taxes, if he is to gain public support?</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad the Deputy tabled this question. I hope there will be wider debate <Col N="33" /> on this issue and I welcome his contribution. There are two big trains at different ends of the junction on this matter. Those who put forward pure environmental proposals want carbon energy taxation because the proposals will limit greenhouse gas emissions. The Deputy will be aware of the paper published by the Department of the Environment and Local Government, which very much favours carbon energy taxation.</P>
      <P>On the other hand, that will mean an increase in taxation, higher cost of living for individuals and higher costs for industry. The purpose of the environmental proposals is to limit greenhouse gas emissions but there is a price to be paid. This matter has been referred to in previous budgets and in the last budget I stated we hoped to introduce carbon taxes by the end of 2004 but before doing so all the issues would have to be discussed by an interdepartmental group working in this area.</P>
      <P>I welcome the debate because those who pursue carbon energy taxation neglect to tell the public there is a price to be paid. Deputy Boyle and the Green Party are advocates of such taxation but there is a price to be paid. There is also a view regarding whether such taxation will have the anticipated effect. I welcome the debate in this area and, before the Government makes a final decision, I hope it will take all the issues into account. It will not be an easy decision. If one advocated the position taken by Deputy Boyle and his colleagues, there would be significant energy taxation but if one is a realist, like me, one must ask what effect that will have on individuals and poor people and on industry in terms of escalating costs, which could possibly lead to job losses, unemployment and loss of Exchequer resources and the cycle we are trying to break? This is a major issue and I welcome the debate on it.</P>

      <P>To introduce carbon taxation, one has to be wedded to the principles of hypothecation. One has to be willing to increase social welfare appropriately to avoid fuel poverty. One has to be willing to reduce employer's PRSI and social insurance payments to reduce the cost to industry. It is all about <i>quid pro quo.</i>The Department of the Environment and Local Government has put out the strong statement that it believes the &ldquo;do nothing approach&rdquo; regarding our current level of carbon emissions will cost the State &euro;1.2 billion per year, annually, from to 2010. Does the Minister accept that as a valid figure and is it a price he is willing to let Ministers for Finance pay in future budgets?</P>

      <P>The answer to the Deputy's question is &ldquo;yes&rdquo; we will be fined if we do not <Col N="34" /> get our greenhouse gas emissions to the levels to which we signed up. That is not the same as saying carbon energy taxation alone will ensure we reduce our emissions to the appropriate level. That is what the great debate will be about.</P>
      <P>If I was to take the position from which Deputy Boyle and other colleagues on the environmental wing come I would have introduced carbon energy taxation a long time ago. Many issues need to be considered. The macro-economic position must also be considered in this regard. We have time to debate this issue and I welcome contributions from everybody.

      <P>Would the Minister not agree that if he continues to take his position of opposing any form of earmarking for the use of these funds, according to the Department of the Environment and Local Government's estimates the only impact on emissions will be in the region of 1.4%? That is a tiny impact. Would he not agree that if we are to achieve a change in attitudes and behaviour he will have to fund things such as improved efficiency in the home, changes in attitude towards public transport and improved behaviour regarding industrial processes? Would he agree that the key to achieving the Kyoto targets is behavioural change? Would he not agree that he must try to lead that change with sensible policies rather than collect the money and remain totally opposed to using it for anything other than general revenue purposes? Would he agree that that would lead to this proposal being stillborn in terms of genuinely changing the way things happen?</P>
      <P>Would the Minister not agree that, as Deputy Boyle said, the key to this is the use of money to support policies which can make change possible? The Minister must contribute positively to the debate rather than simply sit on his hands.</P>

Could the Minister say if he has given any thought to introducing such schemes to discourage the use of fossil fuels and, at the same time, make people more comfortable in their homes?</P>

      <P>That is a fact. Under existing law, that is precisely what can happen. I see the dangers of abuse of the law but that is how things currently stand. Any club or association in a particular category under existing law can obtain an extension to remain open until 2 a.m. The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform is answering concerns expressed at local level about opening hours. People in the tourism industry believe they should have flexibility on opening hours in the summer time. They say it is a total nonsense that they have to close at 11.30 p.m. on Sunday night during summer time. They have expressed the view that flexibility should be allowed in this regard. The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform has put out, for public discussion and debate, the suggestion that local authorities should be given the power to determine opening hours in their area. The tourism related issues in their local communities could then be taken into account. We must listen to what is being said by local authorities and others.</P>

    <P>Deputy Kenny asked for my view on this. That is how the law currently stands. That is how it operates at present.

The Minister, Deputy McDowell, has indicated that restrictions on those under 18 entering pubs after 7 p.m. or 8 p.m. may be considered as part of his efforts to tackle under age drinking.

The Taoiseach did not answer my question about whether he has a personal view on this matter. Is the Minister, Deputy McDowell, proposing to change the existing law of which we are all aware? Does the Taoiseach agree that there has <Col N="38" /> been a five-fold increase in violent crime, some of it unprovoked, on the streets of Dublin? Violent and unprovoked attacks, as well as the general abuse of alcohol, are not confined to Friday and Saturday nights. Does the Taoiseach have a personal view on this matter if he agrees with the remarks I have made and given the matter has been floated for public discussion? Is the Taoiseach satisfied that the resources available to the Garda, in terms of facilities and numbers of gardaí, are adequate for the enforcement of the existing laws? It is quite clear that they cannot do that at the moment. Will the Taoiseach give his personal view on local authorities being able to set different opening hours in respect of different areas? It is a matter of the gravest concern to communities and parents in particular.</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not a question of personal views, but of the existing law of the land and the proposals that may emanate from the Commission on Liquor Licensing. Many tourism bodies have pointed out that under certain legal arrangements, or certain interpretations of legal arrangements, people can get exemptions in certain areas but not in others. The system has worked in such a way for the past 14 or 15 years and possibly prior to the 1988 Act. The Minister receives requests from numerous interest groups as part of the debate on the liquor licensing laws &ndash; we are now on the third report &ndash; so perhaps it is no harm for local authorities and others to express their views.</P>

      <P>I welcome the agreement with the Irish Dental Association, which will protect PRSI patients and will result in a return to a full service. The dispute has gone on for some time. The Government's main policy is to keep people working and to give them the opportunity to be <Col N="40" /> in employment so they can improve their standard of living. We intend to keep taxes at low levels, 42% and 20%, and to keep additional charges to a minimum.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the dental association's agreement to display price lists, which has been a long-standing issue. Basic preventative dental treatment, including examination, will remain free. The Department of Social and Family Affairs will pay a 10% increase in its fees to dentists and, where relevant, dental treatment fees. The Minister has given many examples of the changes that will result from this agreement. PRSI patients earning under &euro;45,000 per annum will face an increase of 10% on all treatments other than fillings, which will be charged at a nominal rate. Negotiations to resolve this difficulty were under way for a long time and many people were unable to get any cover for dental treatment while they were ongoing. I do not accept Deputy Rabbitte's assertions in relation to price increases. While there have been some increases, there has been an attempt to keep to a minimum increases in areas that the Government can directly control. We have tried to spread price increases in a fair and equitable way.</P>

Not only will Duncan and Mary not be subject to wealth tax, but by the time the Taoiseach is finished, they will be eligible for family income supplement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>By an array of wealth taxes, increased charges and new levies and charges, the modest gain of &euro;95 per annum on budget day has now been eroded to the extent that the ordinary family is &euro;1,050 worse off, taking the Minister for Finance's example of one spouse working at &euro;40,000 per annum with two children. That is the reality of the wealth taxes and it is borne out by the EUROSTAT report. There has been excess<Col N="41" /> ive profit-taking in this economy, unchecked by anything the Government has done in recent years. That is the extent to which the ordinary family is worse off.</P>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I reiterate that as seen in the EUROSTAT, CSO and OECD figures, the ordinary family in Ireland is working and that there is lower unemployment than in other countries. There are good and funded services, with the State paying a substantial amount towards those. More money is put into the health services here than in many countries, perhaps with the exception of France.</P>
      <P>A range of State agencies have been involved in trying to control price and perhaps they could do more. I am on record as saying that there should be more regulation in this area and there are questions on that on the Order Paper. However, the statutory powers are in place to control that. It has been agreed with ICTU and IBEC that there will be a combined effort in areas where there has been excessive profit-taking and where unjustified price increases could be controlled. The figures which have come out in recent days, whether from EUROSTAT, the CSO or the OECD, show that the people of Ireland are working and that the less well off are treated more fairly than in other societies in the OECD.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent" hpid="Mr. Sargent Mr. Sargent">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach explained the need for adjustments or cutbacks in different areas such as health, education and housing. The Taoiseach has lost the plot with regard to the issue of climate change given that there has been an 82% increase in greenhouse gas in the past six years in the context of transport.</P>
      <P>Ireland has a 6:1 ratio of spending on roads as opposed to public transport. Is it time to go back to the 1998 national road needs study and look again at the National Roads Authority's plans to increase and develop national primary routes? The Government effectively threw out that study and proceeded with a cavalier programme involving 800 kilometres of new motorway which it is now known, since the NRA came before the Committee of Public Accounts, will not cost &euro;22 billion but an amount that is escalating daily in an out-of-control fashion.</P>
      <P>Given the cutbacks in various areas, which are hurting many sectors of society, is it time for an assessment of the wisdom of much of the expenditure on transportation, particularly the roads sector? There is capacity for 50,000 cars per day despite the NRA predicting only 12,000 in its needs study. Is there a need to assess this and when will that assessment be undertaken given that many people are being badly hurt by the cutbacks, particularly with regard to schools and housing? Will the Taoiseach consider this area because it is one which has not been cut back to the same extent?</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>There were decades in which it was not possible to improve public transport but transport infrastructure has greatly improved in recent years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent" hpid="Mr. Sargent Mr. Sargent">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
      <P>We are talking about roads, not public transport.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Roads are a part of transport. The Government has created for the first time an integrated Department of Transport to deal with these issues. A large amount of money was put into rail, something that had not been done for years. Work on the rail safety programme, which had lacked investment for close to 40 years, is almost complete with the servicing of the rail lines. Luas is within a year of completion and there has been huge investment in DART and rail carriages, with 100 coming on line recently. A huge amount of money has been put into Dublin transportation initiative studies on bus lanes and infrastructure.</P>
      <P>However, roads are also required. I accept that a lot of money &ndash;&euro;1.4 billion &ndash; is being spent on roads. Most people would contend that is not enough although it is relatively more than most countries would spend on transport. I have no difficulty with doing more with regard to rail lines. The comprehensive rail report is before the Minister and will be published shortly. It sets out what is required with regard to rail and the Government must deal with that. An enormous amount of money has been put in and the Government is committed to the rail programme.</P>
      <P>It is not a case of one thing competing with another. Ten years ago, it was thought the population would now be 3.6 million but it is over four million. Car ownership has increased dramatically. It is not correct to say that we do not need roads or that roads will be built at the expense of other infrastructure.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
      <P>I certainly did not get an answer. I am not denying that roads are needed but I thought the national roads needs study was what the Government was working from. When the Taoiseach says that he has no difficulty with rail, he is also saying that he has no difficulty with an imbalanced ratio of 6:1 between roads and rail. He is also saying that he has no difficulty with an 82% increase in greenhouse gases over the past six years. That is completely irresponsible and will land the country in far more hot water in <Col N="43" /> terms of international fines than the sums the Taoiseach mentioned. Those in the BMW region would contend that, in any case, much of that money is spent in the Dublin area and not their areas.</P>
      <P>Will the Taoiseach carry out an assessment? He talks about the sub-committee on infrastructure carrying out one assessment on roads and another on public transport. Will he put those assessments together so that an assessment can be made on the transport needs of the country?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>That is why an integrated Department of Transport was set up. All issues are being considered, not just regarding roads but also rail, aviation and other services that relate indirectly to transport such as haulage. I take the Deputy's point and he should take mine. The rail safety investment programme has been enormously successful. A number of stations have been upgraded, as have suburban rail and the DART, and there are 80 new diesel carriages.</P>
      <P>The Department of Transport, the NRA and the various agencies are considering what is required. The national development plan provides details on the infrastructure programme. The plant allocates almost &euro;3 billion to public transport.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent" hpid="Mr. Sargent Mr. Sargent">

    <P>
      <Col N="44" />Tom was a servant of the people, a man who was motivated not by what he could get out of politics but what he could do for it and, therefore, what he could do for Ireland and its people. In Tom O'Higgins's case that was a lot by any standards. As a Deputy, Tom served the people of Laoighis-Offaly and Dublin for 25 years, from 1948 until 1973. They were years of courage, vision and an unerring sense of what was right and the decent thing to do.</P>
    <P>As Minister for Health, he made a major contribution to health care by establishing the Voluntary Health Insurance group. He ran twice for the Presidency of Ireland, first in 1966, where he was narrowly defeated by Éamon de Valera by 10,000 votes, and later in 1973. The second attempt was remarkable in that he had probably the most devoted and youngest ever team of political campaigners as his children hit the streets telling people why they should vote for their dad. He had, of course, two eminent careers, parliamentary and judicial. His tenure as Chief Justice was characterised by his sense of honour that always marked him out and by the clarity of his judgments.</P>
    <P>However, it was as a devoted father and husband and later as a grandfather to 30 grandchildren that he was happiest and most fulfilled. With Tom O'Higgins, family came first. He came from an extraordinary family, a family of rare courage, vision and patriotism. The O'Higgins family is, and always will be, synonymous with the foundation of the State. The O'Higgins's never demurred in the face of great political and personal danger, even death itself. If Tom ever needed inspiration it must have come from his uncle, Kevin, who in turbulent times gave his life for Ireland at a young age. Tom and Terry named one of their sons after him.</P>
    <P>Today is a sad day for Dáil Éireann, the Judiciary and for us on this side of the House. We will miss Tom but we know that his great and gentle spirit will live on in the hearts of us all who were lucky enough to have known him. It is the saddest day of all for his wife, Terry, his seven children and his grandchildren, by whom he felt so blessed and of whom he was so proud. On behalf of the House, I offer them our deepest sympathy. He lived a full and healthy life and leaves behind a legacy of family and achievement of which, as Irish people, we can all be proud.</P>
    <P>As we say goodbye to the best of men, I know that Tom O'Higgins would not judge the success or the value of his life by what he was, who he was or what material possessions or status he held. He would judge all of it by his sincerity and his success as a husband, father and grandfather. In the words of the United States writer, Raymond Carver:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;And did you get what you wanted from this life, even so?&rdquo;&ldquo;I did&rdquo;. &ldquo;And what did you want?&rdquo;&ldquo;To call myself beloved, to feel myself beloved on the earth&rdquo;.</P>

      <P>On behalf of the Fianna Fáil Party and my own behalf, I extend my deepest sympathy to Deputy Kenny and the Fine Gael Party on the death of Tom O'Higgins. Mr. Justice O'Higgins was born in Cork in 1916 and was the son of a former Minister for Defence, Dr. Thomas F. O'Higgins and the nephew of Kevin O'Higgins, Minister for Home Affairs in the Free State Government, who was assassinated in 1927.</P>
      <P>Meeting him was always a pleasure because it was possible to reminisce about the foundation of the State and the history of the country. As a Fine Gael Deputy he represented the people of Laoighis-Offaly and Dublin from 1948 to 1973. He was very proud of his service as a member of Fine Gael and a Member of Dáil Éireann. He served as Minister for Health from 1954 to 1957 and we have all benefited from one of his major decisions, the establishment of the Voluntary Health Insurance group, which is as popular today as he could have hoped. It was established in difficult and traumatic economic circumstances.</P>
      <P>Tom O'Higgins was narrowly defeated for the Presidency in 1966 and was again unsuccessful in 1973. He was appointed a High Court judge at the end of 1973 and on 29 October 1974, he was elevated to the Supreme Court as Chief Justice, where he remained until January 1985. In 1984 he was nominated by the Government as a judge of the Court of Justice of the European Communities and remained in that post until 1991.</P>
      <P>Tom O'Higgins became known to a much wider public through his energetic presidential campaigns of 1966 and 1973. In 1966 he almost caused the biggest political upset in the history of the State when he came a close second to Éamon de Valera, something that would have been considered inconceivable at the commencement of that campaign. It was the first modern political campaign in the country because of the energy he put into it. It was effective and it took full advantage of addressing the concerns of the modern Irish State. To this day, he is remembered fondly because of the positive impact he made on people across Ireland at that time and later in his work on the Bench.</P>
      <P>He was closely associated with the Just Society agenda and his political contribution to public life was remarkable for its thoughtfulness. His speeches demonstrated a fine and open mind. His political heritage spans an unbroken contribution to political life in Ireland that predates his birth in 1916. That is no longer possible because the years have moved on. His passing is, in a symbolic sense, a turning of the page of Irish history from the 20th to the 21st century.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I did not know Tom O'Higgins well in the early years but in recent years I had the pleasure of getting to know him far better through his involvement on the Council of State. Like many who have given long service, in retirement he <Col N="46" /> demonstrated a sharp mind on the council, where, even at its most recent meetings, he was energetic and analytical in his approach and in the views and advice he imparted to the President.</P>
    <P>I join Deputy Kenny and Members of the House in extending our sympathy to his wife, Terry, his seven children and 30 grandchildren. I also extend the sympathies of the Fianna Fáil Party to his family. Ar dheis Dé go raibh a anam dílis.</P>

      <P>I am glad to have the opportunity, on my behalf and on that of the Labour Party, to associate ourselves with the words of tribute that have been paid to the memory of the late Mr. Justice Tom O'Higgins. He had a long and distinguished career as a public servant, both as a Minister of this House and as a leading member of the Judiciary. He was the proud bearer of one of the distinguished names in Irish political history and all who knew him agree that he brought added lustre to that name in this House and, subsequently, as Chief Justice, when he jealously and quite properly protected the independence of the Judiciary.</P>
      <P>On my behalf and on behalf of the Labour Party I offer condolences to his family and sympathy to the Fine Gael Party, whose interests he once represented in this House with distinction.</P>

As others have said, he served this country with great distinction, both as a member of the Judiciary and as a politician and Minister for Health. As Deputy Kenny acknowledged, he will be best remembered for establishing the VHI in the mid-1950s during his time as Minister for Health.</P>
      <P>Mr. Higgins came from a very distinguished political family, the foundations of which go back, as the Taoiseach and others have said, to the foundation of the State, through his father, the late Tom O'Higgins, and his uncle, the late Kevin O'Higgins.</P>
      <P>Like the Taoiseach, I had an opportunity of witnessing his sharp intellect as a member of the Council of State in recent years. Notwithstanding his years, he was very energetic and very capable. I extend my sympathy to his wife Terry, his seven children, his 30 grandchildren and to the Fine Gael Party.</P>

As a former Minister and former Chief Justice he will be highly regarded in the memories of many people, particularly people in Fine Gael. They will be duly proud of his work and the high standing that he had and will continue to have.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My early memories of him, particularly in 1973 when he was a candidate for President, have <Col N="47" /> more to do with the warmth of his smile than getting to know him in any other way. Even though he had an elevated status in society, was renowned and had enormous responsibility, he always came across as friendly and ready to listen to other people. He was never aloof and this is a quality that I will always associate with him.</P>
    <P>Others will remember him from having worked with him and will know him better. As a Minister, founder of the VHI and Chief Justice, there is no doubt that he follows a long line of people in his family who have distinguished themselves in politics. Ar dheis Dé go raibh a anam uasal.</P>

      <P>The first time I met Tom O'Higgins was in Court Square, Stradbally, on the first Sunday in June 1992. The occasion was the commemoration of the centenary of the birth of his uncle, Kevin O'Higgins, Minister for Justice in the first Irish Government.</P>
      <P>Tom O'Higgins, as a Deputy, Minister and judge, served this country with honesty, honour and conviction. All of us would do well to remember the words he spoke in the Mansion House in May 1996 at the Fine Gael Ard Fheis:</P>
      <P>The superficial prosperity of the last few years, instead of bringing benefit to those citizens who have least in the way of material comfort or even of bare necessities has merely left them further behind. Those who needed it least have benefited most.</P>
      <P>Mr. O'Higgins is remembered by many for his tremendous performance in the 1966 presidential election. He fought that election against all the odds and was within half a percent of pulling off what would have been a spectacular victory. This achievement showed everyone that no one party had an exclusive right to any public office and showed that the people were willing to vote for change. However, Tom O'Higgins's achievements and legacy are far greater than that. As other speakers have said, he will certainly be remembered always for setting up the voluntary health insurance scheme, which endures to this day. He was also one of the architects of the Fine Gael-Labour manifesto and election victory of 1973.</P>
      <P>Tom O'Higgins represented my constituency from 1948 to 1969 and he is still remembered fondly by the generations that he served. At meetings all over the constituency, particularly in his adopted home county of County Laois, I have heard his name greatly praised.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the present climate of political cynicism and the perceived disillusionment of many young people with politics, it is fitting that I, as someone newly elected to the House from the same con<Col N="48" /> stituency that Mr. O'Higgins represented for so long, should conclude my remarks by quoting his remarks made many times in the lead-up to the presidential election in 1966, ideas to which we should all dedicate ourselves in Dáil Éireann:</P>
    <P>I live for my country and her people. I have no claim on the Irish people. I go into office pledging myself, dedicating myself, under God's providence to work and to work hard to the last breath of my body for the benefit of my country.</P>
    <P>Certainly, Tom O'Higgins did that and we are grateful to him for it. On behalf of my family and the people of the Laois-Offaly constituency, I extend my sympathy to his wife Terry, his sons and daughters and his extended family.</P>

      <P>In respect of Nos. 12 to 15, inclusive, let me make the same case that I made last week &ndash; there needs to be a signing off procedure by the committees. It is only appropriate that a short synopsis of the report of a committee be made available to Members; in other words, one cannot have a report unless one attends at <Col N="50" /> the committee. It is not good enough that the Dáil refers matters to a committee which then deals with them and that there is no report to the Dáil.</P>
      <P>As we have been talking about the effects of alcohol, perhaps the Taoiseach will explain the vine and wine agreement 2001? There should be room for discussion at some stage of No. 18, a matter of concern for the farming community. Sufficient time has not been given to addressing their difficulties, although, apparently, the Taoiseach has succeeded in drawing them back into partnership talks.</P>

Despite the fact that they are very well staffed in terms of recording staff who look through a glass panel at each committee as members participate, we cannot get the Blacks for each of the committees in time before the presentation of motions to the House. There is no reason we cannot have them in the same way we have them for this House. If we can have them for the House, surely we can have them for the committees. We would then know what was said at each of the committees before we approve motions motions in the House.</P>

According to a report in <i>The Irish Times</i> last Friday, the sums involved increased from &euro;6 million in 2001 to &euro;32 million in 2002. There are very serious trends in society which we are not being given an opportunity to debate because they have been discussed by a committee but we have not received reports. We should look again at the way we nod such matters through and ensure a debate takes place in this House until such time as we can be properly informed by committees as to what happened and what is their recommendation. As we do not have this, we cannot agree to the proposal.</P>

Now that they have been returned, we are again asked to rubber stamp them without debate. I echo the point made by other colleagues that there is no flow of information in terms of the consideration <Col N="51" /> at committees. We have the very unacceptable situation that we do not have a record of committee debates available within a reasonable period of time, that is, the Blacks of the discussion, debate and deliberations, as we do in this Chamber. This throughflow of information from committees is not happening. That is one area that would have assisted in terms of highlighting the information around the discussion and Committee Stage appraisal of each of these proposals in turn. This should be taken on board. We have to find a better way of doing business than this constant rubber-stamping exercise which is patently flawed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social and Family Affairs (Mary Coughlan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I am pleased to bring the Social Welfare (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill 2003 before the House. This is the second of two Bills to implement the &euro;530 million social welfare package of budget 2003, which for the first time brings the projected level of social welfare expenditure in 2003 to over &euro;10 billion. Deputies will recall that a separate Bill was enacted in December last to give effect to the increases in weekly social welfare payments from the beginning of January. This Bill implements a number of key improvements in social welfare schemes such as increases in child benefit, improvements in the carer's respite care grant, and the extension of the payment of increases in respect of qualified children as announced in the budget, in addition to a range of other measures.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am proud to say that this Government continues its commitment to building an inclusive society as reiterated in the programme for Government in June 2002. Tangible evidence of delivering on this commitment includes: a massive increase in spending on social welfare from the equivalent of &euro;5.7 billion in 1997 to over &euro;10 billion this year; significant increases in child benefit rates resulting in the rates of payment being more than three times that payable in 1997 and real increases in social welfare pensions with old age contributory pensioners now receiving <Col N="61" />&euro;157.30 per week compared to the equivalent of &euro;99 in 1997.</P>
    <P>Child benefit is a universal payment made directly to families and as such it is the most efficient and effective way in which the Government can channel support to children. The rate for the first two children is being increased by &euro;8.00 per month and for the third and subsequent children by &euro;10.00 per month. These increases, provided under section 3 of the Bill, will bring the monthly rates to &euro;125.60 and &euro;157.30 respectively. From April next, a family with three children will receive &euro;408.50 compared to &euro;382.50 at present &ndash; an increase of &euro;26 per month. These increases will mean that, since the year 2000, child benefit rates will have risen by &euro;71.64 per month for each of the first two children and by &euro;86.20 per month for the third and subsequent children. These measures will mark the beginning of the final phase of the child benefit investment package initiated in budget 2001, which on completion, will see Government investment in the scheme rise by an additional &euro;1.27 billion. An estimated 530,000 families with over one million children will benefit from these increases in 2003.</P>
    <P>Furthermore, in supporting the ongoing programme of modernisation in the General Registrar Office and to improve service delivery to customers, section 11 of this Bill allows for certain awards of child benefit to be made in defined circumstances without recourse to a deciding officer. This provision will facilitate the automation of payments of child benefit for second and subsequent children where a claim is already in payment.</P>
    <P>This Government, over successive budgets, has introduced measures to develop the types of services and supports which provide practical assistance to this country's carers. In section 4 of this Bill, we are continuing to honour our commitment to supporting the valuable work undertaken by carers by increasing the respite care grant by &euro;100 from &euro;635 to &euro;735, with carers looking after more than one person receiving a grant of &euro;1,470 &ndash; an increase of &euro;200. These increases take effect from June next. This measure, which is highly valued by carers, will benefit 24,700 carers and will cost an additional &euro;2.5 million per annum.</P>
    <P>I am also introducing changes in the arrangements for entitlement to increases in respect of qualified children. Section 5 of the Bill provides that from September next, entitlement to an increase for a qualified child between the ages of 18 and 22 years and in full-time education is extended to recipients of certain short-term benefits. Specifically, these are disability benefit, injury benefit, health and safety benefit, unemployment benefit and assistance and supplementary welfare allowance, where the claimant has been in receipt of the relevant payment for more than 26 weeks. This measure, contained in the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness, implements the commitment to increasing the qualifying age limit to 22 years in line with the <Col N="62" /> current arrangements for long-term payments. This provision will benefit 1,100 recipients of qualified child increases at an estimated cost of &euro;600,000 in a full year.</P>
    <P>The Bill, at section 6, provides for the extension of the island allowance, currently &euro;12.70 per week, to pensioners over 66 years of age and in receipt of invalidity pension, disability allowance and unemployability supplement from April next.</P>
    <P>The six weeks after death payment arrangements are designed to provide transitional financial support immediately following the death of a pensioner. There are a number of anomalies within this scheme and section 7 of the Bill aims to address these.</P>
    <P>From June, where a person in receipt of disability benefit, unemployment benefit, invalidity pension, unemployment assistance, unemployability supplement, supplementary welfare allowance, pre-retirement allowance, disability allowance or farm assist dies, and his or her spouse is in receipt of certain benefits in his or her own right, the payment of the deceased person's benefit shall continue to be made for a period of six weeks after death.</P>
    <P>Section 8 provides for a number of changes in the means test for social assistance schemes. I am particularly pleased to be in a position to tackle one of the remaining outstanding recommendations of the report by the Commission on Social Welfare. I am referring to the inclusion of benefit and privilege in the assessment of means for unemployment assistance and pre-retirement allowance for claimants residing in the parental home. The commission recommended its abolition for persons aged over 25 and I have taken an initial step to achieving this by providing for the removal of this assessment for persons aged 29 and over. It is estimated that 1,300 persons will benefit from this provision at a cost of &euro;750,000.</P>
    <P>The section further provides for standardising the assessment of maintenance payments on the lines currently in place for one-parent family payment to other social assistance payments such as disability allowance, old age and widow's or widower's non-contributory pensions, unemployment assistance and farm assist. This section also provides for the assessment of certain non-cash benefits to be prescribed by regulations, in the case of persons claiming unemployment assistance, disability allowance, pre-retirement allowance, supplementary welfare allowance and farm assist.</P>
    <P>At present, orphans payments in respect of children in foster care are made by my Department directly to the relevant health board. The heath board then combines the orphans payment with the foster care allowance to make a total payment to the foster carer of &euro;281.50 in respect of a child under 12 years and &euro;308.50 in respect of a child aged 12 or over. A working group, which included officials from my Department and the Department of Health and Children, was established to examine payments to orphans and the foster care allowance. In line with the group's recommendations, section 9 of this Bill, in effect, <Col N="63" /> ensures that while foster carers will continue to receive the same level of payment, this payment will be made by one agency only, the relevant health board. Health boards will now have full financial responsibility for supporting children in foster care and orphan's contributory allowance and orphan's non-contributory pension shall no longer be payable to children in respect of whom foster care allowance is being paid. However, orphans payments will continue to be made by my Department where entitlement to such payments is established and where a foster care allowance is not in payment.</P>
    <P>In An Agreed Programme for Government we promised to modernise public services to make them more relevant to the citizen. We committed to improving access to public services by providing them electronically. Progressing the use of the personal public service, PPS, number as a public service identifier is a key element of e-government. Section 10 provides for five new agencies to be added to the list of specified bodies that are authorised by legislation to use the PPS number. The section further allows for including in this listing bodies established by the Minister for Education and Science under section 54 of the Education Act 1998, and provides for the sharing of information with an t-Údarás um Árd-Oideachas, the Higher Education Authority. I believe this measure will lead to improved administrative efficiency and effectiveness across public service agencies. It will help reduce bureaucracy and continue the process of eliminating red tape.</P>
    <P>Sections 13 to 15 of the Bill provide for amending the rules governing entitlement to supplementary welfare allowance basic payments and rent supplements. Section 13 provides that where new claims for rent supplement are submitted after the proposal comes into force, a supplement will only be payable where the claimant is lawfully in the State. This measure is being introduced for consistency. It removes the anomaly whereby a person could be in breach of his or her obligations to the State's immigration service while at the same time having his or her housing costs subsidised by the community welfare service. This provision also provides that following its enactment, where new claims for rent supplement are submitted by asylum seekers, a supplement will only be payable if the claimant is granted either refugee status or leave to remain in the State on humanitarian grounds by the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform. This measure is being implemented following discussions with the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform and the Office of the Attorney General.</P>
    <P>The Government is committed to ensuring that the needs of asylum seekers are fully addressed in an appropriate manner and has therefore decided that the accommodation needs of asylum seekers will, in future, be met exclusively through the system of direct provision operated by the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform. The direct provision system has been in place for <Col N="64" /> three years and the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, operating through its Reception and Integration Agency, has built up considerable experience and expertise over that period. In addition, the backlog of claims for asylum that had built up over the years has now been reduced to much more manageable levels. Consequently, a person arriving in Ireland to claim asylum can now expect to have his or her case decided in a matter of a few months. Given that the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform now has a full range of suitable accommodation available to it to meet the needs of asylum seekers and that individuals are now spending much less time in the asylum process before their claim for asylum is finalised, it is no longer necessary for asylum seekers to have access to rent supplement.</P>
    <P>Section 14 amends the conditions for receipt of supplementary welfare allowance in certain cases to align them with the entitlement conditions that apply to unemployment assistance. Under current legislation, a health board may require an applicant for supplementary welfare allowance to register for employment by signing on for unemployment assistance. The purpose of this provision is to require a person in those circumstances to actually seek work while receiving supplementary welfare allowance pending finalisation of his or her claim for unemployment assistance.</P>
    <P>The proposal gives health boards the power to require a person to comply with the same conditions of being capable of work, available for employment and genuinely seeking employment that apply to persons in receipt of unemployment assistance. These are discretionary conditions which will be applied on a selective basis where a health board considers that the circumstances of a particular case so warrant. The only people who will be affected by this provision are those for whom either unemployment assistance or unemployment benefit is the appropriate social welfare payment but who may have intended to claim supplementary welfare allowance indefinitely as an alternative to complying with the terms for receipt of unemployment assistance or unemployment benefit.</P>
    <P>Legislation currently provides that three categories of people are excluded from entitlement to supplementary welfare allowance, namely, those in full-time employment or in full-time education, or engaged in an industrial dispute. However, health boards always had discretion to pay supplementary welfare allowance in urgent cases even though the applicant may be in one of these excluded categories. It is very rare for payments to be made in these circumstances but nevertheless, it is important that health boards are in a position to deal appropriately with such eventualities.</P>
    <P>Section 15 of the Bill provides health boards with the same discretion to pay in urgent cases in relation to claims for rent supplement from asylum seekers and from people who are not lawfully <Col N="65" /> in the State. This is being done to ensure consistency with the existing provisions in relation to other excluded categories, thus ensuring that, should circumstances arise which in the opinion of the health board are so urgent in nature that rent supplement should be paid, a health board is not prevented from paying rent supplement by virtue of the restrictions imposed by section 13 of the Bill.</P>
    <P>I emphasise that this section does not provide for exceptions that could result in payments being made in any individual case on an ongoing basis. It merely provides discretion to respond in an urgent case that will not remain urgent over time. As with the existing provisions, I expect that very few, if any, payments will be made under this provision.</P>
    <P>The operation of the Social Insurance Fund is an important expression of social solidarity within our society. The fund represents the collective contributions of employers, employees and the self-employed to provide for pensions, in addition to short-term income support needs when contingencies such as unemployment and illness arise.</P>
    <P>Budget 2003 proposed that PRSI should be applied to benefits-in-kind granted to employees with effect from 1 January 2004. This provision is important in enhancing the overall equity as well as improving the coherence between the PAYE and the PRSI systems. Sections 16 to 20 are designed to facilitate the assessment of such non-cash remuneration in relation to PRSI and the health and training levies.</P>
    <P>Section 23 provides for changes to the Pensions Act 1990. These are designed to make some technical amendments consequential on the implementation of the Pensions (Amendment) Act 2002, and to replace the broad powers vested in the Pensions Board under the existing Pensions Act, with more specific powers. These will establish clear policies and principles which the board will use to respond to the current pension funding challenges facing defined benefit occupational pension schemes in the current investment climate of declining asset values, and to give flexibility to pension scheme trustees in relation to submission dates for actuarial funding certificates.</P>
    <P>Following discussions involving the Pensions Board and the social partners, and consideration within my Department, the consensus reached is that the current decline in the equities market warrants a somewhat flexible approach to the funding requirements of the Pensions Act. The precise details of this approach are a matter for the Pensions Board, which is the statutory regulator.</P>
    <P>I understand that, on a case-by-case basis and in certain circumstances, the funding requirement will be set at 85% compared to 100% at present, and the funding proposal can refer to a period of up to ten years rather than 3.5 years at present. The board must consider that these modifications are necessary, are related to the performance of investment markets and are not contrary to <Col N="66" /> members' interests. The adoption of such an approach is intended to give trustees of pension schemes and sponsoring employers financial breathing space in relation to the funding of defined benefit occupational pension schemes. The long-term position on funding is currently being examined by the Pensions Board and I look forward to receiving its report in this regard shortly.</P>
    <P>In relation to the submission dates for actuarial funding certificates, on occasion, the trustees of the scheme may not be in a position to meet the statutory deadline. This can occur where the actuary to the scheme is ill, has been replaced or other administrative difficulties have arisen outside the control of the trustees. In such circumstances, and where it would not be contrary to members' interests, it is considered reasonable to allow some flexibility where the Pensions Board is satisfied of the bona fides of the situation and section 23 allows for this.</P>
    <P>I take this opportunity to signal to the House that I may bring forward an amendment to this Bill, either on Committee Stage or on Report Stage, to facilitate anti-churning provisions in relation to personal retirement savings accounts. While the precise details of the requirements are still being discussed at official level, these would be to the benefit of consumers and to protect people from being enticed out of one perfectly good pension product into another. The proposal would facilitate taking powers to make relevant regulations and I will inform the House of my specific intention in this regard on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>As the Taoiseach indicated to the House earlier, the Irish Dental Association has accepted an agreement that will protect PRSI patients resulting in the return to a full choice of participating dentists. The settlement terms mean that the integrity of the dental treatment scheme has been fully protected for PRSI patients. I have rejected efforts that would have undermined the dental treatment scheme and led to the introduction of unrestricted fees for the full range of treatment.</P>
    <P>My Department will pay a 10% increase in its fees to dentists and dental treatment fees, where relevant, will increase by 10% for PRSI patients. This takes effect from the date of this agreement and includes the increases due for last year and for this year. This arrangement applies to all existing procedures except fillings. The prices of a filling to the PRSI patient will be the dentist's normal private fee less a 15% discount negotiated by me and an increased contribution from my Department of &euro;29.20.</P>
    <P>In particular, I welcome the agreement of the association to display a price list of dental treatments, setting out the private patient fee and the PRSI patient fee, thus allowing for greater transparency. An extraction will now cost the patient a standard fee of &euro;11.75, up from &euro;10.67. Basic services which were provided free, including oral <Col N="67" /> examination, scale and polish continue to remain free under this agreement.</P>
    <P>An early review of the dental scheme will be undertaken with an independent chairperson. Should the review result in recommendations with financial implications such recommendations will not take effect until July 2004.</P>
    <P>This Social Welfare Bill builds on the progress made in the social inclusion area by this Government. It is based on objectives contained in the programme for government and the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness and reflects the principles of the revised national anti-poverty strategy.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ring</NameTxt>
      <P>I am appalled to learn that the Minister has sold out the PRSI workers. A 10% increase for dentists means they are the real winners in this dispute. I am disappointed that the Government has done nothing for those people who have paid their PRSI contribution and have brought vouched receipts to the Minister and to her Department for work done by dentists in the last year. The Minister has done nothing to deal with this problem.</P>
      <P>From a number of letters I have received from people in Cork, Dublin and elsewhere I am aware that a group of people are planning to challenge the Government's action in the courts on the basis that they have made their PRSI contributions while the State has not honoured its commitment to them. If these people or their employers failed to make PRSI contributions they would be prosecuted, yet the State has not honoured its side of the contract.</P>
      <P>I am appalled by this deal. This has been a bad day for PRSI workers, for the Government and for the country. The only people who are smiling this evening &ndash; and it is appropriate that they deal with teeth &ndash; are the dentists. They are the real winners.</P>
      <P>I have tabled a parliamentary question on this matter for tomorrow. I do not have the details of the agreement. It seems to have been a secret deal. I listened to the Minister and to representatives of the dentists in the media in recent days but all the spin doctors in the Minister's Department did not seem to want to spin this story out. For the first time in my experience the media did not get hold of the details of the deal done between the Minister and the Irish Dental Association. We now know that the people have been sold out.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When the House debated the Social Welfare Bill 2002, the Minister described it as a reflection of the Government's priority to protect the living standards of those in receipt of social welfare pay<Col N="68" /> ments at a time when difficult decisions had to be made with regard to the public finances.</P>
    <P>The Conference of Religious in Ireland has already stated that the budget was unfair, unjust and unacceptable. The budget increases of between &euro;6 and &euro;11 for social welfare recipients have proved to be totally inadequate, in view of the rising cost of living. Inflation has wiped out the increases. ESB charges are up by 10%, on average. The costs of making a cup of tea for a child leaving for school in the morning, of heating a hot water bottle for an old age pensioner and of providing a hot meal are up. Value added tax increases mean that every service and service call will cost more but those on fixed incomes will not have the facility to pay extra and will have to do with less. How have living standards been protected when the VAT increases have wiped away any benefit that could have been had from the social welfare increases, even before they are paid? Increases have also occurred in motor tax and the television licence fee. Council rents and refuse charges will increase.</P>
    <P>A lady came to see me the other day who had received an increase of &euro;8. The council took &euro;6. Now the council has increased refuse charges by 41%. How are these people to live? From 1 April the cost of gas will rise by 9.1% and this will affect more than 400,000 people. Even people who do not have access to the natural gas grid will not escape the price rises. Due to the continuing uncertainty in the world markets the cost of home heating oil and petrol is likely to rise again soon and in some cases the cost of diesel and petrol has increased in the past week.</P>
    <P>This year's budget increases in weekly social welfare payments fail to meet the levels required for the Government to properly honour its commitments. The increases in weekly payments to pensioners and those receiving the lowest social welfare payment rates are way below the level needed to make progress towards the targets set out in the national anti-poverty strategy and in the Government's programme. For the commitments to be implemented the rate of old age pension should have increased by &euro;13.20 per week whereas the budget fell short by &euro;3.20 per week. The average weekly increase in the lowest rate of welfare payments should have been between &euro;10 and &euro;15.40, depending on the criteria used. If the Government was serious about meeting its targets and commitments the increase was barely in line with inflation. This is proof positive that the Government has no intention of meeting its targets, living up to its promises or protecting the living standards of those on social welfare.</P>
    <P>The measly increase in the carer's allowance and the marginal easing of the income disregard for carers shows that the Government takes them for granted. Despite the lofty Government claims of increased budgets for carer's allowance and home help support it is clear when the downturn starts to bite, those least equipped to cope are the first to feel the pain. There are 20,500 people in receipt of carer's allowance but it is estimated <Col N="69" /> that 131,000 people provide some level of unpaid care every day. That means that the Government's policy excludes over 100,000 people from any financial recognition of its assistance to those who need full-time care. It is the elderly, the sick and children who suffer. Without support there will eventually be fewer carers, not because they no longer wish to care but because they will be unable to do so. Ultimately the burden of care will fall on the already over-stretched health services.</P>
    <P>There is no recognition of the additional cost of care and disability. The annual respite care grant is inadequate and respite service availability is patchy to say the least. The Government needs to look again at the practice of denying carers any carer's allowance just because they are in receipt of another social welfare payment. It is unjust and unfair. When a widow is providing full-time care to a person with special needs, the least she should get in recognition of this care is the respite care grant. That does not happen and it is wrong. I have a case where a widow is looking after somebody on a full-time basis. Due to the fact that she is in receipt of one social welfare payment she does not get the respite grant. That issue should be dealt with on Committee Stage. There should be a nominal payment of &euro;50 to &euro;60 per week for the care such people provide and as a recognition of the service provided to the State. These people will have to be looked after.</P>
    <P>People with disabilities still have not achieved anything like an adequate home income, despite the fact that according to the Combat Poverty Agency, seven out of ten people with a disability are unemployed. It is unacceptable in this day and age for the ESRI to find that 72% of households headed by a person with a disability live below the poverty line. I do not like what that says about our country, our priorities and about the kind of Ireland we have become.</P>
    <P>A major survey by the Society of St. Vincent de Paul announced at the weekend showed clearly that the Government has fallen far short of its targets to end child poverty. According to the Society of St. Vincent de Paul, thousands of children are going to school hungry, many families are suffering hardship in trying to buy uniforms, shoes and schoolbooks. An obvious way to prevent child poverty and raise the standard of living for all children would be to increase child benefit to the level promised by this Government in its fantasy document &ndash; the Fianna Fáil and PD manifesto &ndash; which helped to buy the election.</P>

      <P>The Society of St. Vincent de Paul estimates that the average cost of sending a child to school can be up to &euro;1,000. For people on fixed or low incomes, who do not have &euro;1 to spare, the task is impossible.</P>
      <P>The following are the facts: child poverty in Ireland ranks sixth highest on a list of 23 OECD countries &ndash; as cited by the Bernardos report Parents Under Pressure, 2002; the report also highlighted the fact that 29% of lone parents and 19% of two-parent households are living in poverty, yet the estimated no-frills cost of raising a child to the age of five at about &euro;35,000; the Children's Rights Alliance described budget 2003 as, &ldquo;a series of broken promises to children, particularly those children living in poverty&rdquo;; the increase in child benefit in 2003 of a derisory &euro;8 &ndash; if divided over five weeks it is barely &euro;1.50 per week &ndash;&euro;10 for the third and subsequent child. This is not right and the Minister as a parent knows that. That was another broken promise by the Fianna Fáil-Progressive Democrats Government.</P>
      <P>The biggest disgrace in the budget this year was that there was no increase in the child dependent allowance. Groups who work with lower income families had sought a minimum rate of &euro;25 per child per week but there was no increase. If one wants to target child poverty the money should be given to mothers. All reports have proven that when mothers get the money for children they spend it on children and look after them and it helps to deal with child poverty.</P>
      <P>I wish to compliment the Minister in regard to the increases for children in full-time education up to 22 years of age. I am delighted the Minister took my suggestion on board, having lobbied for it for many years. I am pleased the Minister and her officials took it on board and I compliment her on it. I welcome it. It is something I wanted and supported and for which I worked in recent years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The other issue on which I compliment the Minister, even though it was mean and measly, is the allowance for islanders. The Minister is right in saying there should be a special allowance for islanders. It should be for all islanders and not only those over 66 years of age. I welcome it, small and measly as it is. I had the experience of working with islanders many years ago. They pay more for bread and butter than those on the mainland, simply because they have to pay to get out to the mainland, and have to pay to get their goods into the islands. I support that allowance and would support more for the islanders because <Col N="71" /> they are finding it difficult enough to live and should be helped and supported to stay on the islands.</P>
    <P>I shall deal with the Bill, section by section, on Committee Stage and will table amendments on a number of issues. I wish to signal one section of the Bill where I have a major difficulty. Sections 16, 17 and 18 give effect to the proposal in budget 2003 for the application of PRSI to all benefits-in-kind granted to employees. This means that all benefits-in-kind are now subject to tax, PRSI, training and health levies and employers PRSI. What happens when the benefit-in-kind is desirable, such as the payment of health insurance premiums by an employer? Surely this is a desirable benefit &ndash; at least we pay tax relief to people who pay their own health insurance premiums. Making employers pay PRSI on the cost of health insurance to their employees is an additional cost to industry. It will mean that employers will be less likely to assist their employees with health insurance. It is also another loss of competitiveness and another hidden tax. The Minister needs to look at this again. This is a matter on which I will be tabling an amendment on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>Only about 35% of those who are entitled to family income supplement actually claim it. Many on low incomes clearly do not wish to claim FIS because they see it as a social assistance and not an entitlement. The Government's policy of leaving family income supplement as a responsibility of the Department of Social and Family Affairs is depriving low income families of a much-needed boost to their budget.</P>
    <P>Fine Gael renews its call that family income supplement should be paid for through the tax system. This small but important change would mean that everyone entitled to FIS would get the money automatically and would not have to apply for it. It is dreadful that up to 65% of those who would qualify are excluded at present. This simple change would do much to ease the difficulties of people on modest incomes.</P>
    <P>There is one other administrative change to FIS which could be made. If a person on FIS has a salary increase during the year in which they claim, his or her FIS is not reduced. If a person suffers a decrease in salary he or she cannot apply for FIS. These are people who are not well off and are on low incomes. If something goes wrong during the year they cannot apply to the Minister's Department for it. That is an anomaly that should be looked at and dealt with on Committee Stage. It is unfair that people on already low incomes are further penalised by being deprived of support in times of crisis.</P>
    <P>The Government is famous for talking out of both sides of its mouth. One arm does not seem to know nor care what the other arm is doing. The Minister, Deputy Brennan, is hitting the headlines every day in regard to the roads, rail, Luas, motorways, metro, taxis and buses. If we <Col N="72" /> were to believe all the publicity &ndash; by God is he good at the publicity &ndash; about the choices in the west of Ireland and other regions throughout the country, there would be so much competition in the transport sector that it would be difficult to stay at home. That is all very well, but what happens if one is entitled to free travel but there is no CIE service in the area? This is something the Minister must consider. Something must be done to allow people use taxis, particularly in rural areas. There is no Luas and little public transport in rural Ireland. People depend on taxis and it is time the Department entered the new millennium and considered this aspect. Many people have free travel but it is of no benefit because they cannot use it.</P>
    <P>On the national fuel scheme, I cannot understand why it is not in place 52 weeks a year. Fuel prices are increasing daily and people find it difficult to keep themselves warm. All the reports indicate that elderly people like to keep warm in their homes. This provision would not cost a fortune. I will be calling on Committee Stage for the provision to be extended. People are lucky in this country if they do not have to light a fire on five or six days a year. I ask the Minister to consider this aspect.</P>
    <P>The rent subsidy will cause all public representatives a problem, and there are already serious problems in this regard. Letters and appeals are arriving every day because people are beginning to feel the pinch of the Minister's regulations. She must consider this aspect because it will cause much hardship. People will feel the squeeze. Social welfare officers are a bit concerned because they are having great difficulty administering the scheme proposed by the Minister and her Department. I ask her to reconsider the regulation and it is something Deputy Penrose and I, and other Members, will be raising in the coming weeks. It is causing a major problem. The Minister may have the best of intentions in regard to not allowing asylum seekers collect rent subsidies and to go to one of the approved detention centres. However, we must wait to see how the provision works. I am totally opposed to rent subsidies.</P>
    <P>The Department of the Environment and Local Government should put in place adequate social housing. However, the Minister and her Department must recognise that there is a major housing crisis and problems in regard to prices in different areas throughout the country, including the Minister's home county, Donegal, and in Mayo. It is impossible to get accommodation in Dublin or in the west of Ireland during the summer months. If one wants to live in these areas one must pay the going rate. I oppose the changes the Minister made. It is causing great hardship and there will be a backlash.</P>
    <P>I welcome the increase of &euro;30 in the back to school footwear and clothing allowance for children over 12 years of age. However, what about children under the age of 12? Given the Minister's experience buying children's shoes, she will <Col N="73" /> be aware that children under the age of 12 cost just as much, therefore, she must extend the allowance to them.</P>
    <P>The next issue is something about which the Minister can do something. I am appalled that the Department has spent more than &euro;19.6 million in the past two years on consultants. That money could be better spent on people in need rather than on the friends of Fianna Fáil and consultants.  This country is full of reports. What we now need is action on the reports and money to implement them, instead of making money for consultants and the friends of Fianna Fáil.</P>

      <P>Last year, the Minister, Deputy McCreevy, made a smash and grab raid on the social insurance fund, to which the Minister referred in her speech. He decided to make free with her money and mine to pay for his champagne Charlie lifestyle. The party had to go on. In this case the two parties &ndash; Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats &ndash; had to go on. Nothing was too good for them, not even the money invested to look after the future needs of our children, the elderly, people with disabilities, the sick and people on low incomes. That money is not some slush for Fianna Fáil, the Progressive Democrats or for Ministers. The money is for the future of the people of this country. The Minister should never again allow the Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, to touch that fund. An independent board should be set up to oversee the social insurance fund. It should be representative of the social partners and should bring forward policies to efficiently manage the fund in order to stop the Minister, Deputy McCreevy, from playing fast and loose with the family silver. He should never again be allowed to do that.</P>
      <P>On the PPS number being provided to other agencies &ndash; by God did we pay for that bit of information that had to be handed around the country &ndash; while I do not have a problem with it, there are dangers involved because people have a right to privacy. What people receive from social welfare should be a private matter. I am worried about other agencies being allowed to tap into the social welfare network and finding out what people are receiving. I do not have a great problem in regard to social welfare, grants and so on, but I am worried in regard to other aspects and I hope the practice will not continue.</P>
      <P>I welcome the transfer of the orphan and foster care allowance from the Department of Social and Family Affairs to the health boards. People involved in the care of orphans who deal with social workers and the health boards are concerned that the Department of Social and Family Affairs would take that into account and they would lose their social welfare payments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister in the Bill has failed the weak in society, the poor, those who need her most, the people who are now feeling the pinch of the <Col N="74" /> increases in charges on a daily basis. The Minister and the Government will have to call a halt to county councils in particular in regard to charges, particularly to people on social welfare. They have gone mad, together with the Government. They seem to think they can charge and do what they want. There is a feeling among the public that this House and, in particular, the Government, have become arrogant and mean and gone against the poor, and that the Government can do what it wants because it has a majority of 15 or 16.</P>
    <P>In 1977, there was another Taoiseach in this House, who sat where the Minister is now sitting and had a majority of 21 seats, but that was the last majority of 21 he had. The people of this country are waiting because they do not like the fact that the weak, the poor, the sick and the under-privileged are being attacked daily. In recent years people were just beginning to manage. They felt things were turning around for them, some were getting a bit of employment in their home areas and some were coming off social welfare payments. However, as soon as there was a downturn in the economy, the first thing the Government targeted was the FÁS schemes under which people were trying to get training to get back into the workplace, and the Minister targeted the back to work scheme. It is wrong to target that scheme because it was used to retrain people who have lost their jobs and who want to get back into the workplace. People are getting angry because they are feeling the pinch. They think the Government does not care about them, which is correct.</P>
    <P>My party and I, and Deputy Penrose, will be putting pressure on the Minister and the Government to ensure the under-privileged are looked after. These people must not be forgotten because there is a downturn in the economy. People do not mind paying a few extra euro tax if the weak and sick in society, including carers who are looking after elderly people at home, are rewarded. I refer to the subvention and to nursing homes. There are not enough places, yet there are people who are saving the State a fortune by keeping family members at home and who want to do so. They are not asking the State for any real help but for a bit of support. They would like more respite care and some recognition for the work they do. Many sons and daughters will not have a night out, or a day out, this weekend or any other weekend because they will be looking after their loved ones 24 hours a day. Due to the fact that they have a few acres of land, a few cows or a small business, they get no recognition. It is time we rewarded and looked after these people who are looking after their loved ones.</P>
    <P>I will oppose this Bill on the basis of the increases in social welfare. There used to be a budget every year but now there is a budget every hour, on the hour. People are waiting in the long grass for the Minister and her colleagues. I am sorry the Minister has found herself in this Department at this time. I suppose I should have <Col N="75" /> known when I saw the former Minister, Deputy Dermot Ahern, running out of that Department last year. He was glad to get out of it. He knew what was coming and by God did he run fast. We will go through the Bill on Committee Stage when I will table a number of amendments which I hope the Minister will find acceptable. I hope she will look after the people who need to be looked after.</P>
    <P>I refer to the famous horse, Rock of Gibraltar, and to the famous man, Alex Ferguson, who does not pay a penny tax in this country. His horse will go out to stud and he will earn thousands of pounds but he will not have to pay a penny to this State, yet poor creatures will be crucified by county councils as a result of refuse charges and service charges. I ask the Minister to speak to the councils, although she will say she does not have the authority to do so. It is wrong that someone should get a social welfare increase of &euro;8 only to find the county council taking &euro;5, &euro;6 or, in some cases, &euro;7.</P>

I suppose it is the old slogan from Fianna Fáil &ndash; a lot done and more people to be done.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Penrose</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad to get the opportunity to contribute to the Social Welfare (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill 2003. The genesis of the Bill can be found in the December budget speech of the Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, that great right-wing accountant and economist. Last December's budget has been roundly and justifiably condemned by many people and organisations. People who are independent and who have no political allegiance have focused on the budget, particularly its social welfare provisions. Organisations throughout the country have been vocal on its inequitable and unjust provisions, particularly since they affect the poorest people in our society.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I said during a contribution on the budget in December, the unemployed, the underprivileged and the socially excluded &ndash; our fellow citizens who are most in need of and deserve social support &ndash; have been let down. When the Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, was in Opposition in 1997, he criticised Deputy Quinn's last budget. He said that when cutbacks in Government spending are necessary, it is always the poorest who suffer most. The Minister for Finance has amply demonstrated in this budget his belief in, and perhaps commitment to, that principle in that when he is in a corner rather than <Col N="76" /> look to increase the taxes of his friends, many of whom are developers, are in the building industry and so on, he decides to cut off the poorest.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Social and Family Affairs, in introducing the social welfare provisions of the budget in this Bill, has spelled out the extent of the injustice being inflicted by this Government on the weaker and disadvantaged section of this society. Deputy Ring is right in that the Minister, Deputy Coughlan, is a genuine person but she is responsible for putting this through. The former Minister, Deputy Dermot Ahern, always liked to be the good news guru. He ran to the plinth with everything and was always casting back to five or six years ago and trying to compare the situation. We are dealing with history now. The working class, the poor, the underprivileged, the marginalised and socially excluded want answers from a Government which has squandered this country's wealth. These people have not benefited to the same extent as many others. Various OECD studies indicate that is exactly what has happened. These studies do not lie because they are independent. We take heed of those studies.</P>
    <P>The Department of Social and Family Affairs has an obligation to ensure that payments, which are necessary for people to survive, are adequate. It is up to the Minister to fight her case in Cabinet. In that respect, I would say she has failed. She told us that the Bill provides for the introduction of a range of social welfare improvements announced in budget 2003, that it provides for an increase in child benefit and improvements in the respite care grant, that it extends child dependants allowance for certain children, recipients of short-term social welfare payments and that it provides for changes in the means test for certain social assistance schemes, which I welcome.</P>
    <P>As Deputy Ring said, the Bill provides for changes to the PRSI system by giving effect to the budget measures for the application of PRSI contributions and health and employment training levies to benefits-in-kind. That will be very tricky. I intend to table amendments on Committee Stage in this regard.</P>
    <P>Before I deal with a number of critical points and the reason the Labour Party will strenuously oppose this Bill, I wish to say I welcome the extension of the entitlement to an increase for a qualified child aged between 18 and 22 years of age and in full-time education. I salute the Minister in that regard. I am particularly pleased that the recipients of disability benefit, injury benefit, health and safety benefit, supplementary welfare allowance and unemployment benefit and assistance will, subject to certain conditions, have these payments continued. Prior to this, it was very unsatisfactory that the increase for the qualified child ceased at 18 years of age. In some cases, these families were forced to claim supplementary welfare allowance. Previous rates were very unsatisfactory and I am pleased that section 5 of the Bill addresses this issue.</P>
    <P>It is important to set out the reality of the increases provided in the budget. The Bill does <Col N="77" /> not take into account, or refer to, other decisions &ndash; referred to by Deputy Ring as a budget every hour, on the hour &ndash; announced as part of subsequent budgets and which, with the stroke of a pen, wiped out all the increases for the thousands of recipients of social welfare payments which they should have received. Deputy Ring is right in regard to local authorities. The differential rent scheme operated since January, yet some of those increases do not come into effect until April and later. The local authorities are anticipating increases and are taking money from people. That reduces the disposable income of people who are virtually on fixed incomes. It is having a major negative impact given the many increases announced in recent months which those people must bear.</P>
    <P>I refer to the subsequent, or contemporaneous, decision to increase the minimum contribution a person must make towards his or her rent or mortgage interest from &euro;7.62 to &euro;12. This is a fairly significant increase. The Minister said it is based on 10% of the social welfare payment and one can see from where she is coming. However, it is a staggering increase in the minimum contribution of almost 60% and is forcing the average family or individual to meet an increase of &euro;4.38 at a time when the average increase in social welfare for single people amounts to approximately &euro;6.80. The Minister, therefore, is clawing back about two thirds of the average increase.</P>
    <P>The people to whom I refer receive mortgage subsidies and rent allowance and number approximately 100,000. The Department's abdication of its own rules in terms of natural and constitutional justice leaves something to be desired because despite the fact that this significant increase was to apply to all social welfare recipients, neither the Minister nor the people involved had the courtesy to apply those rules and notify the recipients in advance of the proposed change. The regional health boards were only notified on 31 December 2002, the very day the changes were to take effect. As a result, arrears will accrue if the regulation is implemented to the letter and customers of the Department will have to refund overpayments. I call on the Minister to give an assurance that arrears, which have accrued because of non-implementation by the health boards of the circular, will not be collected by her Department and that current recipients will not be pursued for them. That would cause an explosion because we are almost three months down the line now.</P>
    <P>At the same time the Minster introduced other measures in circular 04/2002 on 24 December to regional health boards, which capped the rent people can receive and, worse still, provided for the refusal of rent allowance if it is in excess of the cap. Such interference in the administration of the supplementary welfare allowance scheme by the regional health boards leaves a great deal to be desired. On the basis of inquiries I have been made, there was little <Col N="78" /> or no consultation with the health boards in regard to this matter.</P>
    <P>Health boards have always operated caps and have been extremely vigilant in regard to the amount of rent they pay. They make exhaustive inquires in relation to single people who apply for rent allowance. Payments are only made when there are good reasons for people to have left the family home and, in response to the new regulation, the health boards are drawing a list of circumstances under which a person might receive rent allowance over and above the maximum allowed. As a result they will have to pay a higher rent allowance because it exists under the special circumstances. This regulation will cost more money than it will save, which was the reason behind it originally.</P>
    <P>A related matter is the benefit on privilege in assessment of means for unemployment assistance and pre-retirement allowance for claimants residing in the parental home. Fair play to the Minister for at least having a look at this issue because it is a travesty and a bureaucratic nonsense.</P>

      <P>This relates to sons or daughters living with their parents. People are more comfortable in their own environment and there might be a reason they do not have a job such as the lack of availability of employment in their locality. Not all rural areas are well off and the Minister knows that better than me. However, departmental officials feel everybody should have a job, although they are still busy proposing the abolition of the back to work allowance and CE schemes.</P>
      <P>At the end of the day people were being forced out of the family home because their social welfare payments were based on a means test of their parents' incomes, even though they were aged 18 and over and could vote, buy a house and make monumental decisions about their lives. The social welfare system treated them as children who were dependent on their parents or guardians. Apart from officials prying into the parents' circumstances, the Department was forcing these young people into the rental market. When they secured rental accommodation, they could go to the community welfare office and seek rent allowance under the supplementary welfare scheme. That cost the Department more under a different subhead than to give them a social welfare payment in their own right while living in their own homes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I salute the Minister because at long last something is being done about this issue and she is recognising reality, which is important. One can become a prisoner of bureaucracy and unable to see the wood for the trees. Theory is all right but practice is much different when human relationships are involved and Article 44 of the Constitution promotes the family. However, there is a set of anomalies related to people who live <Col N="79" /> together. They are treated as one for social welfare purposes while for taxation purposes they are treated as two separate people. There are many anomalies in the system and our committee intends to examine them. We will present a report on them to the Minister along with a good report on the position of carers in the not too distant future. In fairness to the Minister, she has begun to examine this issue. It is not enough but our feet are in the door and, hopefully, by next year the headland will have been reached with our encouragement.</P>
    <P>We have all played a role in getting the Minister to resolve the dentists' dispute and we put a great deal of pressure on her. However, the result was a generous deal for dentists and the taxpayer has been left to foot the bill again. The family budget must cover payments for dental care, health care and increases in the cost of gas and electricity, registration fees for students, VAT and car tax. The cost of dental care has increased by 10% across the board, although I am glad oral examinations and teeth polishing and so on are still free. The dentists got their way regarding the cost of fillings. While the Minister has increased the contribution for fillings to &euro;29 with a 15% discount for bulk fillings, there is no ceiling on the cost of a filling. The cost could vary from &euro;50 to &euro;80. I do not know how much they cost because I am a little squeamish about going to the dental surgery and it is a place to which I do not like to go. Nevertheless, dental care is costly and social welfare recipients will pay significant amounts for such work.</P>
    <P>The dispute went on for two years and was a long, drawn out saga. Last Thursday I tabled a parliamentary question which sought details of the proposals to resolve the dispute. The Minister said she could not furnish them but now I can see why. The dentists did not want a detailed examination and review of the scheme because they were coming out smiling as winners. The costs have increased sharply. The cost of a filling could double or treble depending on where one resides. A total of 1.7 million taxpayers who had a contract with the State and were paying into a scheme that would provide dental benefits for themselves and their dependants were left outside the system since last August when dentists began to withdraw their services.</P>
    <P>I spoke to a young woman who earns a reasonable income. She paid an additional &euro;50 for dental care during the dispute and she asked me to find out whether she would be compensated. The Minister must have saved between &euro;4 million and &euro;5 million during the dispute because approximately 35,000 people were excluded from the scheme. If she did not, why not? As many did not take advantage of the scheme, we should ensure a proper method of paying compensation is put in place for the people concerned. As Deputy Ring said, they receive vouchers to assist them in paying their bills. While that is acceptable under the law of any land, they feel deeply aggrieved <Col N="80" /> and disappointed that they did not receive any recompense for the time during which they did not receive treatment. There is a significant number involved.</P>
    <P>The cost of living is spiralling out of control. Recent surveys demonstrate high prices have rendered our standard of living as the fifth lowest in the European Union. We are continually hit with increases. The 10% increase in the cost of dental treatment is another financial burden which families must bear.</P>
    <P>The social welfare increases announced in the budget were a pittance and will be completely obliterated by spiralling inflation. Deputy Boyle and I have spoken before about the 30 cent increase for the unemployed. CORI carried out an assessment of the increases within a week of the budget announcements. What has happened since the budget was introduced two months ago? The people concerned are in a negative position in real terms. An unemployed couple with one child will gain 25 cent a week. Children are getting a real increase of 54 cent a week. The Government broke its promise to complete the three-year programme for increasing child benefit and only delivered one quarter of what it promised to deliver this year.</P>
    <P>We have only to look at the papers presented by the tax strategy group to the Department of Social and Family Affairs recently to reveal the true extent of broken promises in a number of areas. They detail the increases in social welfare required for the Government to meet its many commitments under the programme for Government, the revised national anti-poverty strategy and the PPF. Comparison of the figures with the actual increases announced in the budget shows the full extent of the Government's breach of faith. It broke the contract it made with the people.</P>
    <P>The necessary weekly increases in old age pensions, supplementary welfare and child benefit payments to meet the Fianna Fáil-Progressive Democrats promises as calculated by the Department of Social and Family Affairs were, respectively, &euro;13.20 with &euro;10 given, 24% less than that promised; &euro;10.10 &ndash;&euro;15.40 with &euro;6 given, 41% to 61% less than that promised; and &euro;31.59 with &euro;8 given, 75% less than that promised. This information is not provided by my think tank machines but supplied by the Minister's officials. The extent to which she ignored advice on the need to meet election promises has been clearly outlined. Election promises mean very little. Once the Government took office it was a case of bye bye electorate.</P>
    <P>We are all aware of the situation regarding medical cards and affordable housing, on which we could write a book. The Minister for Finance boasted that during his term of office pensions had increased by more than 50% but the old age pension is now a smaller percentage of the average industrial wage than it was in the late 1970s. Thus, many pensioners without occupational pensions have suffered a sharper and real drop in <Col N="81" /> their disposable income on retirement than they would have 20 years ago. That is the real measure of the Government. Let us stop bluffing and running out on the plinth trying to fool the people who will no longer be fooled. They feel betrayed by the Government for the reasons outlined. It would be better if it did not make promises but simply said what it would do to help the poorest in our society. It should forget those who have done well, of whom there are many.</P>
    <P>What the Minister for Finance promised with the one hand he took away with the other whenever he could. Ireland's domestic inflation rate is double the EU average because of the Minister's profligacy and recklessness in previous years when times were good. It is this inflationary increase that completely dissipates the increases in the Social Welfare Bill. Many social welfare recipients, as the Society of St. Vincent de Paul acknowledges, will be worse off as a result of the recent budgetary and social welfare measures. Many increases will be clawed back by changes in rent supplements which have rightly been condemned by housing groups and community welfare officers.</P>
    <P>There is a commitment to poverty proofing in the revised NAPS. What this means is that policy proposals will be analysed to see what affect they will have on the poor. The poverty proofing process outlined in the recent budget was ambiguous to say the least. The biggest source of disappointment was the increase in child benefit.</P>
    <P>As I said last December during the debate on the Social Welfare Bill, the mark of any society is how it treats the elderly and those with disabilities. I am on record as saying I would pay an extra 1%, 2% or 3% to ensure such people were taken care of and carers were given due recognition for the heroic role they play in society. The manner in which they have been treated is an indictment of us all. They work 24 hours a day, seven days a week, 52 weeks a year. I acknowledge, however, the increase in the respite care grant. How does one tell a widow whose husband died unexpectedly four years ago and who is in receipt of widow's pension that she cannot get the grant for taking care of her 35 year old child? She told me that if she could get it, she would be able to employ somebody to help her.</P>

      <P>Yes. We must look at the saving to the State in that person not having to go into residential care. With the other 120,000 carers, she is saving the Government millions of euro per annum. We have failed to recognise this. Only 20,000 carers receive support from the State because of the restrictions imposed on the means test by Revenue. In this regard a case was successfully pursued through the Ombudsman in 2001. We will have to drag the Government into the 21st century and get it to acknowledge that the sum of &euro;129 does not represent a gravy train. Carers are saving the taxpayer millions of euro. <Col N="82" /> We do not have a proper nursing home subvention or enough places available, many of which are out of the reach of ordinary people. Some have given up the opportunity to return to employment to take care of their loved ones. They are not seeking reward.</P>
      <P>I am not sure if the Minister of State has read the Labour Party document, Caring for the Carers. We might make a submission to the Joint Committee on Social and Family Affairs which will soon undertake a review of the plight of carers regarding the abolition of the means test and the development of a carer's payment linked to average earnings and a dramatic expansion of respite care services. These are fundamental issues. We must continue to press for the implementation of such a programme even in the face of the Government.</P>
      <P>Section 13 amends section 179 of the principal Act of 1983. The net effect of this provision will be to prevent asylum seekers who enter the State seeking refugee status obtaining the right to claim a rent supplement. This provision is ill-conceived and not well thought out. It appears that the Minister and Department have been sold a pass by the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform into a system where they believe this provision will stem the flow of asylum seekers into Ireland. I am sure the Minister of State has read what Mr. James Stapleton of the Irish Refugee Council had to say in that regard:</P>
      <P>It is extremely disturbing that proposed Government legislation will deny rent allowance to all asylum seekers, regardless of their medical or other circumstances. This legislation is a crude attempt to prevent people, regardless of their need, from finding suitable housing. It also risks leaving asylum seekers, who are evicted from the centres, homeless and destitute.</P>
      <P>In November 1999 the Government introduced a system of direct provision whereby asylum seekers denied the right to work were denied full social welfare payments and offered &euro;19.10 per adult and full board in a communal accommodation centre. However, numerous medical practitioners recognising the potential damage that this system has caused to the mental health of many asylum seekers, have recommended that hundreds be granted financial assistance towards providing private accommodation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The suggestion that the administration of asylum seekers' welfare benefits should cease to be the responsibility of the Department of Social and Family Affairs and should be taken over by the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform is an alarming one, as it will mean that the experience and expertise of officials in the Department of Social and Family Affairs will be lost. The establishment of a parallel social welfare system will waste a significant amount of resources that could be spent in other areas. It is extremely worrying that the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, which is respon<Col N="83" /> sible for the security of the nation's borders, will have to attempt to meet the welfare needs of asylum seekers. There is a clear conflict of interest.</P>
    <P>The Irish Refugee Council has expressed its concerns to the Minister and, as Deputy Ring has said, many other bodies have concerns in relation to this matter. Who is going to deal with hard cases? Who will deal with genuine people who may be suffering from anxiety? What will the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform do with such people? What level of consultation has the Department of Social and Family Affairs had with the health boards? Will people remain in direct provision or will they be forced into homelessness? I do not doubt that the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform will be forced to purchase further accommodation centres. It will difficult for this plan to succeed and we must ask why it is being done. Is it being done for economic reasons or to create more efficiency in the system? Is it being done to act as a deterrent so the word will go out that one cannot escape direct provision and one must live in the centres? A number of important points need to be made. There will be difficulties in relation to the operation of certain sections of the Bill.</P>
    <P>Section 9 deals with the orphan's allowance. The Minister has received submissions from the Irish Foster Care Association. It is important to understand that foster care involves a child-centred partnership. Those involved in foster care, such as children, birth parents, foster carers, health boards and the IFCA, need to have a genuine sense of being involved. The suggestions of the Minister of State formerly responsible for this area, Deputy Hanafin, in July 2001 were contentious and created problems for many of those involved in the important work of fostering. Will section 9 allow a reversion to a payment that stands alone as a foster care allowance? Does it include discretionary payments that are intended to meet the day-to-day costs of looking after a foster child? Is the foster allowance now regarded as a separate matter, entirely distinct from the payment of foster care allowance?</P>
    <P>There are many points to be made. What is the position in relation to sections 9(1) and 8(2)? Were the views of the Irish Foster Care Association considered? Foster carers received from the health boards a weekly foster care allowance, which was intended to meet the day-to-day costs associated with caring for a foster child, until the middle of 2001. Foster carers could also receive discretionary payments from the health boards for additional expenses that were incurred. The working group recommended that the best way forward was to increase the foster care allowance appropriately and to absorb the discretionary payments. Foster carers who are disadvantaged because of the reduction in eligibility for grants for education purposes, or for social welfare purposes as Deputy Ring pointed out, as a result of being in receipt of social welfare allowance, hope <Col N="84" /> this Bill will address their problems. Many foster carers have lost out already and are aggrieved as a result. I hope the Minister, Deputy Coughlan, will examine this matter, which I will raise again on Committee Stage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanBoyle" hpid="Mr. Boyle Mr. Boyle">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boyle</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to share time with Deputies Cowley and Crowe, with the agreement of the House. I presume the Government breathed a sigh of relief when the most recent inflation figures were released, indicating that the annual rate of inflation has decreased from 5% to 4.8%. Its relief might be short lived, however, as the biggest factor in the decrease was the reduction in mortgage interest rates and clothing prices during the January sales. The inflationary trend is particularly worrying when one examines the underlying figures for various types of inflation, such as health inflation, which is 10.4%, and education inflation, which is 8%. There is not much to give comfort to the country, given that health and education are vital for those who depend on the social welfare system.</P>
      <P>There have been further developments since the budget and the House's discussion of the Social Welfare Bill 2002. The Children's Rights Alliance has challenged the Government to go further than it plans in terms of the elimination of child poverty. The alliance chided the Government for its retrograde steps in this budget and claimed that the Government is starting from two steps behind as it tries to eliminate child poverty. I would like the Minister, Deputy Coughlan, to outline the Government's response to the voluntary organisations, which make a compelling case. Ireland's position as a country that treats child poverty as a problem of far worse effect, compared to other European countries, cannot be denied under present circumstances.</P>
      <P>This Bill reinforces the Government's failure to meet its three-year commitment in terms of the child benefit increase. The Government should be given credit for trying to deal with certain anomalies in relation to the extension of entitlement to qualified children in certain welfare categories. The problem is that the Minister is failing to address other anomalies, such as the different types of child dependent allowance and the fact that the system is being made even more complicated. Deputy Penrose referred to the small, but welcome, increase in respite care. The Minister should have gone further in this regard, as the respite care system recognises that certain carers deal with more than one person. If the grant itself recognises this fact, why does the direct payment to the carer not recognise it? The Minister should be trying to bring about this very real reform.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome the increase in the island allowance, which not only benefits the Minister's constituents but also benefits some of my relatives. Part of the role of the Department of Social and Family Affairs is to recognise that many people are isolated geographically in terms of those who live in remote rural and island communities, and socially in terms of those who live in urban com<Col N="85" /> munities. I know the Minister's heart is in the right place, but I fear she is representative of a Government that has sustained the concept of the deserving poor. I hope she challenges this notion, which I do not attribute to her, as she grows into her Ministry. I attribute it to many elements in the Government and it is a malign influence which should be constantly challenged. We have discussed the capping of rent allowance on many occasions, but the Minister has to understand that it will have the detrimental effect of helping to increase homelessness.</P>
    <P>The proposals in relation to asylum seekers and refugees, who are being removed from the responsibility of the Department of Social and Family Affairs, are counter-productive. They will cost the State more in terms of increases in direct provision, through the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform. A lack of joined-up government is constantly evident in immigration matters. I do not doubt that there are arguments in relation to where people come from and their direct entitlements, but if it was properly addressing this issue, the Government would look at the prospect of allowing people to work directly while their entitlement is being assessed by the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform. This would not only have the benefit of saving money for the Department of Social and Family Affairs and several others, but it would also earn money for the Exchequer through taxation and social insurance. The fact that the matter is not being dealt with in such an integrated manner means that the Government is cutting off its nose to spite its face.</P>
    <P>I am grateful that the rumoured changes in relation to child benefit, which may never have crossed the Minister's mind, have not been included in this Bill. One of the good effects of the Supreme Court judgment, which made such measures impossible, is that people who are born in this country are seen as Irish citizens and are entitled to benefits as such. The Minister seems to have pandered to some of the opinions of ill-informed people who think that refugees and asylum seekers are getting, or are entitled to, benefits to which other people are not entitled. That has never been the case. The Minister is making that a physical reality the other way around in that there will be payments to which asylum seekers and refugees are not entitled. That is not a good principle, particularly because Ireland has international agreements as to who payments should be given to and how that is done. It is interesting that people from Liechtenstein, Norway and Iceland are entitled to these payments in these circumstances because they are from the European Economic Area whereas those from impoverished, underdeveloped countries are not, whatever the circumstances. This is something the Minister should discuss at the Council of Ministers.</P>
    <P>The Opposition is restricted with regard to amendments to the Bill in that it cannot propose additional payments or anything that would make <Col N="86" /> Opposition Members popular with their constituents. However, amendments to the text should be considered to make the Bill more humane and improve delivery systems. There are continuing anomalies in the social welfare system and, though I realise the Minister is unable to tackle them all in one go, the Opposition will co-operate in a constructive fashion in working to remove them.</P>
    <P>The putative agreement at the national partnership talks should be discussed in the House. It deals with social welfare increases running at twice the rate of inflation for the remainder of the life of this Government. Will the Government make this commitment and, if so, will that be couched in caveats and talked about in terms of ability to pay? If the Government is able to deliver on this, there will be a chance to catch up with social welfare payments that lag considerably behind. I look forward to the debate when the Minister is able to bring that information to the House. In any case, the House will consider how the Bill can be improved on Committee and Report Stages. I look forward to making the Minister's job easier.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JerryCowleyIND" hpid="Dr. Cowley Dr. Cowley">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Cowley</NameTxt>
      <P>I am happy to speak on this Bill. A spokesperson on yesterday's television news on RTE said that the massive profit made by the banks was good for Ireland. I found that statement amazing considering that the profits will not go towards making life easier for the citizens of Ireland. I presume, therefore, that the spokesperson was talking about corporate and big business Ireland, not Sean Citizen. That is a pity because there is great need which requires a Government courageous enough to bite the bullet and give to those with that need. This Government seems unprepared to ask what this issue is about, namely, people, not robbing Peter to pay Paul or being disingenuous.</P>
      <P>It is not right to play games with people, particularly the old and vulnerable. It is unfair that older people are told they are to get a &euro;10 pension increase but later realise that their rent allowance has dropped by the same amount. That undermines confidence in the body politic and the system. There should be a consistent policy on social welfare increases and rent allowances. A review is needed on how rent allowance is calculated for vulnerable people and the pension increase for an elderly person should not be used in the calculation of the rent allowance. Increasing the pension by &euro;10 and clawing back the same amount in the rent allowance is wrong and out of date for a modern and equitable system. Reform is needed because the vulnerable are suffering.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I feel strongly about the use of sheltered housing and the need to support people in their communities, and I am involved in that area. It is important that, no matter how old or disabled, people have the opportunity to stay in their areas. There is a problem with access to sheltered housing for older people &ndash; those with nothing and those with a little. There is an access scheme cat<Col N="87" /> ered for in the budget and I hope it can be extended to older people. Home is best but, where that is not possible, sheltered housing is a good option. Few alternatives have been given to older people in the past except to follow a medical model of faraway institutions and nursing homes. Those options are fine when there is no alternative but there should be an alternative. Institutions are an inappropriate catch-all and many people in them should not be. Treating old age as an illness rather than a natural state is wrong. The old should not need doctors and nurses any more than young people &ndash; they need them only when they are ill.</P>
    <P>Sheltered housing, with its magnificent potential, could be described as the Cinderella of the housing system. It is always talked about and brought to the ball, but nobody takes poor Cinderella home. Until Government faces up to the reality that funding is required for sheltered housing initiatives, nothing will change. Communities are eager to keep local people in their areas if that is possible and if it is supported. There is Cabinet support but the ongoing revenue cost is a difficulty. There is a clear lack of leadership in the failure to bring forward such a defined revenue funding scheme for sheltered housing and I hope the Minister addresses this issue. A sense of responsibility is needed. It is only common sense but there are none so blind as those who will not see. I hope the Government sees because the situation is as clear as day.</P>
    <P>Up to &euro;17 million is paid to nursing homes by way of subventions. Older people could be placed in low-support housing in their communities for one tenth of that cost. The nursing home market is supply led compared to demand led sheltered housing. It is necessary to build big nursing homes to make them pay by packing people in. Some 4,000 elderly and disabled people are languishing on waiting lists who have no realistic hope of ever getting a house because they need sheltered housing, and that figure is a gross underestimate of the real need. There should be a St. Brendan's village in every part of Ireland and the cost of that would be very economic.</P>
    <P>It is important that bricks and mortar are a part of housing policy but needs other than those of the able bodied must be addressed. There must be more thought on the development of housing for the vulnerable and those who cannot take care of themselves &ndash; that is the balance required.</P>
    <P>There could have been far more in this Bill for the unemployed. The increase for those on unemployment assistance was only &euro;10, which is very little for a couple. There should always be an incentive to work and it is demoralising not to have that. It would be good if this Bill was going to change that but I do not think it will.</P>
    <P>I have great time for those working in the Department of Social and Family Affairs. They work hard, are very courteous and provide good information, but there is too much bureaucracy. A person who tries to go back to work for a few <Col N="88" /> days is faced with such stringent paperwork to sign off for those days that there is no incentive to work. It is easier to take the dole and do nothing, and that is bad. Each week, people are obliged to sign off and bring written proof to the social welfare office of exact earnings from an employer. It is hard to chase after employers to get that information and it must be easier to devise a document which a prospective employer can sign to indicate that a person had called looking for work. That would ensure a humane system.</P>
    <P>The family support payments are very low and it must be difficult to cope on them. The fuel allowance of &euro;9 is very low, particularly for pensioners. A bag of coal could not be bought for that and the allowance should be about &euro;25 per week and paid all year, rather than from October to April. There are 14,500 people with arthritis in County Mayo who need heat all the time. Those on supplementary welfare allowance will not qualify for disability allowance which requires an illness lasting one year or more.</P>

      <P>Approximately ten days ago the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform indicated his intention to bring a proposal to Cabinet that would allow local authorities to determine pub closing hours in their areas. Many of us were shocked at this and those I have spoken to have expressed bewilderment at the Minister's intention. In the summer of 2000, pub closing times were extended, the result of which led to a marked increased in the levels of street violence in towns and cities. Groups such as Victim Support have indicated that there is a direct link between the increase in calls to their offices and the liberalisation of the drinking laws. The Minister proposes that every town, city and county council should determine pub closing times, a move that will effectively liberalise them. In some cases closing times will be extended to 2 a.m. It is a crazy, nonsensical and bizarre notion.</P>

      <P>According to the <i>Irish Examiner,</i> the Minister has indicated that the measure will allow communities to help curb late night violence. He will have to explain to this side of the House and the country what he means because nobody appears to be able to make sense of it, especially in view of what is happening on the streets. Ordinary and senior members of the Garda Síochána, who are trying to deal with current levels of street violence, have indicated that they do not have the resources to address the problem. How will they manage if they must police every pub until 2 a.m.? It cannot be done.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister cut the Garda overtime budget from &euro;69 million to &euro;50 million. Given that, he will have to explain how members of the Garda Síochána will be able to deal with extended pub opening hours. If this is implemented it will mean that people will be able to drive from one local authority area to another to avail of longer opening hours. It will encourage drink driving and a nation-wide pub crawl.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Every year alcohol abuse costs the country &euro;2.3 billion, yet the Minister is planning to give people greater opportunities to drink. An article in a newspaper today dealt with an interview on the &ldquo;Marion Finucane Show&rdquo; with a retired detective inspector, Gerry O'Carroll, who was a member of the Garda Síochána for 20 years. In it he <Col N="90" /> expressed the view that if a teenager leaves home today there is no longer any guarantee he or she will return alive. He went on to say that the State has a duty to protect its citizens and he asked about the 2,000 extra gardaí promised by the Government.</P>
    <P>Some Members on this side of the House agree with some of the actions taken, and legislative decisions made, by the Minister, but this proposal is not one of them. We will fight it as best we can. A couple of weeks ago in this House the Minister accused me of beating the drum on resources and manpower in the Garda Síochána. I considered it to be an unfair comment because the Government first started to beat it before the general election. I promise the Minister I will keep beating that drum until it rings in his ears and the ears of those who will vote in the next local elections. I will stop beating it when the Government starts to take crime and law and order seriously and makes it a priority, and when the Minister starts to deliver on his promise to provide the country with an extra 2,000 gardaí.</P>

      <P>I am fortunate in living in the constituency of Laoighis-Offaly because according to the most recent crime statistics, it has the lowest rate of serious crime and the highest detection rate in Leinster. It is the safest place in the province. Despite this, the recent &ldquo;Prime Time&rdquo; programme on street violence focused on my constituency to illustrate the reality of life in provincial towns by day and night.</P>
      <P>The statistics for 2001 for the Laois-Offaly Garda division show an increase of 21% in the incidence of crime. It is one of the biggest concerns in my constituencies, but the fact that the statistics show the lowest rate of increase for the province makes me wonder what life is like in other parts of Leinster and the country. I know what life is like on the streets at night. Perhaps, unlike the Minister, I still attend night clubs on odd occasions. The violence, both inside and outside the clubs, is mindless and it arises because of abuse of alcohol and, in many instances, drugs. Not enough effort has been made to tackle it.</P>
      <P>Pubs are part of the problem, but much more is involved. Much is happening outside pub premises, especially in terms of under-age drinking. We will not achieve any improvement unless we start to tackle the problems beyond the pubs and as they manifest themselves in younger age groups.</P>
      <P>I have spoken to many members of the Garda Síochána who are involved in this area and before I became a Member of this House I worked as a solicitor with many of them in the District Court. They tell the chambers of commerce and the local authorities that they do not have the resources or the manpower to deal with the current situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Matters have disimproved since the rural policing initiative. The Garda station where I live covers a wide area, including on occasion locations outside the county. The Garda cars at its disposal are also expected to police night clubs <Col N="91" /> and pub closing in towns and villages. It cannot be done.</P>
    <P>Last summer the Minister said the recent crime statistics were worrying. Headline offences have increased by 18%, drugs offences by 33%, sexual offences by 83% and assaults by 93%. Last July the Minister said that an increase in crime of this significance required urgent analysis of the underlying causes and priority action required to deal with them. He suggested a three-pronged approach. First, to tackle the causes of crime, second, to ensure that all aspects of criminal law are adequate to combat it and, third, to ensure that sufficient resources are available to the criminal justice system and that they are used to optimum effect.</P>
    <P>The Minister has made some effort but he has not tackled the problem to any significant extent. Last summer he made a commitment to the appointment of an extra 2,000 gardaí and he reaffirmed the importance he attaches to his objectives. Despite this, there is no delivery of these promises. That is why the motion is before the House.</P>
    <P>The Minister's proposal to allow local authorities to determine pub closing times is ludicrous. The town of Birr is under the control of Birr Town Council, yet less than a mile away there is a village under the control of Offaly County Council. If pubs in Birr close at 11.30 p.m. while those in the village close at 1 a.m., customers will travel to the village to get another drink without having to pay to attend a night club. The Minister must address the consequences of his proposal. If he pursues it he will not get the backing of his Government colleagues and he will eventually have to make a climbdown. He would be better advised to make it now rather than later.</P>

      <P>As my colleagues have already said, we are living in a crime-ridden society. The crimes committed are getting uglier by the day, they are more brutal and, in some cases, are without motive. This is well known, but what should we do about it?</P>
      <P>I also heard the retired detective garda on the &ldquo;Marian Finucane Show&rdquo; yesterday. He would actually chill one with the stories he had to tell. He was obviously a man who took his job very seriously. He was prepared to come on the national airwaves and had no chip on his shoulder. The Minister should get a tape of the show and listen to it. It is important for any Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to take heed of what the man had to say.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Everybody listening to the programme will remember his thoughts on the unprovoked attacks on ordinary, innocent young people, men in particular, going about their legitimate business. I know the Minster has spoken about this, as have we on many occasions. Out of the blue, these young men are being almost murdered on the side of the street. We must determine the <Col N="92" /> causes of crime because this trend is new, dangerous and very frightening. I blame a very hostile, cruel streak that is beginning to become embedded in society, although only a minority is involved. There is considerable anxiety on the part of parents and others regarding this trend.</P>
    <P>As I have said to the Minister before, our country is almost submerged in alcohol. Alcohol consumption has increased by over 50% in the past five or six years. Should this trend continue unabated, as it shows signs of doing, there will be another 50% increase in the next five or ten years.</P>
    <P>Binge drinking among children &ndash; because that is all they are &ndash; of 11, 12, 13 and 14 years of age must be tackled. It is time to blow the whistle on this issue and I appreciate fully that it is very difficult and that no single strategy will work. However, I guarantee that unless the parents, community leaders, Garda, social workers, youth workers and politicians stand up to be counted, this deadly scourge will get much worse.</P>
    <P>The existing laws should be enforced by the Minister because this is not being done. That means that the 2,000 gardaí promised by the Government should be on the streets. The Minister must come up with new, practical, solid and sensible proposals. The Minister's allowing the local authorities the opportunity to regulate the opening hours of public houses must be a joke. That could not work in 100 years because people are so motorised nowadays that a distance of 40 or 50 miles is insignificant. If the Minister were ever to create a mobile circus in the middle of the night, this is how he would do so. He would have queues all over the place.</P>
    <P>Access to drink will have to be curtailed. I am not a killjoy in this respect. I make no apologies for the fact that I am a pioneer, but I spend most of my time in pubs, as most politicians do. I voted, like most other people, for an extension of the opening hours under the licensing laws. I did so because I always believed, until recently, that everybody is entitled to be in control of their own future and destiny. However, I do not know what we will do if under age drinking continues unabated for the next five years.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BernardAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>The idea of giving local authorities control over opening hours is daft coming from a man whom I consider to be intelligent. It shows the Minister does not understand the lack of capacity local authorities have in making such decisions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As a former Minister with responsibility for sport, I note there is too much emphasis on dealing with the problem rather than trying to prevent if from arising. The Taoiseach and Government have an obsession with professional and spectator sports. They are proposing huge investment in viewing facilities instead of investing in clubs at grassroots level and encouraging young people to join the healthy environments of such clubs. This policy is stupid, foolish and short-sighted. If one invests in sport as a preventative element in the <Col N="93" /> fight against crime and drugs, one will reap massive benefits. This is not happening because the emphasis seems to be on professional sport, looking at Sky Sports and viewing sports in pubs. One knows what this leads to.</P>
    <P>It is almost a year to the day since I raised the issue of an incident in Cork where a man was beaten up outside and inside a nightclub on 26 March 2001. I raised the matter on 27 February last year and did so because the event was caught on video. The file went to the DPP but the DPP took no action. Subsequently, through raising it here in the Dáil, the inquest was heard. The coroner ordered that the file be returned to the DPP and, just two weeks ago, there was no prosecution. I find it incomprehensible that a man could be kicked to death on the streets of Cork, an event that was caught of video, without action being taken. Where is the law and order? The DPP may be independent but surely he is accountable for such decisions. I ask the Minister to find out exactly why the investigation that took place was ineffective in getting the case into court.</P>
    <P>Every weekend in my constituency I see under age drinkers with plastic bags of alcoholic drinks going to the alleyways and bushes. The Garda may intercept them from time to time and seize their drinks, but why is the next step not taken? Why are the young people not asked where the drink came from and why is no action taken against the off-licences that are selling young people alcoholic drinks and allowing them embark on a life of binge drinking and crime?</P>
    <P>There seems to be no enforcement. We can make all the new laws we want, but unless we enforce those that exist we are on a loser. I do not see a determined effort to apprehend the people who are making massive profits by selling drink to young people.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeymourCrawford" hpid="Mr. Crawford Mr. Crawford">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crawford</NameTxt>
      <P>I congratulate Deputy Deasy on raising this very important issue. I know from the Minister's comments that he too is very conscious of the issue of alcohol abuse and the lack of justice in this regard.</P>
      <P>I am astounded that the Minister would even suggest that the decision on opening hours be left to local authorities. I question his knowledge of how local authorities work, how decisions are made by the people that serve on them and how the administrators and Garda could enforce a ruling in this respect. As has been said, when there is one law in County Monaghan and another in County Cavan, how can you stop people rushing from one place to the other to drink for an extra half hour? The changes to licensing laws which were brought about through the votes of all Members mean that people no longer hire vans or cars to travel to night clubs They can now drink until all hours in public houses, which is where they stay. The crowds disappear because they can get drink without having to travel. I beg the Minister to look again at the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I encourage curtailment of late night drinking. <Col N="94" /> Some of the new licensing provisions are logical such as changes to the holy hour which used to permit drinking in hotels on Sunday afternoons, but not in public houses. The late opening hours are crazy and statistics show they have encouraged our youth to indulge in serious drinking which has resulted in violence and major health care problems. Accident and emergency nursing staff are afraid of what will happen to them in the early hours of Saturday, Sunday and Monday mornings. Street violence and violent crime are becoming the norm whereas we used to see occasional attacks on homes. Murders are being committed by people who are out of their minds, not on drugs, which we blamed in the past, but on drink. We must control this problem.</P>
    <P>I was delighted to hear Sean McCague, President of the GAA and a fellow countyman, lead the way by suggesting that alcohol should no longer be advertised. He said that clubs should no longer accept sponsorship from drink companies. While making provisions in this area would take time, we must go in that direction. We must stop encouraging binge drinking and all that goes with it. I am not a teetotaller, I enjoy one or two drinks, but I recognise that there have to be controls.</P>
    <P>The Minister took office with great ideas, but he now finds himself faced with cutbacks. Overtime has been curtailed and the 2,000 promised gardaí will not appear on our streets as we believed they would last May. The economic climate means we should not cod ourselves that the new recruits will be provided tomorrow. The Minister will face difficulties which is why he should consider the use of civilian staff to release more gardaí to provide a service on the beat. I question the closure of Garda stations.</P>
    <P>Opening hours must be restricted and we should turn our backs on the idea that drink is our patron saint. It was wrong to use Guinness brewery during the visit of President Clinton. Those images were broadcast around the world as a demonstration of how Ireland lives. There is no need for the Taoiseach to open every public house.</P>

      <P>I will not repeat Deputy Costello's comments about the Minister, but I recognise that he is living up to his reputation. The Minister has given the impression in this House that he regards this issue as something of <Col N="95" /> a joke. The amendment to the motion commends the Government with regard to its commitment to continue to tackle all aspects of crime, but nothing could be further from the truth. Law and order is out of control in every part of the State and people in all sectors of society are saying that the Minister has no handle on it. The Government amendment endorses its national drugs strategy which will operate for the next seven years. The Government may have put a strategy in place, but the use of drugs is escalating. Local and national papers recently reported that cocaine use has emerged in Kerry where it was never known to be popular before. People were caught with it just last week. Use of the drug is spreading and there seems to be no control over it. A car was stopped last week as it travelled from Castleisland to Tralee with 1,000 ecstasy tablets to supply the Saturday night market.</P>
      <P>The first annual Garda report was published in 1947 and it portrayed a society which was largely free from crime. A dozen rapes and three murders were recorded that year. The crime figures for 2001, published last November, detail an average of one murder per week, the highest number ever recorded, while rape and sexual assault reached unprecedented levels. Over 23,000 burglaries took place and there were 1,400 cases of arson. The figures for 2002 illustrate that it was the bloodiest year since the first annual Garda report on crime appeared. There were 62 killings in 2002 compared to 27 in 1982 and 12 in 1962. When detailed comparative data become available for 2002, they are likely to reveal that Dublin has become a more deadly city than London and that the national crime rate has crept closer to the EU average. These are the statistics on which the Minister seeks to compliment himself and the Government.</P>
      <P>I have seen articles printed in international media which show that Ireland is not perceived as a safe country for tourists to visit. It was recorded in the media that on 28 December in Cork a young Australian tourist was raped in the city following a casual meeting in a local pub. I compliment the Garda on the conviction of a man who detained two Australians against their will and brutalised them in every manner possible. It was a very gruesome story.</P>

      <P>I support the motion before the House and I hope it will go some way to bringing the Government to a realisation that there is a problem which concerns everybody in society. There has been a dramatic increase in the rate of violence, and it is frightening and deplorable that <Col N="96" /> it is happening in this day and age. The story is the same in both urban and rural Ireland. Older people go to bed at night in fear of being robbed. Housing estates which were once trouble free are now being used and abused by joyriders. Street violence is a regular occurrence in most towns at weekends. Young people are terrified of going out for fear of being attacked. The assaults have become more vicious. There is no control over the drinks and drugs culture. There are well known places in all towns and villages where drug users can obtain supplies. Drugs are being sold to young people in a town near where I live and very little is being done about it. The problem is getting worse even though we talk about it night and day.</P>
      <P>Last Friday night I was in a hostelry in my constituency and I saw a young man looking for a drink. I asked him his age and he told me that he was 16 and a half years old. He was well oiled, well jarred. He ordered two pints and two alcopops for his friends and staggered away. In Clonmel last weekend, people marched to highlight crime levels in the town. People are at a loss as to what to do about violence in our towns.</P>
      <P>The Minister has a huge responsibility to do something. Rural Garda stations are being closed down in every rural constituency. The Government has failed to put more gardaí on the beat. All the Opposition can do is put pressure on the Government and make it realise the extent of the problem. I implore the Minister to do something. Many of us on this side of the House know the Minister's background and that he is genuinely interested in doing something, but the Government is failing in its duty to the citizens of Ireland to clean up our streets.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnPerry" hpid="Mr. Perry Mr. Perry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Perry</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Deasy for raising this important issue. I wish to speak on the subject of bail. I am sure law-abiding citizens are bemused at the enforcement of bail. Many people who flout the terms of their bail do so with impunity. They seem to treat bail money like a lotto bet &ndash; skip bail and you may or may not lose your money. This is a huge problem that threatens to undermine respect for the courts and the administration of justice. There is a problem with unexecuted bench warrants. In 2001, of the 10,121 bench warrants issued, there was a failure to pursue estreatment in 3,297 cases.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am astonished that there is no communication between the Garda Síochána and the Courts Service on follow-up action and that people can pay the minimum amount of bail and skip bail. I ask if the Minister can stand over a system where warrants are not executed. In 2001, 5,044 forfeitures and estreatment notices were issued with a value of &euro;638,000 but only &euro;20,000 was paid. There is a lack of interface between the various bodies. The Garda states that there is no clear procedure for the conversion of estreats and warrants to penal warrants. Garda time is used in collecting small amounts of bail and in establishing <Col N="97" /> the identity of persons who have been served with bench warrants.</P>
    <P>The Minister spoke about issuing ID cards to young people under 25 but he cannot even arrange the collection of bench warrants. There is no system in the Department for the collection of money for unexecuted bench warrants. I want the Minister to assure the House that every bench warrant is executed, that every euro of bail is paid. Only &euro;20,000 of a total of &euro;600,000 was paid in 2001 &ndash; let the Minister say that is a sign of law and order. The foundation of this State is built on accountability. When people go before the courts and are fined they should pay the fine. They claim inability to pay and the warrant is not executed. The victims of crime are the real losers. I ask the Minister for clarification on the enforcement of bail.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>To delete all words after &ldquo;Dáil Éireann&rdquo; and substitute the following:</P>
      <P>&ndash;&nbsp;commends the Government on its commitment to continue to tackle effectively all aspects of crime;</P>
      <P>&ndash;&nbsp;acknowledges the Government's achievement in bringing the numbers in the Garda Síochána to an all time high of approximately 11,900, the huge increase in the level of resources available to the Garda Síochána from a low of &euro;580 million in 1997 to &euro;938 million in 2003 &ndash; an increase of 61% &ndash; and the commitment to prioritise recruitment in order to quickly bring the force to its authorised strength of 12,200;</P>
      <P>&ndash;&nbsp;notes the success of the Garda Síochána's operation encounter which targets public order incidents by tackling the problem at source outside night-clubs, licensed premises and fast food outlets and recognises that the substantial additional provisions contained in the Criminal Justice (Public Order) Bill 2002 will greatly enhance the powers of the Garda Síochána to deal with public order offences;</P>
      <P>&ndash;&nbsp;recognises the provision of significant additional resources to other sectors of the criminal justice system, including increasing the number of prison places by over 1,200 and the appointment of additional judges;</P>
      <P>&ndash;&nbsp;commends the Government's record in continuing to build on the strengthening of the criminal law over the past five years through unprecedented legislative reform;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ndash;&nbsp;commends the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform on his proposal to introduce a new Criminal Justice Bill before the end of the year to provide stronger powers to the Garda Síochána <Col N="98" /> to investigate crime and to improve the efficiency of the criminal justice system generally;</P>
    <P>&ndash;&nbsp;endorses strongly the Government's national drugs strategy for the next seven years, as outlined in the publication Building on Experience which brings together all elements of drugs policy in a single comprehensive framework;</P>
    <P>&ndash;&nbsp;welcomes the Government's allocation of over &euro;60 million to date, to implement the plans of the local drugs task forces and the Government's increased budgetary allocation of 16% in 2003 for the funding of drugs services and programmes co-ordinated by the Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs;</P>
    <P>&ndash;&nbsp;congratulates the Garda Síochána and the Customs Service on their continuing success in making large seizures of illicit drugs, particularly heroin and cocaine, thereby reducing access to those drugs that cause most harm;</P>
    <P>&ndash;&nbsp;acknowledges the significant role played by the Criminal Assets Bureau in responding to serious and organised crime by targeting and seizing the profits of such crime, and by ensuring that the proceeds of serious criminal activity are subjected to the tax laws;</P>
    <P>&ndash;&nbsp;welcomes the recommendations contained in the Interim Report of the Strategic Task Force on Alcohol which was established to provide advice to Government and public bodies on measures to prevent and reduce alcohol related harm; and</P>
    <P>&ndash;&nbsp;approves the Government's commitment to supporting the Garda Síochána in every way possible in tackling crime, not only through increased Garda numbers, but also by facilitating and promoting a programme of legislative change and reform both within the force and the criminal justice system generally, in order to meet the challenges of present day crime.</P>
    <P>When I came to address this motion I thought I was facing a serious effort by Fine Gael to express its views on the issue of criminal law. Instead, I have had a scatter gun approach of eight Deputies taking five minute soundbites to echo empty comments on the criminal law system.</P>

However, if they do not believe that, they should have the moral courage to consider it possible that local authorities should be given some discretion as to whether they want their town to be a late night town or not. That is a reasonable proposal. At the moment we give the Judiciary, without local democratic input, the right to give special extensions to night clubs. The local communities' views are immaterial in that process. If one applies to the local district judge one can run a night club that will stay open until 2 a.m. Surely we are at the stage where local public representatives should have some input into that decision in their own community.</P>
      <P>I was particularly struck by what one Deputy said. He said that if I knew anything about the way in which decisions are made in local authorities I would not make such a suggestion. I have faith in local representatives and I believe they should represent their communities and make important decisions for them.</P>

I make no apology for my stance, which has been to acknowledge the gravity of the crime figures that emerged last year. I have set out a solid programme of work for my period as Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform in order to counter some of the factors which are giving rise to increased criminality.</P>
      <P>The Government has one over-riding and fundamental strategy in the area of criminal justice. The Garda will be given the resources to investigate crime, the courts the resources to deal effectively with criminal cases, and there will be sufficient prison places to ensure that those convicted of crime will serve the sentences imposed on them by the courts.</P>

      <P>The Government has increased the number of prison places by over 1,000. In addition, it has spent a huge amount of money on updating and improving prison facilities. In the course of the next few months I intend to bring a Bill in regard to Garda powers before the House. One important aspect of my role as Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform is to keep the criminal law under constant review to ensure that the gardaí have the legislative support to allow them to effectively investigate crime and bring to justice its perpetrators. In this respect I intend to bring forward legislative proposals in the forthcoming Criminal Justice Bill in relation to new Garda powers of investigation. In the main, these proposals arise from the recommendations in the report of the expert group appointed to consider changes in the criminal law which were recommended in the report of the steering group on the efficiency and effectiveness of the Garda Síochána.</P>
      <P>My proposals will provide for longer powers of detention in Garda custody, the strengthening of Garda powers in relation to the preservation of the scene of a crime, the introduction of new powers in relation to the issuing of search warrants in certain circumstances and the strengthening of the law in relation to DNA sampling. In the Criminal Justice Bill, I also propose to include a number of miscellaneous provisions which will improve the effectiveness of the criminal justice system in a number of specified areas.</P>
      <P>I am strongly of the view that the time has come for the establishment of a national DNA data bank in this country and I am anxious therefore that as comprehensive a data bank as possible be established having regard to constitutional and human rights issues.</P>

      <P>I did not come prepared for the kind of nonsense I have heard here.</P>
      <P>I am pleased to note that the Attorney General has recently written to the Law Reform Commission asking it to consider, as a matter of urgent public interest, the establishment of a DNA data bank having regard to the issues to which I referred. I look forward to examining the Law Reform Commission's findings when they become available.</P>
      <P>I mentioned earlier that a fundamental part of our approach to crime &ndash; in stark contrast to that of our predecessors &ndash; is to ensure that there is sufficient custodial accommodation available. There is a related point which I should mention because of some misconceptions that may have arisen relating to persons serving life sentences. As things stand, all long-term prisoners, with the exception of those serving sentences for the murder of a member of the Garda Síochána, are eligible to have their cases reviewed by the Parole Board after serving seven years. This may have created the impression that in some way seven years was regarded, as it were, as the going rate for a life sentence. I want to dispel any such notion. Entitlement to review is not entitlement to release. Far from it. As Minister, I have the final decision in such cases. While I will continue to decide on such cases on their individual merits I do not accept as a general proposition that seven years, or anything like it, is anywhere near adequate in cases of murder. Those people who think there is an eight, ten or 12 year tariff should remember that from now on I intend that no single digit sentences will be had except in the most extraordinary circumstances, which I cannot even envisage. Anybody who deliberately takes another person's life &ndash; and I distinguish between cases of manslaughter and murder &ndash; anyone who with malice aforethought murders another citizen can now expect that they will serve a very substantial sentence.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>I am talking about murder. Tackling crime effectively requires that the courts are equipped to provide speedy and efficient trials. Overall support for the courts has been greatly improved in recent years by the establishment of the independent Courts Service. The Courts Service has devoted a great deal of effort to streamlining the administrative supports for the courts including the introduction of modern IT systems. Deputy Perry might note this. A recent important initiative taken by the board of the Courts Service is the establishment of a working group to examine and report on the operation and organisation of the various jurisdictions of the courts system. That is being done under the chairmanship of Mr. Justice Fennelly of the Supreme Court. The group is undertaking a root and branch review of the organisation of our courts and will involve examining any necessary <Col N="105" /> changes to allow for the fair, expeditious and economic administration of justice. I look forward to receiving that report and on foot of it to substantially alter the structure of our system of criminal law trials on indictment with a view to speeding them up and getting rid of the current delays.</P>
      <P>More recently I established a committee chaired by Mrs. Justice Denham of the Supreme Court to examine the potential of video-conferencing technology in regard to the conduct of criminal and civil trials, including pre-trial hearings involving prisoners, such as bail and remand hearing. New technology has great potential to improve and enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of the trial process. I expect the committee will address the full range of practical, technical and legal issues involved in the use of such technology. As soon as the interim report is presented to me I will begin to prepare action on foot of it.</P>
      <P>I am committed to supporting the Garda Síochána in tackling crime, not only through increasing Garda numbers, but through facilitating and promoting change and reform, both within the force and in the criminal justice system in general, aimed at meeting the challenges of present day crime. Work is ongoing in the preparation of a general scheme of a Bill to provide for an independent Garda inspectorate. I intend bringing this to Government in the near future with a view to publication later this year. This will be the first major Garda reform since the 1925 Act to be passed by these Houses. The strategic management initiative report is also currently being implemented by the Garda.</P>
      <P>The Criminal Justice (Public Order) Bill 2002 is currently awaiting Report Stage in this House. The purpose of the Bill is to strengthen the law in order to deal more effectively with late night public disorder and disturbance which mainly has its origins in alcohol abuse. It does so in two main respects. First, in so far as a person who is facing a conviction for a public order offence under certain provisions of the Criminal Justice (Public Order) Act 1994 is concerned, the Bill provides for the making of an exclusion order as an additional penalty. Second, the Bill allows the Garda to apply to the District Court for a closure order which will have the effect of limiting the hours of opening of these premises. Under a closure order, the premises in question may be restricted from opening for business for certain times and periods as the court may determine, for the purposes of avoiding disorder either on the premises or in the vicinity of the premises.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Drugs misuse is one of the great social ills of our time. The Government's overall policy to tackle the drug problem is set out in the national drugs strategy. Our strategy is the result of the most comprehensive analysis and assessment of the problem ever carried out in this State. It brings together all elements of drugs policy into a single framework for the first time. It establishes the framework for the next six years to tackle the <Col N="106" /> drugs problem in an integrated fashion, involving the four pillars of supply reduction, prevention, treatment and research.</P>
    <P>Much work has been done in recent years, especially in the communities hardest hit by drugs. They have been the focus of major policy developments involving, for example, urban renewal schemes and cross-departmental programmes designed to speed up the processes whereby communities can more speedily draw down public resources. The national drugs strategy and the local drugs task force have, rightly, been the subject of favourable comment. They have facilitated the mobilisation of cross-agency forces.</P>
    <P>The Government has committed, and continues to commit, significant resources towards the drugs initiative. Up to the end of last year, over &euro;62 million had been allocated in implementing projects established via the local drugs task forces. In addition, the Government has committed &euro;130 million over the lifetime of the national development plan to a separate fund. That is the young people's facilities and services fund, which targets areas of disadvantage with greater risk of drug misuse among young people. This fund was established in 1998 and approximately &euro;68 million has been allocated to support over 350 facility and service projects within these targeted areas.</P>
    <P>The Criminal Assets Bureau and other specialised Garda support units, such as the national drugs unit, the National Bureau of Criminal Investigation and the bureau of fraud continue to have a major impact in disrupting the activities of such gangs. The successes achieved can be gauged by the significant drug seizures which have been made, the ongoing seizures of assets and the dismantling of a number of these gangs, resulting in the conviction of some of the most major criminal figures or, as is evident, their fleeing abroad.</P>
    <P>The Garda national drugs unit maintains close contact with law enforcement agencies worldwide. A particularly important advance in EU law enforcement co-operation has been the development of EUROPOL as a support agency for member states. I intend to publish in the near future, a Criminal Justice (Joint Investigation Teams) Bill which will give effect to an EU Council framework decision on joint investigation teams and will provide, by mutual agreement of the competent authorities of two or more member states, for the setting up of a joint investigation team for a specific purpose and limited period, to carry out criminal investigations in one or more of the member states setting up the team.</P>
    <P>Deputies will be aware of Operation Encounter, which was established in February 2002. This operation is focused on all issues of public order occurring in the community, but particular attention is paid to night clubs, fast food outlets and other venues at which large numbers of people congregate and where there is potential for disorder. Additional Garda resources have been made available and plans drawn up by each of the <Col N="107" /> regional commanders to prioritise the deployment of those resources.</P>
    <P>I know some Deputies have a difficulty with the concept of gardaí paying attention to premises in this way but to a large extent the increase in recorded levels of street crime reflects this targeted Garda effort in terms of the levels of activity and enforcement. This is borne out by the excellent detection level of 75% in relation to reported assaults.</P>
    <P>Much has been made of Garda recruitment in the course of this debate. The parties opposite opposed the Government's proposal to have 14,000 members of the Garda Síochána. It is fascinating to see how they now clamour for something they opposed when it came up for decision by the people. They now demand that I do what they said was wrong.</P>

This is why he looks so sharp and seems able to present such a strong argument. Let us look at the facts. It is timely that we have this debate. The Minister's predecessor, Deputy O'Donoghue, gave us zero tolerance. He saw crime rampant all the way from Cahirciveen to Dublin every day he travelled there and was going to deal with it. It did not matter how small it was, the Minister would wipe it out. The statistics from his reign in office are the worst we have ever seen.</P>

      <P>The Minister has announced cutbacks in the budget for Victim Support and Garda overtime. This great Government of which the Minister is a member has announced today that it will have a new Government jet at a cost in excess of &euro;50 million. That is where the resources are being spent. This is the Government's approach to dealing with crime. The scarce resources are being spent on a new Beechcraft at a cost of further millions of euro to carry the Government and the Cabinet around the world. The Government has a perverse sense of priority. Given that it has no money for third level education it is introducing third level fees. There is no money for substandard primary and second level schools which are badly in need of repair.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps we will have a short lecture from the Minister of State, Deputy O'Dea. The health area, where there are long hospital waiting lists, is a priority area for the Government. Most of the cutbacks have taken place in the areas of deprivation and disadvantage where resources are needed to try to eliminate the causes of crime.</P>
      <P>The Minister has criticised us for not giving him any ideas. He has not produced any ideas in this debate. We do not need to look at the old failed polices of law and order or zero tolerance but at a new approach. We want to see where the problems arise and how best to deal with them. I am referring to problems such as anti-social behaviour and violence on the streets. The best way to deal with these issues is to give a role to communities. Communities must have a forum whereby they can articulate their concerns and they must have a garda who would be accountable to them in regard to the way in which resources are spent, strategies adopted and action is taken. We have to look at matters from the ground up rather than from the top down. The Garda as it stands is a hierarchical force. We must look at those who are insecure in their communities where joyriding is taking place, where drugs are rampant, where intoxicating liquor is abused and where violence takes place. Unless there is community participation and unless the community sees that the gardaí who are policing it are responsive in a meaningful fashion, there will not be a solution. If we want to mean what we say that will require some change in structures. It will require the establishment of a policing forum.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. McDowell Mr. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>I am going to do that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad to hear it but there was nothing about it in the Minister's speech. It will also require a fresh look at the structures in the Garda. We may well have to look at reform of the Garda in certain ways. I am not mad about the Minister's idea of an inspectorate for the Garda. I would much prefer a full blown ombuds<Col N="112" /> man. While the Minister said it would have the powers he did not say it would have the resources. Without resources we can go nowhere. Our approach should be to look at crime and the causes of crime. An injection of resources is needed to deal with the causes of crime and a new dispensation in the manner in which we are going to tackle crime. Unless it is done from the ground up it will not be effective. Much of the approach in the past has been wrong. It has been ineffective, badly focused, badly directly and has not been that accountable.</P>
      <P>A fresh approach is the only way forward. I hope the Minister will bring forward proposals other than those before us. I have every intention of making proposals in this direction to try to put flesh on how we might provide a greater level of community participation and accountability where the problems arising on the streets would be dealt with in a more holistic fashion. We are not talking about victims of crime after the crime is detected and what happens in the courts, but the victims of crime as it is being committed. We know that 25% of people do not bother reporting crime because they know it will not be dealt with.</P>
      <P>This is a timely debate, but there needs to be a fuller debate and new thinking on the matter. Perhaps the justice committee will consider the issue.</P>

      <P>I welcome the debate this evening. Many families in my constituency live in a constant state of fear because of the activities of a relatively small number of people who are totally out of control. That is beside the point, however, for the people who live beside them. These people live in a constant state of fear. They are afraid for their children and their elderly relatives. It ranges from what might be considered minor crime to much more serious crime, but whether it is minor or major is irrelevant if one happens to be the victim. Minor crimes range from muggings to stealing mobile phones. A 15 year old victim of such a crime is in the Visitor's Gallery this evening. He and his friend were minding their own business outside Trinity College in broad daylight when their mobile phones were stolen.</P>
      <P>The other end of the violence and crime in my constituency includes unfortunate gangland murders. It appears the way to deal with having a spat with one's enemy is to shoot or stab the person to death. Unfortunately, there have been six of these events in as many months. Crimes range from what might be considered minor crimes, with very little comeback, to major crimes where people are murdered. It seems there has been very little effective action taken in either case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The fear of a number of my constituents is added to as a result of joyriding exploits, not just in my area but in many other areas also. Unfortunately, young men of a certain age are very enthusiastic about this activity. They have caused havoc in many areas. The Labour Party tabled a Private Members' motion last year which was <Col N="113" /> defeated by the Government. No one wanted to know about it, even though everyone agreed the content was excellent. Joyriding is still taking place. A number of positive proposals were put forward in that regard but no real action was taken.</P>
    <P>I agree with my colleague, Deputy Costello, that what we are dealing with are the causes of crime, not just the outcome, which is where we must begin &ndash; it is far too obvious what the outcome is because we see it every day. We need to deal with the underlying causes, including the areas of disadvantage where people are dropping out of school. Let me give an example in my constituency. There was an excellent idea for an all-encompassing school-type project in Cherry Orchard. It was a disadvantaged part of the community where people were looking forward to everything from excellent pre-school to after school care, including homework clubs and so on. This was recently ignored and deferred in the schools list and there will be no action on the project until 2004. This is a community that cannot wait. It cannot afford to sit around. It needs action and support. </P>
    <P>There are three policing forums in my area, which are very good. The community is involved and is very committed to them, but there are no resources. They are operating on a wing and a prayer. Until we have a committed resource for these forums, we do not expect any positive outcome from them.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SimonCoveney" hpid="Mr. Coveney Mr. Coveney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coveney</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pleased to have an opportunity to speak on the motion. It is probably the fourth or fifth time we have had a Private Members' motion on street violence or crime-related matters. For the Minister to suggest that we as a political party are void of ideas on the issue is total nonsense because a large number of Deputies have worked extremely hard on the issue. If he read our election manifesto he would have seen that the main plank of it was what is being introduced now, but was not introduced for the past four years, that is, the mandatory ID card scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. McDowell Mr. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy's colleagues attacked me for that a few moments ago.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SimonCoveney" hpid="Mr. Coveney Mr. Coveney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coveney</NameTxt>
      <P>I will come to that issue in a moment and I will give it recognition if and when it is deserved. We live in a more dangerous society now than we did 12 months ago. When the Minister took over in the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform there was some optimism among many neutral people because they felt he would take swift action, including tough and unpopular decisions, if necessary. Unfortunately, we have not seen that action.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Speaker after speaker gave the statistics and, therefore, I will not go over all of them again. To give just one, there were 52 killings last year alone. That is a much higher figure than previous years, going back over a five year period. The most important issue for people nowadays is their <Col N="114" /> personal safety, whether at home, in work or walking down the street in the evening or during the day. Tragically, there was the rape of a young Australian girl in public in my city of Cork, the beating of young men fishing on the Loch in Cork early in the morning and a young man kicked to death while walking down a quiet alleyway to get a taxi home.</P>
    <P>These types of incidents did not happen in the past to the same extent. They have instilled a fear in young people and their parents which has a significant effect on the mindset of many families. People do not think the Minister is taking this issue seriously. He should put forward policy initiatives to deal with the problems. First, we need to establish the main reason for the increase in violent behaviour. If one asks doctors in accident and emergency wards, Victims Support and gardaí on the beat, they will all point to alcohol as the main problem.</P>
    <P>What has been done about alcohol abuse? There is the Intoxicating Liquor Bill. I agree with the Minister that almost everyone in the House accepted that licensing hours should be extended, which was a mistake. We are big enough to say at this stage that it was a mistake and my personal view is that it needs to be reversed. We also made a very strong case at the time, even though we did not vote against the Bill, that if licensing hours were to be extended, a mandatory ID card scheme should be introduced so that publicans could establish the age of young people coming into pubs. I do not know how many times I asked the Minister, Deputy O'Donoghue, whether he would introduce the scheme, but time and again he refused, putting his faith in the failed age card scheme, which fewer than the population of UCD took up over a two year period.</P>
    <P>The Minister's contribution disappointed and annoyed me. His opening gambit was to tell Deputy Deasy to cop himself on. I thought it was a patronising, personalised, sniggering contribution that did no service to him, his Department or this House. The way he finished his speech, almost laughing at the topic, indicates the level of seriousness he attributes to the topic.</P>
    <P>For fear of being accused of not offering ideas, I want to offer a few to the Minister this evening. These are not news ideas because they have been around from my party's point of view for some time. There needs to be increased use of CCTV. The system has been extended in cities like Cork, Limerick and Dublin, but it needs to be extended to rural towns also. Business communities will co-operate with the Minister if he works with them. There needs to be community policing committees. The Minister spoke about communities in parts of rural Ireland taking responsibility for unruly behaviour as a result of alcohol. That can happen by linking the Garda with members of the community, whether youth groups, residents' committees or local public representatives. It is a far more sensible suggestion than asking local authorities to regulate the times of closing hours.</P>
    <P>With regard to mandatory ID cards, the Mini<Col N="115" /> ster should push that proposal through as soon as possible. We have called for them for the last four years. I hope the Minister is serious about them and that they will be introduced.</P>
    <P>With regard to non-policing issues about which we do not talk enough, we need to tackle parenting and start challenging parents on the level of responsibility they have towards their children.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>I raise this matter following concerns in the Portlaoise area since the publication of the schools building programme &ndash; I use those words loosely &ndash; in January of this year. There was no mention in that programme of the proposed new development of the greenfield site in Portlaoise. Will the Minister of State explain how the Department of Education and Science intends to proceed with this development?</P>
      <P>Progress has been made on the development and a greenfield site has been purchased with the Department of Education and Science. I understand outline planning permission has been sought. One of the schools involved is the Christian Brothers school in Portlaoise which was originally built in 1847. A new building was provided in 1906 and a series of prefabs were constructed or arrived at the site between 1991 and 1996. There are inadequate sports facilities in this school. There is no gymnasium, there is only one playing pitch and there are no proper facilities for resource teachers. The school cannot offer the leaving certificate applied programme or, indeed, the junior certificate schools programme because of the lack of facilities.</P>
      <P>The other school involved is Scoil Chriost Rí, which is a 30 year old three-storey prefab. There are no language laboratories in the school and there is an insufficient science laboratory. There is only one computer room for 470 students, there are no music and drama facilities and no learning support areas, resource space, room for guidance councillors or chaplain's room. There are no social areas, the corridors are very narrow and there is a small canteen. Again, this school cannot offer the entire choice of curriculum, including the leaving certificate applied. It is unable to offer subjects such as woodwork and technical graphics because the facilities are not available.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Both schools are located in the heart of Portlaoise, as are a number of primary schools. There is no room at either school for expansion. One could not fit a prefab into the grounds of either school at this point. There are no proper parking facilities in the area. There are also problems in terms of the location of the schools. Due to the lack of resources and space in the schools, the temptation for students to leave the school build<Col N="116" /> ing at lunch hour is much greater and students are quickly able to access the town.</P>
    <P>Under the promised programme, the schools are to be located on adjacent sites, &ldquo;with as much sharing as is desired between the two schools.&rdquo;  The schools had been led to believe that the campus facility would be provided by way of public private partnership and that it would be in place by 2004. The schools thought they would open in September 2004 on this new site and have offered the public in the area the full curriculum and school programmes by 2004.</P>
    <P>Will the Minister of State clarify when the campus will proceed and whether it will proceed by way of public private partnership? The Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Noel Dempsey, speaking at the Maritime College on 13 February said his Department is a leading force in delivery of quality infrastructural projects under the Government's public private partnership pilot programme and that it is the intention to continue to maximise the use of this method of procurement as much as possible in meeting the demands of the Department's capital programme. These two schools were not mentioned in the programme, so perhaps the Minister of State will clarify the position.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children (Mr. Callely)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Enright for giving me the opportunity to outline the Department of Education and Science's position regarding the allocation for schools building projects.</P>
      <P>The 2003 capital programme has now been published and full details in relation to individual projects are available on the Department of Education and Science's website at www.education.ie. The programme is designed to give the maximum amount of information to managers, boards of management, principals, parents and students. The criteria used for selecting projects have also been published for the first time, so people will be fully aware of the criteria used.</P>
      <P>It is also important to state that this year's building programme amounts to &euro;342.9 million which is four times the amount allocated in 1997 to the then schools building programme. The 2003 programme will deliver over 140 large-scale projects at primary and post-primary levels. In addition, over 400 schools will benefit in some way from the capital programme and, of course, all primary schools benefit directly from the devolved grants scheme for minor works.</P>
      <P>A number of Deputy Enright's and my colleagues have asked about the CBS and Scoil Chriost Rí in Portlaoise. I am pleased to inform the Deputy that a site has been identified by the Department of Education and Science for the provision of the proposed new schools in Portlaoise along the lines she stated. An outline planning application is currently being prepared for submission to Laois County Council in respect of this land and the newspaper advertisement was placed in the <i>Leinster Express </i>on 19 February 2003.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="117" />The budgetary allocation for 2004 and subsequent years will determine the rate of progress on projects currently in architectural planning and projects awaiting the appointment of design teams for future projects such as the schools mentioned.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gormley</NameTxt>
      <P>I decided to raise this issue on the Adjournment following the latest reply from the Minister on the matter. It was, I am afraid, a typically off-hand and dismissive reply on a serious subject. At the very least, I expected the Minister to express regret at the course of events and to assure me that, as Minister for Health and Children, he would investigate the matter thoroughly. All I got was a prime example of buck passing. The Minister's staff know all about this case because I have spoken to them. Let me, nevertheless, refresh the Minister's memory.</P>
      <P>I first raised this issue with the Minister on 27 March 2002 when I asked him why no speech therapist had been allocated to Ballinteer community school. The Minister referred my question to the chief executive officer of the Eastern Regional Health Authority. I received a letter dated 7 May 2002 from Louise McMahon, senior commissioner of the Eastern Regional Health Authority, informing me that the position of speech therapist in Ballinteer community school was offered to a successful candidate on 26 April 2002. This was good news and I immediately wrote to my constituent, Mr. Andrew O'Riordan, whose son, David, required a speech therapist, enclosing my parliamentary reply.</P>
      <P>To my astonishment, I received a letter from my constituent dated 13 June 2002 informing me that no speech therapist had been appointed to Ballinteer community school. He wrote to me again on 13 September 2002 telling me there had been no improvement in the situation. I made a number of telephone calls to the Eastern Regional Health Authority and, in a letter dated 27 September 2002, Louise McMahon conceded that the information I had previously received was inaccurate. Apparently, a speech therapist had been appointed to Ballinteer health centre and not Ballinteer community school.</P>
      <P>I do not know if the Minister has any idea of the deep frustration and anger parents feel when they encounter this level of incompetence. I wish to quote from a letter from Mr. O'Riordan in which he states:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have read the correspondence received from Ms Louise McMahon, Senior Commissioner, Eastern Regional Health Authority and I am amazed to think that the person would write you a letter on May 7th 2002 advising you that the <Col N="118" /> interviews for the position of Speech Therapist in Ballinteer Community School were held recently and that the position was offered to a successful candidate on April 26th 2002 and that it takes five months for that person to realise that the information given was incorrect.</P>
    <P>He goes on to state:</P>
    <P>I note that Ms McMahon in her letter to you, dated September 27th 2002 states that she hopes the position will improve in the near future. However, she does not seem to realise the damage that has been done to children like David with speech problems and she does not seem to realise that the lack of a Speech Therapist for months, let alone for years, is doing untold damage to David. Please note that Ballinteer Community School has been without a Speech Therapist since the end of October 2000 when Mrs Lucy O'Hagan ceased working there.</P>
    <P>There has been no speech therapist since October 2000. Since that letter I have pursued this matter and I have been going from Billy to Jack. Where is the accountability? I was referred to Mr. Brian Redahan, assistant chief executive, by Louise McMahon. Mr. Redahan referred me to Mr. Martin Gallagher.</P>

I respect your judgment and I will not name people. An internal report was published prior to Christmas regarding speech therapists, which I would like to see.</P>
      <P>It is an indictment of society and the Government that a basic requirement such as speech therapy can become so neglected. It is a necessity, not a luxury. That it has become problematic is indicative of a skewed value system. Who and what do we value in our modern, sophisticated Ireland? We worship before the altar of the market and if we believe in the market, we should learn a basic lesson of supply and demand. If there is a problem with supply, speech therapists should be paid more and better conditions should be created. It is time to act on this. It is terrible that when a Member comes into the House he is given the run around.</P>

      <P>The Deputy has raised a number of issues that have nothing to do with the House, such as typographical errors in letters and confusion between those who have statutory <Col N="119" /> responsibility for the provision of services.

    <Speaker pid="IvorCallely" hpid="Mr. Callely Mr. Callely">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Callely</NameTxt>
      <P>We will not be able to resolve the case raised by the Deputy in the House but I will clarify the position regarding the provision of health-related services to people with disabilities, particularly those within the Eastern Regional Health Authority. The East Coast Area Health Board has regional responsibility for speech and language therapy services in Ballinteeer community school. The board has recently completed a review of such services and the full report will be available shortly. The Department of Education and Science is also undertaking a similar review. Consideration of the issue of the provision of speech and language therapy services within the resources available will form part of that review. Decisions in this regard will affect Ballinteer community school.</P>
      <P>The Deputy referred to the shortage of specialists in this area and he is right. I would like early intervention where speech and language therapy is required so that it is provided without delay. It was recognised a number of years ago that there was a need to increase the number of professional therapists and the Bacon report, published in July 2001, concluded that a major expansion was essential in the number of speech and language therapists, requiring a significant increase in training places to meet the long-term needs of the health service. The report, therefore, advocated an annual increase of 75 training places for speech and language therapy to achieve the fourfold increase in the number of speech and language therapists over the next decade recommended in the report.</P>
      <P>On 29 May 2002 the former Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Woods, announced the provision of 175 extra professional therapy training places for students to tackle the acute shortage of physiotherapists, occupational therapists and speech and language therapists in the health service. This initiative almost doubles the number of therapy places available and it is expected that the first intake to the extra places for speech and language therapy will commence in the 2003-04 academic year. The political will to provide training places has been demonstrated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Other key recommendations of the report include the provision of sufficient clinical placements within the health service through the establishment of a national network of clinical placement co-ordinators; the need for fast-track qualification and review of the existing training system; concerted recruitment from overseas; establishment of the planned system of statutory registration consistent with the requirement for a <Col N="120" /> patient-centred health service; and an examination of career structures.</P>
    <P>In addition to the Bacon report, the Department has asked the Eastern Regional Health Authority and health boards to explore other approaches which might result in the maintenance of an existing level of service provision or an enhancement in line with agreed service developments using the resources allocated to the services. The Northern Area Health Board has undertaken a concentrated overseas recruitment drive for various allied health professionals, including speech and language therapists, on behalf of all health boards. Procedures are being streamlined to minimise the length of time taken to validate foreign qualifications consistent with the over-arching need to ensure that all therapists working in the health sector are appropriately trained and qualified.</P>
    <P>I hope that helps the Deputy in terms of political will and desire to ensure adequate numbers of speech and language and other therapists are provided where there are gaps in services, as has been recognised. We are doing our best.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DanNeville" hpid="Mr. Neville Mr. Neville">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Neville</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate the opportunity to raise this important issue of the provision of a radiotherapy service in the mid-west region, which has been sought for a long time. People in Dublin do not understand how difficult and traumatic it is for those in the mid-west who must access services in Dublin or Cork. I made a proposal to establish a radiotherapy service in the mid-west region for the benefit of parents suffering from cancer. This unique proposal was adopted by the health board at its meeting on 17 January. The proposal is that a public private partnership between the Mid-Western Health Board, the Mid-Western Hospital Development Trust and the Mater Private Hospital, Dublin, should be established in the region.</P>
      <P>The details of the proposal are that the health board would provide a site adjacent to the existing cancer centre in the Mid-West Regional Hospital. Planning permission exists for a radiotherapy unit in the hospital. The development trust would provide the money &ndash; approximately &euro;6 million &ndash; for the building and equipment and the State would not have to provide money. The Mater Private Hospital would be responsible for the operating costs. Currently there are four centres with two private facilities providing radiotherapy. Three of the centres are in Dublin and Cork. This is insufficient to meet demand. The result is long waiting lists for people in the mid-west region in particular. They have difficulty obtaining treatment due to the distance involved and often have to spend six weeks away from home while having treatment in Dublin or Cork.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister of State will appreciate this is extremely stressful for cancer patients and their families. Terminally ill cancer patients require radiotherapy to ease their pain and suffering. We <Col N="121" /> are proposing the establishment of a local unit which would transform the lives of those patients and their families. The Minister of State will be aware that almost three years ago the Minister appointed an expert group to examine the need for radiotherapy services. Perhaps he will tell me what is happening in that area?</P>
    <P>The report has not yet been published and perhaps the Minister of State will indicate when that might happen? Perhaps this forum does not facilitate that. We do not believe that a national radiotherapy service will be provided and the Minister will quote cost as the reason for that decision. He will also quote the current economic climate as has been expressed on the basis that no further funding should be expended on people with intellectual disability.</P>
    <P>There may be other influences against the provision of a radiotherapy unit in the mid-west region. The only funding being sought by the mid-west region from the Exchequer is required to pay for the treatment of public patients. This will amount to approximately &euro;500,000 initially and &euro;1.5 million when the unit is up and running. In doing this there will be no barriers to the treatment of public patients who will have the same access to this unit as patients covered by health care insurance. A great deal of money will be paid into the Exchequer in supporting patients travelling from the mid-west region to Cork or Dublin. This is a golden opportunity to put in place the final component of a world class cancer service for the people of the mid west region. The unit if given the go ahead can be up and running within two years and will put an end to the hardship which sick and vulnerable people from my area are enduring.  </P>
    <Speaker pid="IvorCallely" hpid="Mr. Callely Mr. Callely">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Callely</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Neville for raising this matter on the Adjournment. I am pleased to indicate that I support some of his proposals, in particular the need for full and appropriate world class radiotherapy services. Most people in this House would like to see such a service in place. That is what we are setting out to do.</P>
      <P>The expert review group which was established to examine the appropriate future development of radiotherapy services comprises a mutlidisciplinary team of experts. It has conducted a national assessment of needs for radiotherapy services having regard to the required cancer services and the gaps in the current service provision. Its report will address the following key issues: access to radiotherapy services; the need to provide a high quality, evidenced based service; the need to take account of current and new developments in health technology; the requirements of the system in terms of human resources; international norms in relation to service provision, planning and staffing; and the organisational development of the services in terms of structures and processes which need to be in place.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Neville asked about final editing and publishing of the expert review group's work. It is my understanding that will be published shortly. <Col N="122" /> Whatever report becomes available will be supplied to him. All health boards, including the Mid-Western Health Board, have been afforded the opportunity to meet and make submissions to the group. I am aware that the Mid-Western Health Board has submitted a proposal to the Department of Health and Children regarding the development of radiotherapy services in the region. As the Deputy will appreciate, consideration of this proposal must be informed by the report of the expert group. The provision of additional radiotherapy services will be considered in the context of that report.</P>
    <P>Following consideration of the report, the Minister for Health and Children will submit proposals to Government for discussion. As soon as I am in a position to indicate what progress can be made on the provision of services in the Mid-Western Health Board area I will communicate with the Deputy.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the House for giving me the opportunity to raise this issue. Yesterday's decision by the Supreme Court was an inevitable outcome following a succession of bad and conflicting decisions by various State authorities relating to the M50 motorway at Carrickmines. A number of questions arise. Why did Dúchas give its approval for removal works at Carrickmines Castle without the consent of the National Museum? Why did Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council fail to respond to the question put to it in September 2002? Why in the first instance was the wrong route selected for this motorway? It has resulted in a threat to an important medieval castle site at Carrickmines, has damaged Leopardstown Racecourse and compromised council housing land, at enormous cost to the taxpayer.</P>
      <P>In 1992 the then Dublin County Council identified an alternative route for this motorway which was adopted by it at the time. An environmental impact study was, at the direction of the then Minister for the Environment, ordered on the route eventually chosen. If the route which had been identified by the county council in 1992 had been selected, Carrickmines Castle and Leopardstown Racecourse would not have been involved, the council would have been enabled to keep its housing land and, most importantly, the motorway, long overdue to the motorists and residents of this area, would have been built at considerably less cost to the taxpayer. The public wants answers as to what caused this problem as the motorway is delayed and the costs to the taxpayer are mounting.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Ultimately, responsibility for the Carrickmines debacle rests with the Minister for Transport who is not only responsible for the roads programme but also has local knowledge of the area. The Minister has, I know, been attempting since last summer to resolve the conflicting needs to preserve Carrickmines Castle and its environs and to <Col N="123" /> build the motorway. He has clearly failed in his efforts and must now tell the House what steps he intends to take to resolve this impasse. Carrickmines Castle remains at risk and the motorway needs to be completed. How are both objectives to be met without construction being delayed and costs increased? The Minister must set out how these problems are to be resolved.</P>
    <P>I draw the Minister's attention in that context to the proposal made by my colleague, Proinsias De Rossa, MEP, yesterday that the Minister should use the time given by the court to sit down with all the parties concerned, including the public authorities, Dúchas and the National Museum, and the people of Carrickmines to work out a solution which is acceptable to all concerned. Such a solution, if all interested parties are agreeable to it, would be unlikely to result in a further contest in the courts. It would give the Minister the necessary flexibility to vary the motorway order to allow the necessary engineering adjustments to be made to the motorway in the interests of avoiding further damage to Carrickmines Castle.</P>
    <P>In any event, we now have an unusual situation. The medieval castle site at Carrickmines is at risk and a long overdue motorway has been delayed. Costs are mounting for the taxpayer and State authorities appear to be at sixes and sevens in relation to deciding what to do about it. Only the Minister for Transport can resolve this problem and I ask him to take the initiative in the form of the political steps that are necessary to bring this matter to a conclusion. He should not allow it to continue to be adjudicated on in the courts, a process which involves costs and delays and is not resolving the problem.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMcDaid" hpid="Dr. McDaid Dr. McDaid">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Transport (Dr. McDaid)</NameTxt>
      <P>The implications of the Supreme Court judgment, which granted an injunction restraining Dun Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council from doing work on the Carrickmines Castle section of the south-eastern motorway, are being urgently considered by the county council, the National Roads Authority, which is responsible for the construction of the south-eastern motorway, and the Departments of Transport and the Environment and Local Government. It is not possible at this stage to respond definitively to the Supreme Court judgment or to indicate precisely the action that might be taken in response. Yesterday's judgment means that the completion of the M50 will be delayed as further work cannot be carried out at the castle site pending a full hearing of the issues in the High Court and-or the obtaining of consent under section 14 of the National Monuments Act 1930, as amended.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister for Transport wishes to emphasise that the archaeological importance of the Carrickmines Castle site has always been acknowledged. This is reflected in the archaeological assessment, dating back to 1992, and the major archaeological excavations undertaken <Col N="124" /> since August 2000 at a cost of over &euro;6 million. The Carrickmines site has been excavated and all archaeological finds will be recorded and documented in accordance with best archaeological practice and the approval of Dúchas. The approach adopted in relation to archaeology at Carrickmines involved the preservation <i>in situ</i> of the remaining upstanding section of the castle and the investigation of the castle environs to resolve any archaeological features present by means of excavation and recording. This approach is in line with the environmental impact statement, mentioned by Deputy Gilmore, which was approved by the Minister for the Environment and Local Government in October 1998 and by Dúchas.</P>
    <P>In August 2002, Dun Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council and the NRA submitted a joint report to the Minister for Transport, setting out proposals for the enhanced preservation of archaeology at Carrickmines Castle and responding to earlier proposals made by An Taisce. The Minister for Transport agreed a set of proposals based on this report in September 2002, including raising and tilting the Glenamuck Road roundabout, aimed at preserving extensive areas of the Carrickmines site, while allowing the construction of the south-eastern motorway to proceed on schedule. Every effort has been made to respect the archaeology at the site.</P>
    <P>Work is proceeding on other elements of the south-eastern motorway. While work at Carrickmines has been delayed, it is not possible to be definitive about the impact on the scheme's completion date pending resolution of the current issues. It is clear that it will be delayed, however, as the Supreme Court order prohibits Dun Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council and its agents, including the contractor, from doing any work at the site for some time to come. It is open to the contractor, under the terms of the contract, to make a claim in respect of any delays arising from the disruption and delay to the road construction programme, including delays as a result of archaeological works. While it is not possible to indicate what the overall cost of the claims might be, the county council and the NRA estimate that the cost could between &euro;50,000 and &euro;100,000 per week.</P>
    <P>The Ministers for Transport and the Environment and Local Government are committed, in conjunction with the NRA and the county council, to resolving the situation which has arisen as quickly as possible, to ensure that the completion of a vital piece of transport infrastructure of national significance is not unduly delayed, while at the same time ensuring that archaeological heritage is protected and preserved in accordance with best archaeological practice and the relevant statutory provisions.</P>
    <P>The Dáil adjourned at 9.05 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Wednesday, 26 February 2003.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 121 and 185 together.</P>
      <P>These questions concern the Ombudsman's recent report to the Houses of the Oireachtas on foot of Revenue's refusal to implement fully certain of his recommendations following an investigation carried out by him. In his report the Ombudsman made five recommendations. I understand two of these are being implemented by the Revenue Commissioners. The other three concern the payment of compensation for loss of purchasing power or interest. One of these relates to a general scheme and, as Deputies may be aware, this issue is being dealt with in the Finance Bill currently before the House.</P>
      <P>I assume the Deputy's question relates to recommendations 3 and 4 of the Ombudsman's report which cover individuals who received tax refunds without compensation for loss of purchasing power. The House will be aware from the Ombudsman's report and the evidence given before the Finance and Public Service Committee by the Chairman of the Revenue Commissioners of the particular problems and issues raised for the Revenue Commissioners who must operate within their powers under the law. The House will also be aware that the Minister for Finance does not get involved in individual tax cases. While I appreciate the strength of feeling in the House on the issue, I do not intend to depart from that practice in this instance.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 123 and 270 together.</P>
      <P>I am satisfied with the basis on which the indemnity was given to religious congregations in return for a voluntary contribution of &euro;128 million towards the overall cost of the residential institutions scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I refer the Deputy to my earlier response to Deputy Burton. There are a few points I would like to emphasise. First, the Government had already approved proposals for a residential institutions redress scheme, which formed a major part of its general approach to try to bring some healing and closure to victims of child abuse and recognising its own responsibilities to those victims. It was considered by Government that the <Col N="127" /> religious congregations should be asked to make a meaningful voluntary contribution towards the cost of the scheme. However, it should be emphasised that the Government had already decided to go ahead with a redress scheme even if the religious congregations were not to contribute to the scheme.</P>
    <P>Second, as I also indicated earlier to the House, following the Government approval of the redress scheme a group of officials from the Department of Education and Science, my Department and the Office of the Attorney General met representatives of the religious congregations on a number of occasions during the period February 2001 to October 2001 to explore whether they would make a contribution. It was clear from the early stages of the negotiations with the congregations that they would not participate and contribute to the scheme, without a cap and an indemnity. The decision was taken, following earlier clearance at ministerial level, that the negotiators could propose an approach based on a 50:50 contribution with a cap of £100 million, &euro;127 million, together with an agreement, in principle, to an indemnity to be subsequently drafted between the parties. This was put to the religious congregations at the meeting of 16 October 2001 but was not accepted by them at that stage.</P>
    <P>Following further direct discussions between representatives of the congregations and the Minister for Education and Science during December 2001 and January 2002, the Minister announced, on 30 January 2002, that the Government had agreed, in principle, to a set of proposals whereby the congregations would contribute &euro;128 million to the scheme in return for the indemnity by the State, the details of which had to be subsequently drafted.</P>
    <P>As I mentioned in my earlier reply to Deputy Burton, my Department was represented at a meeting with representatives of the Department of Education and Science and the religious congregations in mid-March 2002 to advance matters. This was followed by meetings between officials from the Department of Education and Science and the Office of the Attorney General and representatives of the religious congregations on the detailed provisions of the indemnity agreement. My Department was not in attendance at those meetings. However, my Department was kept informed of developments generally and met officials from the Department of Education and Science and the Office of the Attorney General in mid-May with a view to concluding matters at official level so that the agreement could be formally submitted to Government.</P>
    <P>As regards the overall costs of the redress scheme, when the Government agreed the indemnity agreement on 5 June 2002, the best information available from the Department of Education and Science was that the estimated cost could be in the range from £200 million to £400 million, &euro;250 million to &euro;500 million. The cost <Col N="128" /> could be higher or lower depending on the actual number of cases and the awards made. The final cost will not be known until the redress board has completed its work, which will be at least three years hence.</P>
    <P>In the event that the costs are considerably greater than originally estimated, I am informed that the agreement contains no renegotiation clause. However, I have no evidence which would indicate that the estimate provided by the Department of Education and Science of likely costs is unreasonable.</P>

      <P>The examination of the State property portfolio by the Commissioners of Public Works with a view to identifying vacant, under-utilised, underdeveloped or surplus property is continuing. To date, the process has produced a number of properties which are considered suitable for more detailed assessment to determine their potential for disposal or redevelopment.</P>
      <P>In assessing these particular properties, a range of considerations will be taken into account, including: the planning issues in the context of their development potential; their condition; the extent to which decisions on decentralisation might impact on them; the alternative use to which they might be put; and their market value.</P>
      <P>When the detailed assessment stage has been completed, final decisions on the disposal-redevelopment of specific properties will be made.

      <P>The 2% stamp duty levied on non-life insurance premiums applies to most categories of non-life insurance business. The exceptions are re-insurance, voluntary health insurance, marine, aviation and transit insurance and export credit insurance. Most EU member states have such a tax, and in most of these it is levied at a significantly higher rate than in Ireland, typically between 9% and 15%.</P>
      <P>The levy applicable to insurance premiums relates to most types of non-life business. The yield since 1997 is as follows:</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 126, 131 and 139 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="130" />One of the key principles underpinning the National Pensions Reserve Fund Act is the fact that the fund is managed by commissioners who are independent of Government. The commissioners control and manage the fund with discretionary authority to determine and implement an investment strategy. The Act requires the commission to follow a strictly commercial investment mandate with the objective of securing the optimal return over the longterm subject to prudent risk management. In following this mandate, the commission has decided on an investment portfolio of 80% equities and 20% bonds.</P>
    <P>These features of the National Pensions Reserve Fund Act are similar to the trustee arrangements which exist in private pension funds. Along with the statutory prohibition on drawdowns from the fund prior to 2025, they insulate the fund from day to day pressures on Government and enable the commission to take a long-term view. This is essential if the purpose for which the fund was established, to meet as much as possible of the cost to the Exchequer of pension payments from 2025 until at least 2055, is to be achieved. I do not intend to propose any change to the provisions of the National Pensions Reserve Fund Act 2000 to direct the commissioners to invest fund moneys in any particular way. There is nothing to prevent the commissioners from investing in housing or other infrastructural projects in Ireland should such investments yield a commercial return.</P>
    <P>A total of &euro;8,163 million has been paid into the NPRF since its inception in April 2001 by way of capital contributions from the Exchequer. The provisional market value of the fund at end 2002 was &euro;7,426 million, that is, there has been a decline of &euro;737 million. This represents a return of -13.3% since the fund's inception, as opposed to a return for the fund's strategic benchmark of -24.4% and a return for the average Irish managed pension fund of -19.3 %.</P>
    <P>The National Pensions Reserve Fund Act places a statutory requirement on the Minister for Finance to make a payment of 1% of GNP into the fund each year. I have no plans to introduce amending legislation to change this requirement.</P>
    <P>To leave discretion in the making of the 1% contribution would, I am convinced, undermine the whole basis of the fund. If discretion were left in the making of the payment of the 1% contribution, it is likely that future Governments would come under pressure to prioritise shorter-term economic goals at the expense of making the payment. It is essential that the mandatory contribution be maintained. Once it is breached for one purpose, it is more likely that it will be breached again.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 127 and 166 together.</P>
      <P>The decision to cap numbers in the public service at the authorised level on 4 December was a Government decision and Departments needed no further directive to implement this decision.</P>
      <P>I indicated after the budget that I had started the process of consulting my ministerial colleagues on where the reduction can be made and that I would not be making any decisions on the distribution of the reduction until I concluded the consultation process.</P>
      <P>I am reviewing the proposals made by Ministers in response to my request for their views on how the reduction could be achieved and in the light of this I will consider how the target can be reached. I will engage in further consultations with my colleagues when my considerations are completed. No other directives or instructions have been issued to Departments regarding the filling of vacancies pending the outcome of my review.</P>
      <P>I remain of the view that the reduction can be achieved through natural wastage and I will be seeking to avoid or minimise the effect on front-line staff providing a service to the public and to ensure that essential services to the public will not be affected by the reduction.</P>

      <P>The Government is committed to moving forward the progressive decentralisation of Government offices and agencies taking the national spatial strategy into account. This commitment was reiterated in An Agreed Programme for Government. As I have said previously, a wide range of important issues, including the national spatial strategy, have to be considered before a final decision is taken on this matter. It is vital that all involved are consulted, be they staff concerned about their futures or departmental managements concerned about the delivery of the public services for which they have responsibility.</P>
      <P>Given these wide ranging considerations it is not possible for me to state, at this time, when the Government will be in a position to take a decision on the issue of decentralisation.

      <P>Exchequer income tax receipts for January 2003 were &euro;712 million, down 10.4% compared with the &euro;795 million received in the same month last year. The Revenue Commissioners' target for income tax for January 2003 was &euro;785 million. Lower than expected receipts from deposit interest retention tax, DIRT, accounts for a large part of the shortfall on the Revenue Commissioners' target for income tax collection. DIRT receipts were &euro;38 million below the amount expected though this was partly due to some payments not being received on time. PAYE receipts in January were only marginally less than the Revenue profile. I would stress, however, that January figures for any of the tax heads are not a reliable indicator of the likely trend for the rest of the year.</P>

      <P>The public service pay agreement under the proposed social partnership agreement, Sustaining Progress, provides for a pay increase of 7% over an 18 month period with an initial six months pay pause. This increase is to apply as follows: 3% from 1 January 2004; 2% from 1 July 2004; and 2% from 1 December 2004. It is estimated that the cost of implementing these increases is &euro;548 million in 2004 and &euro;928 million in 2005.</P>
      <P>In addition to this increase the awards recommended by the Public Service Benchmarking Body would be implemented as follows: 25% of the increases in 2003 backdated to 1 December 2001; 50% of the increases from 1 January 2004; and 25% of the increases from 1 June 2005. The estimated cost of implementing the benchmarking increase is &euro;565 million in 2003, of which &euro;290 million relates to arrears from 1 December 2001, &euro;825 million in 2004 and &euro;985 million in 2005. In the public service the payment of the increases will be dependent on the achievement of measures to modernise the public service and the maintenance of industrial peace.</P>
      <P>It is not possible at this stage to provide an estimate of the cost of several of the commitments made under the agreement as the details of what is to be done is to be the subject of further discussion and examination.</P>

    <P>With regard to redundancy payments, Part 2, &ldquo;Pay and the Workforce&rdquo;, section 3.1 states, <Col N="134" />&ldquo;Agreement to enhance statutory redundancy terms to provide for two weeks pay per year of service, with the abolition of differentiation by age and to retain the bonus week in the calculation of payments.&rdquo;</P>

    <P>With regard to social housing, it is intended that the special affordable housing initiative proposed in the agreement will be a fully commercial exercise with houses being made available for sale on a full-cost recovery basis. Therefore, the initiative will not impact on the Exchequer.</P>

      <P>The arrangements for the composition and appointments to the boards of State bodies are normally set out in the legislation establishing the bodies in question. These arrangements are designed to ensure the efficient management of the individual bodies. Generally, appointments to the boards are made by the Minister with responsibility for <Col N="136" /> the body in question, subject to the consent of the Minister for Finance.</P>
      <P>In making appointments, Ministers must take account of any specific legislative or policy requirements such as those contained in the Workers Participation (State Enterprises) Acts or the Government's policy in relation to gender balance on the boards of State bodies. Typically, Ministers seek to ensure that a selection of people are appointed who will bring a diverse range of relevant skills and experiences to the body. Where appropriate, Ministers may also place a value on having representation from the different strands of society such as the business community, consumers, trades unions or the other social partner groups.</P>
      <P>I am happy with the current arrangements and have no plans at present to introduce a procedure whereby appointments to State boards would be referred to the appropriate Oireachtas committee before confirmation in their positions. The existing arrangements follow the routines and practices of previous Governments.</P>

      <P>The vacancy on the six member executive board of the European Central Bank to which the Deputy is referring arises from the expiry of the non-renewable term of office of Ms Sirkka Hamalainen on 31 May next.</P>
      <P>On the last occasion that such a vacancy arose in May of last year, Mr. Lucas Papademos of Greece replaced Mr. Christian Noyer of France, and while at the time I did not propose an Irish candidate for that position, I did indicate that Ireland would put forward a candidate for the vacancy caused by the ending of Ms Hamalainen's term.</P>
      <P>Article 11.2 of the Protocol on the Statute of the European System of Central Banks and of the European Central Bank states, &ldquo;. . . .  members of the Executive Board shall be appointed from among persons of recognised standing and professional experience in monetary or banking matters. . . . .&rdquo;  It is clear from the appointments made to date that this treaty requirement in regard to both qualifications and standing is being interpreted quite strictly. Of the original six members and one replacement appointed to date, three have been central bank governors, three others held very senior positions in a central bank and the only non-central banker, Mr. Noyer, was formerly head of the French Finance Ministry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Against that background, where the number of credible candidates that any member state can <Col N="137" /> put forward is very limited, where a number of highly qualified candidates are already in the field, and moreover, where the eight year term of office for all new members is so lengthy as to effectively rule out some qualified persons, I recently considered whether an Irish candidate of sufficient standing and closely relevant experience, who was willing to allow his or her name to go forward, might be found. Despite informal approaches being made to a number of people, no such candidate was found.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy)</NameTxt>
      <P>I assume the Deputy is referring to the imposition of taxes with a direct environmental effect. In relation to existing excise taxes, there are two in particular with environmental as well as purely revenue raising characteristics. Vehicle Registration Tax, VRT, broadly relates to engine size and, in turn, there is a general, positive relationship between engine size and CO2 emissions. The recent budget change in relation to the widening of the highest VRT band to include vehicles of 1901cc and over was in line with this established linkage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Excise tax on mineral oils has an impact on usage of products with potentially adverse environmental effects. In my budget in December 2002, I announced an increase in auto diesel of 3 <Col N="138" /> cent per litre, which took effect from budget night. In my previous budget in December 2001, I announced increases in both petrol and auto diesel which took effect from budget night, with a further increase from 1 March 2002 for auto diesel with a higher sulphur content. This measure was designed to encourage a speedy changeover to the use of low sulphur diesel.  In addition to the above, as the Deputy is aware there is a plastic shopping bag levy which is collected by the Revenue Commissioners under the Waste Management (Amendment) Act 2001.</P>
    <P>I said in my budget speech on 4 December 2002, Ireland has international obligations under the Kyoto Protocol to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. For this reason, the Government has asked the relevant Departments to advance the plans for a general carbon energy tax, with a view to introducing this from the end of 2004. This carbon energy tax will be an environmental tax measure. Given the many implications of such a tax, both environmental and economic, there will be full consultations with interested parties on the design of the tax and a reasonable period is being allowed for its effective introduction. There are other taxes or tax reliefs which may have indirect environmental effects or the potential to be used to achieve environmental objectives.</P>

      <Quest>the guidelines from his Department which are in place governing the planning, costing, execution and management of over-runs of public capital projects; and if he has satisfied himself that these guidelines are being faithfully observed.</Quest>
      <QRef>[5430/03]</QRef>
    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy)</NameTxt>
      <P>In accordance with the principles underlying the strategic management initiative, my Department has been for some time pursuing an active policy of maximum delegation to Departments. In relation to large capital programmes, responsibility for individual projects is, therefore, generally delegated to the relevant Department.</P>
      <P>The role of my Department is to set out a clear framework in relation to the management of capital investment. In managing capital projects, Departments are required to comply with my Department's Guidelines for the Appraisal and Management of Capital Expenditure Proposals in the Public Sector.</P>
      <P>These guidelines, which are currently under review by my Department, set out four main stages of project appraisal and management. First, the appraisal stage aims to provide a basis for a decision on whether to approve a project in principle. This stage includes an assessment of uncertainty and risk.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Second, the planning stage involves the establishment of a project management structure, preparation of a design brief, detailed planning and design of the project and a review of costings. If changes are proposed to the project in the <Col N="139" /> course of the planning stage, the guidelines make it clear that the cost implications should be fully appraised and the approval of the sanctioning authority should be sought before proceeding. On receipt of a tender price and other relevant information, the case for proceeding with the proposal is again subject to review. Where it is proposed, following such re-appraisal, to go ahead with a project at a price higher than that originally proposed, a decision will again be required by the sanctioning authority to proceed.</P>
    <P>Third, the implementation stage begins once the final approval for the award of a contract has been secured. If adverse developments occur, including unforeseen costs increases, which call into question the desirability or viability of the project, the sponsoring agency should consider necessary measures to rectify the situation. Where, despite these measures, increased costs are likely to arise, the approval of the sanctioning authority for the extra expenditure should be obtained before any commitment is made to accept cost increases. The viability of the project, given the changed circumstances, should also be reported.</P>
    <P>Fourth, the final stage following the completion of a project, is post project review. Such a review is recommended to evaluate both the outturn and the effectiveness of appraisal and management procedures.</P>
    <P>I am confident that the steps outlined in the guidelines provide sufficient guidance to Departments and agencies for the re-evaluation of projects at key points in the decision making process and that accounting officers are fully aware of the need for ensuring value for money in the consideration of all capital projects.</P>
    <P>As part of the new expenditure management and control arrangements put in place with effect from this year, I intend to agree five-year multi-annual capital investment envelopes with my ministerial colleagues. This arrangement will provide a more secure framework for Departments and implementing agencies in the planning and delivery of capital projects. The arrangement will also see an more explicit link between resources provided and outputs to be achieved and will incorporate a requirement for an adequate contingency provision to cover cost increases likely to impact on capital projects.</P>

      <Quest>the projected level of inflation for 2003 based on the latest information available to his Department; the way in which this compares with the projected EU average; the impact he expects the anti-inflationary measures agreed in the recent national talks to have on the consumer price index; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 143, 156 and 168 together.</P>
      <P>On budget day, inflation, as measured by annual changes in the consumer price index, CPI, was projected to average 4.8% in 2003. This forecast was, as always, based on the technical assumption of unchanged interest rates. Since budget day, the ECB cut interest rates, and this will have a favourable impact on the CPI this year. My Department will publish a Revised Estimate in the Economic Review and Outlook in the summer.</P>
      <P>In terms of EU comparisons, the appropriate measure of inflation is the harmonised index of consumer prices, HICP. HICP inflation for Ireland for 2003 as a whole was forecast to be 4.2% on budget day. The most recent international forecasts for inflation in the EU are those of the OECD, published in December 2002, which estimate that HICP inflation in the euro area will be 2.2% this year.</P>
      <P>For a variety of reasons, Irish inflation has been exceeding the EU norm for some time. This has been due partly to external factors, partly to the process of Ireland catching up in growth terms with the rest of Europe and partly to domestic factors. This last reason is where we must concentrate our efforts.</P>
      <P>In this context, the adoption of the pay arrangements set out under the draft new social partnership agreement, Sustaining Progress, is important. By ensuring that wage increases are kept to sustainable levels we can continue to focus on our competitiveness and avoid losing jobs. Also important will be the implementation over the next 18 months of the anti-inflation initiative agreed by Government, employers and union leaders, to target key domestic sources of inflationary pressure.</P>

      <P>Following the recommendations of the Review Body on Higher Remuneration in the Public Sector in its report dated 25 September 2000, the Government decided to replace the then existing scheme in the <Col N="141" /> Civil Service with a new scheme of performance-related awards and to introduce the new scheme in the Garda Síochána and the Defence Forces. The new scheme applies to Civil Service posts at the levels of assistant secretary and deputy secretary and to comparable posts in the Garda Síochána and the Defence Forces. The scheme applies with effect from 1 January 2002 in the Civil Service and with effect from 1 May 2002 in the other areas.</P>
      <P>Decisions on performance-related awards for individual posts will be made by the Committee of Performance Awards based on recommendations from Secretaries General in the case of the Civil Service, the Garda Commissioner or the Chief of Staff of the Defence Forces. The committee comprises the Secretary General, public service management and development, Department of Finance, the Secretary General to the Government and three members from the private sector. Decisions on awards will be based on an assessment of performance against pre-set objectives. The individual objectives will vary from area to area, but will go beyond the normal requirements of the jobs and will be derived from the strategy statements for the organisations.</P>
      <P>The funding for awards is based on 10% of the payroll for the posts covered by the scheme. Within this overall limit payments of up to 20% can be made to individuals. The amount available for awards is in the region of &euro;2 million. The awards in respect of 2002 are under consideration at present and decisions have not yet been made.</P>

      <P>In its programme, the Government has reaffirmed that the Stability and Growth Pact provides the overall framework for Ireland's budgetary policy.</P>
      <P>I believe that the financial discipline that has resulted from the Stability and Growth Pact has been good for Europe. This can be clearly seen when one compares the lower level of budget deficits and debt in Europe in 2002 as against 1997.</P>
      <P>In my view, budgetary policies must continue to be geared towards sustainability and meeting the requirements of the Stability and Growth Pact. Achieving budgetary positions &ldquo;close to balance or in surplus over the medium term&rdquo; is a key target for this purpose.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I said in the House on 20 February in reply to Second Stage of the Finance Bill 2003, the essential message of the Stability and Growth Pact is that through fiscal prudence we can ensure economic growth and financial stability. Low debt, low deficits and sound fiscal policies are the bedrock of this policy. Furthermore, as I made clear in the House, we are not following these <Col N="142" /> policies simply because of EU rules but because they make sound sense in themselves.</P>

      <P>The main developments at the ECOFIN Council of 18 February included a number of matters. Under the item, preparation of spring European Council of 21 March 2003, the Council examined: the Lisbon strategy and the broad economic policy guidelines, BEPGs; a comprehensive report on Eurozone statistics and indicators; and the Commission's communication on strengthening the co-ordination of budgetary policies.</P>
      <P>With regard to broad economic policy guidelines, following a presentation by Commissioner Solbes, the Council held a first exchange of views on the Lisbon strategy based on the Commission's synthesis report. It also discussed the first elements for a key issues paper for the 2003 BEPGs on the basis of a draft text prepared by the Greek Presidency. Following the debate, the Council instructed its relevant preparatory bodies to further examine the areas that need to be tackled with a view to presenting a final draft of the Key Issues Paper at the next ECOFIN Council on 7 March 2003.</P>
      <P>The Council also adopted conclusions on the Commission's implementation report on the 2002 BEPGs. According to the conclusions, reforms in the EU labour market have started to pay off as evidenced by the increase in the job content of growth. However, the European economies still have a long way to go to fulfil the objectives of the Lisbon strategy.</P>
      <P>The implementation report notes that Ireland is among the middle group of member states in terms of follow-up on country-specific parts of the BEPGs. The report notes in respect of Ireland that:</P>
      <P>Some progress was made in following up the finance recommendations. While the fiscal stance in 2002 is likely to have been expansionary rather than broadly neutral as recommended, some measures were taken to improve expenditure control and new ones were announced at the end of 2002.</P>
      <P>With regard to Eurozone statistics and indicators, the Council and the Commission adopted a joint report on Eurozone statistics and indicators and decided to forward it to the spring European Council. The Council and the Commission invited the European Council to support the further development of European macro-economic statistics based on sound methodological principles.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to strengthening the co-ordination of budgetary policies, in November 2002, the <Col N="143" /> European Commission published new proposals for strengthening budgetary co-ordination, including proposals relating to the implementation of the Stability and Growth Pact. The issue remains the subject of further discussion. It is due to be finalised at the spring European Council in March.</P>
    <P>With regard to the governing council of the ECB, the Council discussed the issue of the voting modalities of the governing council of the European Central Bank, ECB. The Council took note of the ECB's recommendation in the matter and called on the Permanent Representatives Committee to undertake an examination of it with a view to preparing the matter for final consideration by ECOFIN at its meeting of 7 March.</P>
    <P>With regard to the Stability and Growth Pact, the Council examined the updated stability and convergence programmes for Belgium, Ireland, Spain, Denmark and the United Kingdom. In the opinion on Ireland, the Council welcomed the commitment of the Government to have the Stability and Growth Pact provide the framework for its budgetary policy. The opinion noted that under the programme for Ireland the deficit would stabilise at 1.2% of GDP in 2005 and that the targets imply an underlying deficit of around 0.5% of GDP in each year, reaching a level of close-to-balance or in surplus by the end of the period to 2005.</P>
    <P>The opinion urged the Irish authorities to ensure that the budgetary stance is implemented as planned in the programme. It also welcomed the range of measures outlined in the programme to improve the management and control of public expenditure. According to the opinion, Ireland, with its low debt level and gradual build-up of assets in the national pensions reserve fund, seemed to be in a relatively strong position to cope with the budgetary impact of ageing populations. On inflation, the opinion urged that the projected downward path be attained in order to preserve competitiveness and price stability.</P>
    <P>With regard to taxation, the Council decided to postpone the discussion on energy taxation until its next meeting on 7 March. The Council reached political agreement on the text of the new regulation on administrative co-operation in the field of value added tax and on the Directive amending Council Directive 77/799 concerning mutual assistance in the area of direct taxation, pending and subject to the opinion of the European Parliament. The Council instructed the Permanent Representatives Committee to finalise the legal texts of the draft regulation and the draft directive with a view to adopting them in due course.</P>
    <P>With regard to the Financial Services Committee, the Council adopted a decision establishing the Financial Services Committee, FSC, to replace the Financial Services Policy Group. The FSC will advise the Council and the Commission on financial market issues. It will report to the Economic and Finance Committee in order to prepare advice to the Council.</P>

      <P>The stamp duty code is reviewed by my Department and by the Revenue Commissioners on an ongoing basis, particularly in the context of the budget and Finance Bill process. There are various provisions in the Finance Bill 2003 which, if enacted, will all effect changes in the stamp duty code. Also, the tax strategy group reviews the operation of all taxes, including stamp duty, on a regular basis.</P>
      <P>Significant issues arising from these reviews are brought to my attention by my Department. I should point out that stamp duty is an important source of revenue to the Exchequer and yielded &euro;1,167 million in 2002, which amounted to 4% of total tax revenue.</P>

      <P>I provide every support which I consider appropriate to the Revenue Commissioners in carrying out their task of ensuring that everyone is tax compliant, and as I confirmed in response to an earlier question on this matter on 10 December 2002, the Commissioners consider that ongoing implementation of the efforts and initiatives they are putting in place should result, over time, in a significant improvement in compliance.</P>
      <P>The Revenue Commissioners have at their disposal a significant body of enhanced audit and investigative powers, much of which was provided during my term of office as Minister for Finance. I also provided them with over 400 additional staff in the past two years, most of which have been deployed in the audit and compliance areas.</P>
      <P>The commissioners will shortly be publishing their Statement of Strategy 2003-2005, which I recently approved. This statement contains a very strong emphasis on maximising compliance with tax and customs legislation and outlines a number of related key objectives and supporting strategies. In addition, the Commissioners inform me that they have recently advanced a number of key developments which will have a significant impact on tax compliance: a prosecutions division has been established to deal with prosecution of persons involved in serious tax evasion. Additional staff have been allocated to that division to give it the extra capacity it needs and to ensure that a reasonable number of serious evasion cases are investigated each year with a view to prosecution; a large cases division has been established with specific focus on large companies and wealthy individuals. This division is preparing a comprehensive analysis of the issues relating to large companies and wealthy individuals, in particular those which pose a risk to tax revenues across all the taxes and duties payable to the Exchequer; a computerised risk based selection system is under development and will be brought into operation this year. This system will, when fully operational, allow for the screening of all tax returns against sectoral and business profiles and will provide a sophisticated selection basis for cases for audit; a new code of practice for Revenue audits is now in place. This outlines clearly the consequences of non-compliance and the penalty provisions which apply in such cases; increased resources have been applied to audit programmes and ongoing training programmes are in place to ensure that all Revenue auditors have the necessary knowledge and skills to audit effectively and efficiently; and a comprehensive strategy to improve tax returns compliance is at an advanced stage of consideration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="147" />The Revenue Commissioners are undergoing a fundamental restructuring with a view to increased efficiencies in managing the tax system. The Revenue Commissioners have informed me that this restructuring will facilitate the delivery of a sharp, uncompromising response to evasion and default while providing high quality services to the compliant. There will be a more integrated approach to case monitoring and more flexibility in focusing resources on non compliance in all its formats.</P>
    <P>The commissioners consider that the implementation of these efforts and initiatives will result, over time, in continued improvement in compliance.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy)</NameTxt>
      <P>In responding to this question it is important to explain the context of the link between the implementation of the recommendations of the Public Service Benchmarking Body and the modernisation agenda set out in the public service pay agreement under the proposed social partnership agreement 2003-05, Sustaining Progress.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The recommendations of the Public Service Benchmarking Body were based on a comparison of pay and jobs across the public service and the wider economy. However, the body pointed out that change is accepted as an essential and ongoing criterion of survival, growth and prosperity in the private sector and said that the same considerations were a key requirement in the achievement of greater efficiency and effectiveness in the public service. Accordingly, the body <Col N="148" /> said that implementation of its pay awards should be made conditional on agreement on issues of adaptability, change, flexibility and modernisation. The body further recommended that appropriate validation processes be established in this context.</P>
    <P>As Sustaining Progress has only just been finalised, it is premature to assess the impact of the public service modernisation provisions that it contains in terms of output or service improvements. I can say, however, that securing improvements in the quality and effectiveness of public services is central to achieving the agreed objectives of Sustaining Progress. This is reflected in the large number of commitments applying to the public service in the agreement on co-operation with flexibility and ongoing change, satisfactory implementation of the agenda for modernisation, the maintenance of stable industrial relations and the absence of industrial action.</P>
    <P>The implementation of these commitments will result in very considerable improvements in output and quality right across all sectors of the public service over the duration of the agreement which will also continue into the foreseeable future. Furthermore, the active pursuit by the Government of this modernisation programme to achieve better value for money is an important element of the anti-inflation initiative in the agreement. The Government's determination to ensure value for money is also reflected in the provision in the agreement that the payment of not only the final two phases of the benchmarking increase but also the general round increases of the agreement is dependent &ndash; in the case of each sector, organisation and grade in the public service &ndash; on verified satisfactory achievement of the commitments which it contains.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that the outcome of the improvements arising from the implementation of the modernisation commitments in Sustaining Progress will be a public service comparable in quality with that in any other country. This, as well as the rationalisation of the process of public service pay determination resulting from benchmarking, will be worth the cost of the pay increases involved.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 155 and 158 together.</P>
      <P>All Government Departments have a responsibility as regards the evaluation of the efficiency and effectiveness of public spending. There are a variety of evaluation measures in place. These include reviews conducted by individual Departments under the expenditure review initiative, value-for-money audits undertaken by the Comptroller and Auditor General, and national development plan &ndash; NDP &ndash; evaluations.</P>
      <P>The current expenditure review plan of my Department under the expenditure review initiative includes the review of three programmes in the Department's Vote. These programmes are the Institute of Public Administration, the change management fund and the payments to the promoters of certain charitable lotteries. Work is under way on these reviews, and they are scheduled to be completed by the end of April 2003, in accordance with the timeframe for the expenditure review initiative &ndash; 2002-2004.</P>
      <P>A review of the PEACE programme is also under consideration in the context of the mid-term evaluation to be carried out by the special EU programmes body under the requirements of the EU Structural Fund regulations.</P>
      <P>In the past 12 months, the NDP-CSF evaluation unit, an independent unit under the aegis of my Department, completed a number of evaluation of programmes under the NDP. It has a number of further evaluations under way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My Department has issued guidelines to Departments on the general principles underpinning evaluation under the expenditure review initiative. It has also organised and delivered training on the various stages in evaluation, and staff from my Department have participated in this training. I am satisfied, therefore, that the <Col N="150" /> appropriate evaluation techniques will be applied in the conduct of the expenditure reviews in my Department. For its part, specialised expertise in evaluation is available to the independent NDP-CSF evaluation unit in the conduct of its evaluations under the NDP.</P>

      <P>The issue of the Tobin tax on currency speculation has been considered in a number of fora, including the informal ECOFIN meeting at Liege on 22 September 2001. The Belgian Presidency indicated that it wished to pursue the matter in the context of a general study to be carried out by the European Commission on the issue of globalisation. However, it would be fair to say that most Finance Ministers, myself included, continue to have reservations about the Tobin tax proposal and believed it was not clear that a further examination of the issue by the Commission would ensure that satisfactory answers would be given to the many real questions concerning the tax, including the difficulties relating to practical implementation of the tax; its doubtful effect on short-term speculative capital movements; its conflict with the basic tenet of free capital movement in the EU; its disproportionate effect on small business and consumers; the probability that the tax would simply drive participants into other non-taxable alternatives; and the negative impact on liquidity in the foreign exchange market.</P>
      <P>Nevertheless, at a formal ECOFIN meeting on 16 October 2001, it was agreed that the Commission would carry out a study on globalisation and that this study would examine the arguments for and against a Tobin tax. This study, entitled Responses to the Challenges of Globalisation, was published on 14 February 2002. On the matter of the Tobin tax, the study concluded that &ldquo;while as a source of additional revenue a currency transaction tax may look appealing, its feasibility is, however, not demonstrated&rdquo;. There have been no developments at EU level since in regard to the possible introduction of such a tax. I am informed that votes have been passed over the past two years in the French and Belgian Parliaments in support of the principle of a Tobin tax. However, neither country has implemented such a tax, nor appears likely to do so in the foreseeable future. I remain unconvinced of the feasibility of such a tax.</P>

      <P>The Public Service Benchmarking Body was established as an independent body in July 2000 under the terms of the PPF to examine public service pay and jobs by comparison with the private sector. The body reported in July 2002.</P>
      <P>It was agreed, as part of the adjustment to the PPF, that there would be discussions about the implementation of the report and also that one quarter of any increases recommended would be paid retrospectively from 1 December 2001. The body also recommended that the payment of the balance of the increases recommended should be dependent on real outputs from modernisation, change, adaptability and flexibility. In addition, the outputs should be capable of verification.</P>
      <P>Agreement between the public service employers and public service unions on the implementation of the benchmarking body's report have been reached in the context of the new national agreement, Sustaining Progress. If ratified by the unions, one quarter of the benchmarking increases will become payable with effect from 1 December 2001, 50% of the increases will be payable from 1 January 2004 and 25% will be payable from 1 June 2005.</P>
      <P>The agreement also sets out the conditions applying to the payment of the increases, other than the first quarter, as recommended by the benchmarking body. Briefly, the payment of the increases is dependent on industrial stability, co-operation with change and flexibility and on achievement of a number of specific commitments in each sector. The adherence to these conditions and their timely achievement will be verified by a process set out in section 26 of the agreement. This should ensure that the payment of the increases will only be made on the basis of real and verified changes as recommended by the benchmarking body.</P>

      <P>Net voted spending in January 2003 was 32.8% up on spending in the comparable period last year and this is broadly in line with the profiled spending patterns for the month which I published on 31 January last.</P>
      <P>While some timing factors have impacted on the year-on-year increase, the Deputy will be aware that January is not a good indicator of the trend in spending for the year as a whole. Small swings are magnified by the shortness of the period under comparison.</P>
      <P>The pattern of payments to the local government fund is an example of the timing factors impacting on the January figures. A payment of the order of &euro;130 million was made to the fund in January 2003 while similar payments did not begin until April last year. A timing issue which reduced the January 2002 base by &euro;115 million also arose in relation to the Department of Social and Family Affairs.</P>

      <P>On 16 April 2002 I published the Central Bank and Financial Services Authority of Ireland Bill 2002. The main purpose of the Bill is to provide for the co-ordination of the ESCB-related functions of the Central Bank and the functions of a single regulatory authority for financial services. These will be carried out within the overall structure of the Central Bank and Financial Services Authority of Ireland.</P>
      <P>The Bill, which recently completed Committee Stage in the Dáil, will establish a new entity, the Irish Financial Services Regulatory Authority, to manage the supervision of financial institutions in Ireland. This entity will operate within the Central Bank's legal structure, but will have its own chief executive, chairperson and members with independent functions. The chief executive, chairperson and some members of IFSRA will also be members of the Central Bank and Financial Services Authority of Ireland Board. I am hopeful that the Bill will be enacted soon, with a view to the new structures being established expeditiously.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>An interim authority was appointed in tandem with the publication of the Bill to manage the transition to the new regulatory arrangements. The appointment of the interim authority has facilitated important work to date towards ensuring a smooth transition. Following an open recruitment process, a chief executive designate was appointed by the interim authority in November 2002 and the consumer director was <Col N="154" /> appointed last month. A selection process for the other statutory posts, provided for by the legislation, is under way. It is intended that the interim authority will become the statutory authority on its establishment. I have met the chairman of the interim authority on several occasions in order that he can update me on progress with the arrangements for the transition to the new structures, and I am satisfied that good progress is being made in this regard.</P>
    <P>A companion Bill is expected to be published later this year. This second Bill will implement further recommendations contained in the McDowell report, such as the establishment of a statutory financial services ombudsman scheme and of a consumer and practitioner forum via consultative panels. It will also address issues arising from the recommendations of the report of the review group on auditing.</P>

      <P>The total number of such cases in which settlements have been reached or awards have been made is 11 and the total amount paid to date in respect of compensation and legal costs is &euro;1,020,000. These 11 cases arose prior to the assignment to the State claims agency of the handling of such cases.</P>
      <P>The State claims agency is currently handling 506 claims for damages against the State for alleged exposure to asbestos. None of these has been settled and, since they are in judicial process, it would be inappropriate for me to comment further on any of them. However, arising from the case recently concluded by the Supreme Court, I reiterate my strong welcome to the unanimous decision allowing the appeal by the Commissioners of Public Works. Without prejudice to the merits of any of the cases still in process, I reaffirm my determination that all arms of the State will vigorously defend the dramatically increasing number of compensation claims taken at central and local government level and beyond.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Commentary on such claims often seems to overlook the fact that it is the taxpayers of Ireland who have to meet the cost of awards and settlements, and the substantial associated legal costs. Apart from the direct costs, the constant threat of compensation claims inhibits the provision and extension of desirable public services while, on a wider front, the effect on insurance premia and hence competitiveness threatens the livelihood of many thousands of workers. As Minister for Finance, I fully intend to honour my <Col N="155" /> fiduciary obligations to every taxpayer and to eliminate any perception that the State might be seen as a &ldquo;soft touch&rdquo; for compensation claims.</P>

      <P>The euro is currently trading higher against the US dollar and sterling than at the same time last year. The appreciation of the euro affects the economy in a number of different ways.</P>
      <P>On the positive side, it lowers inflation by reducing input prices and reduces oil prices, as oil is invoiced in US dollars. However, it also reduces the competitiveness of Irish firms exporting to the UK and US and of firms competing with US and UK firms in third country markets. In addition, by diminishing the competitiveness of the euro area, it lessens demand for Irish goods and services in the euro area.</P>
      <P>That is why competitiveness is a priority for this Government. We must remain vigilant to the risks to our competitiveness such as wage and price inflation, otherwise jobs will be at risk.</P>

      <P>As I have stated on several occasions in the recent past, I am increasingly concerned at the ongoing and cumulative costs of tribunals of inquiry established over the past number of years. I am particularly concerned at the legal costs falling on the taxpayer from such tribunals.</P>
      <P>The Office of the Attorney General negotiates the rates paid to legal counsel for the State and the tribunals. However, the major legal costs on the Exchequer in the case of tribunals of inquiry arise from the award of costs by the tribunal to other parties legally represented at the tribunals.

      <Quest>if the cross-departmental team on infrastructure and public private partnerships has calculated the cost of the major infrastructure as outlined in the National Development Plan 2000-2006 at present day cost levels compared to the 2000 level; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy)</NameTxt>
      <P>Taking account of the recent Fitzpatrick evaluation of the NDP roads programme and based on other assumptions, the cross-departmental team on housing, infrastructure and PPPs has carried out an assessment of total cost of completing the economic and social infrastructure operational programme of the NDP. This assessment indicates that the cost to complete the overall NDP economic and social infrastructure operational programme is estimated at &euro;40 billion approximately in 2002 prices as compared to &euro;26 billion, nominal prices, when the operational programme was published in January 2001.</P>
      <P>As I indicated in my budget speech this escalation reflects cost increases which have impacted adversely on the NDP infrastructure programme. There have been a number of reasons for the increase in costs. These have been highlighted in particular in the recent Fitzpatrick evaluation of investment in the road network. First, over the first three years of the plan construction costs have increased by considerably more than the 19% originally assumed. The Department of the Environment and Local Government, in its most recent Construction Industry Review and Outlook, has estimated an increase in civil engineering costs of 42% over the four year period 1998-2001 with the NRA estimating tender price inflation of 54% over the same period. A second factor has been the significant increase in land costs, which directly impacts upon the costs of construction. Third, delays due to the foot and mouth crisis, environmental concerns and compliance with consent procedures have all increased costs. Finally, a number of project costs were also initially underestimated or projects have been respecified since the start of the NDP.</P>
      <P>I would, however, also point out that over the first three years of the plan the Exchequer investment in infrastructure has amounted to &euro;9 billion or about &euro;1 billion more than the original commitment. While it is clear that the cost increases will impact adversely on the timescale for completion of the NDP infrastructure programme, good progress is being made and the plan is funding projects of unprecedented size, particularly in the area of transport. A comprehensive estimate of the total cost, based on a consistent set of assumptions across sectors will not be available until the completion of the mid-term review of the economic and social infrastructure operational programme later this year.</P>

      <P>I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that the specific facts of each case must be examined to determine whether a specific award under the Employment Equality Act 1998, or the Maternity Protection Act 1994, is taxable or not. However, it has consistently been the view of the Revenue Commissioners that, in general, these types of awards are liable to income tax. This view is based on the wide-ranging provisions of the legislation governing the taxation of income from offices and employments as set out in section 112 of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997.</P>
      <P>In general, the type of awards referred to by the Deputy are payable by employers for breach of employees rights under the respective Acts. Such awards arise as a consequence of holding an office or employment. Therefore, they would generally be regarded as falling within the relevant definitions in the legislation and would be chargeable to income tax.</P>
      <P>However, in certain circumstances, where the making of the award is connected with the termination of the employment, the award may be chargeable to tax under the particular rules governing such terminations i.e. section 123 of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997. In such cases, all or part of the award may be exempted from tax, depending on the amount of the award and the number of years service in the employment. The first &euro;10,160 plus &euro;765 for each year of service is exempted from income tax. This exemption can be increased by a further amount of up to &euro;10,000 where the individual has not previously received a lump sum payment on termination of employment within the previous ten years. I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that, as the tax due on such awards is collectible through the PAYE system, there are no separate statistics available on the amount of tax levied on such awards since 1998 as requested by the Deputy.</P>

      <P>The EU proposal to amend Directive 92/81/EEC to reduce the rate of excise duty on biofuels is now <Col N="158" /> being considered as part of the proposal for an energy taxation directive. This proposal is at an advanced stage of discussion in the Council of Economic and Finance Ministers. One of the provisions in the proposal would allow member states to grant relief or exemptions from excise duty on biofuels. Such relief or exemption would be discretionary on the part of member states.</P>
      <P>The subject of biofuel production falls within the remit of the Department of Transport. The Department of Transport has informed my Department that Sustainable Energy Ireland has commissioned a paper from Teagasc on the current position regarding liquid biofuels in Ireland. The paper, due shortly, will lay out strategic options for the sector. The Department of Transport will review the paper in the context of implementing the forthcoming EU directive on the promotion of the use of biofuels. It intends to develop a strategy that takes account of the different interests involved. Pending the outcome of the paper referred to above, and consideration of same by the relevant Department, it would be premature to examine the question of excise duty relief for biofuels.</P>

      <P>As I announced in my budget speech on 4 December 2002, we have international obligations under the Kyoto Protocol to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. For this reason, the Government has asked the relevant Departments to advance the plans for a general carbon energy tax, with a view to introducing this from the end of 2004. In general, a carbon energy tax is being considered in the context of taxation which would be additional to existing excise tax imposed on the same products. It would be inappropriate for me to speculate at this early stage what taxation measures may or may not be introduced, or whether the revenue from any carbon energy taxation would be used to reduce other taxes or would be used to fund necessary public services.</P>

      <P>As I indicated in response to similar questions on Tuesday, 12 November 2002 and on Tuesday, 10 <Col N="159" /> December 2002, the tax status of these payments depends on the circumstances of the payment. If the payment was in the nature of income, the payment would be subject to income tax. If the payment was a gift which falls within the definition of a taxable gift in capital tax law, tax under that heading would be payable. Whether or not a payment is considered to be corrupt, as such, is of little or no importance in tax law. Section 58 of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 provides for taxation of profits or gains which arise from an unlawful or unknown source of activity. All of the payments referred to in the Flood tribunal report are the subject of continuing tax inquiries in the investigation branch of the Revenue Commissioners.</P>
      <P>The Revenue Commissioners have advised me that the public proceedings of the tribunal are carefully monitored by their investigation branch staff and, where it appears that taxation issues arise, these issues are noted for inquiry. Depending on the results of these inquiries, the cases are noted for full investigation. A total of 82 cases related to the Flood tribunal are already under investigation and a further 32 cases have been noted for investigation as soon as possible.

The main issues of concern highlighted in the report had previously been identified by the commissioners themselves and measures to address them had and are being implemented. As acknowledged in the Comptroller and Auditor General's report, the fact that the building maintenance service incurred a trading loss on its operations does not mean that taxpayers incurred a loss of that amount. All of the building maintenance services charged clients are public sector bodies, so the trading losses represent, in the first instance, a failure to charge other central government agencies the full cost of work carried out. The charge out rates has recently been revised. The Deputy will be pleased to know that the building maintenance service will return a notional profit for 2002.</P>

The Government decided accordingly and I published the report on 9 January 2003. I also sent copies of the report to the Committee of Public Accounts and to the Clerks of the Dáil and Seanad in view of the suggestion made in the report about the role of Oireachtas committees in evaluating departmental strategy statements and the performance of Secretaries General.

      <P>The most recent progress report for the National Development Plan 2000-2006, which was presented to the NDP-CSF monitoring committee on 29 November last, illustrates that the plan is generally achieving good financial progress. Cumulative expenditure under the national development plan to the end of June 2002, the latest figure available, is over &euro;15.4 billion. It is estimated that expenditure to the end of 2002 will total almost &euro;20 billion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="161" />NDP Exchequer investment in the key area of economic and social infrastructure, ESIOP, is well ahead of target. Taking account of the 2003 NDP capital provisions, including the budget day addition of &euro;209 million, it is estimated that by the end of 2003 ESIOP Exchequer investment will be &euro;12.2 billion almost &euro;1.9 billion more than profiled. I acknowledged in my Budget Statement that cost increases have impacted adversely on the output and timescale of the NDP infrastructure programme but nonetheless significant physical activity is in progress under the programme, including some projects unprecedented in scale and size.</P>
    <P>As regards the rest of the NDP, the employment and human resources development operational programme is making good progress and cumulative expenditure is expected to be about &euro;6 billion by the end of 2002. The productive sector and regional operational programmes are behind target levels due to the downturn in the global economy and factors such as delays in state aids approval from the EU and the impact of the foot and mouth crisis. Preparations for the mid-term review of the national development plan are well under way. The mid-term evaluators for each of the operational programmes have been appointed and the overall NDP-CSF evaluators will be appointed in March. These evaluations will form the basis of the mid-term review of the plan as a whole and this will be completed towards the end of this year.</P>

      <Quest>the number of High Court orders sought to date by the Revenue Commissioners under the Finance Act 1999, to require financial institutions to supply names, addresses and other relevant information regarding holders of bogus accounts; the number of cases where orders have been granted; the general progress made to date in identifying the holders of such accounts who did not avail of the recent voluntary disclosure scheme; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy)</NameTxt>
      <P>Authorised Revenue officers are empowered to make an application to a judge of the High Court seeking an order requiring financial institutions to supply names, addresses and other relevant information concerning account holders who may have held bogus non-resident deposit accounts. Such applications are made under section 908 of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997, as amended by the Finance Act 1999. I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that information supplied by the financial institutions under section 908 orders will be the principal basis of identifying bogus non-resident account holders who did not avail of the voluntary disclosure scheme in 2001. This <Col N="162" /> inquiry work commenced on 16 November 2001.</P>
      <P>I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that 17 applications for orders under section 908 have been made and granted. When one includes institutions which have been taken over or amalgamated with other institutions, these orders seek information in respect of accounts in 23 financial institutions. One other application has been made to the High Court in relation to one other deposit taker. Information that is supplied by deposit takers under court orders is becoming available on a phased basis. Work commenced in February 2002 on the initial lists of more than 1,800 account holders identified in the DIRT look-back audits. Very large volumes of information are being reported to Revenue under the High Court orders. Letters issued to the first batch of taxpayers on 11 October 2002. A further issue of inquiry letters was made on the 20 January 2003. This inquiry work relates to 35,000 non-resident accounts that had 70,000 Irish addresses connected with them. As further information is received, more inquiries will be made on a phased basis.</P>
      <P>While it is clear that Revenue is facing a long programme of investigations over a number of years, the commissioners have informed me that they are satisfied that significant progress is being made in this new phase of the investigations. Since 15 November 2001, which was the deadline for the voluntary disclosure scheme, payments of &euro;131 million have been made to Revenue by taxpayers who held bogus non-resident accounts. The commissioners inform me that in recent weeks tax offices have been contacted by many recipients of the 20 January 2003 letters who are indicating their intention to make payments by the deadline of 27 March 2003 and it has been clarified that some others have no further tax liability. The commissioners also inform me that they intend to proceed with enforcement action against those account holders who did not respond to the 11 October 2002 inquiry letter.</P>

Rather, it is a 20 year framework which will inform and guide all other Government policies including public investment policies. The national development plan accounts for 80% of Exchequer spending under the public capital programme. The Deputy may wish to note that the mid-term review of the NDP, which is due to take place in 2003, will be informed by all relevant key policy developments since the plan <Col N="163" /> was launched in 1999, including the national spatial strategy.</P>

In certain circumstances, section 65 of the Finance Bill will impose a capital gains tax charge in respect of a deemed disposal of certain assets owned by an individual on the last day of the last year of assessment for which the individual is taxable in the State, prior to becoming taxable elsewhere, where the individual disposes of these assets while resident outside the State and returns to the State within five years.</P>

      <P>I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that in 1998 they obtained details of 430 cases with investments made under the clerical medical insurance-NIB schemes. To date, 361 of these cases have been settled and 69 remain to be finalised. Of the cases not yet finalised, six are being dealt with in the Revenue prosecution division. Currently, two of these cases are before the courts. One pleaded guilty and is adjourned for sentence. The other was referred to the Circuit <Col N="164" /> Court for trial. A prosecution has been directed by the DPP in two of these cases and these are being further processed. Two other cases are under ongoing investigation with a view to prosecution.</P>
      <P>To date, Revenue has collected &euro;43 million in tax, interest and penalties in respect of these cases. This is made up of &euro;36.48 million in settled cases and &euro;6.52 million in respect of payments on account in cases still under investigation. As part of a further review of its records by the financial institution concerned, a supplementary list containing 22 new cases was received by Revenue in April 2001. Of these, 15 cases involve relatively small sums and are unlikely to involve substantial tax evasion. All the additional cases are being investigated as appropriate.</P>

      <P>The latest date for which figures are available for the number of special saving incentive accounts, SSIA, opened is 30 April 2002. The total number of accounts that had commenced by that date was 1,170,208. Details of the number of active accounts on the 31 December 2002 will shortly be available when all SSIA managers submit the 2002 annual return. The due date for submission of this return to the Revenue Commissioners is 28 February 2003. The current average subscription per month is not available as the savings managers only make a detailed return once a year <Col N="165" /> as indicated. However, the average monthly subscription at 30 April 2002 was &euro;148.</P>
      <P>It is impossible to give a definitive answer as to the eventual cost of the scheme as it is subject to a number of variables such as where participants die, withdraw from the scheme or vary their monthly contributions. The most recent monthly figures available in respect of the scheme are the subscriptions to 31 December 2002. The tax credit payout made in January 2003 in respect of December 2002 was &euro;44.4 million, which if continued for a full year would give an annual cost in 2003 of approximately &euro;535 million. This, however, is not a conclusive figure, and the final figure may be higher than that, if account holders increase their monthly contributions.</P>

At the annual meetings of the institutions last September I emphasised vital issues such as education and HIV-AIDS in the very short time allotted to me. I assume the Deputy would support international action here also. The debt strategy document, which was launched last July, was forwarded to Ireland's representatives at the IMF and the World Bank in advance of the 2002 annual meetings of the institutions. Both executive boards are fully aware of Ireland's policy on developing country debt. The Taoiseach reiterated our commitment in principle to debt cancellation in his address to the world summit on sus<Col N="166" /> tainable development in Johannesburg in September. In October 2002 we participated in a World Bank meeting convened to discuss the current financing gap that has arisen in the HIPC Trust Fund. In October and November last year officials from the World Bank visited Dublin and the debt issue was raised with them. The president of the bank, Mr. James Wolfensohn, came here last month. The debt strategy was also discussed with him.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy can see, no opportunity has been missed by any of us involved with the debt strategy statement to promote our views. My Department, in close co-ordination with Ireland Aid, will continue to promote Ireland's policy on developing country debt in all relevant international fora. We will also continue to monitor closely developments in the HIPC initiative process and to participate actively in all relevant international meetings.</P>

      <P>While I do not have a statutory function in this matter, I am aware that there are bank drafts which have remained uncashed for various periods of time. However, there is no estimate available of how many such drafts exist. Bank drafts are issued at branch level which is where the relevant records &ndash; requisition forms containing any details of the applicant, payee, date issued, value, serial number, etc. &ndash; are also held. The industry has advised me in another context that in order to ascertain the number of drafts that remain uncashed a manual exercise would have to be undertaken on a branch by branch basis and the results collated at head office level. This would be an extensive and burdensome exercise to undertake. However, on the basis of a very preliminary analysis done by the industry, I was recently advised that the value of these instruments outstanding for more than the 15 years which applies in the Dormant Accounts Act could be a few million euro. This estimate was based on samples taken from individual banks.</P>

      <P>As the Deputy will appreciate, there is no agreement on what exactly constitutes a product which has a superior impact on the environment. Even if the changes in the rates of VAT were considered desirable for encouraging use of environmentally friendly products, the options for using the VAT <Col N="167" /> system to promote such products are limited. While we can maintain existing zero rates on certain food, books and oral medicines, we cannot introduce any new zero rates of VAT. It would not be possible to introduce new zero rates for environmentally friendly products if they are not now zero rated. Likewise, there are restrictions on the extent to which reduced rates can be introduced for any products which might be considered to be environmentally friendly.</P>
      <P>In general, it is not evident that making changes to VAT rates is the most appropriate way of incentivising environmentally friendly products. The effect of introducing a reduced VAT rate may not be evident in the overall price of an environmentally friendly product. In addition, the price impact of any reduced rate of VAT may not be significant enough to change consumption patterns. If there are no changes in consumption patterns as a result of a tax change aimed at incentivising environmentally friendly behaviour, then such tax changes may not be appropriate.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will appreciate that I receive many requests for VAT reliefs and reductions for different types of products and services. If it was possible to concede a relief in respect of environmentally friendly products, then it would lead to pressure for similar concessions in goods and services subject to VAT. The Deputy will appreciate that the yield from VAT makes a significant contribution to the funding of necessary public services in the State.</P>

There are Ansbacher-type arrangements and there are other cases involving offshore funds and deposits.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Revenue has advised that the review team has inquired into 289 cases to date and six of these cases have concluded settlements with Revenue. The 289 cases, taking account of spouses and connected companies, consist of 300 names. The 289 cases are made up of 179 cases listed on the High Court inspectors' report and 110 similar cases discovered by Revenue or listed on the authorised <Col N="168" /> officer's report. A total of 211 cases have been under active investigation. The remaining cases consist of 62 non-resident persons, including 17 former Irish residents, 12 individuals who claimed the 1993 amnesty provisions and four cases with insufficient identity information.</P>
    <P>The investigation includes examining the tax position of disclosed entities and accumulating and assembling information on other connected entities. The number of connected entities in relation to cases under investigation is nearly 700. Revenue is making extensive use of its legislative powers to seek books, records, documents and information in the cases being investigated. Where appropriate, prosecutions will be considered but these will depend on the level of evidence available. Revenue has made five successful applications to the High Court for the production by financial institutions and third parties of books, records and other documentation, which are relevant to liabilities of Ansbacher account holders. Some 150,000 documents have been received under the terms of the High Court orders. Advanced investigative computer software is used in controlling and managing the documentation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy)</NameTxt>
      <P>The report of the Independent Estimates Review Committee, which I published at budget time, was of considerable assistance to Government in prioritising spending choices for 2003. While the Abridged Estimates Volume reflects many of the recommendations of the committee, the final decisions underpinning the expenditure Estimates for 2003 were, of course, taken by Government. These are fully reflected in the Abridged Estimates Volume published on 14 November last and in my Budget Statement to this House on 4 December last. Individual Ministers would be in a position to comment further on the extent to which specific recommendations of the committee are reflected in the spending Estimates for their Departments. The report noted that my Department had already identified the savings necessary to reach the pre-Budget 2003 target for my Department's Vote. The report's only proposal in relation to my Department's Vote was that the allocation in it for the change management fund be reduced by &euro;2 million. This proposal was implemented.</P>
      <P>In its summary of conclusions, the report made a number of recommendations relating broadly to the following areas: the need for a medium-term review of expenditure including an examination of overlaps between programmes and agencies; the need for better control of numbers and administrative costs; the need for changes in the structure of the health services and improvement in the delivery of existing health services and recommendations in relation to public service pay.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The up to date position in relation to each of those recommendations is as follows. As announced in my Budget Statement, a medium-term review of expenditure will be conducted this year by my Department. The Deputy will be aware that in my Budget Statement, I also announced the Government had decided that numbers employed across all sectors of the public service were to be capped with immediate effect and that there would be a reduction of 5,000 in <Col N="170" /> those numbers over the next three years. The views of the committee will inform Government's consideration of the outcome of a number of studies under way in the health area. These include the Commission on Financial Management and Control, the National Task Force on Medical Manpower and the audit of structures and functions. In relation to public service pay policy, the issues raised by the committee have been fully considered as part of the recent talks on a new partnership agreement.</P>

This was composed of a 5% increase in the building and construction deflator and a 1.5% increase in the machinery and equipment deflator. The deflators used in producing the Exchequer element of the 2002 public capital programme were building and construction of 6% and machinery and equipment of 2.5%.</P>
      <P>For 2003, it was forecast by my Department at budget time that the overall economy-wide investment deflator will rise by 2.5%, consisting of a 3% rise in the building and construction deflator together with a 1.5% rise in the machinery and equipment deflator. The deflators used in producing the Exchequer element of the 2003 public capital programme were building and construction of 5% and machinery and equipment of 1.5%.</P>

      <P>I understand the report also comments on public awareness of personal retirement savings accounts, PRSAs. The Deputy will be aware that legislation on PRSAs comes within the area of responsibility of my colleague, the Minister for Social and Family Affairs.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 198 and 199 together.</P>
      <P>The exact information as requested by the Deputy is not available. Statistics on employment and unemployment are compiled, at a regional level, from the Quarterly National Household Survey. The latest statistics show that there were 8,400 people classified as unemployed in the west region in the September-November quarter of 2002. The west region consists of County Mayo, County Roscommon and Galway City and county. Sub-regional statistics, of the kind requested by the Deputy, are not available from the Quarterly National Household Survey.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The live register series gives a monthly breakdown of the number of people claiming unemployment assistance, unemployment benefit and other claimants registered with the Department of Social and Family Affairs. Figures are published for each county and each local social welfare office. A breakdown by postal district is not available. The most recent information available is for January 2003. It should be noted that: (a) <Col N="172" /> the live register is not a definitive measure of unemployment as it includes part-time workers, seasonal and casual workers entitled to unemployment assistance or benefit. Statistics on unemployment are measured at regional level by the Quarterly National Household Survey; and (b) the exact area covered by each local office is not limited to the immediate locality of the particular office. For instance, in the Tallaght local office there may be registered persons from the Blessington area.</P>
    <P>The latest live register figures for the local offices within County Mayo for January 2003 are set out in the following table:</P>

The figures are obtained from the Forfás employment survey, and 2002 figures are preliminary. Data is not available below county level.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>IDA's strategy for the Dublin area is to attract and expand major FDI projects, moving up the value chain while doing so. Projects which would fit into this category in the Dublin area would <Col N="174" /> include Wyeth Medica in Clondalkin with over 50% graduate employment for its approved 1,300 job project and Swords Laboratories in Cruiserath with a similar profile for its 500 job project. Further high-value projects include Xilinx design and development electronics facility in Citywest, growing from 350 to 1,800 jobs over ten years, and SAP's software facility in Citywest also. In the city, Oracle, with over 350 people in East Point Business Park, is a high value salary employer.</P>
    <P>E-business continues to be a focus area for IDA in Dublin especially among the existing client base. Microsoft has set up a European Internet data centre in Citywest and they will now be doing trial runs for electronics distribution of software and licences to their clients. IBM has added an e-procurement activity to their Mulhuddart tech campus, which represents a significant enhancement to their existing facility. Adobe has established a corporate Internet data centre in Citywest.</P>
    <P>The IFSC, with over 450 companies employing 9,000 people, will continue to expand and create high value jobs in financial services and IT. High-end shared services projects such as Accenture, formerly Andersen Consulting, with 350 people are an example of what Dublin will attract on the FDI front in future.</P>

      <P>The issue of job creation is a day-to-day operational issue for the industrial development agencies under the remit of my Department and not one, in which I, as Minister, have direct involvement. These agencies are continuing their efforts towards the development of indigenous industry and in the attraction of inward investment.</P>
      <P>IDA is actively promoting Kerry as a potential location to overseas investors. The agency has commenced site development works on its business and technology park at Tiernaboul in Killarney to enhance the attractiveness of the town as a location for inward investment. This site development work will result in the upgrading of the overall appeal of the location. In addition, the Kerry advance factory group has commenced building work on an advance unit, BES factory, in the estate. This 24,000 sq. ft. advance technology building will be completed in mid 2003 and will further add to the attractiveness of the estate by providing an alternative property solution for potential investors.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="175" />Enterprise Ireland's remit includes indigenous companies in south Kerry. The continued upward trend in employment in Enterprise Ireland client companies, which commenced in 1996, was maintained in 2002 with a net increase of 44, thus giving an overall gain in full time permanent jobs for the area. These gains were spread across a number of sectors, including international services, industrial products and food-consumer products.</P>
    <P>The agency continues to work with such companies to assist them to grow their sales and exports and improve innovation in order that they can compete on world markets. In 2002, Enterprise Ireland approved over &euro;1.9 million investment support to client companies in south Kerry, leading to company investments of circa &euro;2.8 million and approved a capital grant of &euro;183,487 towards the expansion of the Killarney technology centre under its community enterprise centre, CEC, programme. The agency is currently working with community development groups in south Kerry to assist them in preparing applications in response to the current call for submissions under the CEC programme 2002, the deadline for which is 25 April 2003.</P>
    <P>During 2002, the Kerry County Enterprise Board, CEB, offered support to 47 business projects. Future CEB project investment will have the capacity to create an additional 75 jobs spread throughout the county, 44 of which will be in the south and west Kerry area. The board also plans to provide funding for two projects in Killarney and Kenmare for the creation of technology and investment units. In addition, the board will continue to provide advisory, training and other support services benefiting a further 367 existing and potential entrepreneurs.</P>
    <P>I would bring to the Deputy's attention that the implementation of the national spatial strategy, NSS, has the potential to create the necessary linkages to enable the region to be internationally competitive. The physical networks of infrastructure such as roads, public transport, energy and communications are at the core of the NSS. Improvements in these networks in terms of time and cost will reduce the perceived disadvantage of distance.</P>
    <P>I am confident that my Department through its agencies is working to address the employment needs of south Kerry and in promoting the area for suitable investment projects in the future. I am always happy to meet with business leaders public representatives and other relevant groups, commitments permitting, when I am in the Kerry area.</P>

      <P>On 18 February 2003, the Government approved the drafting of a Bill, on a priority basis, to give effect to the new enhanced redundancy payments scheme. The Bill has since been forwarded to the Parliamentary Counsel for drafting. When the agreement is ratified it is my firm intention to bring the increased statutory payments into effect at the earliest possible date.</P>
      <P>Pending the enactment of the new legislation, the existing statutory redundancy terms remain operative. Backdating is not possible because the redundancy scheme places obligations on employers and confers rights on employees. The legal advice from the Attorney General's Office is that obligations, such as increased statutory redundancy, cannot be assigned to employers retrospectively.</P>

      <P>Mr. Ray Jackson was appointed liquidator of IFI on 8 November last and any person with a claim against the company should ensure that they have made a formal claim to him in respect of any amount which they feel is due to, if they have not already done so.</P>
      <P>While I am aware that the liquidator is actively proceeding with the liquidation process, I understand that it is likely to take some time, perhaps two years or more, to establish the full extent of valid claims against the company and to realise its assets. Only at that stage will the liquidator be in a position to determine the amounts payable to unsecured creditors.</P>

      <P>I am very much aware of the serious difficulties being experienced by community councils due to the high cost of insurance.</P>
      <P>On 25 October last, I announced my programme for fundamental insurance reform. The programme reflects the commitments given in An Agreed Programme for Government and comprises a comprehensive set of inter-related measures designed to improve the functioning of the Irish insurance market. The key measures include: establishment of a ministerial committee, chaired by myself, to oversee implementation of the reform programme, including the 67 recommendations in the Motor Insurance Advisory Board, MIAB, report; publication of the action plan to give effect to the MIAB recommendations within a target timeframe; establishment of the Personal Injuries Assessment Board, PIAB, on an interim basis, pending preparation of the necessary legislation to put the PIAB on a statutory footing; and publication of the report of the implementation group on the PIAB.</P>
      <P>The pricing and underwriting of insurance is a matter for individual insurance companies and EU law prevents me from intervening directly in the matter. However, I have made it clear that I consider there to be an onus on the insurance industry to ensure that the reforms to be taken will have the effect of significantly reducing the cost of premia to consumers.</P>
      <P>My Department in conjunction with the Competition Authority finalised terms of reference last December for a study being undertaken into the competitiveness of the Irish insurance market. The terms of reference are available at www.entemp.ie and www.tca.ie.</P>

      <P>While the threat of terrorist attacks in this jurisdiction is the subject of continual analysis and assessment by both the Garda Síochána, who have primary responsibility for law and order, including the protection of the internal security of the State, and the Defence Forces, there is no reason to believe that Ireland is a direct target. Notwithstanding that, it is important that all prudent precautions are taken and that matters are kept under continual review.</P>
      <P>The Defence Forces make contingency plans for a range of scenarios where the security of the State may be at risk. In addition, the Defence Forces have contingency plans in place in relation to the provision of aid to the civil power and the provision of assistance to the civil authorities for a range of emergency situations.</P>
      <P>In the aftermath of the events of 11 September 2001, the Government established a task force on emergency planning. The objective of the task force is to ensure that all State bodies can react quickly and efficiently to any largescale emergency. As chair of this task force, my objective is to ensure that such responses continue to be characterised by effective management of all aspects of emergency planning and by a high level of public confidence in all the response arrangements.</P>
      <P>The Office of Emergency Planning, OEP, which operates under my remit in the Department of Defence, is taking the lead role in emergency planning to meet the new threats from global terrorism, including co-ordination of Government emergency planning and response by various agencies. Review and updating of existing emergency plans is ongoing in order to ensure a co-ordinated and an effective response to large scale emergencies. The major emergency plan is the framework for the immediate response by the emergency services, gardaí, health, fire service etc, to any major incident.</P>
      <P>An urgent and detailed review of capacities and procedures to deal with a range of emergency situations was undertaken by the military authorities following on from the events of September 11. It included, <i>inter alia</i>, an update of the threat assessment; intensive contacts with other State agencies; a reassessment of operations orders relating to vital installations, alert systems, the Army Ranger Wing, ordnance and engineer assets in terms of explosive ordnance disposal and specialist search and a review of equipment including the need for air defence. Guidance documents pertaining to aid to the civil power and aid to the civil authorities were also re-assessed. All matters arising were addressed and all procedures updated as required.</P>

      <P>On 15 January 2003 I approved, in principle, the report of the Reserve Defence Forces Review Implementation Board. The board was established to formulate a plan for the implementation of the recommendations of the special steering group on the reserve. The steering group which I established to undertake a study of the reserve reported to me in September 1999. The Permanent Defence Force is now organised in a three <Col N="183" /> brigade structure and a Defence Forces training centre. The Reserve Defence Force will be similarly reorganised and restructured and it is envisaged that the implementation of the changes in the Reserve Defence Force will take place over a period of about six years.</P>
      <P>The White Paper on Defence recognised that a notable and important feature of the existing FCA organisation is its countrywide, geographical spread. This particular aspect will, in general terms, be retained in the future. The full organisational and establishment details of the new reserve will be determined in the course of the ongoing detailed implementation process. Plans are being prepared by each general officer commanding a brigade for the amalgamation of FCA units in line with the proposals outlined in the steering group report. The objective of this process is to ensure that better training and other facilities will be provided to members of the Reserve Defence Force. No decision has been taken on the location of the proposed newly amalgamated units, but the military authorities have advised me that all proposed amalgamations will provide an optimal environment for personnel in the relevant areas to partake in the new enhanced Reserve Defence Force.</P>
      <P>In general terms, the blueprint for the new Reserve Defence Force will involve replacing An Fórsa Cosanta Áitiúil with an Army reserve consisting of two elements. One element will provide personnel who will integrate with Permanent Defence Force units to bring them up to full operational strength in a contingency situation. Personnel who opt for a period of integrated service will be provided with enhanced military training. The larger element will provide the overall Army reserve, organised into three reserve brigades. It is also proposed to have a dedicated Naval Service reserve &ndash; An Slua Muirí &ndash; of about 400 personnel, of all ranks.</P>
      <P>Members of the FCA are seeing benefits in terms of better clothing, improved equipment and more and better quality training. As the process develops we will see additional benefits in terms of a clearer role for the reserve, a better overall organisation structure and opportunities for suitably qualified reserve personnel to serve overseas. We will also see benefits from the closer integration of the reserve with the Army. I emphasise that I am mindful of the need to preserve and to retain the very many traditional and well established strengths of the current reserve system, not least the admirable spirit of individual voluntary commitment, close social links with local communities and a good depth and scope as regards nationwide geographical spread.</P>

      <P>I understand that the person in question <Col N="185" /> wants to lease a farm from an older farmer who intends to join the early retirement scheme and the question relates to his eligibility as a transferee under the scheme. One of the conditions for eligibility as a transferee is that non-farm income must not exceed 100 income units, equivalent to gross income of &euro;25,400, in the tax year prior to the application being received in the Department. The relevant tax year for an application received in 2003 is that ended 31 December 2002. Therefore, if the intention is to make an application this year and the transferee's income was greater than &euro;25,400 in the tax year ended on 31 December last, he is unfortunately not eligible as a transferee under the scheme.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 220 to 223, inclusive, and 225 to 227, inclusive, together.</P>
      <P>The arrangements put in place in Ireland to implement Council Directive 92/46EEC were based on the registration of all dairy farms by their co-operative or dairy. All farms became subject to inspection to ensure the on-farm facilities were in compliance with the standards set in the directive. The inspections in question were carried out by the Department's dairy produce inspectorate in the case of manufacturing milk and by the local authorities' public health protection service in the case of drinking milk farms. The task of visiting and inspecting dairy farms is a large one and has been ongoing since the introduction of the measure.</P>
      <P>The numbers of registered holdings engaging in production on the dates mentioned by the Deputy were 31,404 at 31 March 1999; 29,071 at 31 March 2000; 27,814 at 31 March 2001 and 26,635 at 31 March 2002. The numbers of registered manufacturing milk holdings, in respect of which it was formally confirmed that the prescribed standards continued to be met in each of the milk years in question, were 4,334 in 1998-99; 2,179 in 1999-2000; 2,462 in 2000-01 and 464 in 2001-02. The numbers inspected and deemed compliant are significantly greater and therefore these figures are not an accurate reflection of the situation. The numbers of manufacturing milk holdings which had their registration revoked in each of the years in question were four in 1999; six in 2000; 11 in 2001 and 13 in 2002.</P>
      <P>The numbers of deregistered holdings which were registered following re-inspection in each of the years in question were nil in 1999, two in 2000; three in 2001 and six in 2002. Once the registration of a holding is revoked, it may no longer be used to produce milk for human consumption. While the numbers of drinking milk production holdings inspected during each of the years in question are not recorded centrally, the numbers of registered drinking milk production holdings in respect of which it was confirmed that the prescribed standards continued to be met in each of the years in question, were 143 in 1998-99; 176 in 1999-2000; 204 in 2000-01 and 12 in 2001-02.</P>
      <P>The figures for each county are set out in the following table:</P>

    <P>The numbers of drinking milk production holdings which had their registration revoked in each of the years in question were nil in 1999 and 2000, 11 in 2001 and nil in 2002. The 11 holdings deregistered in 2001 were re-inspected and re-registered in 2002. In January 2003, it was decided, in agreement with the dairy industry, to delegate on-farm inspection to dairies or co-operatives which will be primarily responsible for implementing on-farm standards on the farms from which they purchase milk. My Department will regulate the overall system and, by means of risk-based inspections, ensure that the standards are met throughout the country.</P>

The numbers of animals inspected at these premises was: cattle, 1,658,939; sheep, 2,911,301; pigs, 3,038,302; equines, 3,703; and poultry, 76,267,616.</P>
    <P>The dairy produce inspectorate of my Department is responsible for the inspection of establishments manufacturing milk based products and the holdings on which milk for manufacturing is produced. The veterinary inspectorate is responsible for establishments which process milk for human consumption with the on-farm inspection of farms producing such milk carried out by veterinary officers employed by local authorities. The total number of inspections carried out by the Department for milk and milk products in 2002 amounted to 695. The Department is responsible for the enforcement of EU regulations governing the production and marketing of eggs from the farm to the retail outlet. This is done through inspection, sampling and surveillance of farms, packing centres, storage depots, wholesale premises and retail outlets. In 2002 there were 1,685 inspections of the following types of premises: free range, 158; packers, 111; retailers, 1,215; wholesalers, 99; hospitals, 82; and bakeries, 20. The final category of work within the FSAI service contract is pesticide residue monitoring. The foodstuffs tested for pesticides and metabolites are cereals, foodstuffs of animal origin, plant products including fruit and vegetables and processed foods. The total number of samples taken on such products in 2002 was 970 and each sample was tested for up to 89 pesticides and metabolites.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture and Food (Mr. Walsh)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 228 and 229 together.</P>
      <P>Under EU Directive 92/46/EEC, which is given the force of law in Ireland by S.I. No. 9 of 1996, there are animal health requirements for the dairy cows yielding milk for human consumption. The system operated in Ireland to ensure these requirements are met is based on certification of the milk yielding animals by private veterinary practitioners. Inspection of the on-farm dairying facilities under the legislation has been the responsibility of the Department's dairy produce inspectorate in the case of manufacturing milk production holdings and of the local authorities' public health protection service in the case of farms producing milk for the preparation of drinking milk.</P>
      <P>While the primary onus for compliance, as with all food safety requirements, rests with the supplier, certification by veterinarians was deemed a key part of the scheme. The regularity of veterinary inspections for this purpose is not set out in the directive. The system worked well when almost all dairy herds were inspected and certified in 1999-2000. However, following an interruption due to the foot and mouth disease outbreak, Veterinary Ireland displayed an unwillingness to continue the system as originally operated. Discussions are ongoing with the veterinary and the farming organisations on aspects of the scheme, which if concluded successfully, will allow the arrangement for the health certification to be re-commenced.</P>

      <P>Destocking arrangements are required to implement measures to protect and rejuvenate commonage areas that may be at risk because of overgrazing. They are an integral part of the agreement with the EU Commission secured in 1998. Any failure to implement them would put in question the generous REPS payments based on that agreement. There is no procedure for a review of the destocking figures outside of the appeals mechanism I have put in place. I recently <Col N="190" /> extended the deadline for receipt of appeals against destocking figures to 14 March 2002 and, subject to the time taken by farmers to select a planning team and the capacity of planning teams to complete the reassessment, appeals will be dealt with as quickly as possible.</P>

      <P>The arrangements for the implementation of the commonage framework plans were finalised after a series of meetings between my officials and the farming organisations stretching over several months and covering a wide range of issues. I am fully aware of the concerns of farmers and the arrangements that I have now put in place afford farmers the maximum flexibility compatible with the 1998 agreement on commonages between my Department and the European Commission. That agreement formed the basis on which I have been able since 1999 to make generous payments of up to &euro;242 per hectare on commonage land to farmers in the REP scheme. I am satisfied that there is no scope for further concessions. I believe, therefore, that a meeting with Mayo County Council representatives would serve no useful purpose at this time.</P>
      <P>Farmers who are required to destock under the commonage framework plans may either join REPS and accept the generous payment rates negotiated in 1998, or may apply for compensation under a national scheme to be operated by Dúchas. I understand that discussions on this scheme between Dúchas and the European Commission are at an advanced stage. I have recently announced arrangements to enable farmers to appeal the destocking levels recommended in commonage framework plans. The appeals process will consist of a reassessment of the plan by a second approved framework planning team and a contribution of up to &euro;1,300 will be available towards the cost of each appeal.</P>

      <P>The EU regulation governing the early retirement scheme requires that the early retirement pension be paid as a supplement to any national retirement pension that the participant, or his or her spouse or partner in a joint management arrangement, receives. The Department has an obligation, therefore, to ensure that a participant does not receive full payment of early retire<Col N="191" /> ment pension if he or she is also entitled to a national retirement pension.</P>
      <P>On 23 May 2002, over three months in advance of her 66th birthday, my Department informed the person named that she must apply for both the old age contributory and non-contributory pensions and provide documentary evidence of the outcome of her applications. However, as she had not provided this information by the time she reached the age of 66 on 5 September 2002, my Department was obliged to suspend the payment of her early retirement pension. On 1 October 2002, my Department ascertained from the Department of Social and Family Affairs that the person named had not yet applied for an old age non-contributory pension from that Department. However, my Department has now received, through the Deputy, documentation from the Department of Social and Family Affairs confirming the award of a non-contributory old age pension to the person named from 29 November 2002. Arrangements are being made to restore payment of the early retirement pension, net of the old age pension, to the person named and to pay all arrears due.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture and Food (Mr. Walsh)</NameTxt>
      <P>My Department has received correspondence on behalf of the person named. Milk Quota transactions are governed by European Communities (Milk Quota) Regulations 2000. Regulation 9 states that a lessee of land and quota may, on expiry of a lease, purchase the leased quota with or without the land provided that the lease in question existed prior to 13 October 1999 and expired on or after 31 March 2000. It also states that this possibility is open only to either the original lessee or a person who has become entitled to the lessee's interest in the lands by way of inheritance.</P>
      <P>I understand that the person named entered into a lease agreement involving land and milk quota on 30 March 2000 for a period of five years from that date. Accordingly, as the lease agreement came into effect after 13 October 1999 and furthermore, as the person who wishes to acquire the quota without the land is not the original lessee or his successor, this transaction cannot be approved. However, if the lease was to be terminated the quota would revert to the named person and if he wished to dispose of that quota he could avail of the option to sell it into the 2003 milk quota restructuring scheme.</P>

      <P>My Department has provided financial assistance to the rendering industry since January 2001, when meat and bonemeal was banned as an animal feed. By the end of February 2003 the overall expenditure on supporting the production of MBM will have been &euro;138 million. This funding is apart from other actions to support the beef sector in the wake of the BSE crisis in late 2000. For example, the total funding of cattle destruction schemes came to &euro;426 million, which included &euro;217 million in Exchequer funding, in the years 2001 and 2002. The funding of the disposal of the 170,000 tonnes of MBM currently in store, will have to borne by the Exchequer at some future date. From December 2002, the Department's contribution towards the rendering of offal and the disposal of MBM was set in agreement with the rendering industry at &euro;410 per tonne of MBM for a three month period up to the end of February.</P>
      <P>Since the introduction of the rendering subsidy it has been the policy of my Department to reduce the Exchequer contribution on an ongoing basis especially in the context of the beef market returning to normality. The policy of disengaging from Exchequer funding in this area of the livestock and meat sector is in line with developments in other European Union member states and with Commission guidelines on state aid, which require such aid to be ended by the end of 2003.</P>
      <P>Since the introduction of the subsidy, the costs associated with disposal abroad have been falling. The industry has also had the time to arrange outlets for the disposal of MBM on an on-going basis and has done so since last December. I am also of the view that in the absence of the State subsidy the industry will focus greater effort on the achievement of more cost-efficient means of handling meat and bone meal and including the use of such product in industrial or energy production. There are already indications that lower cost disposal options are being actively explored. I would expect, in those circumstances, that rendering and disposal costs will continue to reduce as greater efficiencies are achieved.</P>

      <P>In July 2001, the Information Commissioner, in his report on compliance by public bodies, addressed in some detail the operation of the Freedom of Information Act in relation to a number of common exemptions, including meetings of the Government &ndash; section 19 &ndash; and deliberations of public bodies &ndash; section 20. Having regard to this, <Col N="202" /> to the fact that Government records would fall due for release for the first time in April 2003 and to issues which had arisen from time to time in relation to other exemptions under the Act, the Government decided to set up a high level group, chaired by the Department of the Taoiseach, to review the operation of the Freedom of Information Act in the light of experience gained in the four years since it came into operation.</P>
      <P>The group was asked to consider issues in relation to how exemptions provided for in the Act have been applied; the extent to which the public interest has been served in practice by the operation and provisions of the Act and the appropriate balance between promoting transparency in the decision-making process and preserving the effectiveness of that process. The group comprised the Secretary General to the Government, the Secretaries General of the Departments of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Foreign Affairs, Transport and Finance.</P>

      <P>In its programme, the Government has reaffirmed that the Stability and Growth Pact provides the overall framework for Ireland's budgetary policy. I believe that the financial discipline that has resulted from the pact has been good for Europe. This can be clearly seen when the lower level of budget deficits and debt in Europe in 2002 are compared against the situation in 1997. Budgetary policies must continue to be geared towards sustainability and meeting the requirements of the pact. Achieving budgetary positions close to balance or in surplus over the medium term is a key target for this purpose.</P>
      <P>As I said in the House on 20 February, in reply to the Second Stage of the Finance Bill 2003, the essential message of the Stability and Growth Pact is that through fiscal prudence we can ensure economic growth and financial stability. Low debt, low deficits and sound fiscal policies are the bedrock of this policy. Furthermore, as I made clear in the House, we are not following these policies simply because of EU rules but because they make sound sense in themselves.</P>

      <askee>Minister for Finance</askee>
      <Quest>if he will consider a provision similar to section 81 of the Stamp Duties Consolidation Act 1999, which affords a reduction in stamp duty to young farmers in respect of the purchase by young persons generally of private residential owner occupied houses.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy)</NameTxt>
      <P>The young trained farmer relief from stamp duty is a <Col N="203" /> special exemption, designed to encourage young people entering farming to obtain a high level of training and to generally encourage the transfer of land to a more progressive generation of farmers. It is not applicable where the farmer has not achieved the necessary qualifications. The stamp duty code in relation to residential property is quite different to the regime that applies to non-residential property. Owner occupiers purchasing new homes under 125 sq. m. are exempt from paying stamp duty, and if it is over 125 sq. m., the stamp duty applies on the value of the site or on 25% of the value of the property, whichever is the greater. For first time buyers of new houses, this means that they only pay stamp duty if the house is over 125 sq. m. and either the value of the site exceeds &euro;190,500 or the value of the property exceeds &euro;762,000.</P>
      <P>First time buyers of second hand residential property do not pay stamp duty if the value of the property is under &euro;190,500 and pay a reduced rate if the property is less than &euro;381,000. The top rate of 9% applies only on residential property valued over &euro;635,000, as opposed to non-residential property such as agricultural land, where it applies on property valued over &euro;150,000. I consider the present threshold limits and rates to be quite generous and I have no plans to make a provision of the type suggested by the Deputy.</P>

    </P>
    <P>The Exchequer Balance is the traditional domestic budgetary aggregate which measures Central Government's net surplus or borrowing position. It is the difference between total receipts into and total expenditure out of the Exchequer Account of the Central Fund.</P>
    <P>The General Government Balance, GGB, measures the fiscal performance of all arms of Government, i.e. Central Government, Local Authorities, health Boards, Vocational Education Committees and non-commercial State sponsored bodies, as well as funds such as the Social Insurance Fund and the National pensions Reserve Fund which are managed by government agents. It thus provides an accurate assessment of the fiscal performance of a more complete &ldquo;government&rdquo; sector.</P>
    <P>The GGB does not reflect the position of commercial State sponsored bodies as these agencies are classified as being outside the General Government Sector.</P>
    <P>The GGB is calculated in accordance with ESA95, a consistent standard developed by the EU to facilitate budgetary comparisons between EU Member States in accordance with their obligations under the Maastrict Treaty.</P>
    <P>Details of the variation between the Exchequer Balance and the GGB are set out in the following table:</P>

    <P>(a)&nbsp;This adjustment reflects the requirement, under ESA95 rules, that changes in the assets of the Capital Services Redemption Account and capital gains or losses on foreign exchange contracts, swaps, etc., should be excluded from the interest recorded for the purposes of calculating the GGB. An adjustment for interest accrued but not paid on small savings is also included.</P>
    <P>(b)&nbsp;Equity and loan transactions are excluded from the GGB on the basis that they affect the composition but not the level of assets and liabilities. The ale of ACC Bank in 2002, for example, is treated as a financial transaction under ESA95 conventions and the proceeds from this sale are not counted as income of the General Government Sector.</P>
    <P>(c)&nbsp;Transfers between units within the General Government Sector do not affect the GGB.</P>
    <P>(d)&nbsp;The National Pensions Reserve Fund (established in 2001) is within the General Government Sector and transactions within the sector do not have an impact on the GGB. These figures include the contributions paid from the Exchequer and a provision for income earned by the funds.</P>
    <P>(e)&nbsp;This adjustment is required in respect of certain transactions recorded on an accruals basis in calculating the GGB. The main adjustments are in respect of Value Added Tax receipts and Departmental Balances.</P>

      <askee>Minister for Finance</askee>
      <Quest>if his attention has been drawn to the fact that the increase in diesel prices following the budget has knocked back the potential of biodiesel to help in developing cleaner fuel than mineral diesel and towards import substitution; and if he will consider a reduction in the tax rate for biofuels as introduced in the UK or waiving this excise duty altogether.</Quest>
      <QRef>[5167/03]</QRef>
    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy)</NameTxt>
      <P>The excise rate for auto-diesel prior to budget 2003 was well below the EU average, the Irish rate was 30c per litre compared with the EU average of 35c per litre. Even after this increase, the Irish rate will only rank 7th in the EU, at 33c per litre. Moreover, the price of diesel had in fact decreased in real terms by 14% between 1993 and 2002, while the tax content had decreased by 17.3% in real terms, pre-budget.</P>
      <P>At present, under European Union law, the rate applicable to substitute fuel is the same as that applicable to auto-diesel. Substitute fuels are products such as biofuels that are manufactured, produced, and intended for use or used as motor fuel. There are proposals relating to energy taxation currently at an advanced stage of discussion in the EU Council. One of the provisions in the proposal would allow member states to grant relief or exemptions from excise duty on biofuels &ndash; assuming final agreement on the proposals. Such relief or exemption would be discretionary on the part of member states.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="210" />For the Deputy's information, the matter of biofuel production falls within the remit of the Department of Transport. The Department has informed my Department that Sustainable Energy Ireland has commissioned a paper from Teagasc on the current position regarding liquid biofuels in Ireland. The paper, due shortly, will lay out strategic options for the sector. The Department of Transport will review the paper in the context of implementing the forthcoming EU directive on the promotion of the use of biofuels. They intend to develop a strategy that takes account of the different interests involved. Pending the outcome of this paper, and consideration of same by the responsible Department, it would be premature to examine the issue of excise duty relief for biofuels.</P>
    <P>I am aware that the United Kingdom sought and were granted a derogation under Article 8(4) of Directive 92/81/EEC in respect of biodiesel from the Council of Ministers. This derogation authorised the UK to reduce the rate of excise duty for biodiesel from 74c per litre to 41.4c per litre, which is still higher than the Irish rate of 33c per litre. This derogation is to have effect from spring 2002 for a five year period until 2007.</P>

      <P>In my Budget Statement of 4 December 2002, I indicated that we have international obligations under the Kyoto Protocol to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. For this reason, the Government has asked the relevant Departments to advance the plans for a general carbon energy tax, with a view to introducing this from the end of 2004. Given the many implications of such a tax, both environmental and economic, there will be full consultations with interested parties on the design of the tax and a reasonable period is being <Col N="211" /> allowed for its effective introduction. All relevant issues, including those relating to revenue recycling and fuel poverty, will be taken into account in this consideration.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 277 to 280, inclusive, together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Office of the Revenue Commissioners has responsibility for the collection and administration of virtually all taxes and duties, including import charges, for example, customs duties, excise duties where applicable, and VAT. These charges are administered in accordance with European Union law. As a general rule, import charges are payable on goods imported into Ireland from outside the EU. There are two <Col N="212" /> exceptions to this general rule, gifts and consignments of negligible value, as set out below.</P>
    <P>Council Regulation (EEC) No. 918/83 of 28 March, 1983 (Customs Duty) and Council Directives 78/1035 of 19 December, 1978 and 83/181 of 28 March, 1983 (VAT), allow for certain reliefs from import charges (customs duty and VAT) in the case of both gift consignments and consignments of negligible value. Any consignments made up of goods of negligible value dispatched direct from a non-EU country to a recipient in the Community are admitted free of import charges provided the intrinsic value of the consignment does not exceed a total of &euro;22. The relief from VAT and customs duty does not apply to alcoholic products, perfumes and toilet waters or tobacco or tobacco products.</P>
    <P>Goods contained in consignments sent by a private individual in a non-EU country to a private individual living in the Community are admitted free of import charges provided that such importations are not of a commercial nature. Consignments are not of a commercial nature if they are of an occasional nature, contain goods exclusively for the personal use of the recipient or his-her family, which do not by their nature or quantity reflect any commercial intent and are sent to the recipient by the sender free of payment of any kind.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Gift consignments&rdquo; mean goods the customs value of which does not exceed a total of &euro;45 per consignment. However, where a consignment exceeds that value but is made up of two or more items, relief up to &euro;45 is granted for such of the items as would be the case if they were imported separately, have been granted relief. It should be understood that the value of an individual item cannot be split up. The customs declaration form on the parcel should be marked &ldquo;Gift&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Relief from VAT does not apply to alcoholic products, perfumes and toilet waters or tobacco or tobacco products. However, relief from customs duty is granted for certain quantities of such goods. Goods imported from outside the EU must be accompanied by a customs declaration form and, on importation, customs formalities must be completed, including payment of all duties-taxes. Customs does not examine each consignment. Carriers are responsible for complying with customs procedures, on behalf of the recipient of the consignment. This includes making sure that a customs declaration is made and collecting and remitting to Revenue the correct amount of the relevant duties-taxes. Carriers, and customs warehouses from which goods are dispatched onwards to the recipients, are subject to approval by Revenue and are monitored and audited by Revenue to ensure that the regulations are being properly applied.</P>
    <P>From 1979 onwards, Public Notice No. 1179, entitled Relief from Customs Duty and VAT on Gift Consignments and Consignments of Negligible Value Imported from Outside the European Community, has been published and made available to the public through both customs head <Col N="213" /> office and the local customs and excise offices. This public notice has been updated on a continuous basis since 1979 to date; the latest version was published in September 2001. I have asked the Revenue Commissioners to forward copies to the Deputy for his information.</P>
    <P>In addition to the printed leaflet, public notice No. 1179 is currently available, to view and-or print, on the Revenue Commissioners website in both portable document format and Microsoft word format. However, I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that technical changes on the website in mid-January 2003 caused difficulty in downloading some forms and leaflets for a number of days. The leaflets affected included public notice No 1179. This problem was rectified on 22 January.</P>

      <P>The most recent inflation figures show an inflation rate, as measured by the annual change in the consumer price index, CPI, of 4.8% in January. This was slightly lower than the 5% rate of increase in December 2002. The budget day forecast was for average CPI inflation to be 4.8% for 2003 as a whole. This forecast, as always, was based on the technical assumption of unchanged interest rates. Since budget day, the ECB cut interest rates and this will have a favourable impact on the CPI this year.</P>

      <P>The rates of customs duties applicable to imported goods are set out in Regulation (EEC) No. 2658/87, as amended, on the tariff and statistical nomenclature and on the common customs tariff. Ireland is bound, as are all other member states of the European Union, by these rates. On occasion, customs duty rates are negotiated through the auspices of the World Trade Organisation.</P>
      <P>The normal or full rate of customs duty can vary from 0% upwards. In the case of many products, including bicycles, preferential rates of duty apply depending on their country of origin. Preferential rates of duty are granted by the European Union to products originating in developing countries and the amount charged is reduced or even zero-rated. Details of these rates, the countries concerned and the conditions that apply are available from the Office of the Revenue Commissioners, customs division, Castle House, Dublin. Imports of bicycles from countries where preferential rates of duty do not apply are charged at 15%.</P>
      <P>It is not evident that making changes to customs duty rates is the most appropriate way of incentivising environmentally friendly products. The effect of introducing a reduced customs duty may not be evident in the overall price of an environmentally friendly product. In addition, the price impact of any reduced customs duty may not be significant enough to change consumption patterns. If there are no changes in consumption patterns as a result of a tax change aimed at incentivising environmentally friendly behaviour, then such tax changes may not be appropriate.</P>

      <P>While stamp duty may arise on the purchase of a house, no stamp duty arises on the adaptation or extension of a house already purchased.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>New residential property is exempt from stamp duty for any owner-occupier where it is under 125 square metres. If a new house is over 125 square metres, stamp duty is charged on the site value or one quarter of the total value of the property, whichever is the greater. This means that, for owner-occupiers who are not first-time buyers, <Col N="215" /> stamp duty will not arise on a new house where the site is valued at under &euro;127,000 and the house is valued at less than &euro;508,000.</P>
    <P>For first-time buyers of new houses, stamp duty will not arise if the value of the site is under &euro;190,500 and the house value is under &euro;762,000. They will also, thereafter, pay a lower rate of stamp duty than other purchasers of a second-hand house, as long as the site value is less than &euro;635,000 and the house is valued at less than &euro;2.54 million.</P>
    <P>I consider the stamp duty relief for new houses to be quite generous, and I have no plans to extend further relief from stamp duty to larger and or more expensive new houses.</P>

      <Quest>if he will give consideration to addressing an apparent anomaly in section 784 of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 to provide for non-residents to receive an exclusion order in respect of income from an approved retirement fund, as is done for other income taxable under Schedule E; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <P>Most double taxation treaties provide that pensions, other than governmental pensions, are liable to income tax only in the country of residence. Generally, an individual who is resident in another State with which Ireland has a double taxation treaty and who is in receipt of an Irish pension, is taxed in the State in which the individual is resident. To avoid double taxation, the treaty provides that the pension is not taxable in Ireland and an exclusion order is issued by the Revenue Commissioners which has the effect of excluding the person paying the pension from the requirement to operate PAYE on the payments.</P>
      <P>It would appear from the details of the particular case as supplied by the Deputy that the non-resident person in question is in receipt of both a normal pension in respect of which an exclusion order has been issued and also owns an approved retirement fund, ARF. I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that withdrawals from an ARF are subject to Irish income tax in accordance with the provisions of section 784A(3) of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997. In other words, the withdrawals are subject to PAYE deductions. However, the Revenue Commissioners understand that withdrawals from the ARF are not taxed in the country in which person in question is resident, nor are ARFs mentioned in double taxation treaties. Since double taxation of the withdrawals from the ARF does not arise, there would appear to be no basis on which relief from Irish tax should be granted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Relief for taxation is given in Ireland for the contributions paid into the pre-retirement pension product on the basis that withdrawals after <Col N="216" /> retirement, for example, from an ARF, are taxable. In the absence of a specific relief from this charge to tax in a double taxation treaty, the question of the issue of an exclusion order does not arise.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 289 to 291, inclusive, together.</P>
      <P>The Minister of Finance is responsible for the development of the legal framework governing the regulation of credit institutions carried out by the Central Bank of Ireland. Once the necessary legislative framework has been put in place, day-to-day responsibility for the supervision of credit institutions is a matter for the Central Bank. Thus, the Central Bank has independent statutory responsibility for regulating and supervising credit institutions so that their financial stability is maintained and that shareholders and depositors funds are protected. Therefore, my role in assessing the adequacy of controls affecting the banking system, including such matters as risks arising from overseas interests and regulation of solvency ratios, is to ensure that the legislative framework enables the Central Bank to perform its supervisory duties.</P>
      <P>Irish legislation reflects the harmonised European framework for banking supervision, which is turn embodies the generally accepted international best practices. An IMF assessment in 2001 confirmed that banking supervision in Ireland is carried on in accordance with the Basel core principles, which comprise the relevant international standard.</P>
      <P>Allfirst, while a part of the AIB group, was a separate legal entity incorporated in the US. Accordingly, the primary responsibility for the supervision of Allfirst lay with the US federal and State regulators. As part of the AIB group, it was subject to supervision by the Central Bank on the basis of its consolidated financial position. A key component of consolidated supervision involves establishing contact and information exchange with the host country supervisory authorities. In this regard, the Central Bank had maintained regular contact over a number of years with the US regulators of Allfirst bank. When the difficulties at Allfirst came to light, the Central Bank worked closely with the US authorities as part of the investigation team.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="218" />Deputies will recall that as soon as I became aware in February last year of the events at Allfirst, the Central Bank was asked to provide a report, on the completion of its investigations, on whether it considered that any changes to legislative provisions governing banking supervision might be required. The Central Bank subsequently confirmed to me that it had sufficient statutory authority to allow it to fulfil its supervisory responsibilities and that any need for legislative change which might arise in the future would be brought to my attention.</P>
    <P>Subsequent to the investigation at Allfirst, the Central Bank required AIB and other banks to introduce changes in their internal control procedures so as to counter the scope for the type of fraud that occurred at Allfirst.</P>

      <P>Maintaining our competitiveness is essential to retaining and expanding the level of investment in Ireland and is, therefore, a priority for the Government. We must remain vigilant to risks to our competitiveness including those posed by inflationary pressure.</P>
      <P>For a variety of reasons, Irish inflation has been exceeding the EU norm for some time. Some inflation has been due to external factors, some due to the process of Ireland catching up in growth terms with the rest of Europe and some due to domestic factors. The last is where we must concentrate our efforts. That is why the adoption of the pay arrangements set out under the new social partnership agreement, Sustaining Progress, is important. By ensuring that wage increases are kept to sustainable levels we can continue to focus on our competitiveness and avoid losing jobs.</P>
      <P>I welcome the aims of the anti-inflation provisions in Sustaining Progress. The Government, along with IBEC and ICTU, will work together to keep downward pressure on inflation, particularly over the next 18 months. I am pleased to see that the rate of inflation fell to 4.8% in January, despite many predictions that it would rise to around 5.5%. I also note that some commentators see inflation dropping sharply by the end of the year. I will not make a prediction except to say that the trend will be downward during the course of the year.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 293 and 294 together.</P>
      <P>Foreign direct investment, FDI, has been key to Ireland's emergence as a high-growth economy over the past decade. The level of FDI investment in Ireland, relative to the size of our economy, is one of the highest in Europe and the world. Ireland has for a long time received a far higher proportion of FDI inflows into the EU than our 1% of the population would suggest. In 2000, for instance, we received 10% of all FDI inflows into the EU.</P>
      <P>Maintaining our competitiveness is essential to retaining and expanding on the level of FDI into Ireland. The latest inflation projection published by my Department was included with the budget documentation. It was then estimated that inflation, as measured by annual changes in the consumer price index, would be 4.8% in 2003. This forecast, as always, was based on the technical assumption of unchanged interest rates. Since budget day, the ECB cut interest rates, and this will have a favourable impact on the CPI this year. On the assumption of unchanged interest and exchange rates and that pay developments are consistent with the assumptions which were used in Budget 2003, my Department projected an easing in inflation beyond 2003 to around 2.5% by 2005, much closer to the projected EU average.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The main driving factor behind Ireland's current inflation rate is the high level of services sector inflation. This, in turn, partly reflects the high <Col N="220" /> levels of wage increases in the economy. It is important, from the perspective of retaining and increasing investment in Ireland, that wage pressures are not allowed to lead to a deterioration in competitiveness, which would result in lower growth and higher unemployment.</P>
    <P>I am confident that Ireland remains well placed to maintain our position as an attractive investment location for overseas investors. The taxation system has been reformed to maintain the inward investment levels which proved so vital to our economic growth. Our workforce is highly skilled and we continue to invest significantly in our education system to ensure that this remains the case. Infrastructural development has been prioritised and is being progressed through the continued roll-out of the national development plan.</P>

    <P>The Deputy will be aware that the burden of debt for the people has fallen very considerably as a result of prudent fiscal policies. For example, debt service as a percentage of GDP was 10% in 1987 and 7.3% in 1992. As a percentage of average income tax, these costs were 78% in 1987 and 68% in 1992.</P>

      <P>The security and human rights issue in Pakistan is a matter of deep concern to the Government and to our EU partners.</P>
      <P>In August 2002, six people were killed in an attack on a Christian missionary school in Murree, north of Islamabad. In the same week, three nurses were killed at the Christian hospital in Taxila, near the national capital. All of the victims were reported to be Pakistani nationals.</P>
      <P>On 7 August, EU Heads of Mission, on behalf of all EU partners, conveyed to the Pakistani authorities their deep concern at the deteriorating situation in Pakistan, and in the Islamabad area in particular. In reply, the Secretary of the Pakistani Ministry of the Interior asserted that sufficient security arrangements were in place in Islamabad. It was agreed, nonetheless, to improve daily communication with the EU embassies.</P>
      <P>On 14 February 2003, a further EU démarche took place in Islamabad. The deep concern of the EU about a number of human rights issues was again conveyed to the authorities there. These included the protection offered to religious minorities, the abolition of the death penalty and gender discrimination against women. In response, the Pakistani State Secretary of Law, Justice and Human Rights signalled an intention to form a small working group of members of the national assembly to pursue such issues and invited representatives of EU missions to participate.</P>
      <P>We, in conjunction with our EU partners, will continue to monitor closely the situation in Pakistan and press for the fullest observance of human rights, including the security of religious minorities, in that country.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>The current crisis in Venezuela must be viewed against recent economic and political developments. Venezuela is an oil-rich nation, abundantly endowed with an exceptionally wide range of other mineral resources, in which 66% of people live below the poverty line and a further 21% exist in abject destitution without the basic <Col N="222" /> necessities of life. Notwithstanding Venezuela's immense oil and other mineral wealth, GDP growth through the 1980s and 1990s averaged only 1.3% a year while annual population growth was 2.4%, indicating a steep and continuous decline in real average incomes. By 1998, 67% of Venezuelans were earning less than $2 a day. In the presidential elections of December 1998, a former army officer, Mr. Hugo Chávez, was swept to power on a platform proposing radical political reform and an economic third way. He gained 56% of the vote, the largest majority in Venezuela's democratic history. In the congressional elections, the broad Chávez Patriotic Pole coalition won an overall majority.</P>
      <P>President Chávez took office in February 1999 with opinion polls showing 80% support. A new constitution, incorporating the Chávez concept of participatory democracy, was approved by 73% of voters in a December 1999 referendum. Under the new constitution, Mr. Chávez was re-elected in June 2000 with an enhanced majority of 60%. President Chávez's popular support remained high throughout 2000, but started to drop sharply in 2001 as people apparently began to feel that their expectations regarding economic growth and employment creation were not being met. By early 2002, street demonstrations were being organised by the main private business association, Fedecámaras, headed by Mr. Pedro Carmona, and by the Venezuelan Workers' Confederation, CTV, led by the former head of the oil workers union, Mr. Carlos Ortega. On 12 April 2002, these demonstrations led to street violence, fatal shootings and an attempted <i>coup d'état</i> which at first appeared to have been successful. The presumed replacement, Mr. Carmona of the Fedecámaras, proceeded to proclaim the suspension of all democratic institutions. Within 48 hours, it became clear that the coup was only supported by a small element in the armed forces and President Chávez was released from captivity and returned to the presidential palace.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Following that brief rupture of the constitutional order, Ireland and its EU partners supported the efforts of the tripartite working group comprising the Organisation of American States, OAS, the United Nations Development Programme, UNDP, and the Carter Centre to facilitate dialogue between the Government and the Democratic Co-ordinator opposition alliance. In September 2002, a joint mission of the OAS, UNDP and the Carter Centre visited Venezuela and met with senior Government officials, members of the opposition, as well as representatives of the Church, the media and civil society. This led to the establishment on 8 November 2002 of a forum for negotiation and agreement under OAS auspices to bring together the various parties. These negotiations stalled when the opposition called a general strike for 2 December 2002. On 16 December 2002, the OAS adopted resolution 833, urging the Government and the CD to use good faith negotiations to bring about <Col N="223" /> a constitutional, democratic, peaceful and electoral solution in the framework of the forum for negotiation and agreement.</P>
    <P>On 15 January 2003, a group of friends of Venezuela, composed of the Foreign Ministers of Brazil, Chile, Mexico, Portugal, Spain and the United States was formed to support the OAS in its mission. Ireland and its EU partners welcomed the establishment of the group of friends and expressed its full support for their contribution to fostering a viable solution to the crisis in Venezuela in line with the objectives set out in OAS Resolution 833. We have supported the efforts of the OAS and the group of friends as the main interface between the international community and Venezuela in dealing with the problems that beset that country.</P>
    <P>On 21 January 2003, President Carter proposed two options: a constitutional amendment; and a recall referendum. The first proposal would involve the collection by the opposition of the required number of signatures to propose a constitutional amendment to shorten the presidential term from six to four years, with one possible re-election. It would also shorten the term for deputies to the National Assembly from five to four years. The current mandate of the President and of deputies would end immediately and all would be entitled to run again. The second proposal would involve a referendum on 19 August 2003 &ndash; midway through the Chávez term of office as already provided for in the constitution &ndash; on whether President Chávez should remain in power, to be followed by early elections if the referendum went against him. The group of friends met on 24 January in Caracas with President Chávez and the CD, and called for concessions from both sides. The group also noted that the proposals put forward on 21 January by President Carter were positive elements for seeking a solution.</P>
    <P>On 2 February 2003 &ndash; after 63 days &ndash; the opposition called an end to the national strike, which had caused serious damage to the economy by reducing crude oil exports from approximately 2.8 million barrels a day to 150,000 barrels. Oil production has since risen to approximately 1.3 million barrels per day. In recent weeks, foreign exchange operations have been suspended in order to protect foreign reserves which fell by more than $1.2 billion during the general strike and to allow the government to work out a new currency regime and a package of price and capital controls. Fear has been expressed that the Government will deny essential foreign currency to those enterprises which joined in the strike. On 18 February 2003, President Chávez and the CD opposition alliance signed a declaration against violence and in favour of peace and democracy. The declaration was drafted by the Secretary General of the OAS, César Gaviria. The declaration calls for a climate of peace and calm and for the legislature to form a truth Commission to <Col N="224" /> investigate the deaths during the failed coup in April 2002. The declaration also reaffirmed the parties' respect for constitutional provisions on freedom of expression, but called on the media, public and private, to ensure that they did not encourage unconstitutional or unlawful behaviour. The declaration was designed to help to reduce tensions, leaving the difficult question of possible early elections until such time as both physical and verbal violence should diminish.</P>
    <P>On 20 February 2003, Carlos Fernández, who replaced Pedro Carmona as head of Fedecámaras, was arrested by police on foot of a warrant issued by a judge. He is now under house arrest on charges of rebellion and incitement. Mr. Fernández, together with Mr. Carlo Ortega, head of the CTV, who has gone into hiding, were the most visible leaders of the 63-day national strike. The OAS Secretary General has called on the Venezuelan authorities to ensure that judicial action be independent, impartial and strictly conform to the rule of law and respect for rights guaranteed by the constitution. In spite of last week's joint declaration by the government and opposition, it appears that the situation remains acutely polarised.</P>
    <P>The general strike has inflicted severe economic damage. It is estimated that GDP will be found to have contracted by as much as 7% by the end of 2002 and it is feared that the contraction in 2003 will be at least 15% and perhaps as much as 30%. Nobody stands to gain from such a situation, least of all the many millions of extremely disadvantaged Venezuelans.</P>
    <P>Throughout the crisis, Ireland and its EU partners have stressed the importance of creating the appropriate spirit of tolerance in order to consolidate a climate of reconciliation among the people of Venezuela. Ireland and the EU as a whole stand ready to respond to any recommendation which may be made by our partners, Portugal and Spain, and the other members of the friends of Venezuela group.</P>

      <P>I am aware of the circumstances outlined by the person concerned relating to the difficulty he has encountered in applying for a visa to enter Colombia. On 1 November 2001, the Colombian Ministry for Foreign Affairs notified the Department of Foreign Affairs that Irish nationals travelling to Colombia, including those travelling as tourists, would henceforth require a visitor's visa to enter. I appreciate that this arrangement, particularly the requirement to attend for interview, is inconvenient. In the circumstances, the Department will raise with the Colombian authorities the possibility of their dropping the requirement for interviews, especially in the case of those who have been travelling to Colombia over the years and are personally known to the Honorary Consul.</P>
      <P>Colombia is one of many countries that Irish citizens require a visa to visit and, at present, Colombian nationals travelling to Ireland also require a visa to enter this country.</P>

      <Quest>if, in the event of disagreement at the UN Security Council among the permanent members, he, on Ireland's behalf, will sponsor a resolution, and initiate a procedure known as the unity for peace resolution procedure of the General Assembly, a procedure which has been used ten times previously by the UN; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <P>It is assumed that the Deputy is referring to the procedure provided for in resolution 377(V) adopted by the UN General Assembly on 3 November 1950, known as the &ldquo;Uniting for Peace&rdquo; resolution. Resolution 377 was envisaged by its sponsors as a means of circumventing the use of the veto by one or more of the permanent members of the Security Council. It provides that if the Security Council, because of lack of unanimity of the permanent members, fails to exercise its primary responsibility for the maintenance of international peace and security in any case where there appears to be a threat to the peace, breach of the peace, or act of aggression, the General Assembly shall consider the matter immediately with a view to making appropriate recommend<Col N="227" /> ations to members for collective measures, including in the case of a breach of the peace or act of aggression, the use of armed force when necessary, to maintain or restore international peace and security.</P>
      <P>The procedure involves the convening of an emergency special session of the General Assembly to consider the issue in question. Such sessions have been convened ten times under resolution 377, in 1956 &ndash; Suez; 1956 &ndash; Hungary; 1958 &ndash; Lebanon; 1960 &ndash; Congo; 1967 &ndash; Middle East; 1980 &ndash; Afghanistan; 1980 &ndash; the question of Palestine; 1981 &ndash; Namibia; 1982 &ndash; Golan Heights; and 1997 &ndash; Israeli actions in the occupied Palestinian territories. Any decision by a UN member state to initiate this procedure would of course depend on the particular circumstances. It is clear, however, from the above list that resort to the &ldquo;Uniting for Peace&rdquo; procedure in the effort to resolve urgent issues of international peace and security offers no panacea.</P>
      <P>My own view, buttressed by Ireland's recent experience of membership, is that such issues are addressed most effectively by a united Security Council. It is far from evident that absence of unity in the Council can be overcome through recourse to the General Assembly or that the General Assembly would in such a case be in a position to put in place practical ameliorating arrangements. Most Council resolutions are adopted by consensus, often marking the culmination of intensive consultation and negotiation to reconcile divergent views and interests. The process of achieving unity is often a fraught one, but the Council's credibility, and therefore its effectiveness, is enhanced by the commitment that its members, both permanent and elected, bring to the task.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. N. Dempsey Mr. N. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Mr. N. Dempsey)</NameTxt>
      <P>Most third level colleges have developed initiatives to promote disadvantaged access, through targeted funding provided to the universities by the Higher Education Authority and funding from within the overall financial allocations to the institutes of technology. These initiatives involve links with second level schools and local communities and examples of these activities include supervised study programmes, summer schools, study skills programmes and mentoring.</P>
      <P>These programmes involve assistance to students to meet the points requirements for courses, enabling them to obtain a third level place through the standard CAO entry procedure, and through special entry arrangements which involve more flexible entry criteria and various supports for students entering by this method. The Higher Education Authority has for a number of years provided dedicated funding to the universities and other Higher Education Authority designated institutions to support new developments in areas of strategic importance in higher education.</P>
      <P>One particular priority area is that of broadening access to the universities and Higher Education Authority institutions for students from traditionally under-represented groups. These include students from disadvantaged backgrounds, mature students and travellers. In 2002, the Higher Education Authority provided over &euro;6 million to support institutions in initiatives aimed at providing for such broadened access. Likewise in the institutes of technology sector, actions to improve participation by the targeted groups are undertaken by all institutes. These actions include pre-course and on-course support systems for students from disadvantaged areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The report of the action group on access to third level education sets out a co-ordinated framework of actions required to improve equity of access to third-level. The group considered that a single co-ordinating body was essential in order to realise the framework. Accordingly, a key <Col N="229" /> recommendation of the group was that a national office for equity of access to higher education be established to ensure the effective implementation of many of the recommendations in the report. As the Deputy will be aware, I have now given approval for the establishment of the national office within the Higher Education Authority. I anticipate that the office will facilitate the aim of increasing third level access by the three target groups, in partnership with my Department, the third level institutions and other stakeholders and agencies.</P>
    <P>In relation to the special access programmes referred to specifically by the Deputy, my Department grant aids a number of special projects, as follows, which are designed to improve access to third level for second level pupils in particular schools in disadvantaged areas. All of these projects, with the exception of No. 6, are long-established; No. 1, Ballymun initiative for third level education &ndash; annual grant &euro;50,800; No. 2, Clondalkin higher education access project &ndash; annual grant &euro;63,500; No. 3, Tallaght higher education access project &ndash; annual grant &euro;50,800; No. 4. Trinity access project &ndash;&euro;36,830; No. 5, Limerick community based education initiative &ndash; with links to University of Limerick &ndash; annual grant &euro;25,500; No. 6, the Wexford outreach access project of the Carlow Institute of Technology has been approved, on a pilot basis &ndash; 2003 grant &euro;55,000; and No. 7, Blanchardstown third level access project &ndash; annual grant &euro;50,000.</P>
    <P>The objective of the projects is to improve access to third level for pupils in selected disadvantaged schools who have the potential to benefit from third level education. The projects consist of intensive interaction with the pupils through extra tuition, scholarships, mentoring and other incentives to assist them in going on to higher education.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>My Department's inspectorate wrote to the visiting teachers of the deaf service last year informing them of the existence of the pre-school in question. A further letter will issue to the visiting teachers shortly containing additional information on the pre-school. My predecessor estab<Col N="230" /> lished an advisory committee on the education of the deaf and hard of hearing to advise on the range of key issues relating to the future education of deaf children. The terms of reference of the committee are to review the adequacy of the current range of educational support services available to students with hearing impairment, to identify and prioritise areas of service provision which require development or adjustment and to bring forward such proposals as are considered appropriate in order to ensure the development and delivery of an appropriate, effective and efficient education support service for students with hearing impairment.</P>
    <P>I understand from my officials that the committee hopes to produce an interim report before the end of the current school year. I expect that the issue referred to by the Deputy will be dealt with in that context.</P>

      <P>I am not aware of the costs of insurance in individual secondary schools as it is a matter for the managerial authorities of the individual schools to arrange insurance cover on school property and against public liability. However, I am aware of the concerns expressed by school authorities in relation to increased insurance costs. Grant aid to voluntary secondary school is provided by my Department by way of <i>per capita</i> grant and may be used towards insurance costs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Significant improvements have been made in the level of funding to second level schools. The standard per capita grant from &euro;224.74, £177, that applied in 1997, was increased to &euro;266.49 in this school year. An additional <i>per capita</i> grant of <Col N="235" />&euro;38.09 is paid to disadvantaged schools bringing the total <i>per capita </i>grant in the case of such schools to over &euro;300. In addition, under the school services support initiative, second level schools will benefit from further significant increases in the support grant from &euro;25.40, £20, per pupil to &euro;99 per pupil over this school year.</P>
    <P>Funding for voluntary secondary schools has been further enhanced by the introduction of a range of equalisation measures that are designed to reduce historic anomalies in the funding arrangements for the different school types at second level.</P>
    <P>Under the terms of a recent equalisation measure, the support services grant was further increased by &euro;28 per pupil with effect from September 2002. This brought the support services grant in the case of secondary schools to &euro;116.88 per pupil from September 2002 and to &euro;127 per pupil from 1 January 2003. This increase is in addition to the range of equalisation grants of up to &euro;15,554 per school, &euro;4.44 per pupil, per annum that was approved for secondary schools in December 2001.</P>
    <P>For a school with 500 pupils, this amounts to extra funding of up to &euro;100,000 per annum, and annual grants of &euro;236,761, &euro;255,811 in the case of disadvantaged schools, towards general expenses and support services, including insurance costs.</P>

      <P>The new Cork School of Music, a constituent part of Cork Institute of Technology, is being procured under the public private partnership model. The CSM provides training in a wide range of musical instruments, musical theory and speech and drama. The school caters for students from first to fourth level, whether they are amateur musicians, music teachers or performers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The tender for this project was advertised on a European-wide basis in June 2000. Following the project launch in July 2000, 12 consortia expressed interest in bidding for the project. Following the presentation of outline proposals the number of bidders was eventually reduced to three. These bidders were issued with an invitation to negotiate in November 2000. The consortia bids were submitted in February 2001 and were subject to detailed evaluation by the project board which included officials from my Department, the Department of Finance, representatives from the Cork Institute of Technology and our specialist advisers under the following four head<Col N="236" /> ings; design and construction, services, financial and legal issues. Following this process, Jarvis Projects Limited was selected as the preferred bidder in March 2001.</P>
    <P>My Department's officials and advisers entered into a period of intense discussion with Jarvis with a view to reaching financial close on the project. Recently the Department of Finance raised a number of additional issues in respect of the project that my officials have been examining in conjunction with our specialist advisers. In addition the question of the involvement of the European Investment Bank is being addressed. Proposals have been tabled whereby the EIB could provide refinancing for the project two years into the operations phase, thus reducing the overall cost of the project. Discussions with the both the Department of Finance and the EIB are currently ongoing.</P>
    <P>Ultimately, the final approval for the CSM will be a matter for the Government and consideration of it will be based on a thorough assessment of affordability of the project in the context of the competing demands on the likely capital funding envelopes in the future. My Department will continue to pursue this matter with the Department of Finance and all other concerned parties with a view to having the matter determined by Government in the very near future.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Mr. N. Dempsey)</NameTxt>
      <P>The National Educational Welfare Board is now the single national body with responsibility for school attendance matters. It is an independent statutory body, established under the Education (Welfare) Act 2000, to implement the provisions of the Act. The board has responsibility for ensuring that each child attends a recognised school or otherwise receives a certain minimum education. The board is required to assist parents who are experiencing difficulty in ensuring that their children attend school regularly, and will also assist schools in fulfilling their role under the Act. Through the appointment of educational welfare officers the board will provide a welfare focused service that is accessible to parents, school and others concerned with the welfare of young people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Where a child is not attending school or is not otherwise in receipt of a certain minimum education, the board will investigate the case, establish the reasons for non-attendance and then work collaboratively with the family, schools and others concerned with the child's welfare in order to ensure that the child either attends school or <Col N="237" /> otherwise receives an appropriate education. The board also has the legal power to compel a parent to send his/her child to school. However, this power will only be used where all other measures have failed and where the board is of the view that the parent has not made all reasonable efforts in this regard. The new service will be introduced on a phased basis commencing this year. The former school attendance officers have transferred to the board and a small number of head office staff, who will manage and develop the service, are currently being recruited.</P>
    <P>I have provided a budget of &euro;5.244 million for the new service in 2003 and I am confident that this provision will enable the board to recruit a significant number of educational welfare officers in 2003. I have requested an action plan from the board that will outline how its budget will be spent. When I have received and examined this plan I will then consider future commitments to the new service.</P>

      <P>In October 2000 the Government, in recognition of abuse that happened in residential institutions which were under State supervision, decided to establish a scheme through which victims of childhood abuse while in institutional or <Col N="238" /> residential care could apply for compensation for their injuries. Following the Government's decision, the religious congregations that had been involved in the management and operation of the institutions indicated that they wished to make a meaningful contribution to the scheme. Negotiations between the religious congregations and the State followed and arising from this the indemnity agreement referred to by the Deputy was signed on 5 June 2002.</P>
      <P>There is no provision for renegotiation in the indemnity agreement between the State and the religious congregations. Regardless of the participation of the religious congregations, the Government considered that the setting up of a compensation scheme was the right thing to do for victims of institutional childhood abuse. The participation of the religious congregations in the scheme was however a policy goal of the Government in that their participation in the scheme provides an opportunity to bring closure to the issue of past abuse and also provides a sounder basis for healing for victims. It was on the basis that it offered the best opportunity to meet the needs of survivors of abuse that the Government entered into the agreement with the religious congregations.</P>

      <P>Under the adult educational guidance initiative, there are 25 pilot projects, located throughout the country, with the aim of providing a quality educational guidance service for adults. All projects in the initiative were selected by an inter-agency selection committee on foot of applications invited by public advertisement.</P>
      <P>The criteria for selection were that projects should demonstrate clear aims and objectives, innovation, a local partnership approach, and the ability and commitment to deliver a quality guidance service to all the participants in the target group. The selection team chose the projects which best met these critera, but there were a range of applications which, although eligible, had to be refused due to funding constraints.</P>
      <P>The 25 projects were inaugurated in three annual phases in 2000, 2001, and 2002. In 2003, the increase in resources is being concentrated on the development of a web base publicly accessible integrated database of adult learning options. Accordingly, applications for funding of further local guidance projects cannot be entertained at present. However, under the national development plan some &euro;44.5 million has been committed for adult guidance and further education support with the aim of having a comprehensive service in place by 2006. It is envisaged that there will be further expansion in the number of projects as resources permit.</P>

      <P>The following statutory instruments are in the process of being prepared for my signature:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <i>State examinations commission order.</i>The State will provide for the establishment of the State Examinations Commission to perform functions in relation to the provision of State examinations and to take over those functions from the Department of Education and Science as envisaged in the Cromien report into the oper<Col N="243" /> ation of my Department. A draft order has been prepared and is to be considered for approval by these Houses.</P>
    <P>In accordance with the White Paper on adult education it is proposed to establish the National Adult Learning Council by way of an order under section 54 of the Education Act 1998 to exercise a range of functions in relation to the promotion, co-ordination and funding of adult learning.</P>
    <P>
      <i>National Council for Special Education Order.</i>A national council is being prepared under section 54 of the Education Act 1998 to provide for the establishment of a National Council for Special Education to perform functions in relation to the education of persons with disabilities.</P>
    <P>Regulations for primary and post-primary teacher allocations are at present being prepared which will provide a scheme of teacher allocations for schools and allow for an appeals process. The regulations will be made under section 33 of the Education Act 1998.</P>
    <P>School Admissions Regulations for the preparation of school admissions policies are being prepared under section 15(2)(<i>d</i>) of the Education Act 1998.</P>
    <P>The school transport regulations will place the school transport system on a more formal statutory basis to be made under section 33 of the Education Act 1998. The purpose of the designation of national association of principals and deputy principals order is to designate the National Association of Principals and Deputy Principals, NAPD, as an organisation which has a special interest in the functions of the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment, NCCA. Once the order is made, the NCCA will be obliged to consult with the NAPD in certain circumstances and to consider representations made to it by the NAPD.</P>
    <P>In the interest of the Vocational Education (Amendment) Act 2001 &ndash; third commencement order, my Department is in the process of identifying, with the relevant interest groups, further sections of the Act for commencement in the short to medium term.</P>
    <P>I am, currently giving consideration to extending the number of institutions to which the Residential Institutions Redress Act 2002 applies. This would require the making of a draft ministerial order under section 4 of the Act and laying that draft before these Houses in order to seek a resolution.</P>
    <P>I have recently received a request from the Church of Ireland College of Education to reserve places for students who are members of recognised churches in the reformed tradition and who are aware of and willing to uphold and support the distinctive ethos of Protestant primary schools. In order to accede to this request, a ministerial order must be made under section 12 of the Employment Equality Act. The order must be made with the <Col N="244" /> consent of my colleague, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform and is subject to the approval of these Houses.</P>
    <P>Directive 99/42/EC provides for mutual recognition amongst member states of the EU of qualifications required in respect of certain trade activities. My Department is in the process of finalising a draft scheme for regulations to transpose this directive and is in consultation with the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment in this regard.</P>

      <P>The position in relation to teaching practice is that it is not a paid activity in any institution but rather is viewed as training rather than employment. It is an integral part of the curriculum of the degree programmes in education and there is no special financial assistance available to students.</P>
      <P>I would point out that teacher education programmes provided in approved third level colleges, are approved courses for the purposes of the higher education grants scheme. Under the terms of that scheme, grantholders who are required to participate in off-campus placement as an integral part of their course may have their grant entitlement paid in the normal manner. Where the college requires a grantholder in receipt of the adjacent rate of grant to relocate from his-her residence in order to undertake a placement of not less than one academic term-semester, the non-adjacent rate of grant may be paid for the duration of such placement. Accordingly, student teachers who are eligible for grant assistance continue to receive their entitlements while undertaking teaching practice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am aware that assistance is made available to <Col N="245" /> student nurses and Garda trainees in the course of their training. However, there are no plans to introduce a scheme of financial assistance for travel and materials cost incurred by student teachers while on teaching practice.</P>

      <P>The mainstream staffing of a primary school is determined by reference to the enrolment of the school on 30 September of the previous school year. The number of mainstream teaching posts sanctioned is determined by reference to a staffing schedule which is finalised for a particular school year following discussions with the education partners. The provision of additional teaching posts in primary schools in recent years, approximately 2,900 since 1997, has allowed for a reduction in class sizes, the allocation of additional learning support teachers, the allocation of teaching posts to schools where 13 <Col N="246" /> or more pupils with significant English language deficits are identified and the allocation of resource teacher posts to either individual schools or clusters of schools where needs are identified.</P>
      <P>A revised primary curriculum was sent to schools in 1999. This curriculum was designed by the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment taking into account the most recent findings on the content and methodology in mathematics and language programmes throughout the world.</P>
      <P>The curriculum in these two areas has already been introduced to schools under the primary curriculum support programme. Under this programme there are &ldquo;cuiditheoirí&rdquo; available to schools to advise and assist them in implementing the new curricula in these areas. The learning support service provides additional support for pupils who function at or below the tenth percentile on a standardised test of literacy or mathematics. My Department has published learning support guidelines for schools. Training for teachers in implementing these guidelines is being given under the primary curriculum support programme. These guidelines recommend that an individual profile and learning programme be prepared by teachers, in conjunction with parents, in respect of each child attending learning support. In cases where the assessed needs of individual pupils are greater than can be met by the learning support service then schools can apply for additional resource teaching hours and-or special needs assistant support.</P>
      <P>At second level, my Department allocates additional teaching hours and-or special needs assistant support to pupils with an assessed need for these services.</P>

      <P>Under section 30 of the Education Act, the Minister for Education and Science may prescribe curricula and hours of instruction in schools. However, I have no role in the prescription of the level of courses of study for individual students in post-primary education. The curriculum of a secondary school, as set out in rules and programme for secondary schools, must include instruction in a syllabus approved by the Minister in a number of subjects, one of which is Irish. This applies to both junior and senior cycle pupils. However, the level of course offered within a school is a matter for the school authorities. The law guarantees, within certain bounds, the right of schools and their boards of management to manage their own affairs and to allocate resources in a manner best suited to the schools needs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards the examinations, my Department <Col N="247" /> allows candidates sit whichever level of paper they wish regardless of any course of instruction they may have taken in a school funded or part funded by the State or otherwise.  </P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. N. Dempsey Mr. N. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Mr. N. Dempsey)</NameTxt>
      <P>Dealing with educational disadvantage remains a key priority of this Government and my Department has introduced a range of key interventions and programmes in primary schools aimed directly at tackling the problem of educational disadvantage.</P>
      <P>The Breaking the Cycle pilot project was launched in 1996 and seeks to discriminate positively in favour of primary schools in selected urban and rural areas which have high concentrations of children who are at risk of not reaching their potential in the education system because of their socio-economic backgrounds. When the project was launched there were 33 schools in the urban dimension and 123 schools in the rural dimension, however due to amalgamations and withdrawals there are now a total of 32 designated disadvantaged schools included in the urban dimension and 120 small rural schools in the rural dimension. The 32 schools in the urban dimension are benefiting from a targeted programme of teacher and funding supports being made available. For the 120 small rural schools shared teacher/co-ordinator supports and funding supports are also made available.</P>
      <P>It has been found however that Breaking the Cycle similar to the disadvantaged areas scheme, does not take account of different levels of need. On this basis, a comprehensive survey of all primary schools was carried out by the Educational Research Centre in 2000, at the request of my Department. The purpose of the survey was to identify the level of concentration in each primary school of pupils with characteristics that are associated with educational disadvantage and early school leaving. The survey is the most comprehensive ever undertaken of the incidence of educational disadvantage in primary schools in Ireland and it provides a valuable basis for directing resources to the areas of greatest need.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The survey outcomes form the basis of the new disadvantage programme, Giving Children an Even Break, a major initiative which was launched in January 2001 to tackle educational disadvantage at primary level over a three year period. Under Giving Children an Even Break, my Department's approach is refined to ensure that the individual &ldquo;at risk&rdquo; pupils are targeted. Giving Children an Even Break subsumes the <Col N="248" /> previous process of designation of schools that serve areas of educational disadvantage. In total over 2,300 schools are now participating in Giving Children An Even Break.</P>
    <P>Giving Children an Even Break is a key component of my Department's strategy to discriminate positively in favour of children who are at risk of school failure or who are experiencing educational disadvantage. Schools in Giving Children an Even Break are in receipt of a range of additional supports including teacher posts and other non-teaching supports to be targeted at disadvantaged pupils. The additional supports provided reflect the level of concentration of pupils from educationally disadvantaged backgrounds in each school invited to participate in the programme.</P>
    <P>All schools included in the Breaking the Cycle pilot project and those that were previously designated as disadvantaged will retain the resources allocated to them under those programmes and may also qualify for additional resources under Giving Children An Even Break, based on the level of concentration of pupils at risk.</P>
    <P>Both Breaking the Cycle and Giving Children An Even Break are being monitored to ensure that they are addressing the needs of the educationally disadvantaged pupils targeted and, where modifications are required, the necessary changes will be made to incorporate these. In addition Giving Children an Even Break will be subject to independent evaluation to ensure that the programme is meeting its objectives and to assist in its future development and the introduction of further interventions in this area. The early start pre-school pilot project is in place in 40 selected schools in designated areas of disadvantage. It is aimed at children who are considered to be most at risk of not reaching their educational potential and are aged between three and four years. Early Start units have been established in 40 schools and all of these schools are benefiting from additional resources to cater for the pre-school children attending.</P>
    <P>The Deputy may be aware of the White Paper on Early Childhood Education, Ready to Learn, which sets out a comprehensive strategy for the development of early childhood education for all children from birth to six years. The question of developing and funding particular pre-school initiatives or the extension of the Early Start project to additional schools will be considered by the Centre for Early Childhood Development and Education, which I recently established.</P>
    <P>Such concentrated and focused deployment of funds should not only lead to more and more young people staying on and completing second level education, but should also make their experience of school more positive and worthwhile and so help to alleviate the problem of educational disadvantage.</P>

These bodies do not refer individual applications to my Department except, in exceptional cases, where, for example, advice or instruction regarding a particular clause in the relevant scheme is desired.

      <P>If an individual applicant considers that s/he has been unjustly refused a maintenance grant, or that the rate of grant awarded is not the correct one, s/he may appeal to the relevant local authority or VEC. Where an individual applicant has had an appeal turned down, in writing, by the relevant local authority or VEC, and remains of the view that the body has not interpreted the schemes correctly in his-her case, a letter outlining the position may be sent to my Department. Alternatively, as already indicated, the local authority or VEC may, itself, in exceptional circumstances, seek clarification on issues from my Department. However, it is not open to me, or my Department, to depart from the terms of the maintenance grants schemes in individual cases.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Mr. N. Dempsey)</NameTxt>
      <P>In 2002, my Department introduced the school completion programme, SCP, which is a new and significantly expanded programme to deal with early school leaving incorporating the learning, experience and best practice derived from previous early school leaving initiatives and assimilates the eight to 15 early school leaver initiative, ESLI, and stay-in-school retention initiative at second level, SSRI.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My Department's decision to amalgamate the two programmes was based on the grounds that the two schemes shared the same objectives and targeted similar young people. The objective of the school completion programme is to provide a range of interventions in areas of disadvantage that support the retention of young people in education. Evidence generated from the pilot phases of the school completion programme <Col N="252" /> shows that the most effective way of addressing educational disadvantage is through an integrated approach involving primary and post primary schools, parents, communities and relevant statutory and voluntary agencies.</P>
    <P>Due to the success of the initial phase of the eight to 15 early school leaver initiative, it was decided to extend the 17 ESLI projects until August 2002. The extension of these projects into a second phase was encouraged by clear evidence of successful developments. Local voluntary and statutory agencies were giving support to young people at risk and the school attendance and attitudes to learning of many of the young people were improving noticeably.</P>
    <P>In 2002, 82 school completion project sites, including the 17 ESLI projects, were selected to participate in the school completion programme. Figures in relation to the number of young people targeted by this initiative have been compiled from the retention plans submitted from the projects. These projects have identified 15,293 pupils as being most-at-risk of early school leaving.</P>
    <P>As the school completion programme only commenced in October 2002, it is not possible to provide a full evaluation of it's success to date but it is expected that the progress made as a result of the ESLI and the SSRI initiatives will continue under the school completion programme. Having regard to the amount of funding available to this programme in the future, any decision to include further project sites will be based on a selection process using the most current detailed analysis of pupil retention rates at second-level from my Department's post-primary pupils database.</P>

      <P>The Maritime Safety Directorate published a consultation paper last November seeking views in respect of the adequacy of legislation regarding the carrying and wearing of life jackets or personal flotation devices, PFDs. The directorate wishes, in particular, to ascertain the extent of public consensus in support of the statutory obligation to wear life jackets or PFDs on pleasure craft in a wider array of circumstances than is currently the case, including on all small open decked craft and on non-mechanically propelled craft.</P>
      <P>This paper was aimed at as wide an audience as possible in order that all interested parties can give their views on this important safety subject. The Maritime Safety Directorate requested interested parties to respond by 31 December 2002 and I encouraged the widest possible participation in this consultation process.</P>
      <P>I am delighted to state that over one hundred submissions have been received to date. The directorate continued to receive detailed submissions on this subject up to the beginning of this month which is a testament to the level of interest in this matter. The submissions are currently being assessed and I will bring forward proposals for any necessary regulatory change on the mandatory wearing and carrying of lifejackets as quickly as possible following this assessment of the public response.</P>

      <P>As I have previously informed the House, arrangements are being put in place to urgently relocate the staff of the Central Fisheries Board from their current premises in Glasnevin to other accommodation, due to inadequacies in the existing premises on health and safety grounds. Refurbishment of the existing premises, which I am advised is not feasible, would in any event necessitate the relocation of staff for the lengthy duration of works. Temporary relocation has been the subject of ongoing negotiations in which staff representatives of the central board participated since November 2002.</P>
      <P>I am committed to the permanent relocation of the Central Fisheries Board to Carrick-onShannon. My predecessor gave a commitment to the staff of the central board that these discussions will be advanced on a partnership basis and on the understanding that relocation to Carrick-on-Shannon will be on a voluntary basis and in accordance with the conditions of the Government's programme of de-centralisation of the public service.</P>
      <P>Under the Fisheries Acts, responsibility for the overall administration of human resources issues is a matter for the Central Fisheries Board. The terms and conditions of employment of contract staff in 2003 will be a matter for the board to determine when deciding their staffing complement for the year in the context of available funding and having regard to Department of Finance guidelines on recruitment to the public service generally.</P>

      <P>Under the local authority swimming pool programme, which is administered by my Department, there are four stages in a swimming pool project following the submission of a feasibility study. These, in order of progress, are preliminary report; contract documents; tender; and construction. My Department's technical advisers, the Office of Public Works, Office of Public Works, evaluates each stage and local authorities cannot proceed to the next stage of a project unless prior approval issues from my Department. Grant-aid is allocated only when tenders have been approved for the project and will be capped at the time of allocation.</P>
      <P>Under the programme, grants of up to a maximum of &euro;3.8 million are available towards both the refurbishment of existing pools and the provision of new pools subject, in both cases, to the total grant not exceeding 80% of the eligible cost of the project or, in the case of projects located in designated disadvantaged areas, 90% of the eligible cost. Support is available towards the cost of the swimming pool, toddler pool, sauna and steam room.</P>
      <P>In the case of the swimming pool in question, Drogheda Borough Council re-examined the design and funding proposals for the pool. The council submitted an addendum to the original preliminary report in respect of the Drogheda pool in early November and it was forwarded to the Office of Public Works for assessment. This documentation is currently being examined by the Office of Public Works and my Department is keeping in close contact with Office of Public Works on the matter. Once this assessment is complete, the proposal will be considered further.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy should be aware that the approach of comparing health expenditure based on percentage of national income can provide misleading comparisons. Increases in GDP will reflect growth on the basis of the economy expanding over a period of time. This may mean that although funding provided for a particular sector such as the health service may increase significantly in real terms, the percentage committed may fall due to overall GDP growth, this being particularly evident in a fast expanding economy such as has been evident in Ireland in recent years. For example, OECD figures indicate that the public expenditure on health as a percentage of GDP in Ireland fell from 5.2% in 1999 to 5.1% in 2000 although investment by the Government actually increased by 17% in the same timescale. However, experience from 1997 to 2002 has shown that increases in the level of health funding have in fact outstripped the rate of increase in GDP by an average of 6.4%.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Evidence from the World Health Organisation report 2000 on health funding and delivery indicates that greater expenditure alone does not guarantee a better performing health service. For example, the United States spends the highest proportion of GDP on health care, at 13.6% of GDP in 1998, with Ireland ranked 25, and yet this level of expenditure did not translate into a high ranking in terms in either performance on level of health or in overall health care system per<Col N="259" /> formance. In fact, in both of these categories Ireland performed significantly better than the United States, particularly in the overall ranking with Ireland ranked at 19 and the United States ranked at 37.</P>
    <P>The Deputy will be aware that in 2001 the Government commissioned a report on value for money in the Irish health system which was carried out by the consultants, Deloitte and Touche. Many of the recommendations contained therein are being put in place, through the health strategy Quality and Fairness &ndash; A Health System for You. In addition I commissioned a review of health delivery structures, both internal and external, undertaken by Prospectus Consultancy. The report from the Commission on Financial Management and Control in the Health Services, which was established by my colleague the Minister for Finance, is nearing completion. Both reports should be submitted to Government in the near future and will inform the Government's early consideration of a programme of change to reform the health delivery system.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 359 and 395 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My Department has not authorised any suspension in the recruitment of speech and language therapists by health agencies. Indeed, intensive efforts have been undertaken to improve staffing levels in speech and language therapy, both at local and national level. Relevant developments include the continued implementation of the recommendations of the report of the expert group on various health professions, which included new pay scales and career structures, the undertaking of a concerted overseas recruitment drive on behalf of all health boards, the introduction of a fast-track working visa scheme for health and social care professionals, the streamlining of procedures for the validation of overseas qualifications, as well as the planned significant expansion in the number of training places in speech and language therapy referred to by the Deputy. The success of these measures are reflected in the increase of 54 speech and language therapists, +15.6%, employed in the public health service <Col N="260" /> over the two year period to end-2001. Information in respect of the end-2002 position is currently being compiled by my Department.</P>
    <P>Responsibility for human resource planning, including the monitoring of vacancies in speech and language therapy posts in the North-Eastern Health Board, rests with the chief executive officer. My Department has therefore asked the chief executive officer of that board to investigate the specific matter raised by the Deputy and reply to him directly.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 360 and 391 together.</P>
      <P>The secondary legislation that is currently outstanding within my Department is as follows:</P>
      <P>&nbsp;1.&nbsp;Health Insurance Acts</P>
      <P>
        <i>Risk Equalisation Regulations</i>These will provide for risk equalisation in support of the operation of community rating and open enrolment in our voluntary health insurance system. The regulations have been drafted for submission to the Oireachtas. Under the Health Insurance Act, the draft regulations require the approval of both Houses of the Oireachtas. There has been close liaison on proposed arrangements for risk equalisation with EU Commission. My Department is currently in correspondence with the Competition Directorate, which has received a complaint that the proposed scheme would involve State aid. This is being addressed with the directorate through the procedures it has for determining such matters.</P>
      <P>
        <i>Lifetime Community Rating Regulations</i>These regulations will allow for late entry loadings to support the sustainability of community rated health insurance. However, these will not affect persons currently insured. Drafting will be commenced following completion of regulatory arrangements for risk equalisation.</P>
      <P>&nbsp;2.&nbsp;Social Services Inspectorate</P>
      <P>The Social Services Inspectorate is being established on a statutory basis under the Health (Corporate Bodies) Act, 1961.</P>
      <P>&nbsp;3.&nbsp;Children Act 2001</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Regulations and commencement orders are being drafted with a view to bringing Parts 2, 3 and 11 <Col N="261" /> of the Children Act 2001 into operation. Part 2 of the Act will establish the family welfare conference system on a statutory basis in respect of children who may need special care and protection. Part 3 of the Act amends the Child Care Act 1991 to give health boards statutory responsibilities and powers to provide for children found in their area who may be in need of special care and protection. Part 11 of the Act provides for the establishment of the Special Residential Services Board. This board has already been established on an administrative basis, pending its establishment on a statutory basis.</P>
    <P>&nbsp;4.&nbsp;Mental Health Act 2001</P>
    <P>A number of regulations remain to be made under the provisions of the Mental Health Act 2001. These will provide, <i>inter alia,</i> for the commencement of the remaining parts of the Act, for standards in relation to approved centres, that is, hospitals and other in-patient facilities and other related matters which will allow the Act to be brought into operation.</P>
    <P>&nbsp;5.&nbsp;Pre-Hospital Care</P>
    <P>The Department will be amending S.I. No. 109 of 2000 which concerns the membership of the Pre-Hospital Emergency Care Council. This council has also submitted proposals in relation to the creation of an emergency medical technician, EMT-A, grade. The Misuse of Drugs Regulations, 1988 and the Medicinal Products (Prescriptions and Control) Regulations, 1996 may need to be amended to allow EMTs to administer cardiac and other appropriate medications in a pre-hospital setting. This issue is currently being examined by my Department.</P>
    <P>&nbsp;6.&nbsp;National Treatment Purchase Fund</P>
    <P>The National Treatment Purchase Fund is being established on a statutory basis under the Health Corporate Bodies Act (1961). A Statutory Instrument is in the process of being drafted to bring this about.</P>
    <P>&nbsp;7.&nbsp;Misuse of Drugs Acts</P>
    <P>Secondary legislation is currently being prepared that adds a range of substances to the Misuse of Drugs Acts. This requires the making of orders and regulations under these Acts. The need to introduce control over the various substances concerned, as controlled drugs, arises mainly out of this country's obligations under the various United Nations conventions on narcotic drugs, psychotropic substances and precursor chemicals, to which this country is a party.</P>
    <P>&nbsp;8.&nbsp;Health (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2001</P>
    <P>Effect has not been given to section 1(<i>b</i>) of the Health (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2001, which amends section 59 of the Health Act 1970 as it refers to the provision of the community drugs schemes. The matter is under consideration in my Department.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="262" />&nbsp;9.&nbsp;Public Health (Tobacco) Act 2002</P>
    <P>The Public Health (Tobacco) Act 2002 contains a number of provisions which allow for the making of regulations. I have already announced my intention to make regulations under section 47 which will ban smoking in all workplaces with effect from 1 January 2004. I have not yet decided on the timetable for introducing other regulations under this Act.</P>
    <P>10.&nbsp;EU Directives to be transposed into Irish law</P>
    <P>In addition to the foregoing, the following EU directives will be transposed into Irish law: Council Directive 98/83/EC of 3 November 1998 on the quality of water intended for human consumption. The expected transposition is the first quarter of 2003; Commission Directive 2002/26/EC of 13 March 2002 laying down the sampling methods and the methods of analysis for the official control of the levels of ochratoxin A in foodstuffs. The expected transposition date is February 2003; Commission Directive 2002/27/EC of 13 March 2002 amending Directive 98/53/EC laying down the sampling methods and the methods of analysis for the official control of the levels for certain contaminants in foodstuffs. The expected transposition date is February 2003; Commission Directive 2002/69/EC of 26 July 2002 laying down the sampling methods and the methods of analysis for the official control of dioxins and the determination of dioxin-like PCBs in foodstuffs. The expected transposition date is February 2003; Directive 2002/46/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 10 June 2002 on the approximation of the laws of the Member States relating to food supplements. The expected date of transposition is the second quarter of 2003; Commission Directive 2002/82/EC of 15 October 2002 amending Directive 96/77/EC laying down specific purity criteria on food additives other than colours and sweeteners. The expected date of transposition is the second quarter 2003.</P>

      <P>As the Deputy is aware, responsibility for the provision of orthodontic treatment lies with the health boards in the first instance. Validation of waiting lists are an integral part of the management of such lists, in order to ensure that up to date and accurate information on waiting lists and waiting times is available. The chief executive officer of the Western Health Board has informed me that the board carried out a validation of their orthodontic waiting list in 2002. In carrying out this validation exercise, all patients on the waiting list received a notification requesting them to indicate if they wished to remain on the waiting list. In the event of a reply not having been received, a follow up letter issued to the patient seeking their response. This validation process resulted in a reduction of approximately 200 patients from the waiting list. The chief executive officer has further informed me that the board did not validate its orthodontic waiting list in 2001.</P>

      <P>The provision of orthodontic services is a matter for the health boards in the first instance.</P>
      <P>I am pleased to advise the Deputy that I have taken a number of measures to improve orthodontic services in the Southern Health Board, SHB, area and on a national basis.</P>
      <P>In the short-term, I have funded an orthodontic initiative to ease current pressures on the system. Additional funding of &euro;6.729 million was approved for orthodontic services in 2001 of which &euro;4.698 million was to fund an initiative on orthodontic waiting lists. This is enabling health boards to recruit additional staff and engage the services of private specialist orthodontic practitioners to treat patients. The SHB was allocated an additional &euro;1.191 million in 2001 for orthodontic services of which &euro;1.032 was for the orthodontic initiative. Under the initiative, the board propose to <i>inter alia,</i> recruit an additional two consultant orthodontists, one of which will be based in Tralee. The chief executive officer of the SHB has informed me that the board recently advertised this position through the Local Appointments Commission but were unsuccessful in recruiting a candidate on this occasion. The board will again consider the possibility of advertising the post at the earliest opportunity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Last June, my Department provided additional funding of &euro;5 million from the treatment purchase fund to health boards specifically for the purchase of orthodontic treatment. This funding is enabling boards to provide both additional sessions for existing staff and purchase treatment from private specialist orthodontic practitioners. <Col N="265" /> The SHB was allocated an additional &euro;0.720 million from this fund for the treatment of cases in this way and this is enabling the board to treat an additional 246 patients.</P>
    <P>My Department has also funded the recruitment of a professor in orthodontics at Cork University Dental School to facilitate the development of an approved training programme leading to specialist qualification in orthodontics.</P>
    <P>The grade of specialist in orthodontics has been created in the health board orthodontic service. This year, my Department and the health boards are funding 13 dentists from various health boards for specialist in orthodontics qualifications at training programmes in Ireland and at two separate universities in the United Kingdom. These 13 trainees for the public orthodontic service are additional to the six dentists who commenced their training last year and one dentist whose specialist training is nearing completion. Thus, there is an aggregate of 20 dentists in specialist training for orthodontics. These measures will complement the other structural changes being introduced into the orthodontic service, including the creation of an auxiliary grade of orthodontic therapist to work in the orthodontic area.</P>
    <P>The number of cases on orthodontic waiting lists by county is not routinely collected by my Department. Therefore, the chief executive officer of the SHB has been requested to provide the information requested directly to the Deputy.</P>
    <P>Finally, the chief executive officer of the SHB has informed me that at the end of the December 2002 quarter, there were 3,473 patients receiving orthodontic treatment in the board. This is an increase of approximately 1,173 patients in orthodontic treatment when compared with the number of patients receiving treatment in December 2001. I expect that the number of patients in orthodontic treatment will continue to increase as the measures that I have taken to improve orthodontic services take effect.</P>

      <P>As part of the review of the national nuclear emergency plan it was decided that stocks of iodine tablets should be purchased and pre-distributed to households throughout the country. During the months of June and July 2002 a packet containing six potassium iodate tablets, BP 85mg was to be delivered to each household which is sufficient to provide a single dose for each member of an average sized household. Approximately 2.1 million packets of tablets, 12.6 million tablets, were distributed to households nationwide via the postal distribution.</P>
      <P>Following the postal distribution my Department distributed the remaining tablets, approximately 1.6 million, to the health boards for persons who did not receive a supply of tablets or who did not receive a sufficient number of tablets via the postal distribution. A public notice was placed in national newspapers on Monday, 21 October 2002 advising such persons to contact their local health board to arrange for the collection of the additional tablets required. Contact details for each health board were included in the notice.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children (Mr. T. O'Malley)</NameTxt>
      <P>Persons receiving care in psychiatric facilities are regularly assessed to ensure that the most appropriate care and treatment is being provided but it is accepted <Col N="269" /> that there are people who are inappropriately placed. However, substantial progress has been made in recent years in developing alternatives to hospitalisation within the mental health services. Health boards have developed, and are continuing to develop, a modern comprehensive community-based mental health service.</P>
      <P>Since the publication of Planning for the Future in 1984 there has been a significant decrease in the number of patients in psychiatric hospitals and units. At 31 December, 2001 there were 4,256 patients in psychiatric hospitals and units compared to 12,484 in December 1984. Considerable progress has also been made in providing additional community-based residential accommodation. There are now over 400 community residences. Securing local authority housing for persons suffering from the disablement of psychiatric illness remains a difficulty in some locations. However, the health boards and the efforts of voluntary housing agencies continue to improve this situation through the provision of community residential accommodation. It is the Government's intention to continue the growth in alternatives to hospitalisation with the further development of community-based services throughout the country.</P>
      <P>In relation to persons with an intellectual disability in psychiatric hospitals, the number of such persons in October 2002 was 452, down from 490 in April 2002. The figure in 1996 was 970. Between 1999 and 2002 additional revenue funding of &euro;10.476 million and &euro;27.4 million capital funding was allocated to the intellectual disabilities programme to provide more appropriate care settings for; persons with an intellectual disability and those with autism accommodated in psychiatric hospitals; those accommodated in de-designated units, which were formerly designated as part of the psychiatric services; and others who moved some years ago from psychiatric hospitals to alternative accommodation which is now unsuitable for their needs.</P>
      <P>Finally, it is anticipated that the number of admissions to psychiatric hospitals and units will decrease following the implementation of the Mental Health Act 2001, which, <i>inter alia,</i> provides for a review of all decisions by a consultant psychiatrist to detain a patient for psychiatric care and treatment on an involuntary basis and each decision to extend the duration of such detentions.</P>

      <P>I assume that the Deputy is referring to recommendations which may emerge from the audit of structures and functions of the health system. As <Col N="270" /> I have already outlined to the House, the report of the consultants has not yet been completed. The terms of reference included consideration of the structures and functions of both health boards-authority and other specialist, advisory, regulatory and executive agencies under my aegis. The terms of reference also require prospectus to make recommendations to improve corporate governance arrangements in the health system. The outcomes sought are to ensure that: the structures are the most appropriate and responsive to meet current and future needs; constitute an adequate framework for overall governance in the system; achieve effective integration of services; adequately represent the views of consumers; and focus sufficiently upon the principles of equity, accountability, quality and people-centredness and the national goals of the health strategy.</P>
      <P>It is not possible at this stage to speculate on the recommendations and their potential impact, if any, on specific service delivery units whether they be acute, primary care, continuing care or other community services. However, given the terms of reference outlined above, I am confident that the recommendations will be in the interests of an improved system of service delivery, greater accountability, quality and value for money.</P>

      <P>The agreement between my Department and the Irish Medical Organisation in relation to the implementation of automatic medical card eligibility for persons aged 70 and over, included a once-off entry provision for doctors to the GMS scheme. This element of the agreement gave right of entry to any suitably qualified and trained GP to continue to care for any of their patients who acquired their medical card under the new eligibility provision. This right of entry is limited for a period of five years after which the GP is free to accept any medical card patient nominating him or her as their doctor of choice. The limitation is reduced to two years in the case of a GP who is in a partnership on the date he-she acquires limited entry if he-she continues in that partnership for the two year period.</P>
      <P>During the term of limited access to a GP's panel, any of his or her patients under 70 years of age qualifying for a medical card have the option of either choosing an alternative GMS GP, or remaining with their existing GP as a private patient until the limited entry term has expired. I have no plans to alter the terms of this agreement.</P>

      <Quest>the reason each of the vaccines contained in the MMR vaccine is not given in single doses; if his Department has considered allowing individual doses where parents so request; his views on the concern among some parents that three vaccines in one dose may be harmful to their children; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>
      <QRef>[5339/03]</QRef>
    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>MMR vaccine is available under the primary childhood immunisation programme, which provides for the immunisation of children against a range of potentially serious infectious diseases. Under the programme parents may have their children immunised free of charge by the general practitioner of their choice. The schedule of immunisation is in accordance with the recommendations of the immunisation advisory committee of the Royal College of Physicians of Ireland, RCPI.</P>
      <P>There is no provision for children to receive separate measles, mumps or rubella vaccinations under this programme. Information provided by the Irish Medicines Board, IMB, which has responsibility for licensing all pharmaceutical products in Ireland, indicates that while single dose vaccines for measles, mumps and rubella are licensed in Ireland, it is not aware that these single vaccines are currently marketed here.</P>
      <P>There are sound public health reasons for not administering the MMR as separate vaccines. First of all, the scientific evidence does not support a link between MMR and autism or inflammatory bowel disease. There is no evidence that administering the three components of MMR as separate vaccines is safer. The immune system is well capable of responding to the small number of components in the MMR vaccine and there is no evidence that the component parts of the MMR vaccine interfere with each other. In any event, vaccines are designed to strengthen the immune system and not weaken it. Recent UK research published in the journal <i>Archives of Disease in Childhood</i> has confirmed that there are no adverse effects on the immune system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the vaccines were to be given separately, this would also mean a child requiring a total of six injections to complete the course instead of two which could also mean an increased risk of local reactions at the injection site. The practical aspect of giving six injections would mean that children are unprotected for a greater period of time from these diseases and, therefore, at significantly <Col N="273" /> greater risk of contracting these conditions. The protracted time involved in administering the vaccines would result in the diseases in question circulating in the community for longer. Unprotected children such as younger children, that is, children below the age of 12 months, and children who are immuno-suppressed would, therefore, be at greater risk of catching the diseases concerned.</P>
    <P>Most countries implement a two-dose MMR vaccine programme and this policy has been very successful in controlling measles where high uptake of the vaccine has been achieved. My Department's primary concern in relation to immunisation is that the vaccines in use are safe and effective.</P>
    <P>The international consensus from professional bodies and international organisations is that the MMR is a safe and effective vaccine. The institutions include the Medical Research Council Expert Committee and the British Committee on Safety of Medicines in the UK, the Centres for Disease Control and Prevention, CDC, and the American Academy of Paediatrics in the USA as well as the World Health Organisation. The World Health Organisation, WHO, strongly endorses the use of MMR vaccine on the grounds of its convincing record of safety and efficacy. This view is supported by the Irish Medicines Board and by the Royal College of Physicians of Ireland.</P>
    <P>A recent UK study where researchers analysed 2,000 studies from 180 countries found no evidence of a causal link between MMR vaccine and autism or inflammatory bowel disease. In late 2002, the <i>New England Journal of Medicine</i> published details of a study of more than 500,000 children born in Denmark between January 1991 and December 1998 which indicated that the risk of autism was the same for children regardless of whether or not they were vaccinated with MMR.</P>
    <P>In a statement on 14 November 2002, the IMB advised parents and doctors against the use of unlicensed single component measles, mumps and rubella vaccines. Specifically, the IMB has concerns in relation to the manufacture, testing and storage of the single component vaccines Pavivac, single mumps vaccine, and Movivac, single measles vaccine, as there is insufficient information about these two vaccines to be able to offer any assurances about the safety, quality or efficacy of these products which are manufactured by Sevapharma in the Czech Republic. The IMB's counterpart in the UK, the Medicines Control Agency, has issued similar recommendations pending further investigation. The IMB further stated that the two combined MMR vaccines, MMR II and Priorix, currently in use in the childhood immunisation programme in Ireland have undergone rigorous assessment and are licensed by the IMB.</P>
    <P>In view of the recent outbreaks of measles that are predominantly affecting the Eastern Regional Health Authority, ERHA, and the Midland Health Board, MHB, regions, I would like to take this opportunity to urge all parents to have their <Col N="274" /> children immunised against the diseases covered by the childhood immunisation programme. This is in order to ensure that both children and the population generally have maximum protection against the disease concerned. General practitioners are aware of the contraindications to the recommended childhood immunisations and parents should discuss any concerns they may have with their general practitioner before making a decision about their child's immunisation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children (Mr. T. O'Malley)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government is very much aware of the important contribution that the community employment, CE, programme has made to the development of services for local communities over the years and the difficulties that now arise for sponsor organisations in the voluntary and community sector due to the reduction in the level of funding available for the programme. In this context a cross departmental <Col N="276" /> senior officials group has been asked to consider options for the future of CE, taking account of the link with the provision of community services. In addition the PPF mandated review of active market labour programmes is being progressed under the aegis of the standing committee on the labour market, chaired by the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment. FÁS is also currently undertaking an internal review of CE and the job initiative programme which should be finalised shortly. The outcome of these various initiatives will inform the Government's consideration of options for the future deliver of community services and the appropriate levels of CE for the future.</P>
      <P>The overall economic position in 2003 has had implications for all aspects of public investment, and this is reflected in the Estimates and budget adopted by the Government for 2003. Pending the outcome of the various reviews outlined above, no money has been allocated to health boards in 2003 for the mainstreaming of CE scheme workers and no CE scheme workers providing health services have been mainstreamed to date.</P>
      <P>The CE scheme workers on health related schemes are not employed directly by health boards but by sponsor organisations in the community and voluntary sector. Following the current reviews of the CE programme the number of workers to be mainstreamed will be determined.</P>

      <P>The state enrolled nurse (SEN) qualification is a United Kingdom qualification which is not recognised here. Persons who have obtained this qualification must undertake a nursing conversion programme in the United Kingdom to qualify for registration as a nurse. Unfortunately, it is not possible to provide such a programme here because the rules of the UK regulatory authority for nursing only allow for a maximum of 10% of the clinical component of the programme to take place outside the United Kingdom.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I introduced a special initiative in February 2001, to assist state enrolled nurses (SENs) undertaking nursing conversion programmes in the United Kingdom. Under this initiative any SEN working in the Irish health service who wishes to undertake such a programme will be entitled to receive a non means-tested grant of &euro;7,618, £6,000, towards the overall costs including college fees, textbooks, travel and accommodation, involved in attending the programme in the United Kingdom. Payment of the grant will be subject to the SEN giving a written undertak<Col N="277" /> ing that she or he will work as a nurse in the Irish health service following registration with An Bord Altranais. Some 108 SENs have benefited from the initiative to date.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy may wish to note the significant increased employment of health care professionals in the health service over recent years. For example, between end-1997 and end-2001 there has been an increase of 8,650, 22%, in numbers of medical/dental, nursing and health and social care professional personnel employed in the health service in wholetime equivalent terms. Information in respect of the end-2002 position recorded in the annual health service census is currently being compiled by my Department. Overseas recruitment by health agencies has, over recent years, made an important contribution to meeting the human resource needs of the health service in areas experiencing shortages of fully trained and qualified staff.</P>
      <P>The sharp increase in employment of these personnel highlights the increased attractiveness of employment in the health service. This has been achieved through such measures as pay enhancements, developments in career structure and enhanced opportunities for professional development. The implementation of the pay recommendations of the public service benchmarking body will make a further contribution to the recruitment and improved retention of these scarce grades.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="280" />A number of important initiatives are currently being undertaken to continue to meet the human resource requirements of the health service in areas which have experienced staff shortages over recent years.</P>
    <P>As far as the therapy professions are concerned, the report current and future demand conditions in the labour market for certain professional therapists commissioned by my Department from Dr. Peter Bacon and Associates, concluded that a major expansion was essential in the numbers of therapists and this required a very significant increase in therapy training places in order to meet the long-term requirements of the health service. Significant progress has been achieved in boosting the number of therapy training places in line with the recommendations of the report. In May 2002, I announced, in conjunction with the Minister for Education and Science, an additional 175 therapy training places in speech and language therapy and occupational therapy and physiotherapy to achieve the recommended increase in the number of therapists over the next decade recommended in the report. The first intake into these additional training places in UL, UCC and NUIG is planned to take place later this year.</P>
    <P>In the nursing area, in July 2002, a comprehensive report on the nursing and midwifery resource towards workforce planning was published. Recruitment and retention of nurses and midwives has been an issue of concern in recent years. Developments in relation to the education of nurses have coincided with a dramatic increase in the number of places available for nursing students. This year, 1,640 nursing training places are available, 58% higher than the number available in 1998. In addition, there are now in excess of 800 places available on specialist post-graduate courses including accident and emergency, coronary care and oncology. A comprehensive package of incentives, including payment of fees and other financial supports are available to nurses undertaking these courses.</P>
    <P>The report of the national task force on medical staffing which is currently being completed will make an important contribution to planning how the health service should provide a high quality consultant provided service and meet the requirements of the European Working Time Directive.</P>
    <P>With the record numbers of staff recruited into the health service in the past number of years it is imperative that a coherent, strategic approach to workforce and human resource planning be developed further. Planning for the development of new and existing services in the future must be soundly based on a robust and realistic assessment of the skill and human resource needs to deliver these services. The issue of skill mix is also of paramount importance in meeting human resource needs. Enhanced skills mix by matching skills to service needs benefits patients and empowers health personnel to reach their full <Col N="281" /> potential and optimise their contribution to quality care.</P>
    <P>Having recruited and developed such a large number of staff over recent years, it is a priority to retain them by offering a challenging and rewarding career path. In todays human capital and skills intensive health sector, retention has been identified as a key issue in better people management. The implementation of the action plan for people management has a crucial role to play in boosting the capacity of the health service to retain scarce skilled medical/dental, nursing and health and social care professionals.</P>
    <P>As far as speech and language therapists in particular are concerned, intensive efforts have been undertaken to improve staffing levels in speech and language therapy, both at local and national level. Relevant developments include the continued implementation of the recommendations of the report of the expert group on various health professions, which included new pay scales and career structures, the undertaking of a concerted overseas recruitment drive on behalf of all health boards, the introduction of a fast track working visa scheme for health and social care professionals, the streamlining of procedures for the validation of overseas qualifications and the planned significant expansion in the number of training places in speech and language therapy, through the implementation of the Bacon report. The success of these measures are reflected in the increase of fifty-four speech and language therapists, an increase of 15.6%, employed in the public health service over the past two years.</P>
    <P>Responsibility for human resource planning, including the monitoring and filling of vacant speech and language therapy posts, in the South-Eastern Health Board area rests with the chief executive officer. My Department has therefore asked the chief executive officer of that board to investigate the specific issues relating to the recruitment of speech and language therapists raised by the Deputy and reply to him directly.</P>

The current rate of the RCG is &euro;735 where there is one eligible person in a family or &euro;1470 where there are two or more eligible persons in a family. Respite care grant is a once yearly payment, which will be paid during the first week in June 2003. The RCG is automatically paid to all recipients of DCA, without application being required.

      <P>The purpose and focus of the penalty points system is to identify and track a range of offences the commission of which has a direct impact on road safety. The Road Traffic Act 2002, which provides the legislative basis for the penalty points system, identifies a range of offences as penalty point offences.</P>
      <P>The operation and use of bus lanes make a significant and positive contribution to facilitating the provision of public transport. Breaches of the rules that relate to driving in bus lanes do not have such direct impact on road safety, and accordingly the offences that result from such breaches do not attract penalty points but this situation will be kept under review.</P>
      <P>As with all offences created under the Road Traffic Acts, the maximum fine for the commission of a first offence relating to the use of bus lanes has been increased through the Road Traffic Act 2002 from &euro;190 to &euro;800. Where a person is convicted of the offence on a second or subsequent occasion, a maximum fine not exceeding &euro;1,500 can be applied. In addition where a third or subsequent such offence is committed within 12 months, in addition to a maximum fine of &euro; 1,500, the court may at its discretion impose imprisonment for a term not exceeding three months. A person accused of the offence of driving in a bus lane may avail of the opportunity to pay an on the spot fine of &euro;25 to avoid proceedings being pursued in court.</P>
      <P>The Road Traffic Act 2002 also provides for the replacement of the on the spot fine system with the new fixed charge system. Measures to apply that system generally to the offences that currently attract on the spot fines are currently being progressed by my Department in consultation with the Garda authorities and the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 410 and 416 together.</P>
      <P>Sections of the Road Traffic Act 2002 that relate to the operation of the penalty point system, including the provisions relating to the disqualification from holding a driving licence on reaching the threshold of 12 points, were commenced with effect from 31 October 2002 to facilitate the operation of that system in respect of speeding offences.</P>
      <P>Proposals for the extension of the system to the remaining offences that will attract penalty points are being progressed by my Department in consultation with the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, the Department of the Environment and Local Government and the Garda Síochána.</P>

      <Quest>if he intends to reduce traffic speeds in urban areas to 20 mph or equivalent speed; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Transport (Mr. Brennan)</NameTxt>
      <P>The standard speed limit for built-up urban areas is currently 30 miles per hour. However, there is a general statutory obligation that a vehicle shall not be driven at a speed exceeding that which will enable its driver to bring it to a halt within the distance which the driver can see to be clear.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have indicated that it is proposed to introduce a metric system for the measurement of speed. The adoption of metric values for speed limits will of itself create the need for alternations to the imperial values applying at <Col N="287" /> present. The last comprehensive review of speed limits was carried out between 1990 and 1992 which resulted in the adoption of the current structure. I am currently taking the opportunity afforded by the process of metrication to review that structure in consultation with the Garda Síochána, the National Roads Authority and the local authorities, in view of the particular role given to the latter in the Road Traffic Acts in the application of speed limits at specific locations.</P>

      <P>The most recent statistics on numbers waiting, average waiting times and longest waiting times for a driving test at each test centre are set out in the following table. The average waiting time is derived having regard to waiting times, ranging from the shortest to the longest, experienced by individual applicants over a particular period at a test centre. The longest waiting time shows the current longest period any individual has to wait for a test at that centre.</P>
      <P>Of the 108,922 applicants on the waiting list, 31,531 have been scheduled for a test, 9,456 have indicated that they are not available for test and 67,935 are awaiting a test appointment.</P>
      <P>The current level of applications for the driving test and the resultant backlog is unprecedented. While the capacity of the driving test service to deliver tests has increased significantly in recent years I am considering, in consultation with the Minister for Finance, what other measures can be taken to enable tests to be offered within the shortest possible time.</P>

      <P>On 17 December 2002 the Government approved the implementation on a phased basis of the recommendations of the taxi hardship panel in accordance with An Agreed Programme for Government. These recommendations relate to extreme personal financial hardship experienced by taxi licence holders as a result of liberalisation of taxi licensing.</P>
      <P>The design and administration of a scheme to implement the recommendations of the taxi hardship panel will be carried out by a proposed Commission for Taxi Regulation as this will ensure that applications are dealt with on a confidential and objective basis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The preparation of the necessary legislation to support the establishment of that Commission is proceeding as a matter of urgency in my Department. In addition, the post of chairman is the subject of consultation with the Department of Fin<Col N="291" /> ance with a view to the initiation of a formal recruitment process.</P>
    <P>The Commission for Taxi Regulation, when appointed, will be tasked with the determination of criteria and conditions for the making of payments having regard to the categorisation and specific recommendations identified in the report of the taxi hardship panel. The commission will also invite applications and determine appropriate levels of payments within the amounts determined to be appropriate in the report. In pursuing this task, it is envisaged that the commission will consult with relevant Government Departments and agencies.</P>
    <P>As an interim measure, I have recently appointed Mr. Jimmy Farrelly, former Secretary General of the Department of the Environment and Local Government, as an interim chairman of the Commission for Taxi Regulation pending the recruitment of a statutory chairman. One of the matters I have asked Mr. Farrelly to progress as a priority will be the implementation of the findings of the taxi hardship panel.</P>

      <P>In terms of demand for services on the route, a licensed private operator recommenced services on the Cavan to Dublin route in January 2003. I am also considering an application from Bus Éireann for consent under section 25 of the Transport Act 1958 to operate the services that the company was directed to cease with effect from 31 December 2002. Following completion of the steps outlined in my response to Question No. 443 on 11 February, I hope to be in a position to make a decision on the application.</P>

      <P>Applications for licences for road passenger services are considered on an individual basis in accordance with the provisions of the Road Transport Act 1932. The Department is guided by relevant legal advices provided by the Office of the Attorney General. Reference is also made to Departmental guidelines which seek to clarify the administration of the 1932 Act and to act as a guide to applicants. The guidelines, which are currently under review in conjunction with the Attorney General's office, are an administrative aid and cannot of course supersede any considerations under the Act.</P>
      <P>The 1932 Act sets down a number of matters which the Minister must have regard to in considering an application for a licence. These include whether the service in respect of which the application is made is required in the public interest having regard to the passenger road services and other forms of transport available to the public on or in the neighbourhood of the route of the proposed service.</P>

      <P>The establishment of new routes and services is a day-to-day matter for each of the public transport companies. I do not grant approvals in respect of the establishment of new services and routes.</P>
      <P>However, since 10 January 2001, Bus Éireann and Dublin Bus are required to notify my Department of proposed new services or proposed changes to existing services at least four weeks prior to their introduction. Where a proposal conflicts with a prior application from a private operator to licence a service under the Road Transport Act 1932, Bus Éireann or Dublin Bus, when notified by my Department, must suspend the introduction of the proposed service changes until further notice.</P>
      <P>Once the application for a licence under the 1932 Act has been processed, Bus Éireann or Dublin Bus is advised that the Department has noted their proposal and, where appropriate, the relevant company will be asked to review its proposals in the light of any licence that may have been issued to the private operator for the route in question.</P>
      <P>Both Bus Éireann and Dublin Bus are required under section 25 of the Transport Act 1958, to seek my consent for the initiation or amendment of services operated by the company so as to compete with a licensed passenger road service.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. McDowell Mr. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. McDowell)</NameTxt>
      <P>I refer the Deputy to my reply to Parliamentary Question, No. 171, of 17 October 2002, from Deputy John Deasy, in which I undertook to arrange for copies of the report mentioned to be placed in the Oireachtas Library. I also gave an assurance that the Irish Prison Service would publish the report on the service's web-site.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Copies of the report were forwarded to the Oireachtas Library on 17 October 2002. I am <Col N="297" /> informed, however, that the Irish Prison Service has not yet been able to publish the document on its web-site, as they are attempting to resolve, with the report's authors, an apparent pagination error. I understand that the report will be available on the Prison Service's web-site as soon as the matter is resolved.</P>
    <P>I can inform the Deputy that, as indicated in my reply to Deputy Deasy's question, there are strong reservations about interpreting the main finding of the study as suggesting that over 28% of the prisoner population in the country have a mental handicap. Any such suggestion is strongly disputed by people who work with prisoners in a professional capacity on a daily basis and there is a reasonable basis for argument that this unexpectedly high figure could be accounted for by measurement of factors attributable to educational deficit and social disadvantage, rather than learning disability <i>per se.</i>The authors of the report recommended that a number of priority steps be taken in relation to prisoners with learning disability. These recommendations fall into three main categories: (i) psychological assessment of prisoners identified as having a learning disability, (ii) provision of training for personnel on needs and supports for people with learning disability and (iii) development of appropriate educational programmes in prisons designed to address the needs and learning characteristics of prisoners with learning disability.</P>
    <P>The Director General of the Irish Prison Service has indicated that these recommendations are being considered by the service in the context of the care and rehabilitation services for prisoners.</P>
    <P>I am also informed by the Director General that, at present, the routine medical, probation and education assessments at committal result in prisoners with learning disability coming to notice early in their time in custody. Such prisoners are provided with a range of supports appropriate to their circumstances, including, as required, referral for psychological assessment and special arrangements within education units and workshops.</P>
    <P>Such prisoners may also be referred to the prison psychology service for assistance in coming to terms with and coping with their incarceration and in addressing their needs around dealing with their offending behaviour. As necessary, on a case by case basis, the psychology service, in conjunction with the probation and welfare service, makes contact with community-based services in supporting the reintegration of offenders back into the community. This would include voluntary and statutory services working within the learning difficulties sector.</P>
    <P>The prison education service, which involves a partnership between the Irish Prison Service and a range of educational agencies including the vocational education committees, provides a broad programme of education for prisoners following an adult education approach. Education <Col N="298" /> units are in operation in all prisons and places of detention with the exception of Cloverhill Prison where the arrangements for education are not yet complete.</P>
    <P>At over 50%, participation in education in Irish prisons is high by international standards and there is substantial flexibility in education delivery, with significant provision for one-to-one teaching which is particularly relevant to prisoners with learning disability. Under the programme for Government, there will be particular emphasis on tackling illiteracy and lack of educational accomplishment among prisoners and, in this regard, work is ongoing in the Irish Prison Service in relation to the following key targets in the educational area, as set forth in the Prison Service strategy statement: maintain the prisoner participation rate in education at 50% against the background of increases in the prisoner population and review the education curriculum to ensure its continuing relevance to prisoner needs.</P>
    <P>The prison education service has recently prepared &ldquo;Guidelines for Quality Literacy Work in Prisons&rdquo;. In addition, a study of literacy among prisoners, which was undertaken by the education department of St. Patrick's College, Drumcondra, at the request of the Irish Prison Service, has recently been finalised and is in the course of being evaluated. Action in relation to literacy work with prisoners will be informed by both these publications.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. McDowell)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 431 and 438 together.</P>
      <P>I am informed by the Garda authorities that at 5.50 a.m. on 30 October 2001, a family member of the person in question telephoned Cahirciveen Garda station to report the death of this person at the family home. The gardaí went immediately to the scene, and, based on their initial observations and the circumstances of the report, the scene was preserved and a request was made for the services of the State pathologist and a team from the Garda technical bureau.</P>
      <P>The district officer at Cahirciveen took charge of the investigation, and inquiries were carried out to establish the last known movements of the deceased. The scene was also examined by the State pathologist, who subsequently carried out a post-mortem examination on the body at Tralee General Hospital. The cause of death was initally given as hypothermia as a result of acute ethanol intoxication and later in the inquest as acute ethanol intoxication and possibly cardio myopathy. At the conclusion of the post mortem the State Pathologist stated that the injuries were consistent with a number of falls with no evidence of assault. The deceased had a concentration of 327 mgs of alcohol per 100 mls of blood and 439 mgs of alcohol per 100 mls of urine.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I understand that the Garda investigation concluded that he received his injuries as a result of a fall within the precincts of his home. All statements relative to this investigation were forwarded to the Coroner, who set a date for the inquest for Tralee courthouse on 30 September, <Col N="300" /> 2002. This was adjourned to the courthouse at Listowel on 11 November 2002 where a Garda superintendent represented the State. After 22 people gave evidence, the Coroner's Court was adjourned again to 11 December 2002, when a further 12 witnesses gave evidence. The jury returned a unanimous open verdict stating that the person in question died on 30 October 2001.</P>
    <P>I should mention that the person in question had been released from Garda custody the previous day but I am not aware of any evidence that his unfortunate death was in any way connected with this.</P>
    <P>As the circumstances of this person's death were exhaustively investigated first by the gardaí, and then in public at the inquest, I have no plans to initiate a further inquiry into the matter.</P>

      <P>The Committee for the Prevention of Torture and Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment &ndash; CPT &ndash; which operates under the aegis of the Council of Europe, was established under the European Convention for the Prevention of Torture and Inhuman or Degrading Treatment in 1987.

      <P>The CPT visited Ireland for inspection purposes in May of last year and the report to the Irish Government on this visit was received in my Department recently.

      <P>As the Deputy will be aware, I have recently given a commitment to replace, as soon as possible, all traditional padded cells with new safety observation cells which, while soft surfaced to protect the prisoner from self-harm, will fully meet the needs and respect the dignity of prisoners in every way consistent with their safety. Proposals are being developed by senior officials in the Irish Prison Service to give effect to this commitment, in consultation with prison governors. As it happens, I understand that the governors have arranged to discuss the matter tomorrow Wednesday 26 February, 2003.</P>
      <P>I expect that the final proposals on the new arrangements will be remitted back to me for policy direction in the near future and that any issue regarding additional medical or para-medical staff will be addressed at that stage. However, I am informed that the case for extra medical and para-medical staff in Irish prisons is largely independent of the use of padded cells and that, while substantial improvements in medical services for prisoners have been made in recent years, the situation continues to be kept under review.</P>

      <Quest>if his attention has been drawn to recent research in the Irish Penal Reform Trust report, Out of Sight Out of Mind, showing that closed prisons may both increase and instigate mental illness and to the fact that this is particularly true for juveniles; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. McDowell Mr. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. McDowell)</NameTxt>
      <P>The research carried out by the <Col N="306" /> Irish Penal Reform Trust, to which the Deputy refers, focused on the use of padded and strip cells in the prison system, and the mental health of prisoners who have been detained in those cells. The research did not establish any definite link between imprisonment and the development of mental illness, particularly in the context of such illness developing in juveniles.</P>
      <P>The Prison Service is committed to health care standards comparable with those pertaining in the wider community outside prison. It is undoubtedly the case that vulnerable and mentally disordered people are among those committed to prison, and it is therefore important to obtain a clear picture of the extent of mental illness among prisoners and to monitor their mental health on an ongoing basis.</P>
      <P>In this regard, the incidence of mental illness among prisoners is the subject of a research project currently being undertaken by a team based in the Central Mental Hospital. The research, which is supported by the Irish Prison Service, is well advanced. The definitive results of this research will be published when available.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. McDowell)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware of the report to which the Deputy referred.</P>
      <P>I am informed by expert advisors that there is significant difference between mental illness and personality disorder. While mental illness falls within the remit of psychiatry in relation to assessment and treatment, the situation regarding what is commonly referred to as personality disorder is much less clear. I understand there is significant professional dispute regarding the &ldquo;treatability&rdquo; of such disorder, particularly in the short term.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy will be aware, the Mental Health Act 2001, which addresses various matters in relation to the detention and treatment in community psychiatric facilities of persons with mental illness, specifically excludes a diagnosis of personality disorder as a grounds for compulsory detention for treatment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While there are no medical or para-medical staff employed within the Prison Service specifically to treat those mentally ill prisoners with personality disorders, all prisoners with mental health problems have access to medical, nursing, psychiatric, and psychology services within the prison system. Where in-patient treatment is indi<Col N="307" /> cated as appropriate by qualified medical practitioners, prisoners may be transferred to the Central Mental Hospital, Dundrum.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. McDowell Mr. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. McDowell)</NameTxt>
      <P>A person declared a refugee under the provisions of the Refugee Act 1996, as amended, is entitled to reside in the State whether he or she has an Irish born child.</P>
      <P>Up until recently there was a separate process operated by the Department whereby the non national parent(s) of an Irish born child could apply to reside in the State on the basis of an Irish born child. Such an application was processed even if a person had a current asylum claim. In effect therefore, an asylum applicant whose claim was being processed by the Refugee Applications Commissioner or the Refugee Appeals Tribunal could have a separate and totally independent claim to reside in the State on the basis of an Irish born child processed by the Department simultaneously. It was generally the case that the question of making a deportation order was not contemplated pending the processing of both claims. It was also the case that in the vast majority of such cases the asylum application was unsuccessful but the Irish born child application was successful.</P>
      <P>With effect from 19 February, 2003, and as a result of the Supreme Court's decision in the cases of L and O, the separate process which operated in respect of applications to reside on the basis of an Irish born child has been abolished. Therefore neither a current nor an unsuccessful asylum applicant can resort to that separate process in future. The Government has yet to determine the general policy to be adopted in respect of more than 9,000 Irish born child applications on hand at present from current or former asylum seekers which have not been finally determined.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is the case under existing law that where I, as Minister, propose to make a deportation order in respect of any person, I am obliged, save in very exceptional circumstances, to notify the person in writing and to give the person an opportunity to make written representations within 15 working days. Whether or not representations are made I am also obliged to have regard to a range of ten additional factors in determining whether a deportation order should be made. My decision is also subject to the general prohibition on refoulement. Those additional factors include the person's family and domestic circumstances and humanitarian considerations. They also include circumstances relating to the common good <Col N="309" /> which reflect the Government's serious concern at the number of claims to reside in the State on the basis of parentage of an Irish born child and the social and economic consequences arising therefrom.</P>
    <P>My Department no longer accepts separate applications to reside in the State purely on the basis of the birth of an Irish born child. However, where there is a proposal to deport a person who is the parent of an Irish born child, that person will be given the opportunity to make representations in relation to the proposal and all factors relevant to the determination will be taken into account.</P>

      <P>I am informed by the Garda authorities that discussions are taking place between representatives of the Garda National Crime Prevention Office and the mobile phone service providers, as part of the 'Telecommunications Fraud Forum', with the aim of enhancing mobile phone security.</P>
      <P>I understand that the service providers are all now working towards the implementation of new technology to bar stolen handsets from their systems. The technology is expected to be in place later this year.</P>
      <P>This development will allow the victim to report a handset stolen to the service provider. The service provider will then bar the stolen phone from that network and advise the Global System for Mobiles (GSM) Association that that handset is barred. The other service providers, through the GSM Association, will then download the stolen handset numbers and bar them from their systems, thereby rendering the stolen phone useless. The service providers will also be in a position to download the handsets stolen in the UK and bar them from their systems. I also understand that a publicity campaign to inform the public that stolen phones can be removed from the system is being discussed.</P>
      <P>I consider that this technology, when fully implemented, has the capacity to significantly reduce the incidence of mobile phone thefts.</P>

      <P>As the Taoiseach outlines in Sustaining Progress, Social Partnership Agreement 2003-2005: one of the overall goals of the agreement is to ensure a consistant economic development framework that is socially and environmentally sustainable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="313" />The parties to the negotiations included the Government, employers, trade unions, farming bodies and the community and voluntary sector. While Comhar, the National Sustainable Development Partnership, is not a party of this process, many of its constituent bodies were represented at the negotiations.</P>
    <P>Sustainability issues were raised by many of the social partners throughout the negotiations, in particular by CORI. Sustaining Progress reaffirms the Government's commitment to the promotion of sustainable development through ensuring the necessary balance between environmental, economic and social aspects of development. While there are no proposals to carry out a formal environmental assessment of the agreement I am satisfied that environmental and sustainability concerns appropriately inform its overall content, and, that key policies such as the National Spatial Strategy and the National Climate Change Strategy are reflected in, and key issues such as waste management, public transport, national emissions ceiling and water quality are integrated into, the overall framework of the agreement.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment and Local Government (Mr. Cullen)</NameTxt>
      <P>My Department's heritage service is currently considering the suitability of nine upland areas for designation as special protection areas, SPAs, in respect of the hen harrier, one of the species for which SPAs are to be designated under the European Directive on the conservation of wild birds &ndash; 79/409/EEC. One of these sites is the Stack's-Mullaghareirks Mountains, County Limerick, which is in the general vicinity of the townlands mentioned in the question. Preparatory scientific work to confirm the suitability of SPA sites and define their boundaries is currently under way, and none of the sites being considered has been formally proposed for designation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In general, existing farming activities are likely to be fully compatible with the conservation requirements of bird species for which SPAs are designated. In these circumstances, there will be no need to place any restrictions on traditional farming activity. I reaffirm that I am committed to paying fair and reasonable compensation to landowners for any actual loss shown to have been incurred as a result of any restrictions that may be imposed on existing activities consequent on designation of their lands. Special protection areas also attract higher levels of payment to <Col N="314" /> farmers who join the rural environment protection scheme.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 458 and 462 together.</P>
      <P>Traffic management and safety matters, including road design, are an integral part of the overall layout of new residential developments and should be undertaken at initial design stage.</P>
      <P>In November 1998, my Department issued recommendations for site development works for housing areas which were intended for the guidance of local authorities, public authorities, private developers and consultants. The recommendations encourage road layout and alignments which seek to deter through traffic, to ensure very low traffic speeds and greater priority for pedestrians and cyclists within housing areas.</P>
      <P>Guidelines for planning authorities on residential density issued by my Department in September 1999 also contain advice on road standards and referred authorities to guidance contained in publications such as: Places, Street and Movement &ndash; DETR 1998 &ndash; and the earlier Layout of Housing Roads Design Guide &ndash; DOE Northern Ireland 1988. Wider roads serve to encourage greater vehicle speeds and are not recommended under the above guidelines for residential areas.</P>

      <P>All major housing authorities, that is, county and city councils, Drogheda, Sligo and Wexford Borough Councils and Athlone and Dundalk Town Councils operate the shared ownership scheme. The following table sets out the initial capital allocation notified to each local authority in 2002. Last year the following local authorities sought an increase and were granted approval to exceed their allocation: Cavan; Donegal; Galway; Kildare; Kilkenny; Laois; Limerick; Offaly; Sligo; North and South Tipperary; Wexford and Wicklow County Councils, Cork; Dublin; Galway and Limerick City Councils and Wexford Borough Council. Notification of this year's allocations will be issued shortly.</P>
      <P>Information on activity under the scheme is published in my Department's housing statistics bulletins, copies of which are available in the Oireachtas Library. Detailed information on the day-to-day operation of the scheme in individual authorities, including the maximum loan limit applied, is not available in my Department.</P>
      <P>My Department will continue and support the shared ownership scheme as an important instrument in support of affordable housing.</P>

      <Quest>the areas in which there is a focus on disabilities in relation to community development projects, in view of the fact that this is European Year of the Disabled; if his Department will give a priority to such projects in allocating funding for 2003; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs (Mr. N. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>The community development support programme is aimed at addressing all areas of poverty and disadvantage. Projects are concerned with the needs of women and children, those with disabilities, the homeless, lone parent families, the elderly, the unemployed, young people at risk, Traveller and other disadvantaged groups. Projects are based in inner city areas, in rural areas, in small towns and peripheral estates in suburban areas. Depending on their location and the particular needs in their areas, the projects have a wide range of individual aims, activities and target groups.</P>
      <P>Whereas the focus of each project supported under the community development support programme is determined by the management committee of each project, depending on identified needs locally, the programme also supports a number of initiatives which focus specifically on disability issues. The programme directly supports a community development post within the Kerry Network of People with Disabilities. Also, a contract was agreed last year with the Interaction project based in Clane, County Kildare. This project will have a national remit to work with people with disabilities in a number of local areas. The project has a two stranded approach involving personal development and leadership training and raising awareness of disability issues in other core-funded community development projects. It is expected that the Interaction project will become fully operational over the course of 2003.</P>
      <P>Under the community development support programme, my Department also funds a number of specialist support agencies which have a national focus and expertise in work with specific groups, for example, Travellers, homeless people, people with disabilities. These agencies are a resource to the programme in relation to the issues, as well as providing specialist advice and support to local projects, as appropriate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Disability Equality Specialist Support Agency, DESSA, focuses specifically on disability issues and works to enhance the capability of the programme to develop actions and ways of work<Col N="323" /> ing to ensure the full involvement and inclusion of people with disabilities within the programme.</P>
    <P>As the Deputy will be aware, due to the tighter economic situation, it may not be possible to progress the expansion of the community development support programmes at the same pace as we have done in previous years.</P>
    <P>However against the background of the measures outlined above, including the interaction project which will become fully operational this year, I am satisfied that the community development support programme is contributing positively and significantly in support of people with disabilities.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 479 and 480 together.</P>
      <P>There are 107 community development projects and 48 core funded groups being funded under the community development support programme. Details of all payments made to groups under the community development support programme are held in the Oireachtas Library for the information of the members. It is envisaged that details of grants for 2002 will be provided to the Oireachtas Library shortly.</P>
      <P>In addition, pre-project training and development work has been undertaken with 27 groups who have applied for core-funding under the community development support programme. In a further three areas, which have been designated for inclusion in the community development support programme, pre-development work has yet to commence. There are, in addition, 35 applications which are currently under assessment for inclusion in the community development support programme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Some &euro;25.281 million has been provided for in the Abridged Estimates for 2003 for community and voluntary supports which include: the community development support programme; grants to locally based community and family support <Col N="324" /> groups; training and support services to the community and voluntary sector, funded under the White Paper on Voluntary Activity; national networks of federations of community and voluntary groups, also funded under the White Paper on Voluntary Activity; and funding for national organisations working for the re-integration of prisoners.</P>
    <P>The precise allocation of funding as between the individual schemes for 2003 has yet to be determined. Due to the tighter economic situation this year, it may not be possible to progress the expansion of the community development support programme at the same pace as in previous years. The question of providing core funding to new groups will be considered in the context of existing commitments and available resources. However, I anticipate that decisions relating to the expansion of the programme during 2003 will be made as soon as possible.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social and Family Affairs (Mary Coughlan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 494 and 495 together.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will, I am sure, appreciate the need for proposals worked out in discussions aimed at ending a dispute to remain confidential to the parties to the discussions while the proposals are the subject of a ballot. There is no question of a secret deal in this matter, nor could there be in relation to proposals which have implications for charges under a statutory scheme.</P>
      <P>I am happy to say that the detailed proposals aimed at ending the dispute affecting the dental benefit scheme have been accepted by members of the Irish Dental Association. As a result it is expected that all dentists who participated in the dental benefit scheme in the past will resume doing so and that patients will have the degree of choice which they enjoyed before the dispute began.</P>
      <P>Under the settlement, oral examination and scale and polish treatments will continue to be available to patients free of charge. In addition, extractions will continue to be provided as heretofore on a fixed fee basis for those earning under &euro;45,000. The cost to the patient will increase by 10% in respect of these treatments as will the contribution by my Department towards the costs of these treatments. This means that a patient will pay nothing extra for oral examination or scale and polish but will pay an extra &euro;1.08 for extractions.</P>
      <P>In the case of fillings, the Department's contribution towards the costs of each filling increases by 10%, or for example, from &euro;26.54 to &euro;29.20 in the case of a simple amalgam filling.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="329" />The cost to the patient will be the normal private fee, less 15%, less the Department's contribution &ndash;&euro;29.20 in the case of a simple amalgam filling.</P>
    <P>The cost of other treatments, such as dentures, also increases by 10% as does my Department's contribution towards the costs of these treatments. The increase in the fees payable takes account of the fact that fees under the scheme were not increased last year. The settlement also involves a review of the scheme under an independent chair.</P>
    <P>The impact of the dispute cannot be fully assessed until a resolution is achieved and treatments which may have been deferred pending a settlement are carried out. Expenditure on dental benefit in 2002 amounted to &euro;35.1 million compared to &euro;35 million in 2001. Dental benefit is financed from the social insurance fund which operates separately from general taxation.</P>

      <P>Every person who is dissatisfied with a decision on a claim to a social welfare payment or with certain decisions made by health boards in regard to supplementary welfare allowances has a statutory right to appeal. The social welfare appeals system is a quasi-judicial one and the procedures involved are designed to ensure that every appellant's case gets full and fair consideration. While there is an inevitable time lag in such a process, which is governed by statutory and fair procedure requirements, it is designed to enable as quick a resolution of each appeal as possible.</P>
      <P>When an appeal is received, the social welfare appeals office refers the case to the deciding officer for his or her comments on the arguments made by the appellant, including any new evidence submitted. As a result of this process over one fifth of such cases are revised in the person's favour by deciding officers, usually because new evidence that warrants such a revision has become available.</P>
      <P>Some appeals may be decided summarily by an appeals officer on the basis of the documentation presented to him/her. In other cases the appeals officer may decide that an oral hearing is required before the issue can be decided.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Although the number of appeals increased in recent years, average processing times were broadly maintained over the period at around 22 weeks. This average time is impacted by, in a significant number of cases, issues such as adjourned hearings, usually at the appellant's behest, additional medical examinations and consultants' <Col N="330" /> reports, unavailability of legal representatives for hearings, etc.</P>
    <P>A consultancy study has been carried out recently on the appeals process, in order to assist the management of the appeals office in effecting improvements. Additional resources have been deployed to the office and the number of appeals on hand has been reduced from 7,500 at the beginning of 2000 to under 5,900 currently. Further measures are also being put in place to reduce the number of appeals on hands and to shorten the average time taken to determine an appeal.</P>

      <P>A number of measures, announced in the budget statement on 4 December last, are scheduled to come into effect during the course of 2003 and will require secondary legislation. These are:</P>
      <P>Carer's benefit: a person in receipt of carer's benefit may engage in employment or self-employment outside the home, subject to a maximum of ten hours per week and an income ceiling of &euro;95.23. As announced in the budget, provision has been made for an increase in the income ceiling to &euro;150 per week to come into effect in April 2003. The required regulations are currently being drafted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Carer's allowance: provision was made in budget 2003 for increases in the income disregarded for the purposes of carer's allowance. In the case of a single person, the increase is &euro;19 per week, bringing the total amount of the disregard to &euro;210. In the case of a married person, the disregard is increased by &euro;38 per week, raising the total to &euro;420. These amendments will be given <Col N="331" /> effect by regulations which are scheduled to commence in April 2003.</P>
    <P>Class P PRSI: provision was made in budget 2003 for an amendment to the minimum PRSI contribution payable by a class P contributor. The minimum amount payable was reduced from &euro;253 per annum to &euro;200 per annum, and this was provided for in section 6 of the Social Welfare Act 2002. Regulations extending these provisions in the case of an optional contributor who becomes an optional contributor in the same contribution year in which he or she first becomes insured as a self-employed contributor will be finalised shortly.</P>
