    <Title>Local Government Bill 2003  [  Seanad ]  : Second Stage (Resumed).</Title>
    <P>Question again proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaulNicholasGogartyGP" hpid="Mr. Gogarty Mr. Gogarty">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gogarty</NameTxt>
      <P>To recap on what I said last night to a much emptier House, the Green Party broadly welcomes this Bill. Its Deputies resigned their council seats within months of election.  Sitting Deputies were clearly re-elected without having been councillors at the last election.  We did not think that the crutch of being councillors was needed to get elected. It is possible to secure election without being a councillor and we believe that is the way forward.  For that reason, my party supports this Bill, warts and all.  I will get to the warts shortly but, first, I want to respond to some of the comments made by the Minister during his speech last night.</P>
      <P>As the Minister said from the outset, the Bill is clearly not a comprehensive overhaul of local government. The Green Party environment spokesperson, Deputy Cuffe, for whom I stand in today, has made numerous and comprehensive proposals to reform and revitalise local government. However, the unfortunate truth is that while this Administration and its predecessors have made some effort to achieve progress, for every stumble forward there are two cute hoor steps back.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. Treacy Mr. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>Language, please. The Deputy is not at home.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaulNicholasGogartyGP" hpid="Mr. Gogarty Mr. Gogarty">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gogarty</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a fact. The Government talks about decentralisation but all it does is relocate centralised Government Departments to favourite constituencies. It does not give local government any extra powers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is also a fact that while the Minister's predecessor attempted to streamline local government by establishing area committees and strategic policy committees, etc., and by making a councillor's job payable on a part-time basis - the other part being voluntary - he did not provide adequate certainty of funding for councils to deal with these new systems. While a new breed of semi-<Col N="802" />professional councillors was created, even more power was taken out of the hands of locally elected representatives in favour of county managers and other non-elected officials. Waste management was alluded to last night by Fine Gael and is one shameful example of the attempts being made to steamroll valid local objections to environmentally damaging incinerators and other technology such as this.</P>
    <P>Where is the democratic accountability? In essence, successive Ministers for the Environment and Local Government, mainly Fianna Fáil Ministers, have damaged the local authorities to such an extent that the system is now hobbling along. Much needs to be done but very little has yet been done. New powers are required for local government and elected representatives, with certain checks and balances to ensure that such powers are not abused, as was so often the case in regard to the rezoning of land.  I could continue on this issue if not for the short amount of time available to me.</P>
    <P>Local government has clearly not worked &ndash; this has been stated before and will be again. However, we should not focus on the broad strokes because this is a small, specific Bill. The Green Party believes that the ending of the dual mandate will go some way towards revitalising local councils and infusing the new blood, ideas and commitment towards working exclusively at local level that national Deputies and Senators can never have.</P>
    <P>How can Members be stuck in the Houses, waiting for votes, sitting on committees, and tabling motions, questions and Adjournment debate matters while also carrying out council work effectively? Perhaps one could if one did not have a life, but who wants a tired, clapped-out shadow of a public representative? It is better to allow Deputies and Senators to focus on their primary role and for them to do that well rather than also trying to compete with other councillors in the run-up to the 2004 elections.</P>
    <P>The Bill is flawed, particularly in regard to the taking away of the provision for directly elected mayors, which is a backward step and one that can only be seen as a sop to Fianna Fáil backbenchers who do not want the popular vote electing someone who might have a radical idea or vision. The way around this, of course, is to ensure that any candidates must already have experience as a locally or nationally elected representative. The Minister has taken the easy way out.</P>
    <P>The activities of Government backbenchers in opposing the war and on the Freedom of Information Act show that they are all talk and no action. For that reason, I am sure that this Bill will receive wholehearted support from the Fianna Fáil and Progressive Democrats benches.  However, in case some Opposition Members do not agree with the provision to abolish double-jobbing, the Green Party is indicating that it is quite willing to support the Government.</P>
    <P>Section 4, another flawed part of the Bill, states that the Minister shall issue guidelines to local <Col N="803" />authorities. Will the Minister provide clarity in relation to these guidelines? Is it not possible to provide for a legally binding directive in relation to the information that can be supplied?</P>
    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
      <P>For the information of the Deputy, when the Bill was passed by the Seanad, it changed all that to statutory declarations. I am not issuing guidelines but statutory declarations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaulNicholasGogartyGP" hpid="Mr. Gogarty Mr. Gogarty">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gogarty</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad that the Minister has clarified the matter, as it is hugely important.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DonnieCassidyFF" hpid="Mr. Cassidy Mr. Cassidy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cassidy</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="PaulNicholasGogartyGP" hpid="Mr. Gogarty Mr. Gogarty">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gogarty</NameTxt>
      <P>My party would like local county managers to be more transparent. A &lsquo;'members' net&rdquo;, which allows councillors to access information, has been established by South Dublin County Council, of which I am a member. I would like Deputies to be able to access information in a similar manner.</P>
      <P>I made a suggestion last night as a means of relaxing those terrified by the prospect of losing their Dáil or Seanad seats in the event of the abolition of double-jobbing. I mentioned that electoral reform should be considered with local government reform. The Minister was present for my contribution but other Deputies may not be aware that I spoke about the possibility of single seat constituencies, filled by the single transferable vote system and top-up lists.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gogarty</NameTxt>
      <P>My party would like to participate in a debate on electoral reform, if it is coming. Is the abolition of the dual mandate a forerunner of such reform? The abolition of the dual mandate, in itself, has its merits. Whatever about the flawed nature of this Bill, the Green Party supports the fact that it will bring about the removal of the dual mandate. In the unlikely event that Deputy Ring is right and the abolition is found to be unconstitutional, my party would support an amendment to the Constitution. It is a sufficiently important issue for the people to be consulted.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gogarty</NameTxt>
      <P>The removal of the link between national and local government could lay the foundations for a vibrant and self-confident local authority structure. This Bill should mark a tentative first step towards making local government fluid, energetic and, heaven forbid, transparent. While my party supports it because local government does not have the positive characteristics I <Col N="805" />have mentioned, where is the reform that the Minister has promised? When will the other reforms be brought forward? Such reforms are necessary if the abolition of the dual mandate is to benefit local government and be anything other than a false dawn.</P>

      <P>I acknowledge that progress was made under the stewardship of the previous Minister, Deputy Noel Dempsey, who enshrined the role of local government in the Constitution. This Bill represented an opportunity to build on that positive move but, unfortunately, the fact that it includes a reckless section on mayors and chairs means that if it is passed, it will be remembered&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="ArthurMorganSF" hpid="Mr. Morgan Mr. Morgan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morgan</NameTxt>
      <P>Rather than providing for a measure of real democracy, the Bill leaves us with the ubiquitous and autocratic county managers who are responsible to almost no one. I do not have to look too far to see examples of decisions that are arrogant and &ndash; I say this reluctantly &ndash; downright stupid, in some cases. I had to bring the manager of Louth County Council to the High Court on an issue of the utmost importance to my constituents. If the manager in question had simply used his fingers to count the result of a vote, he would have known that he was wrong and would have saved the people of County Louth in excess of £40,000. We all know that such people can be arrogant and all-powerful but their power derives primarily from the Minister for the Environment and Local Government.</P>

      <P>Is the deletion of Chapter 3 of Part V of the Local Government Act 2001 assisting local democracy? Of course, it is not &ndash; it is very wrong. The supposed commitment of the Minister to local government reform is laughable. I remind Deputies that he is also seeking, through the Protection of the Environment Bill 2003, to further destroy local democracy by giving increased powers to city and county managers. People will no longer accept the arbitrary transfer of control of their local authorities to such managers by a Government which is obviously annoyed by what it sees as the nuisance of local democracy.</P>

    <P>There is a pressing need to reform the financing of local government. It is worth noting that Ireland has one of the lowest rates of local government expenditure, as a percentage of total <Col N="808" />expenditure, in the European Union. Local authorities are unable to raise funding in an equitable and fair manner.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Morgan</NameTxt>
      <P>Local authorities are continually reacting to funding crises and are now being forced to implement Government cut-backs. They are forced to introduce penal charges such as planning levies because they do not have the finance they need for important projects such as building social housing. Exorbitant parking charges are also seen to an increasing extent. The formulation of estimates is controlled by unelected city or county managers and only the Minister can sanction extra expenditure. This is completely unacceptable because, as we know, the hands of local authorities are tied without financial control. They are threatened with dissolution each year if they do not impose service charges. Legislation should be bought before the House to give them far greater autonomy in determining and controlling expenditure.</P>
      <P>I ask the Minister to elaborate on the comment he made during his speech last night. He said that a major independent review of local government funding will get under way shortly. I look forward to that and I hope the review is imaginative and creative because it is long overdue. I hope that I will be able to commend the Minister when speaking to a future Bill in the manner I was able to commend his predecessor, Deputy Noel Dempsey. Perhaps the only agreement I had with Deputy Dempsey involved his decision to make constitutional provisions for local government.</P>
      <P>I welcome wholeheartedly the ending of the dual mandate which I hope marks the dawn of a new era for local government. I urge that the provision for the direct election of cathaoirligh be reinstated at the earliest opportunity.</P>

      <P>At local authority level, we have seen the introduction of strategic policy committees. Most local authority members sit on two committees and if they are to be developed effectively, those members must be dedicated to the role. With all the work that goes on in this House, it is impossible for Deputies to devote a sufficient amount of time to local authority work. Representations must be made continually to local authorities by Deputies on issues such as housing, planning, roads and drainage. The increasing workload of Deputies makes it impossible for Members to do both jobs. It will come as no surprise to hear that Sinn Féin is totally in favour of the abolition of the dual mandate.</P>

      <P>I am absolutely in favour of the ending of the dual mandate. Some people put up the argument that we are being too restrictive. There are already a number of restrictions involved in any election. If you are not 18 you cannot vote in this State, though I heard it argued recently at a debate I attended that the age should be lowered to 16. You cannot contest a presidential election unless you are 35, which is not a problem here as almost everybody, with the possible exceptions of Deputies Gogarty and English, would qualify.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ArthurMorganSF" hpid="Mr. Morgan Mr. Morgan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morgan</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps that is welcome. There are also significant restrictions on voting rights in this State for EU citizens in general elections. The concept is not new and I do not accept the arguments that have been put forward by those who oppose the ending of the dual mandate that the restriction on Senators and Deputies is unfair.</P>
      <P>The concern I have relates to the overuse of centralised power, which is unfair. It corrupts local authorities, not in the financial sense, but by forcing them to implement all sorts of planning levies and parking fees. For example, in my own county a planning levy of &euro;3,300 is imposed on a young couple applying for permission to build their first house. How can that be fair, particularly in the context of the ending of the first time buyer's grant in the budget? It is a gross imposition on the very people local government should support. I ask the Minister to look closely at that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I hope the dual mandate ends, but it is equally <Col N="810" />important to ensure that city and county managers are not given additional power. There is an opportunity to replace city and county managers with representatives who are directly elected by the citizens and voters of a city or county. I ask the Minister to take that opportunity. He still has time to delete the corrupting section from the Bill to allow this to proceed. I would be favourably disposed to support the Bill in such circumstances.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusHealy" hpid="Mr. Healy Mr. Healy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Healy</NameTxt>
      <P>I am opposed to this Bill and I will vote against it at the conclusion of the debate. The objective of the legislation is to undermine the democratic process by ensuring that the public is not entitled to elect whomsoever they wish to this House. It will also undermine the democratic process whereby the public has a right to elect directly a chairman or mayor of a local authority.</P>
      <P>We are being told that the preparation, promotion, formulation, discussion and passing of legislation are the prime responsibilities of Members of this House and of the Seanad, which is correct. The Minister made the point again last night when he stated &ldquo;. . .  as Parliament evolves still further in tune with the key role of the Oireachtas which, under the Constitution, is charged with the sole and exclusive power of making laws for the State&rdquo;. I accept that, but the real objectives of the abolition of the dual mandate and the right to elect directly mayors and chairmen are threefold.</P>
      <P>This Bill will set the scene for massive increases in local taxation. In the course of the last general election I looked at the economic programmes of the main political parties. I stated publicly that they pointed to increased taxation and new taxes at local level in particular. That trend has already begun. We have seen huge increases in refuse charges this year, which went up by one third in my own local authority area. Similar increases have occurred right around the country and charges are set to become even greater. We have seen an increase at local level in the new charge for waste water and we hear talk of the reintroduction of local authority rates and/or the introduction of a local income tax.</P>
      <P>The second aim of this Bill is to ensure that Government Deputies and Senators are removed from the line of fire when the huge taxation increases are introduced. Third, the Bill seeks to undermine currently elected Independent Deputies and attempts to ensure that more are not elected. The election of Independent Deputies to this Dáil and the last has put the fear of God into the political parties, which is part and parcel of the reasoning behind the introduction of this legislation.</P>
      <P>If the Minister accepts that legislation is the prime responsibility of this House and the Seanad, does he not think it odd that consideration of no Bill requires Deputies to attend the Dáil?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Healy</NameTxt>
      <P>The main element of this Bill is the abolition of the direct election of mayors and chairmen. This provision was put in place just two years ago with huge fanfare. On that occasion the <Col N="812" />then Minister spoke about innovative measures and proposals. He stated:</P>
      <P>It is my intention also to promote another powerful impetus for change in the internal dynamics of local government through the direct election of a full-time cathaoirleach of cities and counties with a term of office for the five year life of the council. I am talking about a cathaoirleach who is directly answerable to the people and accountable to the elected council, who must work with the council to deliver on a full potential of the office, which is highly visible and accountable, a person elected by the people who draws on powerful democratic legitimacy to speak and negotiate on behalf of the whole community.</P>
      <P>Less than two years later the position has changed completely. It has been turned on its head because the Minister and the Government are afraid of independent non-party candidates standing for the position of mayor and cathaoirleach. The Fianna Fáil backbenchers have ensured that this proposal is not in this legislation. I will be opposing the Bill.</P>

      <P>The only thing that bothers Fianna Fáil is the prospect of an alternative Government and the more Independents there are, the less prospect of that.</P>
      <P>I thank Deputy Gogarty and the members of the Technical Group for agreeing to take up my speaking slot in the House yesterday evening. I apologise to the Minister and the Fine Gael spokesperson for my inability to attend the opening of the debate. I was at a selection convention to select a replacement for former councillor Frank Smith of my party who unfortunately is ill at present.  I think it appropriate at the outset of a debate on local government legislation to say very simply that if the local government system had more people like Frank Smith, it would be a lot better in every way and much less in need of reform.</P>
      <P>Many colourful things have been said both in this debate and in the public discussion about the ending of the dual mandate. My prize for the most colourful so far was a statement issued by the Minister on the day he launched the Bill:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The complete separation of local govern<Col N="813" />ment from the national Legislature is a historic development, 80 years after the State was founded. It is possibly the single most significant change in the administration of local government since the present system was constituted by Gerald Balfour at the end of the 19th century.</P>
    <P>That is a load of bull's excrement. This Bill is not reforming local government. In his opening remarks on the legislation, the Minister now has rowed back from these high aspirations for the legislation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
      <P>I have not rowed back.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>He says the Bill is clearly not a comprehensive overhaul of local government. It certainly is not. The only thing this Bill does is row back on the one modest, although significant, change in local government legislation which the Minister's predecessor put through the Houses of the Oireachtas before the last general election. It is taking out the right of the people to directly elect city and county mayors or cathaoirligh and doing so for one simple reason: it is now perceived by the Government to be in Fianna Fáil's electoral interest not to have direct elections for city and county mayors, whereas it was perceived by them that a system of electing city and county mayors in the climate of high opinion poll ratings which they enjoyed at the time of the first Bill's passage through the House would result in the election of the Fianna Fáil <i>gauleiter </i>in every county being elected as the county mayor. This is being done for Fianna Fáil's electoral advantage, not for the reform of local government.</P>
      <P>This Bill is utterly inadequate as any attempt to reform local government and, for those reasons, the Labour Party will vote against it. What is recognised as local government in most other countries does not exist in Ireland. We do not have a system of local government but rather a system of local administration which is overly bureaucratic, inefficient, inappropriate for the requirements of today, often irrelevant to the needs of the people it purports to serve, impenetrable for the public and in my view highly undemocratic.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Instead of having a system of local government we have direct rule from Dublin with county managers carrying out the bidding of the Custom House. Elected councils are increasingly stripped of either the powers to make policy, to direct county managers or even to hold the system of local administration in its many manifestations to public account. In the past five or six years, particularly since the election of the Fianna Fáil - Progressive Democrats Government in 1997, the democratic functions which traditionally attached to elected local authorities have been increasingly removed and transferred in a succession of measures to unelected officials and unelected public bodies. The responsibility for roads, which was transferred under the Roads Act to the National Roads Authority, has been consoli<Col N="814" />dated, with the whole system of approval of major road schemes transferred to An Bord Pleanála and taken out of the democratic stream of decision-making.</P>
    <P>The making of waste management plans was transferred initially to county managers by a default mechanism under the original Waste Management (Amendment) Act and, more recently, that power has been made absolute under the so-called Protection of the Environment Act. County managers will now make the waste management plans and decide on issues which are of key concern to local communities.  The decision on the making of Traveller settlement plans has been, in effect, transferred under the Traveller Accommodation Act to county managers.</P>
    <P>I do not know how many Members of the House have had the experience of initiating a review of their county development plan under the provisions of the Planning and Development Act 2000. When they do they will discover, as I have, that what had previous been an absolutely reserved function for the elected members of local authorities has in many respects been handed to county managers. Instead of the normal function of making their county development plan, elected members of local authorities are now being invited to do no more than rubber stamp the drafts prepared by managers and the strategic planning guidelines which have been prepared by officials of the Minister's Department.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>The whole process has been framed in such a way with timetables and default mechanisms that, in effect, the real decision-making power has been taken from elected members and handed to officials. Even the process of the adoption of the county estimate, which, in addition to the making of the county development plan, was traditionally a function of elected members of local authorities, has now, in effect, been transferred to county managers. This was done through the mechanism of the threat that exists under local government legislation whereby if a local authority does not adopt its estimate on time, the council will be abolished. The Minister seems to have taken to that provision with an enthusiasm which was not evident in any of his predecessors.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is anxious to get his hands on it. The process by which estimates are adopted is also constrained by the many rules and regulations issued by the Department. Under the legislation which the Minister will introduce in this House shortly, the responsibility for waste charges will be transferred to county managers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I agree with Deputy Healy who said that the <Col N="815" />decks are being cleared for the Government to say it not increasing taxes. It is creating a situation whereby it will use the local government system to introduce taxes and charges by the back door&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;and then wash its hands of it by saying it has nothing to do with it and it is a matter for the local council.</P>
      <P>Waste charges are now running at &euro;200 to &euro;400 in most counties. The Minister said at the Oireachtas Committee on the Environment and Local Government that he wants to see local authorities charging the economic cost for waste.  He gave an estimate of what it will be and, based on that, people will be charged in the region of &euro;600 to &euro;700 per household for waste collection.  I see the Minister nodding in agreement.</P>

      <P>In addition, the three wise men recommended at the time of the last budget that water charges should be reintroduced. Deputy Healy referred to the charges for waste water. There is the question of road tolls and so on.  There is another provision which to my knowledge has not been exercised by any local authority. I believe in time that local authorities will be told to exercise a measure whereby it can introduce a charge or community levy for the provision of services in local areas.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>There is precedent for this. Precisely the same was done in the 1980s in the neighbouring jurisdiction. When the Thatcher government of the 1980s wanted to convince the public it was reducing taxes, it dismantled the democratic system of local government, abolished the Greater London Council, rubbished the operation of democratic local authorities and used the same local authorities to introduce the poll tax, which was eventually the downfall of that particular Admin<Col N="816" />istration.

It is understandable, perhaps, that in a country where the population is approximately four million, significantly less than the population of many large cities either in Europe or the United States, there would be a tendency towards centralisation. That tendency towards centralisation has been exacerbated and exaggerated by the unhealthy political history in this State where, by and large, the country has been governed for the past 70 years by one party, with just occasional interruptions.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>In a country with a small population and a centralised system of public administration, with one party rule, where that one party has its own local network and so on, there was, at the very least, no incentive to create or encourage a healthy system of local government.  There was every intention, deliberate or not, to downplay local government and to discourage it from developing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When my colleague, Deputy Howlin, was Minister for the Environment he attempted, in the Better Local Government document, to set a framework for the reform of local government.  It was intended to be no more than a start to a process. The basic idea was, first, to include the wider community and civic interests through the strategic policy committees and other such bodies. The development of the SPC system would build a structure within local authorities that would be headed on the administrative and management side by a director of services and on the political side by the chair of the SPC. In turn, the chairs of the SPCs would constitute what would effectively be a local cabinet. The chairs themselves would be drawn from the broad representation of the membership of the local authority rather than the traditional winner takes all system. This would then be supported by the local authorities having some independence in revenue <Col N="817" />raising, for example, by the establishment of the local government fund, the dedication of motor taxation to it and, in the view of the then Minister, the right of the local authorities to have some discretion on setting the levels of motor taxation, including possible increases.</P>
    <P>I attended the Local Authority Members Association conference held in Wexford at Easter 1998 at which the Minister's predecessor, Deputy Noel Dempsey, outlined his vision for the future of local government. I agreed with much of what he said and I took the view that he was serious about building on the start made by the former Minister, Deputy Howlin. As part of his vision, the Minister, Deputy Dempsey indicated his intention to end the dual mandate entitling Members of the Oireachtas to be members of local authorities and to introduce a new tier of democratic election to the local authority system which would include the creation of full-time elected city and county mayors.</P>
    <P>Subsequent developments have reversed that process. The better local government document has been used not to reform but to reinforce the bureaucratic side of local government. It was a mistake to dismantle the professional tier of local government, the system of county engineers, architects, planners etc. and absorb it into the director of service system. That has seriously weakened the professional and technical side of the local government service. It has also contributed to the drift away from the local authority service of professional staff who see little for them in the traditional career structures. Ultimately, the administrative and managerial side hold the advantages in terms of promotional opportunities. It has been a regressive step.</P>
    <P>While the appointment of directors of services has increased the number of managers in local authorities, it has not improved the quality of management. The operation of the SPC system is far removed from what was intended. The so-called strategic policy committees meet quarterly in most local authorities. If a member of a local authority puts down a motion about a policy issue it is immediately shunted to the SPC. It may take three or four months for the SPC to consider it and when it does so it is used as a means of rubber stamping the policy paper presented by the manager. In effect, the SPC system, which was designed to increase the involvement of the public and the attention paid to strategic policy issues, has worked in reverse. There is now less consideration by local authorities of policy matters and strategic issues.</P>

      <P>To term the net effect of this a system of local government would be an exaggeration. Increasingly, the elected representatives <Col N="818" />have less of a say. We have a system of local administration which has become much more bureaucratic and less accountable, penetrable and accessible for the public. Members of the public are becoming increasingly disenchanted with it. They are becoming alienated from their local authorities and are losing confidence in those they elect because they see they have no power or, if they do, that they will not exercise it. They also find they have no way of accessing the local authority.</P>
      <P>When anything needs to be done we increasingly look somewhere other than the formal local government system to address it. For example, the drugs issue was not addressed by the local authorities but by the establishment of drugs task forces in local areas. When the issue of traffic in a big city like Dublin has to be addressed it is no longer done through the local government system. I understand the Government is preparing legislation on a traffic or transport authority for the greater Dublin area. When the Government had to consider the strategic planning of the greater Dublin area it could not, or did not, do so through the local government system. The Department of the Environment and Local Government prepared guidelines which the Government superimposed on the system. Even when something major happens in a locality or a city, such as the loss of a major industry, the local authority or city or county mayor no longer drives the process. The Minister is asked to establish a task force.</P>
      <P>A new network of organisations has developed at community level which bypasses the local government system. From speaking to school principals who work in disadvantage areas, it is clear that the initiatives taken to address disadvantage now involve the establishment of new task forces, committees and so on.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>There are two essential measures in this Bill. Neither I nor the Labour Party has any great difficulty with the ending of the dual mandate. When the legislation was before the House previously the Labour Party supported the ending of the dual mandate. It is our considered and collective view, not necessarily shared by all our Members, as would probably be the case across the House, that the time has come whereby, because of the demands of the work of the Oireachtas and demands at local authority level and so on, it is not possible for a Member to be on a local authority and a Member of the Oireachtas simultaneously. We do not have a great difficulty with that.</P>
      <P>There is no point in arguing that by taking Deputies and Senators out of local authorities one is reforming local government. That is not the case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a huge change.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>The original idea of ending the dual mandate was in a particular context where there would be a full-time political presence in the local authority and that the full-time political presence would be the directly elected&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelRing" hpid="Mr. Ring Mr. Ring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ring</NameTxt>
      <P>Mayor.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;city or county mayor.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
      <P>One can still do that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>The situation will be made worse if the Minister abolishes both the dual mandate and the idea of directly elected city and county mayors. When the Members of the Oireachtas were gone, the idea was that there would be a full-time directly elected city or county mayor, whose powers would be modest, who would ride shotgun on the manager. That is gone now. The only democratic strengthening which was proposed in the original legislation is being taken away.</P>
      <P>We need a reform of local government which addresses three key areas, the first of which is the issue of structures. It is time we moved away from the traditional city and county structure for local government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>We need to look at the national spatial strategy and where settlements have occurred and try to reconstruct our local government system around that. There is a loyalty to the county structure, largely because of loyalty to GAA teams and all that goes with them. A different system of local government does not in any way undermine that. There can be two county councils in Tipperary and it does not mean Tip<Col N="820" />perary supporters will shout with two different voices at an All-Ireland final. There are three county councils in Dublin and neither there nor in Northern Ireland, where the system of local government is no longer based on the county system, does it undermine loyalty to the county teams.</P>
      <P>We need to move away from the county idea.  For example, the towns of Bray and Greystones have more in common with the greater Dublin area than with the towns of Carnew or Dunlavin which, in turn, probably have more in common with Athy and Carlow than with the towns on the east coast of Wicklow. Another example is Gort, in my native county, which has more in common with Ennis than with Clifden. We need to relook at the structures of local government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
      <P>I am open to that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>We need to look at the functions and particularly the issue of resources which I have not had time to address. Unless local government is resourced it will not be able to deliver the service people need.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TonyKilleen" hpid="Mr. Killeen Mr. Killeen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Killeen</NameTxt>
      <P>The principal issue being addressed in the Local Government Bill 2003 is local authority and parliamentary membership and the ending of the dual mandate. Unlike many Members I have been a long time supporter of this idea. I am also in a unique position in that I have tasted all the different levels of participation that exist.</P>
      <P>Clearly the first result of making this change is that a considerably greater number of persons will participate in our democracy. Sometimes people dismiss that as a small point but I hold that it is a major advantage as 120 extra people will participate directly in local authorities who would otherwise be excluded if the dual mandate were to continue.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TonyKilleen" hpid="Mr. Killeen Mr. Killeen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Killeen</NameTxt>
      <P>This is an important point that has not been addressed. The level of time commitment which my former colleagues on Clare County Council devote to their representational duties is much greater than when I first joined the local authority in 1985. This is partly due to the number of special policy committees, area committees, county development boards and so on which have been set up. It is fair to say some of those bodies are still finding their feet and some have not turned out be as useful or as proactive as had been hoped. The more time their members have to devote to participation the more effective they are likely to be. There are other constraints which will have to be addressed to make them as effective as they have the potential to become. On balance, the ending of the dual mandate is a positive move in relation to the development of these committees.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the results of the proposal which has <Col N="821" />been around since at least the early 1990s is that it has spawned a proliferation of constitutional lawyers and, no doubt, the issue will be tested in the courts. Only then will the outcome of that element be known.</P>
    <P>I served as a councillor for seven years before being elected to the Oireachtas. During the following five years I served as a member of both Clare County Council and the Dáil. Since 1997 I have served as a Member of this House only.  My experience has been that I have had time to devote to issues in Parliament and to issues in relation to individual constituents that I would not have had were I also a member of the local authority.</P>
    <P>The role of the local councillor has changed so much in that timespan that it is difficult for anybody to give the commitment necessary. The only individuals who could give that level of commitment are those who have personal resources which enable them to employ people to do research, write letters or deal with many of the time-consuming elements of the role as it has developed. Even those of us who have only an Oireachtas role have a demand on resources which is not being met by the Houses of the Oireachtas. There are financial constraints now that there were not three or four years ago. It remains an issue which diminishes the effectiveness of Members on all sides. Opposition spokespersons have a particular reason to feel aggrieved.</P>
    <P>Backbench members of Government parties have a role to play in addressing legislation, which could be done more effectively if the resources were available to us. There are many who are not afraid to exercise that role. Due to a lack of resources Members on all sides, and likewise members of local authorities, are frequently constrained because they do not have ready access to material that would benefit them in dealing with their roles.</P>
    <P>Deputy Gilmore said, among other things, that the Government promised everything in advance of the last election and was successful on foot of that. I do not blame him because many people now believe that. However, it is at variance with the truth based on my experience in County Clare, where one of the main issues that arose during the general election campaign concerned the Ennis bypass element of the Sligo-Limerick road. The Government indicated clearly in advance of the election that money would not be available for this project. It had an impact on the outcome of the election, but the truth was told and the people made their judgment on foot of it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelRing" hpid="Mr. Ring Mr. Ring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ring</NameTxt>
      <P>It is the only place where the Government told the truth.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TonyKilleen" hpid="Mr. Killeen Mr. Killeen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Killeen</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy should not be tempting me because I am aware of other areas in respect of which the parties in Government set <Col N="822" />out fairly stark realities which were at variance with the promises of some of the other parties.</P>
      <P>Deputy Gilmore referred to the role of the community development networks and all others involved in the community sector. He is quite correct to state that their activities, in many respects, undermine the role of local authority members.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not quite what I said.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TonyKilleen" hpid="Mr. Killeen Mr. Killeen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Killeen</NameTxt>
      <P>That is true. At a minimum, it points to a role that ought to be adopted by local authorities and which has not been taken traditionally. It is certainly not being taken in the context of the SPCs, where we envisaged it would be taken. I know that is somewhat different and my perspective on the issue is quite different to that of Deputy Gilmore. However, it is one of fundamental importance in terms of the form of local government. It needs to and can be addressed.</P>
      <P>The national spatial strategy has the potential to have a huge influence and impact. It is sad that it also has the opposite potential. Much of the evidence suggests that it is not being taken as seriously as it might by local authorities and perhaps some Government Departments. It would be useful to revisit the matter in this Chamber and at the relevant committees. If a strategy, which involved much consideration and has the support of a considerable number of people, is set out at national level, it should be given the support it deserves.</P>
      <P>Deputy Gilmore made a point about county loyalty. I am tempted to inform the Minister that, since he will undoubtedly be looking at city and county boundaries close to his home, I would not want him to think that, on foot of this, he might, with impunity, extend boundaries closer to my county. Constituents in Limerick East, who are in the area served by the local authority of County Clare, are adamant that they wish to remain Clare people. While county loyalty may serve as the strongest argument &ndash; as well as other issues upon which we had better not touch &ndash; there are also good reasons that the integrity of the county to which I refer, and any other county for that matter, ought to be preserved. In doing so, there is undoubtedly an onus on the county authority to service, in an appropriate manner, the residents of the area in question, which is close to Limerick and where there are some deficiencies in services which ought to be addressed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let us consider the provision of Traveller accommodation and planning, a significant issue which is causing considerable disquiet in many counties, including my own. I pay tribute to my former colleagues on Clare County Council for the manner in which they have addressed their obligations under the Traveller accommodation requirements and have not left the manager to take the rap. However, the roll-out of the programme is slow and unpopular in some areas for a plethora of reasons, despite the fact that funding has immediately been provided on every <Col N="823" />occasion it has been sought from the Minister and Minister of State.</P>
    <P>Consider planning issues and the role of local authority members in respect of county development plans. Since I left the local authority, I have come to the view that the division of power in the area of planning policy - as opposed to dealing with individual planning applications - and perhaps interpretation, which is central to it, is weighted very heavily against members of the local authority and, by extension, people on the ground.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PeterKellyFF" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Local Government Bill and I am particularly happy to endorse the proposals to end the dual mandate whereby councillors can also sit in the Houses of the Oireachtas. Given increasing indifference among voters towards the electoral process, I am certain that the provisions ending the dual mandate will contribute greatly to revitalising political engagement. Politics is not the preserve of a small group of people who wish to take over all political fora.  It has been noted that the same people seem to be on town councils, county councils and regional authorities. They are attending all conferences and are also Members of the Dáil.</P>
      <P>Simply by affording more people the opportunity to be public representatives, the Bill makes a substantial contribution to restoring interest in the political process.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>Membership of local councils is, for many, the first opportunity to serve in public life.  However, the presence of Oireachtas Members on councils is a major obstacle to that first engagement in politics. Ending the dual mandate is imperative for broadening the political base.</P>
      <P>It remains incontrovertible that the number of women involved in representative politics in Ireland is very low by international standards. In many ways  women are particularly suited to be local representatives. Their practical approach, natural empathy and affinity for community are all vital characteristics for an effective local representative.</P>
      <P>Ireland has a long tradition of good local Government. In 1920, the underground Dáil Éireann, formed by successful Sinn Féin candidates in the 1919 general election, set up a local government Department which assumed the functions of a central authority. The Local Government Board was still active and, nominally at least, in control of affairs. For a time, therefore, two central authorities were competing for the allegiance of local authorities. A majority of the local authorities, however, quickly recognised the new Dáil Department and broke with the Local Government Board.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Based on the most recent census of population, there are almost 1.5 million Irish people under 25 years of age. The country's total population is <Col N="824" />approximately 3.6 million. Young people under 25 years of age represent 41% of the population, compared to a European average of 25%.  Ireland has the youngest population in the European Union. It is often said that that young people are the future of Irish democracy.  However, young people should also been seen in the present tense. Approximately 500,000 people under 25 are eligible to vote. The non-participation of young people is the greatest threat and challenge facing our democratic system as it enters the new century. The turnout in elections has steadily declined in recent years to a point where voters are becoming a minority. Recent trends have been quite alarming.</P>
    <P>The 1997 general election turnout, at 66.2%, was the lowest since 1923. The 1997 presidential election turnout, at 46.8%, was the lowest ever, as was the 1999 local election turnout, at 50.2%. Evidence suggests that the turnout of voters &ndash; particularly young voters &ndash; is declining across the world, especially in developed countries. What sets Ireland apart is the turnout of first-time voters. A recently published analysis of electoral participation data in 1999 showed that among the 15 countries analysed, Ireland had the lowest turnout of first-time voters.</P>
    <P>Fianna Fáil has tried to make itself more relevant to young people. Two themes that constantly come up as barriers to young people getting involved are voter registration and education. We have acted on calls to improve advertising and media campaigns to provide information and education. Two types of campaign were identified as necessary &ndash; educational campaigns to inform people of how the system works and campaigns encouraging people to vote. The Referendum Commission has improved this situation.</P>
    <P>Everyone wants to have an impact, yet far too many young people feel they have little opportunity to substantially affect Government policy. However, it is possible to achieve concrete, practical changes on issues ranging from protecting public health to safeguarding consumers, from preserving the environment to establishing meaningful finance reform.</P>
    <P>At the heart of our plans for the Ireland of the 21st century is a new, vigorous system of local government based on sound financing, comprehensive modern legislation and integration of the best statutory and voluntary organisations. We have tried to make ourselves more relevant to young people. One of the big challenges ahead for us is the local elections in 2004.</P>

      <P>I am sure this is of great interest to many people here, because unlike previous campaigns, these local elections will provide an unprecedented opportunity for new, young candidates to emerge. Under the Local Government Bill, this separation of local government from the <Col N="825" />national Legislature is an historic development. It is no exaggeration to state that this is the most momentous change in the nature of local government since the enactment of the present system which was established over a century ago.</P>
      <P>The ending of the dual mandate removes a significant barrier to young people's progress in political life. It could not have come at a more appropriate time when we consider the increasing apathy among young people towards political life and the electoral process. The time for change is overdue. It is the electorally-mandated policy of the parties in Government. Deputies are hard working, full-time politicians. There are not enough hours in the day nor days in the week.</P>

However, he should have been honest and called it the ending of the dual mandate Bill, because that is all that is in it. The Minister will be aware that the Government and previous Ministers promised we would have directly elected mayors and cathaoirligh of councils. He gave in to the pressure of Fianna Fáil colleagues, particularly councillors who would never be elected if the system of direct election was introduced. It is a perk for them when they have a majority on councils. In some cases they are put in and are not able to function as chairmen. I saw this in the past. It has been an embarrassment to the Minister's party and to the county to have such people in those positions.</P>

Why do Fianna Fáil, Fine Gael and the Labour Party not make it a rule that if councillors are elected to the Dáil, members are prevented from being both a councillor and a Member of the Oireachtas? There is no need to enshrine this in law. All the political parties have to do is say is that Oireachtas Members have to give up their council seat. Why is it necessary to put it into law?</P>
      <P>Last year the Minister introduced Better Local Government.</P>

      <P>It was the previous Minister for the Environment and Local Government, Deputy Noel Dempsey. The officials in my county call it bitter local government because it has created <Col N="826" />nothing but bitterness. I call it bloated local government because all that has happened is that we have more officials &ndash; more jobs for the boys and the girls of the councils. Nobody can deny that we now have a worse service within the local government sector.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ring</NameTxt>
      <P>I would favour it if there was real local government and real change in it. I would support the Bill without difficulty. In fact, I would support the Bill if the Minister concedes that I can put down a question to the Minister for the Environment and Local Government in regard to a constituency problem. If I do so, the Minister will only reply that he has no responsibility for that matter and that is what the county manager will say when we are not part of the local government scene. They will say, &ldquo;I have no responsibility for you.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I do not see any need for the Bill to come before the Oireachtas. I would like to see real local government reform and changes in the local government system but what has happened is hypocritical. Next week the Protection of the Environment Bill comes before the House. In it the Minister and the Government propose to hand over power in regard to refuse charges to county managers. Is that better local government? Is that giving power back to local representatives?</P>
    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelRing" hpid="Mr. Ring Mr. Ring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ring</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not. Deputy Gilmore referred to the two powers which were the preserve of local government. I agree with his point and I said it recently at my local council meeting. One of these powers was adopting the rate which has been taken away from us because we do not have any real way of collecting revenues within the local authority. The other power was the adoption of a county development plan, which was the sole function of the elected representatives. Now if the county manager does not like it, he or she will contact an official in the Department of the Environment and Local Government. The Minister will then intervene to change the plan adopted by the council members. It is a scandal. That is not better local government. That is no local government at all.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I believe the Bill is unconstitutional. I got legal advice to that effect and I hope the President will refer the Bill to the Supreme Court. I hope she will call the Council of State together and refer it because of the controversy in regard to it. There is a lot of controversy on all sides of the House. People do not believe that any Minister or any Government has the right to say who can stand for public office, which is what is happening. The Minister for the Environment and Local Government is saying that Deputy Ring, Deputy Kelly or <Col N="827" />Deputy Gilmore cannot stand in the next council election.</P>

The only people who can make an adjudication on that are the general public. People died for us to have the right to vote. My aunt and uncle were shot in 1921 setting up the police force. As I have said on many previous occasions, if he was a Fianna Fáil member there would be a plaque to him. I have seen plaques to members of Fianna Fáil who were under the bed when the Civil War was taking place.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ring</NameTxt>
      <P>There is nothing wrong with that; it is a good thing. How will the Minister deal with the dual mandate within the Cabinet? There are senior Ministers with the backup of the State who have a dual mandate. I am talking about Ministers who are teachers. Substitutes are filling their teaching posts, but the Ministers are taking the pension rights and in some cases are taking part of the salary. Is that a dual mandate and will the Minister deal with it?</P>
      <P>Will the Minister deal with the dual mandate within the councils, where some people are members of town and county councils? There are councillors who are on health boards, vocational education committees and regional assemblies. Those are dual or triple mandates. I heard Deputy Kelly speak of a busy life. When meetings are called in my county it is not the Oireachtas Members who cannot attend, but the councillors who are so busy. Some of them have travelled more than Joe Walsh Tours.</P>
      <P>I would like to address some remarks to Mr. Liam Kenny of the General Council of County Councils. I paid my contribution to that organisation. I never saw a union throw out one of its members who was not wanted. Although there are 128 Oireachtas Members on local authorities, I was never consulted by the General Council of County Councils to find out my views on the dual mandate. I will deal with the GCCC and I will open a can of worms it will never forget. I will say no more about that today, as I will deal with it in another forum. Mr. Kenny was elected by no one. The Minister has told us this is the view of the chambers of commerce.</P>

We should know if the Attorney General believes the Minister has the right to prevent somebody from standing for public office, which is what he is doing.</P>
      <P>Does the Minister think it appropriate to take Senators away from their natural constituency? Is it right to tell Senators they may not be members of local authorities when the members of those authorities elect them to the Seanad? That would be like telling the Minister he must stay in Dublin and cannot canvass in Waterford at the next general election. There must be a constitutional case there.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ring</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Minister had brought proposals before the House to return real powers to the elected public representatives on county councils, I would have no difficulty with the legislation. I would love if county managers had to stand for election, as is the case in America. Such elections should not take place on the same day as local elections. The people of each county should be given an opportunity to re-elect their county manager or vote for somebody else every seven years. That would be real local government of the kind we want.</P>
      <P>What has happened? We now have more officials. The Minister or one of his press officers or officials should start telephoning local authorities to try to reach some of the recently appointed officials. I recently wrote to my county council asking a simple question about a plant operator position which became vacant last year. I have the letter here and will get the exact date in a moment, otherwise the county manager will write to me to complain. It took about seven or eight weeks to get a reply. Having spent at least three months interviewing and testing applicants, how many of the candidates on the council's list were successful? The answer is none. This is a scandal and the Minister and his Department should be dealing with it. They will not do so because all officials are alike.</P>
      <P>The main source of income for both former and current county managers and county secretaries is earned through travelling around the country to take part in interview boards. This is the greatest national scandal. I have not heard of cases of the media making freedom of information requests to find out how many trips, including foreign visits, these and former officials make each year. A former county secretary recently told me he made more money in this way than he did when he was county secretary. This issue is never discussed. Who pays for these trips? The money comes out of taxpayer's pockets or county council funds. Is this better local government? It should not happen.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Fianna Fáil Party's next move will be to elect 66 Deputies and select the remaining 100. We would then see the wealthy, the millionaires of the country who could never get elected, on the opposite side of the House. I warn the Government not to interfere with the democratic system. I call on President McAleese, for whom I have much time because she was elected rather <Col N="832" />than selected, to convene the Council of State and do the proper thing on behalf the people by referring the proposal on the dual mandate to the Supreme Court to allow it to make the ultimate decision on its legality.</P>

      <P>I will talk about Tallaght in a moment. I do not know how the Deputy knows I am from the area. When I moved there with an employer 33 years ago, I got involved in local organisations, including my local school, the scouts and the community council. I was encouraged along the way and had no plans or prospects of becoming a politician. I was a late developer but 12 years ago I was given an opportunity to become a member of the council. Before I became a councillor, I was happy to be a community worker and a normal resident of Tallaght. I found my period as a county councillor very rewarding and enjoyable. As the next election was some way off, I was able to develop in my role and thought I would be happy not to do anything else.</P>
      <P>At the last local elections I topped the poll and was appointed Cathaoirleach. I then had a heart attack which gave me time to relax and consider my future. Suddenly, as a result of the decision of my colleague, former Deputy Chris Flood, I found myself being encouraged to stand for the Dáil and here I am. I am sorry Deputy Ring is leaving.</P>

      <P>As the Acting Chairman will be aware, I have been a Member of the House for less than a year and still have to learn my trade. The point I was making was that over the past year I had found I was happy to be a Deputy. It has suddenly dawned on me that I do not have to <Col N="833" />do all the council work and community endeavour I used to do. I no longer need to be a member of the strategic policy committees, area committees or the health board. Some months ago I took the major decision to step down as a member of the South Western Area Health Board, of which I was a founding chairman. People told me I would never leave the health board, yet I did.</P>
      <P>I make these remarks in the context of the proposals in the legislation on the dual mandate. While I am sensitive to the role of Members, I am amused by some of the contributions of my colleagues this morning as they ignored or criticised the views of LAMA and the General Council of County Councils. Those of us who subscribe to these organisations should listen to their views which are contrary to those expressed in earlier contributions.</P>
      <P>I am annoyed by Members and others outside the Houses who use the media to accuse me and other Deputies of double-jobbing. I get up at 8 a.m. and spend all day working in politics. I do nothing else, yet I am accused by colleagues, some of whom are close, of double-jobbing. This legislation provides an opportunity to bury these accusations. I ask the Minister of State at the Department of the Environment and Local Government, Deputy Gallagher, to convey my congratulations to the Minister on his bravery in attempting to address the issue of the dual mandate.</P>
      <P>The comments of the Labour Party spokesman will come as a major shock to the party's leader in Tallaght who has taken a different view on the right of Members to remain on local authorities. The lecture we heard from the parliamentary Labour Party is completely different from what is being said outside the House. Politics is an amusing business.</P>
      <P>Deputy Ring should know that nobody writes my speeches or tells me what to do. I do not have spin doctors or press officers. I do my business by listening to people in Tallaght, Firhouse, Greenhills and Templeogue and representing their opinions in the House, which is what I am doing today.</P>
      <P>I am not delighted by the prospect of leaving my local authority. However, the time to do so has come. Speaking on this issue recently, Deputy Kenny stated local politicians should move onwards and upwards. We should all be brave enough to grasp the nettle, which is what I am doing. While I am aware the people of Tallaght will ask me where I have been as they used to see me in the council every other day, time moves on. We have been given an opportunity to do our job in a different way. Some 7,155 people sent me to this House for that reason. Other Members can count their quotas as well as I can. I will do my job as I believe the people want me to do it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When I was reading this Bill, which I have studied in detail, I was reminded that its passage through the House would close the most rewarding and significant part of my life. Twelve years ago I became a member of the then Dublin <Col N="834" />County Council. I worked at a time when Tallaght did not have the facilities it now has. At that time, we used to speak of Tallaght as having the population of a city but the status of a village. Thank God that Tallaght is a great place today. I have tried to encourage all Members to visit Tallaght.</P>

      <P>Change is a simple yet complex word. All around us, in this House, in our work and our daily life we can see change. However, the word can, and does, often lead to illogical responses. I am of an age where change is challenging enough. I am trying to figure out computers and different ways of communications while I am just as happy to sit at my desk and write letters. In my contributions to debates since my election I have, on many occasions, encouraged people to embrace change and face the future with the full benefits of the knowledge and experience they have learned in the past as the foundation on which to ensure our futures are solid. Many Members of this House will have served their political apprenticeship on local or town councils. I followed the path of my predecessors, Deputies Sean Walsh and Chris Flood, in engaging in local public service, a commitment that I believe to be part of the learning curve for every committed and genuinely aware public representative.</P>
      <P>To be elected to this House last year was like a graduation &ndash; the result of 20 years of community and political commitment. I am a happy Deputy and long may I remain in this House.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="836" />On this rare occasion when we, as elected representatives, have the opportunity to create a national role for ourselves, let us not try to use that old pundits soundbite that all politics is local. We should not demonstrate self-interest over the real commitment necessary to bring about the changes that will assist the development of our laws, the accountability of our public service and encourage and protect our citizens. Times have changed both economically and socially. As Members of this House we have to lead that change, shape it and deliver on the aspirations and hard work of all our constituents, young and old.</P>
    <P>I would like to make reference to section 3 where the Minister is authorised to provide regulations on the level of access which we as Oireachtas Members can expect after the Bill is passed. While I note the clauses that allow for the required access, I request that the regulations be specific in relation to some parts of council activity. I believe that all town and city councils should be required to have a fully-resourced Oireachtas administration section for Oireachtas Members to access directly. This section should be attached to the office of the manager and its successful operation should be the responsibility of the manager. These offices would act as a clearing house for all our queries and questions on local issues and, in line with the strategic management initiative, they would be among the first to commit themselves to service delivery performance indicators by having to report back to the relevant Oireachtas committee on how they have met their targets.</P>
    <P>In addition, these offices would be responsible for the distribution of information such as agendas and minutes of both council and sub-committee meetings. In this electronic age, where all Members have e-mail, there would be no need for mountains of paper or duplication of the work required to provide the existing service for the local councillors.</P>
    <P>I support this Bill and congratulate the Minister, Deputy Cullen, on the forthright manner with which he has dealt with the issues involved, in what is and will be seen in the future as the next step in the change and development of the workings of our body politic.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Glennon</NameTxt>
      <P>It is important that this House has as strong a mix as possible of Members who did not come through the traditional route among those who did. Having said that, I come from a background of service at local authority level, my father and grandfather having both served on what was Dublin County Council. I have been watching this issue with considerable interest and listening to the different sides of the debate. I am somewhat confused by the apparent changes in the stances that have been taken by the different sides.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy O'Connor referred to contradictions in the Labour Party's stance which, unfortunately, <Col N="838" />Deputy Costello was not present to hear. The principal opposition has been made by Fine Gael and Deputy Ring in particular. However, a policy statement issued by Fine Gael in September 2000, entitled. A Democratic Revolution &ndash; A Thorough Overhaul of the Institutions of the State, stated:</P>
    <P>Dual mandates for councillors and Oireachtas Members will be prohibited. Sitting Deputies or Senators will not be allowed to seek election to a local authority and sitting councillors will be deemed to have resigned their seat on election to the Dáil or Seanad.</P>
    <P>That policy document was presented as a solemn commitment to the people &ndash; there was no talk of constitutional difficulties or challenges such as those about which we are now hearing &ndash; although all we are hearing is talk, since neither I nor my colleagues are aware of any proceedings having being instituted. It appears that policy has apparently been abandoned, denied and forgotten and yet people wonder why politicians cannot be taken seriously.</P>
    <P>On 4 July 2001, Fine Gael tabled an amendment which stated that &ldquo;a person who is a Member of either House of the Oireachtas shall be disqualified from being elected or co-opted to, or from being a member of, a local authority&rdquo;. I will let those words stand on their own merits without further comment.</P>
    <P>Since I became involved in national politics three years ago prior to which I was involved in various community initiatives, I have been hearing about the crying need for honesty in politics. It is not always helpful to a politician to be honest and economy of the truth tends to the rule with politicians in general.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaulNicholasGogartyGP" hpid="Mr. Gogarty Mr. Gogarty">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gogarty</NameTxt>
      <P>And the Taoiseach in particular.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimGlennonFF" hpid="Mr. Glennon Mr. Glennon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Glennon</NameTxt>
      <P>However, honesty is essential in the eyes of the electorate and this is a good opportunity for all of us in the House to approach the legislation before us with total honesty. I will be honest in saying that I support this Bill but that it will handicap my own re-election. That is not to make excuses in advance &ndash; it is a simple fact of life. All politics being local, membership of the local authority is an advantage to Members of the House in terms of their re-election. However, that is as far as it goes, because the dual mandate affects the efficiency of the operation of the Houses of the Oireachtas and representation in committee work, which is becoming more and more a part of the working of this House and which is to be welcomed.</P>
      <P>We all know that our chances of re-election will be diminished by the abolition of the dual mandate but, if we look into our hearts and do the right thing rather than engaging in opposition for opposition's sake, we know it is right to support this Bill.</P>
      <P>I congratulate the Minister and look forward to the Bill's speedy enactment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="839" />
    <Speaker pid="DanNeville" hpid="Mr. Neville Mr. Neville">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Neville</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to speak on the Bill. While the Bill purports to seek to reform local government, it will abolish the dual mandate and change the provision for directly elected mayors and chairpersons of town councils. I have been a member of a local authority for 18 years and in that time I have seen the erosion of the authority of elected representatives. We must move towards a reassertion of the authority of local authority members as the governors of their local areas. Many senior officials see councillors as incidental to, and at times a nuisance in, the exercise of their duties, because they may ask questions which must be responded to. The reserve functions are becoming fewer and fewer and we must have a root and branch examination of how local government has changed and how we can revert to having real power vested in the people through their local elected representatives.</P>
      <P>Local government appears to have become an administrator of Government policy and the policy of other bodies such as the NRA, with the authority of councillors removed and ceded to those bodies. Often when queries are raised in this House regarding the responsibilities of bodies such as the NRA or EPA, Ministers claim they are not responsible for them. There has been an erosion of democracy. The functions of these organisations should continue but they should be accountable to the people and the State through their elected representatives.</P>
      <P>I was concerned when the Minister decided last year to remove the decision on waste disposal from local authorities. The Protection of the Environment Bill removes the right of local authorities to set refuse charges. Only one local authority that I can recall &ndash; I think it was Dublin Corporation &ndash; was admonished by the Minister for not setting its rates. There may be difficulties but, surely, that debate should take place within the council as part of the democratic process at work and the council should decide what rates and refuse charges it should apply. I could see some case for it if a raft of councils were not making the final decision on rates. However, that is not the case, so I fail to understand why the Minister has removed that power. This year, Dublin City Council had much open and transparent discussion on rates. People knew where they stood, discussed the matter over a long period of time and finally made a decision, while my local authority watched from afar.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is worry and concern about incinerators and, if they are to be introduced, the support of the people and their elected representatives is required. We need to be convinced that this is the right way to go, but I am not convinced and I am not being backward or parochial in that. A health board report published in February about incinerators and landfill sites referred to significant implications for people living in the vicinity of incinerators. It was also concerned with the production of food in the same areas. The finding that the State does not have the means of <Col N="840" />assessing the risk involved is damning for the Government which was irresponsibly prepared to proceed at full speed with the building of incinerators without such capacity being put in place. The obvious conclusion is that all planning on incinerators should stop until the Government has put in place the necessary risk assessment procedures.</P>
    <P>The report frightened many who are concerned about incinerators. In my council area there is a 40 acre landfill site with which there have been serious problems during the years. Despite improvements, the problems remain as do concerns about health and food production in the area, and about smells from the site which have caused much difficulty for local people. The site is discussed regularly in my area and at council level.</P>
    <P>Removing my involvement and that of my colleagues from that area in order that we are not in a position to exert our views as elected representatives is dangerous. Unelected individuals such as the county manager will make decisions based on a policy handed down from the top reflecting what the Department wants done, without it being necessary to consult the people through their representatives. That is wrong.</P>
    <P>The refuse disposal plan for my area stated that if an incinerator was to be built, the county manager would discuss it and get the <i>imprimatur</i> of the council. It did not state a project would not go ahead but that the manager would return to the council to consider it. That protection was removed last year by the Minister for the Environment and Local Government and the county manager has clearly stated that he will not now return to the council to consider the construction of such an incinerator.</P>
    <P>If we want real reform of local government, we must consider the areas councils service. There is no doubt that there is a crisis in housing for which in my county some 1,000 people await. Councils, in partnership with the Department of the Environment and Local Government, must look seriously at this issue. There have been helpful innovations such as the voluntary housing schemes which some in my constituency have successfully taken up. The shared ownership scheme should also be further encouraged as it has been quite successful for many.</P>
    <P>Improvement works <i>in lieu</i> of social housing, a matter I have raised before, are a good way of bringing houses to a proper standard but it seems to be almost impossible to get it through the Department of the Environment and Local Government because conditions are too restrictive. The improvements scheme could be used in a much better way to repair houses instead of telling people that they will get a new house in ten years.</P>
    <P>If real reform is wanted, we must be innovative with regard to shared ownership of housing and other schemes to encourage people. Shared ownership has the advantage of giving occupiers ownership of and responsibility for their houses. <Col N="841" />I am not saying council tenants do not take responsibility but that when one owns and has a stake in a house, one tends to view it differently. One would not look for the council to come to change the tap or put in a window and so on. Perhaps, 25% ownership would be possible in this regard, though I am just throwing out that figure off the top of my head. Nevertheless, we must be innovative.</P>
    <P>There are constant difficulties with roads. I am extremely disappointed with regard to the development of the national primary and secondary routes in my constituency. The people of my area were disappointed again this year to learn that the Adare bypass would not be completed. There is no indication when the work will be done. Adare is the major bottleneck between Newcastle West and Kildare and the bypass would greatly improve the village and surrounding area, one of the main tourist attractions in the mid-west. Removing heavy traffic from the village would be of enormous benefit to its development and the enjoyment of the village by residents and tourists who visit in their hundreds of thousands.</P>
    <P>I also draw attention to the N69 between Limerick and Glin, or certainly between Limerick and Foynes. While there is concern about the harbour at Foynes, it has enormous potential for development as has the 200 acre industrial site at Askeaton which has been available for industrial development for a number of years. The one snag is the road from Limerick to the access route for Foynes and Askeaton. This has been referred to during the years and Ministers have made commitments to taking action. The return on investment in this road would be enormous, both in terms of a return to the State and in the creation of jobs in the area. Those who visit agree that the area is close to a key international airport and has a fantastic facility in Foynes Harbour. However, getting to the area by road is the problem. The frustrations of drivers behind an articulated lorry for 15 miles on the road, or visitors coming to invest in the area are understandable.</P>
    <P>Deputy Allen referred to a discussion document which the leader of Fine Gael, Deputy Kenny, recently brought forward. It creates many challenges for those of us interested in local government, of which I have been a member for 18 years. If the people did not want me to have a dual mandate, they could have made a decision on my position at the last elections in order that I would not be a local government member. However, the people of the Rathkeale electoral area gave me the highest vote of any Fine Gael candidate in Ireland. That is what they said about my position and the dual mandate. I have a duty to respond to this and continue serving them in that role, as they wish me to do.</P>
    <P>There are people &ndash; I do not refer here to politicians &ndash; who will be happy that the dual mandate will be abolished. I refer, for example, to officials in the Department of the Environment and Local Government. Members of the <Col N="842" />Oireachtas, who are close to local government, can raise in this House issues of local concern that deserve national attention. If an issue of concern which has been raised in my council is subsequently raised in the House in the presence of the Minister responsible for it, it is natural that I will want to discuss it. Senior local authority officials have said that it is of benefit that Members who are also members of local authorities can raise matters of local concern at Oireachtas level. Fellow councillors have often criticised me and my Oireachtas colleagues and not raising such issues in a sufficiently forceful manner. They are probably right to do so and I respect them for it. I have often heard Fianna Fáil councillors say that we should raise such issues and I respect their right to do so. The opportunity to make such representations will, however, now be removed.</P>
    <P>Certain officials will be happy when Members of the Oireachtas are removed from local authorities because it will mean that they will no longer receive queries from the Ministers' offices in relation to parliamentary questions. The Minister, Deputy Cullen, has failed to outline clearly the changed role of Members of the Oireachtas after this Bill has been passed. What forms of communication will be put in place? Regardless of the changes that are made, we will no longer be able to play a key role in council decisions. We will not be able to engage in the normal cut and thrust of political exchange in the council chamber.</P>
    <P>Ireland is one of the few democracies in the developed world where local authority functions have been delegated to unelected officials by the national Parliament. More powers should be devolved to local government. If one looks at the state of the health services, one might reflect on the removal of responsibility for health matters from local authorities many years ago. While there was some initial success, I do not think the removal of local involvement in the delivery of health services in local areas was a good development. The delivery of health services should be more locally based. I appreciate that overall management of certain services is necessary, but the more delegation to local authorities, the better.</P>
    <P>There is no reason, for example, that traffic policing should not be done by local authorities, as is the case in other countries. Similarly, I do not believe that the policing of the liquor licensing laws cannot be done at local government level. Local police forces could be run by local authorities and the Garda Síochána could be freed to deal with more serious crimes. We saw yesterday that serious crime is almost out of control, but that is a different debate. We should examine seriously the possibility of giving space to the Garda to deal with violent crimes such as murder and rape. Other necessary duties such as policing speeding offences could be performed by local police forces.</P>
    <P>It is a shame that the Government has decided to abolish the direct election of mayors and local <Col N="843" />authority chairpersons, presumably against the wishes of Deputy Noel Dempsey. The provision could have served as a means of giving direct access to power to the people, by allowing them to decide who they wanted as mayor. The winner of a direct election could have played a marvellous role and could have enjoyed the authority of having been elected by the people to represent them. He or she would have had a mandate from the people to talk to the county manager, in line with the council.</P>

      <P>I welcome this opportunity to speak on the Local Government Bill 2003. When Members on this side of the House speak, they are often asked who wrote their scripts, alleged to be taking the advice of spin doctors, or accused of following the party line. I have not yet found those who write the scripts; if I had done so, I would hardly be reading from handwritten notes. The scriptwriters have not yet found the newer Members of the House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Curran</NameTxt>
      <P>We will find out who they are shortly, but they are obviously not the people I meet in the corridors.</P>
      <P>I listened earlier to the contribution of Deputy Ring, who made a typically colourful and enthusiastic speech. He referred to the view his ancestors might have of the proposal to discontinue the dual mandate and said that, regardless of Fine Gael's policy in respect of this matter, he would stay in that party and fight to the end. I am glad the Deputy is not here because, if he was, I would draw a response from him. It is worth noting, on a serious level, that Deputy Ring made clear a number of weeks ago that he is dissatisfied with the proposed abolition of the dual mandate and that he feels that a constitutional question needs to be addressed. He said that he is prepared to organise a legal challenge to the provision if it is not referred to the courts by the President. A number of Members from this side of the House, who said they felt that members of Fianna Fáil would support Deputy Ring's legal challenge, received a great deal of media coverage some weeks ago.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>During his colourful contribution, Deputy Ring said &ldquo;I have significant cross-party support for my stance on the dual mandate&rdquo;. He received extensive coverage for his initial campaign in regard to <Col N="844" />this matter, which involved contacting all Members of the Oireachtas, including me, to request financial support for his legal challenge. He sent a letter to all Members from all parties and promised that those who supported him would not be identified. I challenge Deputy Ring to think about this matter over the weekend, before I resume my contribution next week, and to come to the House to outline the response he received from Members on this side of the House. He received a great deal of publicity and media interest when he made his initial request. Now that his letters have been received by every Member of the Oireachtas, can Deputy Ring clarify whether Members of either House have indicated that they will support him? This matter needs to be clarified as a number of people gained considerable publicity by trying to show disunity.</P>
    <P>Given that the proposal to abolish the dual mandate has been discussed at length by my party, I would regard as disloyal any Fianna Fáil Member who is supporting Deputy Ring. There is an onus on the Deputy, following his comment that he has received &ldquo;cross-party support&rdquo;, to come forward and say how many Members, if any, from this side of the House have given him financial support, as he specifically requested them to do. I hope to have the opportunity to take up this point when I resume my Second Stage contribution next week.</P>
    <P>I appreciate that many Members have grave concerns about the abolition of the dual mandate. Most Members of the Oireachtas recognise the political and electoral advantages of retaining the dual mandate. Deputy O'Connor mentioned that the abolition can be compared to turkeys voting for Christmas. I must admit that when I came to this debate initially I was of that view. I recognise the importance of my role on the local authority and where my constituency queries are best addressed. I felt uncomfortable. Since then, there has been much debate on the matter and the Minister has addressed reasonably and practically some of our specific concerns, as Members of the Oireachtas, about gaining information from local authorities.</P>

    <Title>Digital Hub Development Agency Bill 2002  [  Seanad ]  : Second Stage (Resumed).</Title>
    <P>Question again proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="TonyKilleen" hpid="Mr. Killeen Mr. Killeen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Killeen</NameTxt>
      <P>When the debate on this Bill was last under way a month ago, I illustrated the impact of education, particularly in mathematics and science, on subsequent innovation capacity and research and development in the information technology sector. I referred to a number of commissioned reports which indicated that, in common with quite a few other countries, Ireland had a declining rate of participation in higher level <Col N="845" />mathematics and science subjects at second level. This impacts negatively on participation in certain courses at third level and, ultimately, the capacity of third level institutions to undertake research projects in these areas. The &euro;700 million for research and development provided under the national development plan has been fully subscribed but one must wonder if the amount is sufficient and ask how it is directed. More importantly, in the context of the current debate, what is the involvement of industry in the research and development permitted by the funding? A core issue is monitoring.</P>
      <P>At Plassey Technological Park, Limerick, new ground is being broken by a facility which illustrates the value of co-operation by the University of Limerick, Shannon Development and industry and the level of innovation it makes possible. I hope the hub project will have a similar role. One of the measures of its success will be its ability to expand beyond its site and its capacity to reach out to distant communities and affect their involvement in information technology. It has that potential and I hope it will be realised. The real test will be the extent to which it helps to kick-start and support information technology initiatives in other parts of the country. I do not doubt that it will be successful in attracting the key players to the campus and other central locations while supporting those players already involved in industry here. What will be really interesting and challenging is its impact on the furthest regions of the country.</P>
      <P>We were very fortunate in County Clare &ndash; Ennis, in particular &ndash; to be chosen as the location of the Telecom Éireann information age town project. It has had a tremendous impact in terms of the level of personal computer penetration and the training made available to a population of 20,000 people in a very confined area. Some have expressed disappointment that the long-term impact has not been greater but many forget that almost 200 jobs have been created and nurtured by the &ldquo;industry Ennis project&rdquo; which followed the information age town project. Those involved continue to work closely with the Shannon Free Airport Development Company and the Industrial Development Agency. Plans are at a very advanced stage to create a new technology park in Ennis, though it could be said it might have been better to make the park available while the original project was still under way. Nevertheless, it demonstrates the impact which can result from beginnings such as those outlined in the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>An interesting report, sponsored by Rural Resource Development Limited, was launched in County Clare in February. It evaluates information technology resources in the county, though it excludes the Ennis area because of the huge impact of the information age town project. Various surveys were conducted with community groups and other interests and recommendations made. Questionnaires were issued to 114 primary schools and returned by 89, which represents a <Col N="846" />very high response level. Of the 14 secondary schools to which questionnaires were sent, 12 responded while 63 parishes completed and returned their sheets which included references to the impact of IT on 91 community groups. The report concludes that there is some access to resources throughout the county in communities and parishes with a population of less than 750 but a strong need for support and assistance to develop an information and communications technology project. Overall, 65% of communities and parishes have no access to ICT resources at a community level. Without support, these communities and parishes will continue to lag behind, a matter the report strongly recommends should be addressed.</P>
    <P>It is apparent from the surveys carried out that the telecommunications services available in County Clare are insufficient and that there is a clear demand for increased bandwidth and improved infrastructure. If the issue is not addressed as a matter of urgency, the report claims the digital divide, already very apparent, will continue to widen. It points out that initiatives at community and parish level should be aimed at addressing the lack of broadband through the implementation of satellite, WLL and other methods. Such initiatives should be encouraged and supported and best practice examples disseminated. It also addresses the need for information and communications technology training. When we think about training, we sometimes think of training at the basic level reflected in the achievements of a great many Members of this House. We can turn on the computer, access email and perform some other basic functions.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBrowne2" hpid="Mr. Browne Mr. Browne">

      <P>The Deputy can speak for himself.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TonyKilleen" hpid="Mr. Killeen Mr. Killeen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Killeen</NameTxt>
      <P>I realise that the Minister of State is far more efficient than normal Members. There are also challenges in increasing the training available for those who work or have worked in ICT. Ultimately, the challenge is to present at the highest possible level which will have an enormous impact on the project and its capacity to address the future needs of the country.</P>
      <P>Digital content has been a key growth area over the last ten years and we face the challenge of moving up the technological value chain. While &euro;2.47 billion was provided in the national development plan for research and development, it is clear that we need to continue to have a greater impact. We also face the challenge of creating critical mass in the hub area and the country in general to ensure benefits continue to flow.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Among the expected benefits is that the digital hub will play a key role in the promotion of Ireland as a premium location from which to distribute digital content products digitally. We have been close to performing in this area but have never quite reached our potential. The hub will provide a highly visible presence for Ireland in <Col N="847" />the international digital industrial community. We can sometimes overlook the importance of the ability of the country to have an impact at that level. Despite its wide dispersal, the international IT community tends to operate within quite a closed circle. We need to be in that circle. We must build on our strong existing technology base, which sounds easy but is, in fact, a huge challenge. In many respects, it is not the base that offers hope for the future. It is the base that needs to be upgraded to make it relevant in the future. There is a challenge to train future generations of students in the digital media area and education has an important part to play.</P>
    <P>There has been considerable progress in several key areas relating to IT access. The co-investment of &euro;200 million in a regional broadband programme has made an impact and made it possible for people living in rural areas to participate in a meaningful way in the industry. The international connectivity cost &euro;77 million or thereabouts and has made a considerable impact on the country's competitiveness. The DSL prices have already been halved and a flat rate access charge will be introduced in June. We need to have the minimum of constraints in such a competitive environment. There have been pilot projects conducted on wireless local area networks. This is one of the areas which offers hope for the peripheral communities in particular but I understand that its costs are close to prohibitive at present.</P>
    <P>The challenge to the agency is to move us forward from a position of relative strength with a certain level of availability of broadband and ISDN to a situation where any area of the country will have the capacity, at worst, to compete on an even plain with the main competitors, but at best, to compete with those at the forefront.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryUpton" hpid="Dr. Upton Dr. Upton">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Upton</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Bill to set up Digital Media Development on a statutory basis. To date a considerable amount of money has been invested in this project so I hope there will be measurable returns on that investment.</P>
      <P>I wish to declare an interest in this Bill because the digital hub is based in my constituency, Dublin South-Central and I have a particular concern about how it will impact on the lives of the people in the area and the associated developments on their behalf.</P>
      <P>I was pleased to note earlier this week that a number of new companies have moved in and hopefully will be up and running in the near future. It is particularly important that these developments contribute in a positive way to the local infrastructure and to the quality of the lives of the people who have lived in that historic part of the city through the lean times. I hope they will be given every chance to avail of the opportunities offered by these developments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I remind the House that the IFSC started out as a positive development in terms of economics and commerce but unfortunately lost its soul along the way to the detriment of the people and <Col N="848" />of the neighbourhood. We must be ensure that the quality of life of the people who live and work in the area is not put at risk by technological developments.</P>
    <P>Other Members have noted that the Liberties is one of the oldest and most historic districts in the city of Dublin with its own unique culture and architecture. Any developments that take place in the area must foster that culture and allow it to merge with the new developments in such a way that the needs of the people are not sacrificed to the economic viability of the project.</P>
    <P>The Liberties is also one of the most disadvantaged areas in the city. My colleagues, Deputies Ardagh and Eoin Ryan, spoke on this Bill and they both referred to the long-standing chronic problems in this part of the city. The positive development of the digital hub will improve the situation for the people of the area which has suffered from a drugs problem for many years. Social problems must also be taken into account as well as the economic viability of the project. The area is burdened with much social inequality and has been generous in making room for a wide range of social services, supports and facilities. I do not believe that the generosity of the local people has been acknowledged in terms of a corresponding input by way of community development. I wish to emphasise the importance of ensuring that a commitment and balance is brought into play.</P>
    <P>It is necessary to have high quality, affordable housing in the area. We must not allow a situation to develop where the price of housing is allowed escalate to the point where the local people could not afford to buy. In the case of the /FSC, a two-tier society has evolved on account of the economic viability and development on behalf of certain groups has left others behind in the race.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach has stated that he would like to see the property aspects of the development of the area will be delivered efficiently and quickly and I seek an assurance that some action will be taken to ensure that happens.</P>
    <P>Deputy Killeen referred to education and educational opportunities in the area. There are a number of primary and secondary schools located around the digital hub area. It is only fair to acknowledge that they have benefited from the investment and the developments in the area. Many successful projects have been co-ordinated with the digital hub and the schools. I ask the Department of Education and Science to provide a corresponding commitment and ensure an upgrading of facilities in a disadvantaged area because there are significant development requirements in those schools. In recent weeks, RTE has been showing programmes on television about the developments between local schools and the digital hub. The schools would be the first to acknowledge that the teachers, pupils and community have benefited.</P>
    <P>It was hoped that the RAPID programme would provide significant advantages and benefits to the area. It now appears that the hoped-for <Col N="849" />interaction between RAPID and the digital hub has not materialised. The projects which were supposed to be introduced under the RAPID programme are already up and running under some other banner. It is a great shame that RAPID appears to be just a recycling of older projects.</P>
    <P>The area has suffered from chronic unemployment and there has been poor educational attainment. The emphasis should be on education and educational facilities at every level as well as retraining and upskilling so that the people of the area can avail of the jobs which we hope will become available. It is hoped that they will be high calibre jobs and that appropriate training will ensure that people will be able to access those positions. There is little point having jobs available if the training and back-up required is not available in parallel.</P>
    <P>Computers and Internet access are something many of us now take for granted. This is a golden opportunity to provide access to many people who would not be able to afford computers. As many flats complexes in the area are being refurbished, it is an opportune time to ensure that these flats or houses have access to computer technology and the Internet. It is something that should be taken for granted at this stage. It is no longer a luxury, it is part of life. Computer and Internet access should be made available as a matter of course to the remainder of the flats complexes which are being upgraded.</P>
    <P>While the information age has been very important to all of us, the introduction of broadband access has been very slow. I welcome some of the recent developments, including the flagship project in the Liberties. It is great for the constituency and for the area in Dublin where this is happening. However, it is not sufficient that it is located in just one area. We must now seek the evolution of what is happening in the digital hub. I hope there will be parallel developments throughout the country to ensure everyone has access to information technology. It is important that development in this area is fast-forwarded from the point of view of competition and attracting industry into the country. We cannot afford to sit back and wait because many of our counterparts in other European countries are way ahead of us in this area.</P>
    <P>I emphasise the need for education and educational development in the whole IT area. The skills shortage task forces set up have been looking at areas which can be developed, particularly in science and technology. It is widely acknowledged that the need for investment in science and technology is enormous, even though there has been considerable improvements recently, which must continue. The areas that are falling behind are the sciences. It is crucial in regard to information technology that both our second and third level colleges have the best facilities available and are able to produce the best quality graduates to attract the appropriate industries to this country.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="850" />I welcome the Bill and look forward to successful progress on the digital hub.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ellis</NameTxt>
      <P>Like other speakers, I welcome the opportunity to make a short contribution to this debate. The Digital Hub Development Agency Bill, which has been around for six or 12 months, is just now reaching this House, having been passed by the Seanad. The Bill will have enormous consequences as far as the whole technology industry is concerned in the future. We have been European and world leaders in the technology industry for a number of years. We know that from the number of major technology companies which found that this was a suitable country in which to base their operations. If we are to continue to be world leaders, however, we must develop our research and development facilities. The provision of a digital hub centre and a digital hub organisation, with responsibility for the development of the technology industry, will make a major contribution to ensuring that we continue to be world leaders.</P>
      <P>The pioneers in this area were Enterprise Ireland and the IDA Ireland which managed to persuade many of the world leaders in technology to come to this country to set up their European and world headquarters. We must move forward from that. The selection of a location like the Coombe-Liberties in Dublin shows that the Government is committed to dealing with disadvantaged areas. To put a major flagship project like the digital hub into this area will give a signal to other communities throughout the country that they will not be left behind when it comes to development.</P>
      <P>We must also look at the educational value because the educational value of technology will be more and more important as time goes on. We know many schools are now finding that technology education is becoming a bigger part of their programme of work. They are finding also that students can adapt much better if they are brought into the technology age as early as possible. Some have the advantage of having computers at home. Seven or eight year olds are more computer literate than many middle aged people. However, some people do not have computers in the home and the education system will now give them an opportunity to progress themselves in the area of technology development.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In regard to the overall project, the fact that the agency is located in Dublin poses a further question whether smaller centres should be established throughout the country to develop the technology industry. I say this in light of some of the recent decisions by the Minister in regard to broadband. I express my sincere thanks to him for acceding to my request to provide broadband to both Carrick-on-Shannon and Manorhamilton. <Col N="851" />This was an important development for both towns, in probably one of the most peripheral areas of the country. It gives a clear indication that as far as Government policy is concerned the idea of a nationally based and broadly based technology industry is totally within the grasp of these communities. This is something people living in the area very much appreciate. It is nothing more than people deserve. We have a duty to ensure the spread of industry throughout the country, whether high tech or otherwise.</P>
    <P>People talk about rural development and so on, but if the services are not in place, we will not be in a position to attract people to rural Ireland. The roll-out of broadband will help to encourage that. I want at this stage to say a special word of thanks to the members of Leitrim County Council who saw fit to provide the local contribution necessary to ensure broadband would be provided in the area.</P>
    <P>The Bill will enable the agency to purchase property and incur expenditure subject to Department of Finance sanction. While there may be a need for belt-tightening, I hope investment in technology will not be curtailed due to lack of finance. If we hinder development in the technology industry which has taken place over a number of years, we will find that countries throughout the world who envy us will pass us out in the area of technology and technology development.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill, including the way in which the entire technology industry is being developed. However, we must allow the situation to arise whereby the success we had in the 1990s will be overtaken by other countries. This House has a duty to provide the necessary resources to ensure that the digital hub is fully developed throughout the country. The necessary funding should also be made available for research and development for the technology industry.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMulcahyFF" hpid="Mr. Mulcahy Mr. Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Ellis for sharing his time. I also welcome the Bill. I must declare an interest to the extent that the digital hub is in a constituency I represent. I hope my remarks are not coloured by that. I know the area well since 1985, if not before. I was first elected to represent it on Dublin Corporation in 1985, re-elected in 1991 and elected to the Dáil in the last general election.</P>
      <P>It is beyond dispute that the hub is located in an area of considerable social disadvantage, which is not to deny that there are many other areas of social disadvantage throughout the country. Over the past years, Combat Poverty has produced statistics which show that the south west part of Dublin and the south inner city are among the most disadvantaged areas of the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill is important because it will put the new digital hub development agency on a statutory footing. Digital Development Media Limited has been in operation for a number of years. I pay tribute to those who have supported this project, <Col N="852" />including the Government and a prime mover and thinker behind it, Mr. Paul Kavanagh. I also wish to express my appreciation to the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, which had the vision and the foresight to enter a partnership with the Government to develop this very important digital hub in the Liberties.</P>
    <P>If Ireland has an economic future, which I believe it does, it will be because of its success at what may be termed the top of the food chain. As other economies may be able to mass produce goods more cheaply, Ireland must concentrate on education, IT and intellectual property. The Irish have a gift for learning, thinking, words and the arts, especially literature and music. It will be good for the country if we can harness our creativity with the most modern digital technology.</P>
    <P>Although the Liberties, the area in which the hub is located, is socially disadvantaged, it is one of the most famous industrial areas of the country. The name &ldquo;Dublin&rdquo; is derived from Dubh Linn, the black pool, and it is believed that the Vikings landed not far from the location of the hub. The Huguenots migrated there from France. The word &ldquo;tenterhooks&rdquo; is derived from the tenters they used to weave on which to hang their silk. Winetavern Street and Cook Street are historical streets which indicate the range of trades in the area, including candle-making and weaving. The Guinness brewery is also located in the area and I am pleased that the MIT Media Lab Europe headquarters are situated in the Guinness Hop Store. It is exciting that the top end of technology will replace these traditional craft industries, many of which have been in decline.</P>
    <P>The Bill provides that the agency's remit will include a development plan which must have regard to Dublin City Council's integrated area plan for the Liberties and the Coombe area and Dublin city's development plan. The agency must also consult with relevant Departments and agencies, including Enterprise Ireland. The city council, acting in conjunction with the Liberties and the Coombe area integrated plan, has been very ambitious for the rejuvenation of the entire Liberties area.</P>
    <P>I share the concern of others that the benefits of the hub will be spread to all the housing estates and flat complexes in the area and to all the schools. I do not wish to be pessimistic on this aspect because there are already good signs. The Minister will be aware of the Liberties learning initiative, which I am told involves approximately 160 local and voluntary groups kindly sponsored by Diageo, the parent company of Guinness Ireland, for &euro;1.3 million. Programmes are also running in 15 local schools.</P>
    <P>The Minister will also be aware that next Thursday, the Taoiseach will launch the Hewlett Packard digital community project. This involves nine flat complexes being fully fitted with state of the art computers and specially adapted computer rooms. This is an exciting development and I pay tribute to companies, such as Hewlett Packard and Diageo, for making private finance avail<Col N="853" />able to spread e-learning to the flat complexes. There is a great aptitude for learning and commerce in the Liberties and I have no doubt that the enthusiasm and enterprising spirit of the digital hub will spread throughout the area. I echo Deputies from rural areas in that I see no reason why there should not be spin-offs from the hub to other parts of the country.</P>
    <P>The concept of quarters, under revival in Dublin, may spread to other parts of the country. In the old days there was the silk quarter, the tradesmen's quarter, the legal quarter, etc. That is re-emerging in the form of the IFSC, the financial quarter and the digital hub, the computer quarter. The Taoiseach is now talking of a legal quarter to be based in the north inner city in Deputy Costello's constituency. Why not develop fashion, crafts, motor and ecology quarters?</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonRyanGP" hpid="Mr. Eamon Ryan Mr. Eamon Ryan">

      <P>I understand that under the national envelopment plan, &euro;2.4 billion has been allocated to research and development in the computer sector. Approximately 80% of the population have mobile telephones but there has not been the same take-up in computers.</P>
      <P>I do not blame the Government, but I am disappointed that broadband and Internet access has not penetrated quickly enough. Ireland now lags behind several other European countries. The day must arrive when, as with telephone points, every home in the country has a computer terminal and free Internet access. In the United States, local telephone calls are free and Internet access is all but free. We must wake up to the 21st century and get a computer into every house with free Internet access. Otherwise, we will not remain at the forefront of computer technology.</P>
      <P>Ireland has some of the greatest indigenous computer companies in the world, which were spawned from the computer boom of recent years. They include Parthus, Iona Technologies and Riverdeep. The large multinational companies located here include Intel, Hewlett Packard and Microsoft. There is a need to take this huge grounding in the computer industry to the next level. In addition to the digital hub, we need to get the vast majority of people using computers so that they can be purchasers of computer and Internet-related products. That is the way forward. I am unhappy that free Internet access has not become a reality in the average household.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Recently we had a presentation on the roll-out of broadband and I understand significant progress is being made. In the same way as every house has a telephone I look forward to the day <Col N="854" />when every household has a computer terminal in the kitchen or the living room. If people have access to information they are empowered, and that would be to our advantage.</P>
    <P>I compliment all involved in the drafting of the Bill and wish all involved in the digital hub the best for the future. Ahead of schedule, there are six companies operating with about 100 employees on a temporary basis. The total area will be seven acres, comprising 500,000 square feet, 50% enterprise, 25% residential, 16% retail and the balance educational/e-learning. I understand there will be approximately 2,000 to 3,000 employees in the sector in the area. This is a huge boost for the Liberties and for the fantastic constituency of Dublin South Central which is well served, I hope, by its representative. I commend the Bill to the House.</P>

      <P>Like other speakers I welcome the legislation before the House. As I stated earlier this week in relation to the Broadcasting (Major Events Television Coverage) (Amendment) Bill, it is a shame it has taken so long to get to this point. It is to be hoped that the passing of this legislation will be a major shot in the arm in moving this project forward.</P>
      <P>It has the potential to make a huge difference to the Liberties and Coombe areas of Dublin. However the Bill is only a first step. It means that the Government must commit itself to at least a generation of funding and investment to create a level playing pitch for local residents and their communities to be able to play a proper part in the job creation strategy that &ldquo;new economy&rdquo; technology offers today. We must also look at the wider picture and in this regard the Government and the previous coalition have been sending mixed messages to not just the public, but the whole information and telecommunications sector.</P>
      <P>From the last Government we got, in the e-commerce Bill, most progressive and far-seeing legislation that would encourage Irish and international business to choose Ireland as an e-commerce location. We have had God knows how many photo opportunities at the national digital park and launches, too numerous to mention, around the Global Crossing contract.</P>
      <P>However the same Government not only botched the sale of Eircom but left the roll-out of new broadband fibre optic networks on the long finger, content instead to pocket the money from the Eircom sale with little thought of developing a proper telecommunications infrastructure for the island. Now Global Crossing is in receivership. I note there were little or no photo opportunities for this media event.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In recent years telecommunication companies have reneged on commitments to roll out new <Col N="855" />cable networks. NTL bought up Cablelink from State ownership and its promise of high speed digital networks for all its customers has gone the same way as many Fianna Fáil election promises.</P>
    <P>It is only now that Eircom is finally offering high speed ADSL Internet access years too late. It is only a stopgap measure and will not lead to the mass broadband access we urgently need.</P>
    <P>During the 1980s and 1990s there was massive investment in the technology infrastructure of the State and it was carried out by what is now Eircom. The State took the risks and put in the work to build the foundation for the technology society. It is now private operators who will profit from it. This investment was based on the principle of universal provision. The Government sold off Eircom and in doing so put short-term greed before the long-term gain of the people.</P>
    <P>The digital hub in the Liberties should be only a small piece of a much larger jigsaw. We need to ensure that existing telecommunications networks, not just in this State but throughout the island, are developed and improved and that the new high-speed fibre optic networks are constructed under the principle of universal provision.</P>
    <P>It is vital that all the island's towns and regions, whether in isolated rural areas or neglected urban communities, have access to this new technology that is the basic building block of the knowledge economy. The Government could make a start with those areas identified under the RAPID proposals. I heard the Minister on the radio this morning trying to defend the indefensible. The reality is that nothing has happened since this programme has been launched.</P>
    <P>The reticence of the private sector to invest in these services without State support or &ldquo;partnership&rdquo; shows clearly how vital it is to have public ownership of these utilities and exposes as a lie the often made statement that the private sector brings dynamism to the economy. We need to commit ourselves to an enhanced cable infrastructure throughout the State, enabling the deployment of new technologies to all communities and especially to schools.</P>
    <P>This brings us back to the digital hub in the Liberties. The educational aspect of the agency is vital. Education more than any other factor has the most power in our society today to transform poverty to wealth, to change unemployment to wage earning and to create a dignified standard of living for all.</P>
    <P>One could be forgiven in recent years for the obsession in Government and media around the term digital. We have had digital parks, digital phones and a host of other developments, but what we do not often hear about is the digital divide. It is this divide that this Bill in a small, but welcome, way attempts to tackle. We have heard much from this Government about the success of the Celtic tiger and the job creation record etc. What we need to do now is not to focus on the strategies of the past but to ask ourselves where <Col N="856" />the next decade of new jobs will come from. I think the answer lies in the knowledge economy, and in this economy what matters is access to resources and infrastructure. Our economy is at a cross roads in this matter.</P>
    <P>Some 20% of secondary school students are leaving without formal qualifications. Some 24% of adults, according to the UN and the OECD, are functionally illiterate and cannot read the back of a bottle of cough mixture. There are 1.1 million people on the island who are education poor and digital hubs will be meaningless to them unless we have an innovative strategy on education and investment.</P>
    <P>Surveys from the Information Society Commission have shown clearly that the early adopters of these new technologies all come from the wealthier social groups who, armed with third level qualifications, can maximise the benefits of this new economy while those without education are being left further and further behind. This must not be accepted at any level. We should not accept the creation of an underclass, which has already happened in many parts of Dublin and in other parts of the State. We need to take the glimmer of imagination and innovation in this Bill and spread it throughout the whole island.</P>
    <P>Every town in Ireland should have a digital hub with broadband access, with computer labs in every school, PCs in every home and not merely an educational curriculum teaching IT but teaching the curriculum through IT. Every business should have high speed Internet access. Then we can begin to approach the critical mass to build a knowledge economy on the island and make not just the Liberties but also the island of Ireland a digital hub.</P>

      <P>This Bill is very positive for Dublin and no doubt it will contribute to the development and growth of the city. Is this what we want? Do we really want Dublin to grow? What about balanced regional development? What about investment in digital infrastructure throughout the region and, in particular, from my perspective in the west and north-west? Why could this Bill not take into consideration the development of digital infrastructure in the regions and appoint an authority that is competent to deliver it. Why do the regions not deserve an agency that, according to the Bill, would promote and facilitate the development of telecommunications to attract enterprises to the digital hub?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was impressed by section 10 of the Bill which states: &ldquo;As soon as may be, but not later than 6 months after the adoption of the development plan . . .  the Agency shall prepare and submit to the Minister . . .  business and financial plans or any revisions of those plans.&rdquo;  The Government means business. Even in times of cutbacks, it makes such priorities. How can it possibly hope to promote balanced regional development or implement the national spatial strategy, launched and trumpeted about two months ago, unless it <Col N="857" />affords the same priority to the knowledge based industry in the regions, the west and north-west in particular?</P>
    <P>I am not just expressing my own views. Surely the words of Sean Dorgan, chief executive of the IDA, must be taken into account:</P>
    <P>IDA remains fully committed to the regional development agenda but we have some serious concerns at the lack of timely delivery of key pieces of essential infrastructure in Objective One regions, especially telecommunications and access. We urge priority attention to these matters.</P>
    <P>Sean Dorgan is asking for priority attention for the BMW region but the Government is currently giving it to Dublin.</P>
    <P>Yesterday the strategic rail review was presented. Others and I had hoped it would in some way help to rebalance the infrastructural deficit between east and west that has grown over the past ten to 15 years. The NRA has, year after year, spent a much greater proportion in the south and east than in the BMW region. At the end of 2001 the spend in the south and east was 45% ahead of target and 25% behind in the BMW region. The knock-on effect is that projects which were started must be completed. It is like a snowball gathering momentum until there is an avalanche and we, in the west, are buried underneath it.</P>
    <P>We must ask if it is essential that the digital hub is sited in Dublin. The information industry is fully mobile. However, has any consideration been given to the fact that it could be sited elsewhere and a driver for balanced regional development? Yesterday I read that a former Member of this House, Liam Lawlor, said it took himself and the Taoiseach to sort out the country and western boys. According to Mr. Lawlor, the western lobby was getting everything and the east was suffering. The grand coalition between Liam Lawlor and the Taoiseach has obviously been one of the most successful in the State because it is very clear that their philosophy still drives policy in Leinster House today. Liam Lawlor may be gone but he has left his mark in more ways than one.</P>
    <P>In December 2002 the Western Development Commission issued a report which made the following recommendation, among others:</P>
    <P>Many parts of the Western Region do not have access to broadband services. In a knowledge-based economy, quality broadband infrastructure is a necessity, and without it growth and competitiveness will be constrained.</P>
    <P>I suggest that broadband access is an absolute necessity and growth and competitiveness will be virtually impossible. The report also states: &ldquo;Telecommunications infrastructure policy for the Western Region should be based on an acceptance that infrastructure there must be at least on a par with other regions&rdquo;. A few moments ago Deputy Ellis told us that the fact that a deprived area of Dublin was being <Col N="858" />developed was surely a sign that deprived areas in the rest of the country could expect similar developments. Despite what he said, when we looked at the Estimates before Christmas we saw that there was a 27% cut in funding for the roll-out of broadband to the regions. Towns like Sligo, which has been named as a gateway in the national spatial strategy, are not even in phase one. Deputy Ellis said it would take place down the road but it is more a case of it being somewhere over the rainbow.</P>
    <P>I ask for parity of access, infrastructure and investment. Yesterday, with the issuing of the strategic rail review, we were presented with what I would describe as pale rail. Today we have been given the digital divide.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonRyanGP" hpid="Mr. Eamon Ryan Mr. Eamon Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Eamon Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>We have a very difficult job here today, as legislators, because we need to legislate for innovation, creativity and enterprise. It is difficult to establish the required conditions on a statutory basis.</P>
      <P>I am a supporter of the digital hub project and always have been. I have to hold up my hand and say that I, with members of the Government, was attracted by the possibilities of the project. I cheered the Taoiseach on as he started spending our money on this good idea. Two or three years later the project has almost become symbolic of what has changed in the economy. I do not think we would possibly spend £73 million today on the property we obtained, nor do I think we would be as flaithiúlach with the administrative expenses on the project which serves as a metaphor for the way in which we mismanaged and blew our money in recent years. We spent a huge amount and, to date, there has been very little return.</P>
      <P>We are in a period of change. The legislation allows us to recognise our changing circumstances and try replot a new way forward. I am critical of the fact that to date the project has centred around administration, plans and proposals as opposed to enterprise. It is now very difficult for us to establish such enterprise on a statutory basis, although it is what we need to do. This Bill does not achieve it. It states more about superannuation schemes and the disclosure of interests than about how we create an innovative centre.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have some suggestions as to how to aid the agency in terms of enterprise and innovation which I will introduce as amendments on Committee Stage, if possible. I am disappointed that the Bill contains no real reference to MediaLab Europe, one of the main anchor tennants for the digital hub. One of the criticisms of the enterprise of the digital hub to date is the failure of MediaLab Europe to connect in with the rest of the city. It is slightly like a monastic site looking within or across the Atlantic via its digital connection but not looking around itself or attracting Irish entrepreneurs or small Irish companies in sufficient numbers. It recognises that a model that applies to the MIT in Massachusetts, where a small company is one with a staff of 500 or 600, <Col N="859" />has to be changed in the case of the Irish economy, where a small company can consist of two or three friends working in the back of a garage. The Bill should serve as an opportunity to reassess how MediaLab Europe is working and connects into Irish businesses and institutions, particularly educational institutions. I am disappointed that there is no reference to this in the Bill.</P>
    <P>Ultimately, when talking about the digital hub, we have to consider how we help our entrepreneurs and business people, the innovators who will create the jobs and provide the resources. It is difficult because, under European competition rules, we cannot provide any of the tax incentives or grants systems we would have used in the past. We are left with very few tools.</P>
    <P>Looking at the explanatory memorandum to the Bill, it is remarkable to realise that we spent twice as much in 2001 and 2002 on administration of the project than we did on actual broadband infrastructure. Money was blown on consultants, coffee mornings, cheese and wine receptions and lovely, glossy reports but very little was spent on the infrastructure that would be of some use to the businesses we are trying to attract. It is important that we change that focus.</P>
    <P>As Deputy Upton said, it is important that we also have a strong connection to local people and the local area. I lived in the area in question for five years. It is a very sensitive area and one of the few urban areas in Dublin that really works as such. I love walking down Meath Street which is packed with pedestrians and going into Jack Roche's greengrocery where everybody talks to each other &ndash; this does not happen in other parts of Dublin. I love walking into Frawley's on Thomas Street and Manning's for a cup of coffee afterwards. It is a vibrant area in which people live and shop and to which people go from all over the city because it is so attractive. We must be careful how we look after and develop it. We do not want to make the same mistakes we made in Temple Bar where we killed the ethos. We need to link up with local people through primary and secondary schools.</P>
    <P>I would like to see the functions of the agency broadened. It is incredible that there is not one mention of the word &ldquo;education&rdquo; in the description of the functions of the agency in the Bill. Surely the concept of a digital hub is one where we link education and business. That is from where one gets ideas and training which one taps into the business potential. Neither is there any connection between the colleges of art and the digital hub, which would be a key connection in using creativity to help create enterprise and jobs. There is no reference to the immigrant community which is strong in this area and would bring diversity and linguistic ability as well as a different way of thinking which, again, would help ingenuity, creativity and innovation.</P>
    <P>We do not want the agency to be a purely educational facility. While we are not going to create <Col N="860" />a new educational establishment, we need to give an indication to the agency that it can help create educational connections, set up programmes or pull in expertise to bring forward educational modules which will connect to businesses and the local community, particularly the immigrant community. I am not just talking about local PR efforts with the local community, some nice gimmicky scheme where one uses some of the technology one is developing. That would not be the real benefit, which is when we start educating people showing them the possibilities of technology and they come back with ideas for development. While I am concerned about young people, we really need to focus on adults across a range of groups in the community.</P>
    <P>We also need to bring culture into the equation. There is no mention in the purpose or role of the agency to develop culture. I would love to see a clause in the Bill stating the agency would organise a couple of parties every year for people working and studying in the area. That would encourage the cross-creativity and connections that the hub is meant to provide. The agency should have a cultural function.</P>
    <P>There should also be a much stronger connection to the local authority, with the involvement of at least two local authority members. There is reference throughout the Bill to the agency reporting back to the Minister for Finance and the Minister for this, that and the other. The Minister for Finance has other things to do; this should be a locally-based project, not something dominated by central government.</P>
    <P>I do not know which Minister is presenting the Bill &ndash; perhaps I should. It could be the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment but the presence of the Minister of State, Deputy Browne, suggests that it may be the Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources. It might have been the Minister of State, Deputy Hanafin, in front of me. I do not have a clue which section of Government is responsible for this area. This is a central flaw in Government information communications technology policy, which has no focus to it. I would love to see the Bill coming back at a later stage with a clear indication as to which part of Government is responsible for it.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>This legislation presents an exciting challenge. I share the sentiments expressed by Deputy Harkin. As a representative of the BMW region, I am aware of the importance of what we are discussing to the future of the island. However, <Col N="861" />every part of Ireland deserves to have the investment that the people of the Coombe and the Liberties are getting. The poor people of those areas deserve all the assistance the Government can give them and I do not deny them the opportunity with which the Bill is providing them. My godmother used to live in Rainsford Avenue, just off Thomas Street. From visiting that part of Dublin for almost the past 50 years, I am aware that the people of the area deserve this investment and the promotion of the opportunity which the Bill presents them. I wish them well and look forward to every village and town having the same opportunity. It is the way forward. We were taught at school that information was power. The potential for advanced information technology proposed in the Bill will provide a future for this island nation.</P>
    <P>Our European colleagues have told us we must no longer have the tax incentives which led to the creation of the phenomenon of the Celtic tiger since 1987. Irish people made this happen with the help of our colleagues in the European Union. No other EU member state starting from a similar position has made so much progress. We are held up as an example of what can be achieved when given the opportunity in countries' with slightly larger populations throughout the world. I agree with the sentiments expressed by Deputy Harkin. We want the same opportunities in the BMW region, without which we will not be operating on a level playing field with our neighbours and competitors in the United States of America in the decades to come.</P>
    <P>The Minister, Deputy Dermot Ahern, and the Minister of State, Deputy Browne, should call on the Minister for Finance to consider as a matter of urgency tax measures and incentives in the next budget to allow companies to set up high-tech clusters in every village and town. It is necessary for small industry that this happens if we are to progress to the next stage of development. People in the BMW region are as capable in regard to knowledge-based industries as those elsewhere in the country. Without this opportunity we will find it difficult to sustain existing jobs, create new ones and progress at the rate envisaged by Government. The Minister for the Environment and Local Government should be asked to look at the possibility that all new housing developments &ndash; be they one-off or housing estates &ndash; should have all the necessary cabling and ducting as a requirement for planning permission.</P>
    <P>I listened attentively to Deputy Mulcahy as he outlined in great detail to the House the direction in which he saw Ireland going in regard to high-tech and digital opportunities. He has vast experience in the business world. It would provide a great opportunity for young people if a computer was available to them at home. It will be part of the curriculum and anyone who is not computer literate in the future will be at a significant disadvantage. This is an opportunity which can be considered in future legislation. This is a marvellous <Col N="862" />window of opportunity and we should grasp it to enhance our future prospects. As public representatives, we should encourage it at every parish and community meeting we go to. That knowledge in the future, and all the proposals before us, are only the beginning of what we want to see for all our people. We want it to be remembered that we, as Members of the 29th Dáil, ensured that the people were given this opportunity.</P>

He and Deputy Ryan outlined their relationship with the area under discussion, and I shall do likewise. Do not tell anybody, but funnily enough, I am not from Tallaght.

      <P>No, wait until Wednesday. I am happy to have the opportunity to speak on this subject, and I mention my birthday only because it reminds me that I am of a different generation. My generation has had to adapt to the business before us and I am finding it as challenging as everybody else. However, as I said when debating the local government legislation, it is a time of change and all of us should be open and amenable to change.</P>
      <P>While I was looking over the business of the Dáil for this week I remarked to my small support team in Tallaght &ndash; who are not PR agents, just a little team who mind me well &ndash; that if I understood what it was about I would speak on this Bill. They obtained a number of statements for me, including the development board's strategy statement, and a list of the areas on the digital hub website to bring me up to speed. That has been my homework in the evenings for the past week. I now admit, after considering digital technology, that it is clearly of use. I am now a dedicated follower and supporter of the digital hub concept and will be keeping myself informed of the activities of the agency in the future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I congratulate Senator Mary O'Rourke, who initiated the development during her time in office, the Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources, Deputy Dermot Ahern, and the Minister of State, Deputy John Browne, whom I am happy to see here, for bringing this development to this stage. We should also congratulate Enterprise Ireland and Dublin City Council, of which the Chair is a prominent member, for their innovation and vision. Enterprise Ireland has, over the years, under its different <Col N="863" />titles, shown itself to be a forward planning organisation which serves this country well.</P>
    <P>So important is the digital hub that had I been a Member of this House on its conception, I would, with the information I now have on the subject, have been banging down the door of the Minister at the time to have it based in Tallaght, where the institute of technology and a large and innovative young population would have played an equally constructive role in the digital hub development. When the hub reaches a stage where it needs more space, I might get the opportunity of seeking a sister site in Tallaght. The digital hub will create an international digital enterprise centre in the Liberties area of Dublin city and will make a major contribution to the development of future technology enterprise in both Dublin and the country as a whole, as well as to the regeneration of Dublin's inner city. This is a long-term project and the staged plans run to 2010. These will offer a vibrant location for living, working and learning in our city centre.</P>
    <P>Digital media, identified by Enterprise Ireland, IDA Ireland and Forfás, will present significant opportunities to develop Ireland's high-tech internationally traded services sector and follow our experiences in the computer sector. This will lead the way for Ireland's role in this sector. During my reading, I noted that the digital media and entertainment business is already a global industry worth &euro;178 billion in 2001 and is set to increase to &euro;434 billion by 2006. Even a fraction of this market justifies our support for this initiative.</P>
    <P>I welcome the fact that the digital hub project will be fully funded through a public private partnership, with the public sector having already committed major resources. The project will deliver 500,000 square feet of development through a mix of enterprises, retail, residential, learning and educational space, and I am keen to support the educational and learning role, as outlined in the development's strategy statement. The three major learning initiatives planned for the digital hub area are to be commended, and I envy their potential for my constituents in Tallaght.</P>
    <P>The learning and technology centre will be the educational and training hub for the formal and non-formal education sectors and will enable the wider community to access information communications technology training and pilot new ways of using digital media in learning. The learning and technology centre role in innovation projects in teaching and learning in the local schools and contributing to greater educational achievement is to be commended. While the provision of access for the local community to computer and Internet facilities, communications studios and ICT-led training will be of great local value, the plan to work with education providers such as DCU and the institutes of technology in supporting staff development for ICT will enable <Col N="864" />learning in schools and community-based projects.</P>
    <P>The provision of a learning facility on Thomas Street for early delivery of a series of courses will become a focal point for schools-based innovation projects, for which I will encourage the schools in my constituency to queue up. It will also showcase digital media in the context of enterprise, community and learning. The proposed digital hub academy, which will facilitate the delivery of a range of digital media courses in the areas of TV-film, computer games and animation, will get any support I can offer. I hope the agency will provide the support in terms of facilities and finance to its graduates to enter the market as small enterprises, knowing that the agency will monitor their activities. The academy will also assist the existing digital media course providers and help them locate in a custom built building on the digital hub site.</P>
    <P>By locating courses in the digital hub academy, colleges will have easy access to a range of digital media and creative companies. This will enable mentor-practitioner relationships to develop between companies and students. The Bill appears to be in line with efforts by Departments to shift responsibilities to multiple agencies, casting off day-to-day involvement in operations themselves and allowing agencies to grow and prosper.</P>
    <P>It is important that Members of the House from all over the State take the opportunity to understand the changes that are taking pace and welcome the Bill. As someone of a different generation, I believe it is important that we do that. I would love to identify the experts in the House on these issues. Perhaps somebody might send me a list. I am no expert but am happy to learn, and if any Deputies want to take me under their wing, I would be happy to become a devotee and advocate of this project. I am happy to commend the Bill to the House.</P>

      <P>I welcome the opportunity to speak on this Bill. Like Deputy O'Connor, I am not an expert on computers or IT. I can access the Internet and send emails so I know a little about it. I first wish to outline the Government's record on IT. Ireland has fallen one place in <i>The Economist </i>intelligence unit's e-readiness rankings. This measures how conducive a country is to Internet opportunities. We have fallen to 15th place worldwide, which is very worrying indeed. We lag behind the US, the Netherlands, Britain, Switzerland, Sweden, Australia, Denmark, Germany, Canada, Finland, Singapore, Norway, Hong Kong and Austria. Ireland is ranked 25th of 30 countries surveyed in terms of broadband access for small firms and home users.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A digital divide has emerged along class lines with the failure to develop a proper digital television service preventing lower income groups from gaining access to email and to the Internet. There is a low Internet use among low income families. Geographically the divide shows that <Col N="865" />high technology is racing ahead in Dublin far quicker than elsewhere in the country. Some 19 Internet data centres were due to be completed in Dublin in 2003, but the total for the rest of the country is two.</P>
    <P>Deputy Eamon Ryan referred to the fact that education was left out of the Bill. The ratio of students to computers in a school outside Dublin is 14:1 whereas for schools close to Dublin the ratio is 9:1, which is not a great score card. One exception to that is St. Anne's school in Killaloe. Last Monday, my colleague from County Clare, the Minister of State, Deputy de Valera, opened an extension to that school, where I saw two of the finest computer rooms I have ever seen. They were modern and well laid out. I envy the students of that school having such a modern centre when compared to other post-primary schools that do not have such facilities. I welcome that sort of initiative. It is important that students have computer access in both national and secondary schools. I hope the Minister of State, Deputy Browne, will encourage the Minister for Education and Science to provide such facilities in all post-primary schools.</P>
    <P>If ever it is apt to talk of squandering the boom it is with regard to information technology. Fine Gael welcomes the hub, which will secure our national position in IT development. We should remember we already have a digital hub from which we continue to derive national benefit. Coming from County Clare I have some knowledge on this. Five years ago Telecom Éireann had a competition to establish the first information age town in the country. Against stiff opposition from places like Killarney and Castlebar, Ennis won the competition. The town received an investment of &euro;19 million in infrastructure, skills and services from Telecom Éireann. Ennis has its own website which is www.ennis.ie, which is very good and well worth visiting. It was a magnificent achievement at the time and both nationally and internationally the hub has significant advantages. It has become a living laboratory attracting skills and international recognition and branding. Crucially it brings high credibility and acceptance to all sectors, including business, education, the public sector, the voluntary sector and end-users in their homes, which is particularly important.</P>
    <P>Ennis has a population of approximately 20,000. There is considerable scope to leverage the infrastructure and people in Ennis for trials, tests and research which would benefit the whole country and put it at the forefront of technological innovation. Ennis now boasts one of the most advanced telecommunications infrastructure in Ireland. The town is served by the French designed Alcatel digital exchange and is equipped with standard and primary ISDN lines which are available on demand. The first digital broadband ring around any town in Ireland was provided in Ennis in 1998. I am delighted the Minister with responsibility for the information society, Deputy <Col N="866" />Hanafin, has arrived. She has visited Ennis and seen the facilities there.</P>
    <P>In 1999 Ennis became the first location in Ireland to have broadband access to the Internet through a new exciting technology, ADSL, which is a digital modem attached to a home phone and connects immediately to a similar modem in the national exchange. It enables connection at very high speed and gives permanent connection to the Internet. Ennis is also the sole location for VDSL with more than 100 installations in the town. VDSL is more advanced than ADSL with extra capacity for television channels.</P>
    <P>This is a truly remarkable achievement and a tribute to the innovative people in the town. Some 5,000 ICT business and science students graduate each year from third level institutions in Galway and Limerick. They are only 45 minutes from Ennis. As the information age town, 75% of houses in Ennis have a PC, which is a fantastic achievement. While establishing Ennis as the information age town, many householders took exams in the usage of PCs. In one year alone 4,300 people were trained by 11 agencies around the town. Some 5,200 children in the area have e-mail addresses. This represents a whole generation of children equipped for the technological world that awaits them. Ennis is vibrant because 42% of its population is under 25 years of age. I hope we will be ready for future innovation. Based on a survey in 2001, people in Ennis spend about 8.3 hours per week on the Internet. E-learning at Ennis is a project that ensures lifelong learning through the workforce.</P>
    <P>I bring all these facts to the attention of the House to give some context to why we are discussing the Bill today. I welcome section 9(3) of the Bill which outlines breathtaking plans for the Liberties and Coombe areas of Dublin. If this succeeds it will transform the whole area. One can only be excited by the project. However, I temper my excitement with two provisos. We cannot allow educated, well paid and technically literate whiz kids to work, create and innovate while the people of the area get no benefit from the project and their new high tech neighbours. The Government must ensure a proper framework is in place to increase new business opportunities for residents of these areas. We must also remember the budget and the overdue national development plan, which is running in parallel with the national spatial strategy.</P>
    <P>Many projects in the national development plan, including the Ennis bypass, are running behind schedule. Road infrastructure is vital. No matter how technologically advanced a town or city, it must have good road access. The Ennis bypass has been promised for years. Many industrialists who come to the town, particularly on Friday afternoons, see traffic jams, an experience which does little to attract new industry. I am sure the position is similar in other provincial towns.</P>
    <P>The national spatial strategy launched last year designated Ennis a hub town and Shannon a gateway. The strategy is designed to take the pressure <Col N="867" />off the capital and bring development to the regions, including County Clare which has suffered tremendously in terms of job losses through the years. For the strategy to be implemented and the Government's policy of balanced regional development to be honoured, the Administration must not rest on its laurels. The Bill and future development of the digital hub must not be viewed as the be all and end all or the dawning of a new technological era.</P>
    <P>There have been advances in Ennis. However, despite being designated an information age town and its broadband access, it has also suffered significant job losses in recent years. I have statistics on overseas foreign investment which show it has lost 245 jobs in this sector alone since autumn 2000. The figure for the indigenous sector is 191 making a total of 436 lost jobs. Although we have the technology and information age status and the town has been designated a digital hub, we do not appear to be attracting the jobs that count.</P>
    <P>Against this background, Industry Ennis, a new partnership comprising Shannon Development, Ennis Information Age Town Limited, Ennis Town Council, Clare County Council, the IDA, Ennis Chamber of Commerce, FÁS and some private sector representatives, was established recently. The role of the organisation is to lever the advantage of information age town status in order to try to sustain economic development and make Ennis attractive to potential investors.</P>
    <P>Since it was established earlier this year, Industry Ennis has made an impact, creating some 102 jobs. Several other initiatives have also been launched, including two overseas projects which it is envisaged will initially create 13 jobs with potential for 12 more. In conjunction with Shannon Development, Industry Ennis has also produced plans to develop the information age park on the Gort Road on the outskirts of the town. Some &euro;10 million has been allocated for the project which will provide infrastructure and services. The first phase will include some 50,000 sq. ft. of office space. The information age park is located alongside the railway line on the western rail corridor which was, unfortunately, ignored again in the strategic rail review published yesterday. The review was extremely disappointing as there were plans to open a small railway station to transport some of the products manufactured in the information age park and provide rail access for workers travelling from other areas.</P>
    <P>A major problem for Ennis is that, while it is in one way well located geographically, it has the disadvantage of being located between Galway and Limerick, both of which have universities. In recent times industry has not expanded in line with the increase in population, despite the digital hub and information age status of the town. Ennis is becoming a dormitory town for people working in Galway and Limerick. Industry Ennis will have a vital role in regenerating the town and strengthening outside focus on it.</P>
    <P>The Bill must ensure digital hub status benefits <Col N="868" />the people of my town and the country in general. It must be maintained, developed and allowed to flourish. Any other policy would be detrimental and wasteful. If the Government was to plough time, energy and funding into a new digital hub to the detriment of established information technology centres, it would have a damaging impact in terms of jobs and investment as well as our reputation and IT structures. I hope the Digital Hub Development Agency will give us an international platform to improve our reputation and, above all, provide our growing population with jobs in the information technology sector.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach (Ms Hanafin)</NameTxt>
      <P>Tá áthas orm labhairt ar an mBille seo agus fáiltím roimh an digital hub atá ag tarlú cheana féin. Inniu tá muid á chur ar bhunús reachtúil. It is a welcome development that in the oldest part of our capital city, an area in which generations of people got jobs in the Guinness company, we are now creating a modern high-tech industry. It provides a strong indication of the state of the economy and the progress we have made in moving forward with new technologies as well as the way in which we are able to link in such technologies with communities.</P>
      <P>I wear many hats in the House, one of which is the position of Minister of State with responsibility for the information society. Obviously, therefore, I take a particular interest in the Bill which crosses a range of Departments. Something as tangible as the development of a digital hub is welcome. For some it will mean broadband, for others inclusion while for others it will be about learning skills. The digital hub is an example of how information technology can create employment and generate a solid economy in a specific area. It reminds me of Seán O'Faoláin's words, &ldquo;There is only one admirable form of the imagination: the imagination that is so intense that it creates a new reality, that it makes things happen.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>If ever we had an example of the imagination giving rise to a reality, it is the digital hub.</P>
      <P>Deputy Breen talked about Ennis, a digital hub. I had the pleasure of visiting the town and seeing the positive impact digital hub status is having on ordinary citizens of the town and its businesses and communities. One has, on the one hand, the pharmacies which are able to provide a very good service on-line and, on the other, schools in which the children, as the Deputy said, are adept at using computers. I am still trying to work out whether I was glad or sad to hear a little girl say she had three computers at home in the same way a six year old would normally tell one she had three dolls. The example certainly shows the advances being made in Ennis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I also met the sunset group, pensioners who, in anyone's language, would be described as late in adopting technology, who have managed to create a new network through the use of technology. This is the reality of the digital world today. The digital hub will be a high-tech village <Col N="869" />in the oldest part of the city. A cluster of Irish and international digital media companies and research, development and educational initiatives will come together. It is wonderful to see the creation, management and distribution of digital content across numerous Internet and digitally enabled platforms.</P>
    <P>I recently attended the O2 media awards at which the digital hub played a part. I take this opportunity to pay tribute to the Dún Laoghaire Institute of Art, Design and Technology as it won the grand prix award for the tremendous advances it has made and continues to make to the digital media sector in Ireland. The idea for the hub arose from MediaLab Europe, the third level research and development institute established by the Government in partnership with the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. The idea was that like-minded people would come together in the hub and optimise the impact of its operations on the commercial sector. Of course, this is not a new idea and I know some Members are wondering whether it will be centred only in that area and whether anyone else will benefit. The idea is that bringing people together will allow the hub to work better and everybody will benefit. It has been brought about by a combination of groups and is a great example of partnership between the Government, Dublin City Council, Enterprise Ireland and IDA Ireland.</P>
    <P>The policy document of the Information Society is called New Connections. It is our blueprint for the future and the hub is one element of it. The hub is based in a premier location and is a local example of what we are trying to achieve nationally. Importantly, it includes the whole community. The people that live in this area have, for generations, worked with Guinness. It is just as important that the local community would feel a part of the new digital hub that is centred in their locality. I visited the Presentation Convent in Warrenmount some weeks ago to open the new computer facilities there. It was wonderful to see those children moving, with their community, into the digital area and embracing computer learning with such enthusiasm and interest. It is important that the companies based there work hand in hand with the community. Investment should go to schools and community centres to ensure everybody benefits from it.</P>
    <P>We can already see the progress that is being made as six companies are established there. It is a good mix of companies covering the areas of e-learning, multimedia and digital. It is a sign that knowledge is the new creation factor of wealth. Knowledge is the new economy and is at the centre of our well being as a country. We measure economic indicators every month and it is now acknowledged that 70% to 80% of economic growth stems from new and better knowledge. However, it is difficult to gauge this. Future prosperity will also be gauged on this and the digital hub has a central role to play.</P>
    <P>Modern technology enables us to do new things in new ways. It also enables us to do old things <Col N="870" />more quickly and efficiently and this can drive economic development. This also provides a challenge for the Government as it must try to address any digital divide that emerges. While it is part of the national plan it is also part of an overall European plan, such as the e-Europe 2005 programme. This programme seeks to include all Europeans and provide facilities and services that are relevant to citizens while ensuring people have the correct skills.</P>
    <P>This morning I launched the ECDL syllabus four. There are about three million people currently taking ECDL programmes in 100 countries. The centre for the foundation that develops this is based in Dublin. I taught Irish for 17 years and anyone who ever studied Irish learned about Peig Sayers, and her book remained on the syllabus for 50 or 60 years. After six years, the ECDL is now on its fourth syllabus. This demonstrates how quickly developments are being made in this field. Dublin and Ireland is at the centre of ensuring a response to this. The new initiatives that are being introduced involve digital cameras, security and viruses &ndash; perhaps there is something we could learn and apply it to our voting system here.</P>
    <P>We know from Forfás that our future economy and competitiveness depends on having a high knowledge content. Whereas other countries may challenge us for manufacturing jobs &ndash; some areas of the country have suffered from this &ndash; Ireland can give added value at the knowledge level. By consistently improving our skills, we will continue to be economically competitive in this area. The Government has invested &euro;130 million in the digital hub project. We must ensure that society and the economy benefits from this and we must ensure that we invest in skills and that it links with Government policy. I believe this can be successful in the long-term.</P>
    <P>There is much creativity and expression involved in this area. While many people might draw down a shutter on ICT, we have already seen evidence of the potential and possibilities for digital tools in exhibitions that have been held. The exhibitions have provided a showcase for newcomers, artists, animators, musicians and filmmakers. Such people work out of the digital hub and have found a form of expression through it. It is about the people who will work in it, benefit from it and invest in it, as well as society as a whole, and it will develop in the coming months. It is interesting to see the interest of the six companies that are established there and more are due to come on board in the coming weeks. It is anticipated that it will have 7,000 ICT employees and 10,000 residents. This will revitalise the area as it creates an industrial pocket in Dublin 8. I believe it will have a wider effect throughout society.</P>
    <P>Particular credit must be given to Dublin City Council and the role it has played in this in recognising the need to move forward. The council was instrumental in bringing various groups together and this partnership approach made it successful. <Col N="871" />In looking at the bigger picture, credit must be given to the Minister, Deputy Dermot Ahern, for the progress he has made on the metropolitan area networks and the 19 towns. This will create greater opportunities for people throughout the entire country.</P>
    <P>When we talk about ICT and the information society, many people speak of the services that are being made available and the role e-government is playing in it. This country is fortunate in that it has always had an emphasis on education. I met the Greek member of the ECDL foundation this morning. He told me that in the early 1990s Ireland had 75% of the average GDP in Europe while Greece had 65%. Now Ireland's GDP is 133% of the EU average, while for Greece the figure is only 75%. The difference is that Greece invested its European funding in infrastructure while we invested ours in education. However, I felt honour bound to tell him that this had not just happened in the last ten years but that we had been investing in education and training for 40 years. It is this that is having an effect on our advances and has us at the forefront of the knowledge economy and e-government.</P>
    <P>Recent reports have shown that Ireland is number one or two in the area of e-government. In that context, there is a challenge to all Departments to ensure they are on-line to provide services people want that represent value for money, are on time and all up-and-running by 2005. Some Departments are making particularly good progress in that regard. The Cabinet will be giving a lead later this year when it becomes an e-Cabinet. It will surprise no one to know that the Cabinet alone generates 1.2 million A4 pages per annum. Each member of the Cabinet carries 4.75 kilogrammes of paper per week. Every piece of legislation and memo circulated for the purposes of Cabinet is circulated not only to 15 Departments but also to 15 people within each Department. The Cabinet then leaves the paper behind on the table after meetings.</P>

In the autumn the Cabinet will give the lead by becoming an e-Cabinet by doing all its business with the help of a laptop. Not only will we get rid of the paper at the final stages of the preparation of legislation we will also be able to contribute to the process. I suspect it might not be too long before we will all have laptops in the House when Committee and Report Stages of Bills are being taken and, with e-Dáil, it will all come before us on screen.</P>

      <P>We may need to arrange some basic and advanced training for Members. This is all useful to publicise the advances being made at different levels because most are not aware of what is happening. At local authority level, for example, Kerry County Council, e-procurement is saving a lot of money. It is also being brought forward at government level. It is important to include everybody.</P>
      <P>Based close to the digital hub, the Liberties Learning Initiative focuses on education and digital literacy. Pilot projects are in place in partnership with the local community and education providers giving people the skills necessary to move forward through the use of digital video cameras, mini-disc recorders, laptops and the Internet. What is particularly interesting is that hundreds of local students and teachers have been involved in a project called, Digital Storytelling. I am a particular fan of the &ldquo;Den 2&rdquo; television programme on Network 2, having appeared with Dustin on two occasions&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms Hanafin</NameTxt>
      <P>It was one of the highlights of my political career. I was delighted to see that the Liberties series was running on &ldquo;Den 2&rdquo;&ndash; the last of which is being shown this afternoon. This is real evidence of how an economic development, well rooted in a local community, can have a wider effect on society. This is to be welcomed. The information society and inclusion are not just about children, they must include everybody, particularly those with disabilities who have been quick to grasp the opportunities provided by technology.</P>
      <P>Perhaps one of the most memorable visits I made recently was to St. Joseph's residential home, Brewery Road, Stillorgan where there are a number of long-term residents, many of whom are blind and deaf. One would think that they were isolated and cut-off from the world but that is not the case. Each day one of the residents goes onto Ireland On Line, downloads the interesting stories of the day and prints them out in Braille in order that the residents can read them. That is significant progress from when they used to get English news in Braille, one month late. Now they can get today's Irish news on the day. This is a wonderful example of how the information society can be all-inclusive. Not only do we have investment in the likes of the digital hub &ndash; with this legislation to back it up &ndash; for the first time in the social partnership agreement there is specific mention of the information society, e-inclusivity and making sure the knowledge economy and information society is there for all our citizens to benefit from equally.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. F. McGrath</NameTxt>
      <P>I am grateful for the opportunity to speak on the Bill which I welcome. I intend to make my views known on what is an important investment issue for an area in Dublin City which needs major development and assistance. It is also important to remind ourselves that the digital hub refers to the area in Thomas Street where it is intended to cluster Irish and international digital media companies, research and development and education initiatives. I strongly welcome the proposal.</P>
      <P>While we all welcome the idea, it is important not to put all our eggs in one basket. I would like to see a high proportion of Irish based and owned companies in the area. We must be constantly on our guard against the fly-by-night companies and get-rich-quick merchants with no loyalty to the State or their staff. This is an economic reality to which we must all face up. With more companies leaving Ireland because of cheaper labour costs elsewhere, we must plan for these realities. We need more creative ideas with a strong semi-State involvement and should never apologise for making such companies the engine room of the economy in the creation of more jobs.</P>
      <P>The purpose of the Bill is to place the development company on a statutory basis and rename it, Digital Hub Development Agency. The agency will, in turn, develop the area as a centre of excellence for the digital media industry. I pay tribute to the thousands of Irish and non-national workers involved in these industries because they are the main reason we have attracted investment to Ireland in the first place. We have people who can do the business and we should be proud of them. We should also try to get rid of the tipping-the-cap syndrome, particularly towards the USA, Britain and the European Union. We have a quality workforce which we should exploit and develop further.</P>
      <P>I strongly welcome the partnership approach to urban regeneration with such bodies as Dublin City Council. This section is vital to its success and must be linked in with the local community, particularly in relation to jobs. People from the local area must be part of this plan because to exclude them would be a recipe for disaster. There must be a high input from the local workforce from all sections of society, particularly the Thomas Street area. If we do this, the digital hub will have great potential in the area and serve as an example for others throughout the city and countrywide. It is good practice and that should always be rewarded, used in other communities as an example and developed further.</P>
      <P>For the project to proceed, extensive refurbishment of properties acquired for the hub must be undertaken. This is already under way and will be a major lift to the area. I hope that there is strong input to the refurbishment from local people with relevant skills. I welcome the involvement of the Office of Public Works, which has a duty to ensure quality investment and reliable public services.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="874" />This digital hub will have a major impact on the IT sector. The idea is good, but we must always be open and transparent about this type of development. The recent debate on the Freedom of Information Act does not give me hope, however, as the Government has a record for suppressing freedom of information. We must all be on our guard with reference to what is an important issue in any democratic society. We must treat information technology and information generally as valuable resources which are to be respected.</P>
    <P>It has recently been seen how information and the communications industry have been exploited and destroyed, particularly with regard to the war in Iraq. When one turns on a television screen, one has to search for an objective view. Similarly, the Seanad last night heard disgraceful comments from Senators attacking the peace marchers outside the Dáil on the previous night. The Senators seemed to forget the reality of what is happening in the world. Senators and Deputies who have attacked the anti-war movement are out of touch with the people.</P>

      <P>When discussing investment in IT, we should always be conscious of civil liberties and vigilant in that regard.</P>
      <P>The Bill has 45 sections and 43 amendments were proposed in the Seanad. I welcome this and, having considered carefully the Bill and the interests of Thomas Street and Dublin, I find the legislation well worth supporting. While dealing with Thomas Street, we might also consider other areas throughout Dublin city, particularly economically disadvantaged areas on the north side. If this project is a success and investment and 7,000 jobs go to Thomas Street, a further project in, for example, the Coolock area of north central Dublin might be considered. There are many vacant sites in that area suitable for further investment.</P>
      <P>When discussing investment, the development of IT and the hub, we must be careful to prioritise certain areas. In my area, there is an excellent northside civic centre but one of the problems with its premises is that many of the groups trying to use it find the rent too high. For example, the Northside Citizens Information Centre, the Coolock community law centre and the local radio station, NEAR FM &ndash; all groups steeped in the local community &ndash; have major problems affording the rent. We must invest resources and finances in the various groups so that they can afford to operate and use services. Certain areas need to be included.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="875" />One school on Griffith Avenue in Marino has raised &euro;175,000 but is still short &euro;25,000 to open a computer room. This is not acceptable if we wish to exploit digital hubs and develop resources. The Minister also mentioned IT in the context of children with disabilities, another area with great potential. Those who know anything about children with disabilities will have seen over the past six years how IT has helped them in a very positive way. Children with Down's syndrome and other intellectual disabilities are now, because of IT, better able to develop themselves.</P>
    <P>I have much that is positive to say about this Bill. However, we should not forget those who do not have computers and who are not involved with IT. I particularly refer to the 38% of our society that seems to have lost faith in politics. We must invest in these areas to win back ordinary people. Investment in IT and the development of these areas would lead to a radical change in society.</P>
    <P>However, there are downsides to the digital world. I do not agree with the idea that a young girl, instead of having three dolls, should have three computers. I am concerned about a lack of exercise among children if they spend hours every day at a computer. That time must be directed and supervised. There are long-term difficulties associated with children not being active in sports. Journalist Tom Humphries wrote an article recently in <i>The Irish Times</i> on the question of lack of exercise and involvement in sports among children, an issue we should monitor closely.</P>
    <P>As a member of Dublin City Council since 1999, I strongly welcome its involvement in this project, and its partnership approach. I also welcome the strong Guinness connection in its local community, which is providing options for local people.</P>
    <P>This leads me to the debate about society versus the economy. I caution against the drift towards developing Ireland as an economic unit rather than as a society. Deputy McGuinness hinted at this in the recent debate among the Government parties, which saw one party pushing an agenda that is against the natural instincts of the vast majority of Irish people. A right-wing agenda is being pushed by certain people. We must stop this drift and win back society, and IT can make a contribution to this.</P>
    <P>I welcome the fact that more than 7,000 people could potentially be employed in the south inner city of Dublin, a magnificent boost for the area, and I welcome the legislation. It is good for Thomas Street, the south inner city, the people of Dublin and Ireland.</P>

      <P>I will first reflect on what happened in the House this week with regard to the use of technology and the action taken by the Labour Party, an issue which came to mind as the Chief Whip, the Minister of State, Deputy Hanafin, was speaking. With regard to voting by elec<Col N="876" />tronic means, we should now consider the position of Standing Order 69. The whole country watched as we went through the motion of casting our votes electronically before having to turn around to walk through the lobbies. A time must come in the development of information technology and its use in this House when we accept one form of technology and do not revert to other means, unless there is a virus which prevents us from using the available technology.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGuinness</NameTxt>
      <P>I compliment you, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, on the initiative you took this week in giving a briefing for Members on e-government and technology. With every company in the world developing, moving on and bringing its staff with it, it is amazing to see this House with so little back-up in terms of the development of technology for use in a Member's day-to-day work. Every other company would have breaks for various courses and for improving the skills of its staff to ensure its job is done more efficiently and cost effectively. We do not seem to do that. I urge those responsible in this area to take a fresh look at what is happening in the world and, perhaps, reconnect us to it so that we can work more efficiently and get rid of the paper. I would not just like to see an e-Cabinet&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaulKehoeFG" hpid="Mr. Kehoe Mr. Kehoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kehoe</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a PD Cabinet.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMcGuinness" hpid="Mr. McGuinness Mr. McGuinness">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGuinness</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;but an e-Deputy, so that we can connect with the Cabinet to know what is going on. I acknowledge the investment made by the Government over the past six years. The investment has been significant in terms of bringing this country forward and being at the cutting edge of information and communications technology developments. Other companies, such as the ESB, have made a huge investment in recent times in terms of providing a fibre optic ring, which needs to be connected.</P>
      <P>A huge number of computers were made available to schools when Deputy Martin was Minister for Education and Science. The number of computers was further enhanced when initiatives were taken by the private sector. A significant number of schools now has computer facilities. The use of computers and technology is not central to the delivery of education in many areas, however. We need to refocus our policy, not only in relation to educating students who attend schools at primary and secondary level, but also to ensure that computers are used in classes for mainstream subjects. IT should become part and parcel of the delivery of education in this country. If more computer facilities, such as designated computer rooms, are required, we should re-evaluate the delivery of the schools building programme. We should ensure that computerisation is part and parcel of the education system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I found that there was a huge interest in my constituency when computers were made avail<Col N="877" />able as part of the inclusion of IT in the schools programme. Young people are driving the technological agenda &ndash; I know my children are far more advanced than me in the use of technology. We need to tap into such resources and energies to ensure that the ICT programme continues to develop as part of the process of creating a truly information-based society, one that can tap into all education and business advantages.</P>
    <P>I would like to acknowledge the contribution of county enterprise boards to information technology developments. Grants have been advanced to various companies to ensure that they are at the cutting edge of business development. The work of the enterprise boards has ensured that SMEs have remained connected to wider developments in commerce. Such businesses are able to take advantage of the information and communication technologies that they have been given as tools.</P>
    <P>I also acknowledge the, admittedly slow, technological advances in local government. Public representatives are now equipped with laptops to enable them to access the information they require. I ask that these changes in terms of local government be developed even more so that the amount of information available to public representatives for their constituents will become far greater than it is at present. The need to telephone an official will no longer exist if one can access on-line the information one requires to respond to a constituent's inquiries.</P>
    <P>The greatest saving that can be made in this country relates to e-procurement. I am surprised by the slowness of the development of e-procurement facilities. Millions of euro can be saved if we develop the e-procurement area.</P>
    <P>It is important that private companies have an input in this regard. Eircom's information age town initiative some years ago created a hunger and a desire among the general population to become connected and to avail of technology to do all sorts of things. Technological advancements of this kind have helped the public to make progress in business and education, or simply to gather information or take courses on the Internet. The digital hub is building on the Eircom initiative, which proved to be a huge success, as a concept by taking the successful parts of it and creating the success story that the hub will become.</P>
    <P>The hunger for technology among the e-literate population is accompanied by the danger that we are about to create a two-tier society. We have to continue to fund local communities that are showing an interest in this area so they can include the marginalised and those who are associated with community and family resource centres in this process. The use of information technology as a tool by such people helps them to find a path out of the cycle of unemployment and back into education and employment. We have to continue to invest in such areas if we are to eliminate the possibility of a two-tier information society. New job creation initiatives will <Col N="878" />be opened if this can be achieved. I have seen in my constituency that technology is taken up as it is made available. People are on-line and are interested in moving on, but they are also keen to gain jobs from that concept.</P>
    <P>A consequence of the fact that investment has paid off is the need to move beyond normal ECDL courses to higher level courses. Such courses need to be delivered at community level if we are to ensure that we stay connected to people who are interested. Private sector interests and businesses are able to keep pace with developments as a result of their own financial advantages, but other sectors need to be assisted. We need to understand that we have a highly literate population in terms of information technology. If we give people the opportunity to make progress, they will become employable, they will create initiatives and they will set up companies that will employ people in the technology sector.</P>
    <P>Problems are continuing to exist in the global economy while we are debating this issue. People are not investing in technology because there are suspicions as a consequence of the events of the past four years. When companies take a fresh look at technological possibilities, they will realise that the growth in the sector has not ended but is beginning to grow. We need to invest in the cutting edge of technological development so that we can avail of the jobs that will be created in the new economy if we have the confidence to invest and to persevere.</P>
    <P>Ireland has a young population of people who are keenly interested in technology. Their creativity is shown in European countries and American companies and in their designing of software and development of training courses. As legislators and public representatives, we need to understand that a movement is taking place and to tap into the energy and direction that exists. We need to show the confidence to take the next steps, to pass this Bill and perhaps regionalise hubs so that we can take advantage of what they will deliver in terms of education and jobs. Computrain, a training company based in Kilkenny, received an award in the RDS yesterday for an initiative it has taken in that area. We need to encourage such companies to continue the process. Many hundreds of people are being given certificates for doing ECDL courses. Women based in the home, in particular, are deciding to start a new life in the workforce by taking ECDL training and learning how to use computers. The fact that they are choosing to make themselves available for employment means that a huge energy is now available to the economy. We need to appreciate this resource and to tap into it.</P>
    <P>One of the big drawbacks in the area of connectivity is that so much fibre optic cable in the ground is simply not lit. I suggested to the Minister for Finance that those who are penalised for not developing derelict sites should also be penalised if cable in the ground remains unlit. This country badly needs such a resource in difficult economic times. Penalties should be imposed in <Col N="879" />this regard to ensure that companies who are responsible for fibre optic cable bring it to life and make it available to the public. Packages need to be put in place as part of this process to ensure that the service is delivered into every home. It is pointless that companies should leave the cable in place, although it may have a purpose for Eircom, which is cornering the market.</P>
    <P>We need to free the market if the economy is to grow. We need to ensure that the fibre optic cable rolled out on the ESB's lines &ndash; I commend the Minister, Deputy Dermot Ahern, for supporting the recent announcement in that regard &ndash; is taken the last mile, as we call it, or the first mile as the Americans call it. If the ESB works in partnership with various companies, it has the wireless technology to take this that last mile. I encourage the Government to be the anchor tenant with the ESB to ensure a critical mass of use is reached to deliver the technology to homes throughout the country. It is pointless to talk up the positive side of information and communications technology if we do not provide for the tangible delivery of the service to the home of every person. They should be able to connect at a low charge and stay on-line permanently but this can only be done if the Government takes the initiative, not by way of investment but by being the line tenant which ensures the next phase goes ahead. If that is done, we will instil the confidence required to ensure the ESB and others take the development to its final stages.</P>
    <P>There are small companies which can make this possible with the co-operation of local authorities. They can use hubs to deliver in cities like Kilkenny and take the development to the county and the region. The regions must be brought along with this development. It is the only way to do this. One of the lessons learned from the information age town initiative was that it was pointless to have Ennis on its own. It is isolated from Kilkenny, Killarney and Castlebar which should be connected and able to talk to each other. Ennis is talking to itself but it must reach beyond to connect regionally and then Dublin to form a basis for building an information age society for the future. I ask the Minister to examine the notion of regional hubs.</P>
    <P>I am chairman of a group in Kilkenny which has purchased a building with its own money and some assistance from Eircom to house the Malting project, a &euro;3 million development. It is similar to the digital hub project in Dublin which has many parallels with the aims and objectives of the Kilkenny information age initiative. Our strategy focuses on the delivery of information and communications technology policies and we have undertaken 40 ICT projects in business, education, the community and local government. The flagship project is supported by Enterprise Ireland. The building we have purchased will bring together the community, young entrepreneurs, those already working in the field and <Col N="880" />software designers. It will create an environment in which they can work and give those already skilled in our community confidence in a way forward through technology. There are real jobs available. This is not just something for the big shots, it can be taken advantage of by those who are marginalised as well as others in society if we demonstrate that a national plan is being worked to.</P>
    <P>Regional hubs are almost established but we need to formalise them. I do not doubt that the lessons of the hub formulated in this Bill can be replicated in the regions if we talk to each other. We can learn from each other's mistakes and success stories and share information, which is essentially what the information society is all about. We can cut down on expense because once the wheel is invented there is no need to go back over the process. Government needs to understand that once this hub is financed and running, it can be replicated at far less cost in the regions which will lead to benefits in terms of jobs and education. An information society will benefit from a national approach. While we were at the cutting edge and perhaps ahead of the posse, Europe has now caught up with us. We are competing on almost the same ground.</P>

      <P>I have no problem with the concept of the digital hub. I agree with the concentration of investment in modern technology in a particular location for the benefit of the country and business at large. However, I do not want to be told on a regular basis that this is the only way to do it and if we are not capable of doing it this way, we are losing out. Many others have managed without such a system. I do not want to be told we have no option except to go this route because there are dangers. There is the danger of becoming totally dependent on a particular system that does not always live up to expectations.</P>
      <P>The Schedule to the Bill delineates the digital hub area. It sounds like a rambler's map. It is a page and a half long and finishes up by stating, &ldquo;. . . then continuing in a southerly direction across Thomas Street West to the first mentioned point&rdquo;. In other words, it comes back to where it started.</P>
      <P>I am aware that the development plan for Dublin is the framework within which this digital hub is located. While I have no difficulty with the concept of the hub, I do not understand the reason it was decided to follow the points from A through to D. I would like more information on the criteria being followed. As I have never been a member of Dublin City Council, I am totally at sea. The Minister may say this is a normal method of describing&mdash;</P>

I sincerely hope there are none of the strings attached as appeared to have been attached to that agency because it stretched the imagination for a long time. I will give this one the benefit of the doubt. I presume everything is above board and that there is no similarity but that caught my eye as I glanced through the Bill. Certain procedures of accountability will have to be followed. There will need to be transparency <Col N="885" />and openness, not exactly features of what is coming from the other side of the House.</P>

      <P>I know that the digital hub is theoretically a good cause and that it should be good for business and society and the international reputation of the country. I notice that &euro;80 million has already been spent on the purchase of property. The cost of the purchase of property in 2001 was &euro;51.94 million and in 2002, &euro;21.7 million. The cost of broadband infrastructure for the digital hub area was &euro;2.29 million. It is interesting that the operating expenses of Digital Media Development Limited amount to &euro;2.54 million. Its other operating expenses in 2002 were slightly less than in 2001 at a mere &euro;2 million. I am a little uneasy about some details having had the experience of examining similar agencies and companies. I sincerely hope there will not be a revisitation of these areas in the context of this Bill.</P>

      <P>The explanatory memorandum to the Bill states:</P>
      <P>Section 24 is a standard provision requiring members of the Agency, the Chief Executive and a director of a subsidiary of the Agency to make a declaration in writing of his/her interests to the Minister on their appointment. The form of this declaration will be specified by the Minister following consultation with the Minister for Finance.</P>

      <P>&mdash;at the mere thought that anybody would become suspicious that this is not normal procedure and practice. It is normal procedure up to a point. Members of this House have to make a statutory declaration to the Public Offices Commission. Why do the requirements of the Public Offices Commission not apply to a matter of this nature? Is it not equally important that agents, bodies or those accountable to the Minister or the Department with responsibility for the expenditure of public funds should be expected to lodge the declaration in the most appropriate place, where we must all lodge our declarations, in the Public Offices Commission? I suggest that might not be a bad idea. It may not be a very good idea, depending on who looks at it, and in which direction, but I suggest that some consideration be given to it. May I refer to section 24?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
      <P>Difficult as it may be, I will do my utmost. Section 24 reads:</P>
      <P>On his or her appointment, the chief executive and each member of the Agency and a committee and a director of a subsidiary, shall make a declaration in writing of his or her interests to the Minister, in such form as the Minister, following consultation with the Minister for Finance, may specify.</P>
      <P>On his or her appointment, each consultant or adviser and each member of the staff of the agency at a grade or level specified before the appointment by the agency, following consultation with the Minister, shall declare his or her interests in writing to the chairperson of the agency and the chairperson shall inform the agency at its next meeting of the interests declared and the names of those making the declarations.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan" hpid="Mr. Durkan Mr. Durkan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no difficulty with that. If the chairperson does not like the declaration of interests, he or she will not have to do anything about it. He or she will merely have to report to the board. The interests must be declared in writing to the chairman who shall inform the agency at its next meeting of the interests declared. I presume it will be to the entire board of the agency, or will it be to a chief executive or a single person? It might be no harm to have another look at that aspect. I get worried whenever the Government comes up with something which is apparently open, transparent and accountable. My chilblains begin to act up straight away.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBrowne2" hpid="Mr. Browne Mr. Browne">

      <P>It is not easy, but they get frequent calls to act up, which is the problem. Perhaps that section can be looked at to see if it <Col N="887" />might be possible to provide safeguards from the point of view of the Minister as well as the public. After all, the public are the last people to be considered by the Government in any circumstances. The Government had a very successful general election.</P>

      <P>I must express my disappointment at the findings of the committee on Dáil reform in the past. They have restricted my ability to <Col N="888" />express my views in this House. When my constituents elected me repeatedly, and with some difficulty on a number of occasions, they gave me <i>carte blanche</i> to speak on their behalf for as long as I wished. We will discuss that issue later.</P>
      <P>I have no problem with the fundamental concept. I hope it goes well and lives up to expectations. I hope no aspect of it will become a disappointment which we will have to investigate in the future. I hope there is not a general belief that seems to emerge from the opposite side of the House, a lemming-like urge to charge in a particular direction, that we are ultimately dependent on this high tech notion spreading from that side of the House and if we do not embrace it, we are in some way a deficient race. I accept that time constraints will not allow me to continue, but I would like to have an opportunity to indulge further on this issue with the Minister of State or any other Member on that side of the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBrowne2" hpid="Mr. Browne Mr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources (Mr. Browne)</NameTxt>
      <P>I begin by thanking Deputies for their contributions, which indicate a high level of understanding of the issues involved. A number of Members have first-hand knowledge of the project which has been demonstrated in the detailed comments. I would say to Deputy Durkan that this is the second or third day we have had a debate on the Bill to which 26 speakers contributed. There is tremendous interest in the digital hub not just in Dublin but throughout the country. There is a need to look at these services in the future and the Minister will take that aspect on board. I thank the Minister of State, Deputy Hanafin, for her input, support and contribution.</P>
      <P>I will deal with some of the issues raised by Deputies Coveney, Kehoe, Broughan, Cuffe and others in regard to funding for the project. I clarify for Deputy Broughan that this project was not subject to the cutbacks in the 2003 Estimates. As originally provided for, the Government is investing a total of &euro;130 million in the project, despite what Deputy Durkan might say. It is envisaged that a further &euro;120 million will come from the private sector, through the PPP, bringing the total investment to &euro;250 million.</P>
      <P>In response to Deputy Cuffe, the prerequisite to the project was that a significant tranche of property would be bought at the outset. Deputy Durkan raised the issue of the money spent on property. This sends a clear message to the private sector of the Government's concrete commitment to the project. It was also necessary to pave the way for facilitating private sector investment through the PPP process. In addition, as indicated in the opening speech, six companies are now operating in the hub. This will increase substantially when the print works building opens later this year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In reply to Deputies' comments that the Taoiseach remains fully committed to the project, it was considered a priority while being managed in <Col N="889" />his Department. The funding allocation was agreed before the transfer of the project from the Taoiseach's Department to the Department of Public Enterprise. His support for the project has been well documented. He has given it high priority and it is fitting that he is launching the digital communities programme next week. He is taking a hands-on approach to the project.</P>
    <P>Deputy Coveney also referred to the accounting issue that arose for DMDL last year. The operational allocation for DMDL in 2001 was &euro;2.5 million. The spend in the same year was &euro;2 million, which left &euro;500,000 to be carried over, in addition to the 2002 allocation of &euro;2 million. Therefore, a timing issue arose in relation to the spending of this &euro;500,000. It was a technical accounting issue, which was resolved following discussions between the Department of Finance, my Department, the Comptroller and Auditor General and the company. It did not affect the company's allocation for 2001 and 2002, which it received in full. When the legislation is enacted, the company will obtain a rent roll and will have recourse to borrowing.</P>
    <P>A number of Deputies, including Deputies Cuffe and Ó Snodaigh, raised the question of the attractiveness to international companies of the long-term viability of the digital hub. Deputies also mentioned other international high-tech clusters, such as those located in Seoul and Kuala Lumpur. I am aware that we are not the only country to see opportunities in the emerging digital media sector. We must model our approach to developing this new sector in a way that is proportionate to our resources and strength. This approach has served us well in the remarkable progress the country has made in the IT sector in recent years.</P>
    <P>Under State aid rules, we cannot offer special tax incentives, but as has been shown by other high-tech clusters around the world, the clustering of these specialist enterprises and research initiatives creates the critical mass of knowledge and expertise necessary to foster the growth of the specialist companies involved. These enterprises and individuals need to be able to tap into a network that facilitates the development of research projects and business ideas, access to venture capital and links with global industry and academia. They also need to be able to do this in an environment that is not adverse to the risk that goes with innovation.</P>
    <P>It is part of the remit of the digital hub that linkages are established, both nationally and internationally, in the context of an overall knowledge economy strategy. This brings me to the question of linkages between the digital hub, MLE and our third level institutions. The academic community expressed concerns about the arrival of MLE, which was natural as the joint venture represented a new departure for the country. I accept that MLE has been affected by the downturn in the technology sector, which is hardly surprising given the impact of the downturn on the sector as a whole. However, it is mak<Col N="890" />ing strides to improve its sponsorship revenue, both in terms of corporate sponsorship and availing of EU research funding.</P>
    <P>It has also created linkages with the third level sector, with the colleges nearby and others. A number of Deputies referred to this and expressed concern that other colleges have not been included. The Government has recognised the importance of these linkages and for the duration of the national development plan, it has allowed over &euro;1 million per annum for collaborative projects between MLE and the third level sector in the country. To date, almost &euro;4 million has been spent under this initiative. MLE has its own agreements with the Government, which includes linkages with third level colleges and industrial promotion agencies.</P>
    <P>With regard to linkages between the digital hub and the third level sector, relationships have already been established on a number of education and training initiatives, such as the digital hub community and digital story-telling projects, which also involve local schools. A number of Deputies, including Deputies Upton and Crowe, referred to this. It is a key part of the agency's strategy that these links will develop into a permanent presence in the area, meeting the training needs of the local community and the workforce in the hub.</P>
    <P>A number of Deputies raised the important issue of community consultation in the digital hub and how real benefits will accrue from these projects. Deputies Ryan, Ó Snodaigh and Upton, in particular, brought their local knowledge of the serious deprivation suffered in this area to bear on this aspect. I welcome the detailed account by Deputy Ryan of what has been achieved to date by the digital hub in working with local communities. As he said, the project is fully committed to respecting the tradition and heritage of the area. Deputies Ardagh, Upton and other Deputies from the area made a number of interesting comments on this aspect. All Members, even those from the sunny south-east, are aware of the importance and traditions of the Liberties area of Dublin and the need to help and support it and protect its culture and values.</P>
    <P>I agree that serious problems exist in this area of Dublin, as pointed out by Deputies Mulcahy, Upton and others. A key priority of the development team in the hub is to ensure that the project can contribute as fully as is feasible to the alleviation of these problems. However, it is also important to sound a note of realism. While the development of the digital hub must, and will, deliver real and sustained benefits to the local community at all levels, it cannot assume full responsibility for solving long-standing problems in the area, such as education and housing. It can also contribute new ides and energy in the way it works in partnership with local groups and Dublin City Council, which will only add to improving the existing efforts to improve the quality of life and opportunities for the residents in the area.</P>
    <P>While the issue of social and affordable hous<Col N="891" />ing is outside the scope of the new agency, any development in the digital hub will be subject to Dublin City Council's housing strategy, which means that a quota of 20% will have to be reserved for affordable housing. This will be of interest to Deputies Upton, Mulcahy, Ardagh and others who raised this issue. It is important that Dublin City Council recognises the important role it must play in the provision of affordable housing in this area of Dublin.</P>
    <P>During passage of the Bill through the Seanad, the Minister gave an undertaking to issue a direction to the new agency when it is established to report to him on further strategies to deal with access and social inclusion issues. On a related point, a number of Deputies raised the question of the representation of the local community on the board of the agency. Section 22 deals with the disqualification from membership of the agency of Members of the Oireachtas. While in the main this is a standard section, it has been altered in one important detail. Normally, local representatives would be disqualified from sitting on such a board, however, it was decided in this situation that it was important to allow such representation, to take account of the need to provide input from the local community to the board by those with real local knowledge. This is in line with precedent, such as the provisions relating to the Dublin Docklands Development Authority.</P>
    <P>I again thank Members for their input to this debate. Some 26 Deputies made a valuable contribution. Matters can be considered in detail on <Col N="892" />Committee Stage. I also thank my officials for their assistance.</P>
