      <P>It now appears that military activity in the war in Iraq is nearing conclusion. On Monday, the Taoiseach spoke to Kofi Annan, Secretary General of the United Nations, about the UN's role in respect of reconstructing and overseeing administration in post-war Iraq. The key word emanating from yesterday's meeting in Hillsborough involving President Bush, Prime Minister Blair and the Taoiseach was &ldquo;vital&rdquo;. Given the scale of challenge facing the administrative bodies in respect of rebuilding Iraq, re-launching its currency, building a financial system from scratch and putting in place an operational judicial system leading to a point where Iraqi people can elect their own democratic government, will the Taoiseach explain to this House what is his definition of the word &ldquo;vital&rdquo; in regard to the UN's role? Has he reported back to Kofi Annan who he said would be well satisfied with what he had to report? What is the Taoiseach's understanding of what was agreed yesterday between President Bush and Prime Minister Blair? Will the United Nations oversee the administration and reconstruction of Iraq or will <Col N="2" /> it merely be an advisory body to the office for reconstruction and humanitarian assistance which the US and Britain are offering to put in place? What is the Taoiseach's understanding of the words &ldquo;vital role&rdquo; in respect of the work to be carried out by the United Nations in the reconstruction of Iraq?</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I spoke to the Secretary General of the UN, Kofi Annan, on Monday. I asked him how he felt matters had developed and he informed me he had spoken to the Security Council which had done preparatory work on what way it would be involved in post-war Iraq. The UN has a special role in this regard. It has special experience and expertise in some areas, although not all. Kofi Annan said the UN had to be cautious about taking on things it would not be able to do or becoming involved in areas that would over-stretch it. The UN does not have any difficulties on the humanitarian issue in which it can become fully involved. It has enormous expertise through numerous UN organisations. Resolution 1472 which was successfully passed under the German chairmanship last Friday week is already <Col N="3" /> in place and allows NGOs and UN organisations to become fully involved. That is already taking place.</P>
      <P>Kofi Annan said the issue of political facilitation leading to the emergence of a new or interim administration is another area in which the UN has considerable expertise. He feels the best way to do this would be to adhere to the Afghanistan model where a UN nominee is involved. The UN has worked in partnership with many countries involved in Afghanistan. That is the preferred position. The UN does not wish to take over the entire operation on day one because it does not think that is feasible. It wants to work in partnership with the United States and the United Kingdom. The UN is, this week, working on the reconstruction programme and looking at what would be involved in setting up an administration which would include Iraqis from inside and outside with some assistance in the early stages. The reconstruction and normalisation of Iraq is a huge task. The UN must move from the oil for food programme to normality and it has the required expertise in this area which others do not have.</P>
      <P>I relayed that information to President Bush yesterday. Events were already moving on because the Secretary General, at the request of the President, had already announced Mr. Rafeeuddin Ahmed as the UN special envoy in this area and he commenced work last night with the Americans and the British. It is hoped, according to the last call I received late last night, that Kofi Annan will meet Prime Minister Blair in London tomorrow morning. The timing may change but that meeting should take place within the next 24 hours.</P>

      <P>Did the US President agree with what the Taoiseach relayed to him, following his conversation with Kofi Annan, that a nominee of the United Nations would work in partnership with the office for reconstruction and humanitarian assistance? Did President Bush say he was happy with that version of Kofi Annan's preference? Given the conflicting signs coming from President Bush and Prime Minister Blair, were the claims that this war was about oil raised with them? Was the issue raised that nothing should be done in terms of strategy for the use of oil resources in Iraq until such time as a democratic government elected by the Iraqi people is put in place? Was that point central to any of the discussions the Taoiseach had yesterday with the US President and the British Prime Minister? That claim has been made internationally and it would be important that in the overseeing of the administration and rebuilding of Iraq, that central issue should not be violated in any way.</P>

      <P>I had an opportunity yesterday to meet Mr. Blair and Mr. Bush for an hour. I told them what people were saying in this country and others. It is not my view, but I thought it was <Col N="4" /> an opportunity for me to put the case and I put it straight to them that people said this war was about oil, power, influence in the region&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;and trying to gain influence on Syria and Iran and the relationship with Saudi Arabia. I put all of the points to them because I had an opportunity to do so. President Bush robustly defends the position that the only thing the war is about is trying to give a future of liberation to the Iraqi people. He said the oil revenues will be for the Iraqi people and the development of Iraq and he looks forward to proving wrong those who are sceptical about his intentions. He outlined&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>On the other aspect mentioned by Deputy Kenny, Mr. da Silva will continue to act as the humanitarian co-ordinator, and he is in place now. He has that legitimacy under Resolution 1472. Mr. Ahmed's mandate is to work with the Secretary General and the Security Council. He does not have a role on the ground at present. I believe that will develop because President Bush said it will be in partnership. These things will not all happen over the next week or two. It will take some weeks but clearly the United Nations will have an involvement.</P>

      <P>I call Deputy Rabbitte.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach has dramatically watered down the position of the United Nations. I have not heard any statement from the United Nations that implies it would settle for what the Taoiseach has attributed to Kofi Annan. I will come back to that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When meeting President Bush, the Taoiseach took the opportunity to raise with him the horrific toll of civilian casualties. Did he tell the President about the revulsion of people in this country at the photographs of children, some of them without arms and some without access to hospital care as a result of this war? Is Deputy Kenny right? Did the Taoiseach ask President Bush whether <Col N="5" /> the horrific bombardment of civilian areas is coming to an end? Did he ask him if the American forces have found any evidence of the weapons of mass destruction that caused this war to be launched in the first place? What did the Taoiseach mean yesterday when, having been asked whether he would accede to a Labour Party call on him to tell the US President that the Irish people saw the war as illegal, he told <i>The Irish Times: </i>&ldquo;I have said from the outset I would be saying that so there is no need for people to remind me.&rdquo;  The Taoiseach sent his lawyers into court yesterday in the case before the High Court to say the opposite. Which is it?</P>
    <P>In terms of the United Nations, what is the Taoiseach's understanding of President Bush's response to Mr. Chirac's statement that it was up to the United Nations alone to take on the political, economic, humanitarian and administrative reconstruction of Iraq? What is the Taoiseach's understanding of that statement which implies that at least that major country, which I suspect is speaking for many in the United Nations, wants Iraq to become a UN protectorate? What is the response of Mr. Bush and Mr. Blair to that and does the Taoiseach side with the position of Monsieur Chirac or that of President Bush?</P>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I will try to answer all those questions. I urged the President and the Prime Minister to take every possible step to avoid civilian casualties and to do all they could to make sure humanitarian issues are observed in full. I gave an account of people's major concern about civilian casualties. They stated they have been making every effort in this war to keep civilian casualties to the lowest number possible. That is their position. I emphasised the immediate need to provide urgent treatment and care for the casualties of war. The position in the hospitals in Iraq is dire, and that is the word I used. I urged the President and the Prime Minister to provide field hospitals for the injured as a supplement to local hospitals. I received that information on humanitarian issues from the NGOs. I asked them to give serious consideration to that and the President said he thought it was a good idea. He did not think it was being done and he would relay it to the appropriate people. The President and Prime Minister told me how deeply conscious they are of the humanitarian needs of the Iraqi people. I recalled that Ireland had already pledged our resources which may be small in international terms but are considerable for a country of this size. We agreed that the humanitarian situation in Iraq must become the immediate priority as events move on.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is clear from my discussions that the war will not end in a day or two. Their assessment seems to be that it will take some more days, although that is a military call. Deputy Kenny did not say that the UN made a statement. I was asked yesterday for my assessment of what Kofi Annan said. My view was that he wanted to get into partnership and contact has already been made in the <Col N="6" /> period between my conversation with him and my meeting yesterday. He will be in London tomorrow and he will also visit some other countries. He will also meet with President Chirac.</P>
    <P>On the question of the legitimacy of the war, I gave a press conference the other day during which I answered questions. My position has not changed on the legitimacy of the war. The position was not agreed in the Security Council and until an international body or the UN calls the war illegal, my position is that I am not calling the war illegal. There are difficulties because of what happened in the UN but that position remains the same.</P>
    <P>On the Secretary General's view, it is not the position of the Secretary General now that the United Nations can come in and take over the entire operation of Iraq and put in place local government, engineering services and a government and reconstruct Iraq on its own. That is not the position of the United Nations. Its position is that it believes it can play a useful role. On the humanitarian aspects, it can play a total role. In the other area, the words used to me were the political facilitation leading to the emergence of a new or interim administration. That is what the Secretary General is anxious to get in on and he wants to be in partnership &ndash; I am using his words, not mine &ndash; with Prime Minister Blair and President Bush. I put that position, using precisely the same words, to President Bush and he strongly stated, and Prime Minister Blair agreed, that that was his intention and that was how it would work out. I want to be clear about this. It is not a question of America and the UK leaving Iraq at the end of the war. They will work in partnership with the UN and, hopefully, other countries. That is their clear intention.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>The United States and the United Kingdom are members of the UN. Therefore the issue is, what does President Bush mean when he says that there will be a vital role for the UN? What does &ldquo;the UN in partnership with the US and the UK&rdquo; mean? They are either members of it or not. Having regard to the damage done to the world order by this war and having regard to the hostility in the region to the United States, surely the United Nations is the appropriate body to head up the reconstruction of Iraq?</P>
      <P>Did the Taoiseach bring to the attention of the President of the United State the concern about the targeting of a hotel where journalists were reporting the war? Three journalists were killed yesterday, bringing the number of journalists killed to 12 in all. Yesterday a US general said that if journalists wanted to be protected they could be embedded. Did the Taoiseach protest to the President of the United States about journalists being targeted in this war?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Who will deliver the food programme? Who will deliver the medicines to the hospitals? Through which agencies will they be distributed? If the supposed excuse for the launching of this war was the threat of weapons of mass destruc<Col N="7" /> tion, did the President of the United States give the Taoiseach any reason to believe that such weapons have been uncovered?</P>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>On the procedural point, the Secretary General has stated to me that it will be the Security Council that will mandate a UN role post-conflict. He is proceeding in co-operation with the two gentlemen. The envoy, Mr. da Silva, is working on the humanitarian issue. The resolution that applies in that regard is Resolution 1472. Therefore that aspect of it is already being dealt with. The German chairmanship brought that through last Friday week.</P>
      <P>On the other aspect, there is no resolution yet. The purpose of the meetings Kofi Annan is having with the regions &ndash; he met the regional leaders last week and on Monday he met, in private session, his own people just after I was talking to him &ndash; is to bring his position around. Presumably that will lead to a Security Council resolution, but that has not happened yet and, I presume, will not happen until after his meetings &ndash; he intends to go to Moscow, Paris, London and other venues today, tomorrow and Friday.</P>
      <P>I stressed the concern of the Irish people, and I stated it the last time I was at an EU meeting. I expressed the same view about the civilian casualties and the targeting of areas where there did not seem to be a military presence. I made that point and, as I said earlier, the President said that they had been endeavouring to take care of civilian targets. Obviously that is not a view people would share when they see some of the incidents that have happened.</P>
      <P>Deputy Rabbitte also asked about weapons of mass destruction. There are a number of ongoing examinations into products that have been found. I did not get a definitive answer that they had been proved to be weapons of mass destruction.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent" hpid="Mr. Sargent Mr. Sargent">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
      <P>Has the Taoiseach had time to reflect on the Government's position regarding overflights of this country by US military aircraft in light of historical facts and the horrific outcome of the invasion of Iraq, including, as he said, taking care of civilian targets? Has he had time, since 20 March, to think again about his statement that Ireland has made overflights available to the United States for the past 50 years, and that it is factually and logically incorrect, according to the Minister for Foreign Affairs, for me or other Opposition spokespersons to suggest that the Government motion represents a departure from established policy?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="8" />Has the Taoiseach managed to study the details of what the past 50 years have brought about? In the 1950s, the then Minister for Foreign Affairs, Frank Aiken, stated that permission would be granted subject to the understanding that in the event of serious deterioration in the political situation in Europe or the Middle East, its authorisation would lapse. Former Deputy Peter Barry, Minister for Foreign Affairs in the 1980s, stated that clearance is not granted where troop-carrying aircraft is on route to military exercises. More recently, in 1989, the former Minister for Foreign Affairs, the late Brian Lenihan, repeating the criteria, stated that the aircraft must not carry arms, ammunition or explosives. In light of that, does the Taoiseach recognise that, far from being a reiteration of long-standing policy, this is a clear departure from long-standing policy and that the motion put before us by the Government was an attempt to mislead this House because clearly heavy military equipment is overflying this State and the Government needs to reflect on its position?</P>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Guidelines are laid down and the understanding of the American administration is that those guidelines are fulfilled, that heavy equipment is not carried in overflights. Last week I had an opportunity of talking to the German Chancellor, Gerhard Schröder, who has taken an anti-war position, as everybody will be aware. Most of the heavy equipment is moving through his jurisdiction. I think he resents the fact that people have been criticising him because he has several thousand troops involved in the protection of bases and in the facilitation of the movement of this heavy equipment. While he has been against the war and has taken the same view in the UN as we did, he has done all he can to facilitate the movement of this equipment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Boyle</NameTxt>
      <P>What about targeting civilian areas?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>On the civilian aspect, I stress that yesterday I genuinely put the case that the US and the UK need to take every single step they can, understanding that these are military operations, to avoid civilian casualties and to do the utmost to continue to observe the highest standards in this regard. Since they are using modern technology and they are engaged in targeting, they should be able to do better on that.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>What about the cluster bombs?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I made that point very strongly yesterday.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent" hpid="Mr. Sargent Mr. Sargent">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Taoiseach is not changing his position, it appears that he agrees that the <Col N="9" /> motion mislead the House because the situation has changed. The C130s that overfly this country are not carrying cotton wool. They are huge planes that are designed to carry large amounts of military equipment. If the Taoiseach thinks that they do not carry military equipment, he is misleading himself.</P>
      <P>Will the Taoiseach agree to a debate on the unfolding situation in Iraq? In <i>The Guardian</i> today, Mr. James Woolsey, the former director of the CIA and the man proposed by the Pentagon to head up the Ministry of information in Iraq, clearly states that this is not a short war and that it will not be over soon. He states that it is more than a war against terrorism, that this is a war to extend democracy to those parts of the Arab and Muslim world that threaten the liberal civilisation that the US worked to build and defend. He states that that will probably take decades.</P>
      <P>In light of the game plan that is unfolding, given that the toe is in the door in Iraq, is it not the case that the Government needs to seriously state and debate its position in this House? It is not a question of where we stand simply on the invasion of Iraq or on overflights, it is a matter of deciding how we go forward as a supposedly neutral country in the face of a plan that will take decades to implement.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>If there were a grand plan for the USA to take over the Middle East &ndash; to follow the war in Iraq with invasions of Iran, Syria and Saudi Arabia &ndash; we would need to consider these issues. I made that point yesterday. However, I do not think there is any such intention.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 1 to 3, inclusive, together.</P>
      <P>I indicated in my reply to Questions Nos. 1 to 5 of 13 November 2002 that the working group on basic income finished its work in March 2001. The group examined the broad implications of the introduction of a basic income. The work contributed to the development of the Green Paper on basic income, which was published in September 2002. With the publication of the Green Paper, my Department's role in this matter has concluded.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Taoiseach aware that many groups working with the poorer sections of the community have criticised the agreement, saying that it does not really do anything to alleviate poverty? According to some of these groups, the numbers of children living in poverty equate to the populations of many of our larger towns combined. After six years in office, how does the Taoiseach react to comments such as these? Is he happy that what he is now putting in place will do anything to alleviate this?</P>
      <P>According to the analysis produced by Teagasc, the average income of full-time farmers is now between 50% and 25% lower than the average industrial wage. How does the Taoiseach react to that? Can he put in place any measures to deal with that statistic?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>In reply to the Deputy's first question, I do not accept the case that is being made. The figure for consistent poverty available when the national anti-poverty strategy, NAPS, was published some years ago was 15% of the population. In the last year for which figures are available, this had fallen to just over 6%. In practical terms, this means that about 400,000 people have been lifted out of poverty. Those are the figures based on criteria that I did not set down. The first NAPS in which consistent poverty was measured defined poverty as both a lack of income and a lack of resources. The arguments that have been made recently do not take account of these figures. Admittedly, the figures are about two years old, so the situation may have improved or deteriorated since then, but the Deputy's argument does not stand up.</P>

      <P>Will the Taoiseach comment on the status of the national children's play strategy, which was to be published by the Minister of State with responsibility in this area, Deputy Conor Lenihan? The Minister of State said that he hoped to obtain Government finding to implement the plan in recognition of the fact that many local authorities have not provided physical play space for children. Will financial assistance be given so that the plan can be implemented? Play is an important element of social development and the emotional and mental well being of <Col N="11" /> children, who are too often confined to areas in which there is no space to play.</P>

      <P>The Green Paper on basic income was published in September 2002, six months ago, and the Government has done absolutely nothing to encourage debate on this important issue, which has far-reaching implications. Does the Government intend to instigate a public debate on the matter, or was the Green Paper just a sop to one of the groups taking part in the talks? Was it simply convenient for the Government to carry out the study at that stage? Did it intend to let it lie on the shelf after its publication?</P>
      <P>In the meantime, many of the underlying aspirations in the area of basic income could be achieved through a significant increase in minimum wage and in welfare payments and control of inflation, which is eating into living standards and creating great difficulty for those on lower incomes. Is it not the case, however, that the policies of this Government, such as cutting corporate tax massively and adding to inflation, have created more problems for people in difficult circumstances rather than alleviating the problem?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>It is neither true nor fair to say that no debate has been generated. In the past few months, not just CORI but many organisations have actively put forward their views. The working group under the original social partnership model in the Department of Finance, which is considering tax and social welfare measures, is taking the Green Paper into account, although it has not yet reported. It has also been discussed at trade union conferences. The arguments continue about whether the aspirations are worthwhile or possible, but the debate is lively. The tax credit group has also been considering this issue. I cannot say at this stage where this will go, but it is not true to say that there is no debate among those who care about these issues.</P>
      <P>When I published the Green Paper I had finalised my position, but other Ministers have taken it up. I have also spoken about it in the social partnership process and I have discussed it with the other parties. If we are to achieve the aspirations set out in the Green Paper the issue must be dealt with under the tax and social welfare groupings. I am not sure when the working group is to report as it is not the responsibility of my Department, but I know it is still working on it and has taken into account not only the Green Paper but also the reports of other working groups.</P>

      <P>The Green Party welcomes the fact that a guaranteed basic income is under discussion, but it is necessary to have far more discussion, given that the Green Paper vindicates our view that guaranteed basic income would have a far more positive impact on reducing poverty than the present tax and welfare system and would also encourage people to move from the unofficial economy into regular employment.</P>
      <P>Taking into account the widening gap between rich and poor and the finding that this system of redistribution of wealth has a positive impact on that, will the taxation study currently being carried out take account of figures that have been released since the Green Paper was published? A tax of 47.7% was mentioned in the Green Paper, but my figures show that since then the estimate has changed to 43%. Notwithstanding this, will consideration be given to a different type of taxation system, in which taxes on finite resources, energy and so on would replace taxes on labour in some cases? This would represent a progressive change in taxation as well as distribution of wealth, which would contribute to a more sustainable economy and society overall.</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I assume the up-to-date rate would be used. Deputy Sargent is right on the figures used in the report. That work had gone on over a number of years and the international studies used figures that were a few years out of date. They have also taken account of the EU Commission's concerns for social protection in Europe and many aspects relating to tax and welfare that arise from that. I am not up to date on where they are in that report. This morning I checked to find out when that report is to be published and while I have not an answer, I can let the Deputy know if I get it.</P>
      <P>The main issue is that of basic income. I was asked to take a study of a particular position. It would replace the existing social welfare, PRSI and personal taxation systems. It would replace the rates and the credits with a standard weekly payment for all citizens, with possibly different rates for children and for those of certain ages, not necessarily pensioners. All income earned other than the basic income would be taxed at a flat rate. All the studies and work were based on that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The debate has not really moved away from that, but it could. It allows itself to be modified. There has been much work done by the European social group on these areas. It would be an enormous change and we have changed our tax system considerably in the past five or six years. Even some of those who were in favour of the studies and the work surrounding it have different views. It has to be discussed and analysed by many people. While I would not consider myself qualified to call it, I believe it is workable. I remember the argument, when I was in the Department of Finance, of those who told me that what is now our system of tax credits would be a horrendous job &ndash; they did not say it was <Col N="13" /> not workable. As that is now fully implemented it indicates these things are workable. However, the plusses and minuses require enormous analysis.</P>
    <P>I produced a report, which examined this fully but did not make recommendations because that was not its intention. Although it is not world news, there are many groups who care a lot about this and are studying it &ndash; we will have to see what happens over the course of the year. It will then feed into the group at the Department of Finance.</P>

Fr. Seán Healy and CORI have as much prospect of getting the Government to agree to a basic income as I have of flying to the moon. Will the Taoiseach put us all out of our misery on this and ask the Minister for Social and Family Affairs to devote herself to defending the interests of the poor whose communities are being ravaged by 1,000 hidden cuts? Why is the Taoiseach dismantling the community employment scheme, which will undermine so much useful community activity in disadvantaged areas?

      <P>I had to read back over what was said. In preparing to answer parliamentary questions my officials kindly give me a copy of the last debate. I have debated this issue for a number of years with Deputy Sargent in the House, even before the research had been carried out. As I said on 13 November to Deputy Rabbitte, the same view was taken some years ago when I answered questions about whether we would have a minimum wage, whether we would try to get those on the minimum wage out of the tax net and whether we would introduce a tax credit system. Many people &ndash; although Deputy Rabbitte was not one of them &ndash; said we would never rationalise our tax system, but would continue to be a high tax rate country and to have all the difficulties with poverty traps, unemployment and labour market issues. However they are all gone, which indicates things move on.</P>
      <P>The Deputy is right in saying that my part in this is completed. The matter is with a sub-committee on finance. It is well worth reading, as I did over the weekend, the comments of the Minister for Social and Family Affairs, Deputy Coughlan, on EUROSTAT and the social insurance infrastructure given in reply to a parliamentary question on 27 March, which also feed into this.</P>
      <P>I look forward to this issue being progressed. We should not think that nothing ever changes. All of us here have a job to promulgate things that change. I know Deputy Rabbitte forgot to congratulate me for bringing in the minimum wage, for which he used to fight so hard and which people also said was impossible.</P>

      <P>The Deputy is making the point about giving people in general a decent living. The Government has made the commitment in the programme that by 2007 the minimum rate would be &euro;150. There are initiatives to try to take the lowest paid out of the tax net. This year those at the lowest end benefited most, which is as it should be. We should continue to pursue those policies each year because it is only over a number of years that we will make an impact on those at the lower end of the market.</P>

      <P>Deputy Kenny is right that the best way to deal with poverty is to create jobs. That has the best effect on people in the poverty net. Our policies are designed to try to maintain employment. Even in a difficult time, we are keeping employment as high as possible. Obviously, if unemployment rises, it affects the figures. Many of the measures we have introduced over the years are designed to assist people when there is unemployment. I hope we will not return to high unemployment. Unemployment has risen and it will probably rise during this year given what is happening internationally. I cannot envisage us totally bucking that trend although we have been doing it better than most over the past year. When that happens it obviously puts pressure on the welfare budget because when people are unemployed the Minister for Social and Family Affairs must provide resources for them. That is what generates budgetary pressure. It is inevitable when people lose jobs and competitiveness.</P>

If the other supports which exist are withdrawn by the Government, as they are being withdrawn for community partnerships, single mothers groups, breakfast clubs for school children, homework clubs and so forth, or if their level of payment is not increased at the same time, raising the basic income means nothing and the poor will continue to suffer.</P>

      <P>I will take up the points the Deputy has made and pass them along to the working group. I have completed my work on this in my Department. It has moved to the tax and welfare working group. I am aware the group is taking the up to date figures into account. I do not know about the energy tax issue because there is a European dimension to it and it is still with ECOFIN. I understand the Greek Presidency wishes to reach a conclusion on that. I will bring the other points made by the Deputy to the group's attention. However, this report has moved away from my Department to the working group under the Department of Finance. Obviously, the Department of Social and Family Affairs has an interest in it too but the Department of Finance chairs that working group and that is where the report is.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 4 and 5 together.</P>
      <P>A total of 985 requests were received in my Department between April 1998 and 4 April 2003. Of these, 297 were granted, 244 were part granted, 60 were transferred to other Departments, 70 were withdrawn, 117 were refused, no records were held in respect of 172 cases and there are 25 cases ongoing. All requests received in my Department are processed in accordance with the Act and its implementation in my Department is kept under constant review. I see no reason to change the process for dealing with FOI requests in my Department as the present system is working well.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny" hpid="Mr. Kenny Mr. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>If the present system is working well why is it necessary to introduce restrictions on access to information? Will the Taoiseach explain why 117 cases were refused? Is it not a clear case of the Government introducing amendments to the Act to save themselves embarrassment because people might find out the reasons certain papers were prepared leading to Government decisions?</P>
      <P>The Freedom of Information (Amendment) Bill, when enacted, will increase the range of records which can be designated as Government records. This has been described by the Information Commissioner as loose and unclear. Will the Taoiseach explain by what process such committee records will be excluded from the FOI process in practice? Since such designations are to be made by the Secretary General to the Government, will the Taoiseach be accountable to the House for decisions made in that context? Will the Taoiseach answer here for those decisions which will have a serious effect on the public's access to information?</P>
      <P>Will this change mean that the work of cross-departmental committees, such as the committees dealing with infrastructure and deregulation, both of which are under the aegis of the Taoiseach's Department, will be excluded? Will the Taoiseach be answerable in such cases where, for instance, the work or records of both of those cross-departmental committees under the aegis of his Department will be excluded? Will the Taoiseach confirm that he will answer to the House in the event of any such decision being taken?</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The reason we are sticking with the system in the Department is that it works well under the existing Act. Obviously, the reason 117 cases were refused was either that they did not concern information or they did not comply with the Act. I have no particular difficulty with the Act and will continue to work with it as amended. While I am not entering into a debate about the Bill now, I will continue to provide information about questions concerning travel, subsistence, entertainment, expenses, use of the Government jet, communications between Ministers and chairmen or chief executives of State agencies, staff employed as political advisers, payments made to public relations and advertising firms, staff employed in Ministers' constituency offices, cost of photographic services to Ministers, expenditure by Departments on refurbishment of offices, correspondence between Ministers and lobby groups, NGOs, appointments to State boards, briefing material prepared for Ministers for interviews, ministerial advisory committee meetings and licences issued by Ministers. All that information, and other information I provide, will continue to be provided.</P>
      <P>In so far as I answer for cross-departmental groups, there are limitations on those questions at the moment and the same will apply in future. Thankfully, however, we will have changed from the position of the deliberative process. In my view, that was a mistake in the first place. When a Government is in the process of dealing with a case, working under the Constitution by way of collective Cabinet responsibility, that work goes from one meeting to another and can sometimes take several weeks. It is a ludicrous system to have a debate when documents are coming out and the entire issue is in the public domain. It runs counter to the idea of collective responsibility under the Constitution, and thank God that will be changed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>I am perplexed because the Taoiseach says he has no particular difficulty with the Act. For a number of months we have been fighting the Government's intention to amend the Act to the point where the public's right to public information is being restricted or cut off. Access to information is being denied and the public will now be charged for the privilege of finding out whether they can be given the information.</P>

      <P>The Taoiseach would have got a job in Napoleon's cabinet because he is a lucky politician. The terrible events surrounding the war in Iraq have buried the fact that the Government has filleted the Freedom of Information Act. In his quieter moments, when he is reading up on basic income over the weekend, has he any regrets about savaging the Freedom of Information Act? Does he not think that it will come back to haunt him? The journalists who are affected have not been writing much about it, although sometimes it is very hard to figure out why journalists write what they do and why they do not write other things, but that is not for us to wonder about. Does the Taoiseach not consider that the attempt he has made to exclude journalists and the Opposition from probing Government decisions might be a watershed for the Government?</P>

He has listened to what has been said in the House on the Bill and those amendments will go through today.</P>
      <P>Deputy Rabbitte asked if I considered that the Bill has been filleted? I do not. The high level group has looked at it and it has put forward a few amendments. I do not believe they are earth-shattering. I do not want to go back over the ground that has been covered. In the Civil Service users group network, academics, journalists and others frequently give views on it. I have no particular problem with it.</P>

    <P>Deputy Kenny said that if I brought a draft memorandum to Cabinet, that people would not find out about it now.

    <P>I have no difficulty with the Act. I wish to make a point about the Act, which I have made here <Col N="25" /> on several occasions, and the amendments that will go through the House today will not change it. It is a long time since I first sat at a Cabinet table and I have been familiar with how the system operates for a long time. What is gone &ndash; and the amended Bill will make no difference in this regard &ndash; is the system whereby that years ago one got a file from a Department along with the manuscript notes of civil servants setting out their views and different arguments. One does not get that anymore. There was some examination into that to the effect that this is not the case, but as Taoiseach I can tell Members it is the case. It is a sad day that we lost that, but so be it.</P>

      <P>There is one proposal to be put to the House. Is the proposal for dealing with No. 18, the conclusion of Report and Final Stages of the Freedom of Information (Amendment) Bill 2003 agreed to?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>No, it is not agreed to. This is an ill thought out measure. It was not included in the programme for Government. There has not been adequate consultation on it. Some 85 amendments are tabled for discussion today and there is no conceivable way Members of the House can have an opportunity to debate this matter thoroughly, as would be in the public interest. This amounts to a cynical exercise by Government, which is ramming through these amendments by guillotine today in a hypocritical fashion to save itself embarrassment from the public having the right to access to information leading to Government decisions. I object to this in the strongest possible terms. It is a denigration of the rights of Members of the House who represent the public to assume that we can get through 85 amendments between now and 7 p.m. this evening. This is a nonsense. The proposal is ill thought out and it did not involve any consultation. It amounts to arrogant and contemptuous treatment of the House by Government, and I object to it.</P>

      <P>I repeat remarks in all seriousness that I made earlier, that I regret that what has happened here has not received the attention and analysis in the media, which it ought to have, because of greater events. What is being done here is a disservice to democracy. Journalists will live to rue the day. The character of our democracy will be less healthy as a result. We have not taken up a position of opposition to reviewing the efficacy of the Freedom of Information Act. We are quite amenable to doing that. We offered to freeze frame the existing legislation for one year to give an opportunity to take in public, evidence from users of the Act about its operation. What has the Government to hide that it is fearful of hearing expert evidence in public on how the Act is performing and what hitches, if any, there are and what changes need to be made? This is a bad day's work in this House. I hope people will remember it for the Government. As Deputy Kenny said, there are 85 amendments tabled and amendments have been guillotined at all Stages. We will continue to oppose this Bill brought in by the Government at every Stage, including this Stage.</P>

      <P>The Green Party, An Comhaontas Glas, also opposes the proposal for dealing with No. 18. This reminds us again of the undemocratic way this legislation came into being, which lack of democracy has been compounded by the proposed guillotining of Second, Committee and <Col N="27" /> Report Stages. It is a disgraceful admission on the Government's part that it has brought in legislation without consultation and now wants to dispense with normal democratic procedures to the greatest extent possible by guillotining all Stages. I support Deputies Kenny and Rabbitte and I ask the Government to look at this issue again and pull back from this, albeit at the eleventh hour. It is clear the Taoiseach himself is regretting the end of the halcyon days when notes could be passed around without being disclosed but that was not in the interest of public accountability. The Government should look at where its interests lie if it is to be genuinely democratic.</P>

      <P>Sinn Féin cannot agree to the Order of Business. Report and Final Stages of this so-called amending legislation will be run though in four and a half hours, at best, before 7 p.m. The Committee Stage took four full days and still did not conclude, with amendments still outstanding. All the salient arguments to be made about each amendment are now to be contracted into four and a half hours.</P>
      <P>Let there be no question or doubt about it &ndash; this amending legislation is being rushed through in order to facilitate the Government which has been in place since 1997. The Taoiseach said earlier the Act is working well in his Department and that he saw no reason to change it. There is no reason to change it because the substantive Act is regarded internationally as a template for best practice. It is hard to comprehend why we are now returning to the days of secrecy and veiled decision-making. This Bill goes against the ethos of the 1997 Act and accordingly, even at this late stage, I hope the Taoiseach sees the light and withdraws the legislation entirely.</P>

      <P>The Bill has obviously attracted a great deal of attention. It was debated for 27 hours in the Seanad and for three days on Second Stage in this House. The debate on Committee Stage went on for four days and included some of the longest days in the session, including today. It is therefore not factual to say the Bill has been rushed. Since the introduction of the Act in 1998, the FOI legislation has played an important part in promoting openness and will continue to do so. After four years, a number of issues needed to be addressed and the high level group set up by the Government focused on the integrity of the Cabinet's deliberative process in ensuring an appropriate level of transparency and openness in the public interest. It is not true to say the high level group did not consider the views of others, which were well outlined by the Government side.</P>

It provides for confidentiality on decisions or discussions in Cabinet without time limits.

Such decisions were made for the right reasons. They were the right decisions and every Member knows them.</P>

On two separate occasions, this week and three weeks ago, I asked the Tánaiste whether those major amendments, which I understand have come before the Cabinet, would be circulated to Members prior to the commencement of Second Stage. She assured me they would be circulated.

It is appropriate to have a general debate on Second Stage initially, when the Minister will outline his changes to the Bill. The position has changed and developed as we moved along.

      <NameTxt>Ms Burton</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That Dáil Éireann, pursuant to Standing Order 128 of the Orders Relative to Public Business, directs that the Freedom of Information (Amendment) Bill, 2003 [<i>Seanad</i>] in whole be recommitted to a Committee of the whole House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On behalf of the Labour Party, I wish to ask that the Bill, in its entirety, be recommitted. In the course of Committee Stage last week, I asked that the committee be suspended to allow Opposition parties to obtain legal advice on the new amendments introduced with little notice by the Minister for Finance. The Labour Party is objecting, in particular, to sections 13 and 14 of the Bill as it now stands. Those sections deal with the creation of Government committees and deliberations which will now be subject to certificates by Secretaries General of Departments. The extended definition of Government is a unique <Col N="40" /> expansion of the notion of constitutional Government in Ireland. We will no longer be in a position to know the names of those in Government who are on these committees &ndash; we now understand it may be Ministers and Ministers of State, civil servants or advisers and any other person or body so designated. We are to have secret Government membership in this country.</P>
    <P>Secretaries General will certify deliberations and we are not to know their title as provided for in this extended and expanded notion of Government. The Labour Party is concerned that we were not allowed to suspend the Committee Stage debate to seek legal advice on the matter. The only recourse now open to citizens and interested groups will be to petition Uachtarán na hÉireann with a view to asking her to meet with the Council of State to seek its advice on this new and dangerous expansion of the notion of Government which is completely absent from and foreign to our Constitution as it stands.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the move to recommit this Bill. The Taoiseach tried to make a virtue of the fact that we had a 24 hour Committee Stage debate. The reason the debate went on for so long was that the Minister for Finance stonewalled on every constructive amendment put forward by the Opposition. This is, as Deputy Kenny said, deeply flawed legislation. It was not contained in the programme for Government or any of the manifestos. No mandate was secured for it and no consultation occurred about its content. The Information Commissioner was deliberately denied an opportunity to discuss it. There would have been no consultation but that the Oireachtas took matters into its own hands and, through the Committee on Finance and the Public Service, gave a small number of people the opportunity to raise concerns.</P>
      <P>The Government is trying put through this legislation in a jackboot manner. The Bill is not, as the Government would try to make out, about better governance. It is solely about Ministers trying to escape the obligations under which they entered into Government, namely, that there would be an examination of the decisions it made after five years. That solemn piece of accountability was written into legislation. Now, with the examination opportunity drawing near, the Government wants to run away from its obligations. This is all about Ministers trying to save their hides. It is bad for citizens who should not have to sacrifice their right to information to protect weak-kneed Ministers who are unwilling to take their duties to the House and the public seriously.</P>

Regardless of the time spent on this Bill, it is the quality of the scrutiny in which we have been allowed to participate that matters. We are now moving to Report <Col N="41" /> Stage of this Bill but discussion on it has been nothing less than an exercise by Government to deny the opportunity for full and open scrutiny. The best example of that has already been illustrated by the very real constitutional concerns expressed by Opposition spokesperson on this Bill.</P>
      <P>It was not good enough to be told by the Minister on Committee Stage that he had received advice from the Attorney General and was satisfied about the matter without Members having been told what that advice was. The failure to respond to the Opposition's request that the parliamentary legal adviser to the committee be made available diminishes our role as legislators. I ask you, a Cheann Comhairle, to ensure that such requests are responded to adequately by the Government and the appropriate legal officers.</P>

      <P>I, too, support the proposal to recommit this Bill. As I said earlier to the Taoiseach, this so-called amending legislation runs totally contrary to the ethos of the substantive Bill introduced in 1997. It pushes back the situation from best practice which has been acknowledged in other jurisdictions to the old days of secrecy and veiling over decision-making by Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The argument has been repeatedly made by the Minister and others that the existing legislation was an impediment to good government. At no time, despite the repeated challenges of Opposition Deputies, has a single instance been cited <Col N="42" /> of how the Freedom of Information Act 1997 curtailed the processes of government. No evidence has been presented to stand up that particular claim. It is imperative this legislation be withdrawn even at this late hour. I join with Deputies in making that appeal.</P>
    <P>This Government stands accused of exercising its power here to cover up the decision-making processes since 1997 when it was first returned to power. That is the reality and is what people believe. Earlier this morning, the Taoiseach remarked that he saw no reason to change things &ndash; he was speaking about the workings within his Department. He should apply the same response to the existing legislation. There is no need to change it. He should allow the 1997 Act to stand and the amending legislation should now be withdrawn.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 2:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="45" />In page 5, between lines 7 and 8, to insert the following:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;1.&ndash;The provisions of this Act shall not commence until the Information Commissioner has conducted a review of the Act under section 36 of the Principal Act and thereafter different sections may be commenced by the Minister as appropriate.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The purpose of this amendment is to seek a delay in the implementation of the various sections of this Bill until the Information Commissioner has had the opportunity of conducting a review, as is his statutory right under section 36 of the Freedom of Information Act 1997. I seek this because in this Bill the Government has attempted to turn back the clock. For years now, we have been attempting to embrace openness in the way in which we transact our business in the Dáil, greater openness in Government and a commitment that citizens are participants in this decision making process. As a result, citizens have a right to information about decisions made in their name. It improves the quality of decision making if Ministers know that in five years they will be accountable for their decisions. That makes them more concerned about ensuring that the decisions they take are defensible, that they consider more widely all the ramifications of their decisions and that they take decisions in a more mature and reflective way. That is good for the public, the Oireachtas and the country as a whole.</P>
    <P>Now the Government comes in here with a Bill for which it sought and received no mandate from the people. It was not listed in its programme for Government. There was no opportunity for the public to be consulted about this dramatic legislation. There was no opportunity for public debate. It is indeed a step back to the old ways. It has heard nothing, seen nothing and learned nothing over the years. We have had numerous tribunals drawing to the attention of the Oireachtas the problems of secrecy in the way business is done. The Government introduced this Bill at five minutes to midnight. The obligation to be accountable comes upon it on 21 April and it is trying to step back from that obligation.</P>
    <P>Not only has there been no consultation, but the Government is attempting in this Bill to throw the veil of secrecy far more widely than we have ever seen it. It wants to redefine Government to constitute a group of people who may not even be officials employed by the State. Once these groups are certified they become similar to the Cabinet and have the full protection of secrecy afforded to them. This is an unprecedented move. It has also reversed the presumption of openness which was at the core of the original Freedom of Information Act. At the core of that Bill is that information should only be denied if it could be proved that harm would come from releasing it. The Government is now reversing that obligation. It is for those seeking information to prove there is benefit. Those making these <Col N="46" /> decisions will be freedom of information officers. The Government has also stitched caution into other areas. In future, freedom of information officers will have to consider not only the impact on their body, but on countless other bodies that might arguably be impacted on. It will embed a deeply conservative approach to freedom of information requests.</P>
    <P>At the heart of this we also see an attempt to re-balance &ndash; as the Government chooses to call it &ndash; the relationship between the Ministers and elected representatives, particularly backbenchers in this House. For example, in future we will be unable to see the briefings about Estimates when they are presented to this House. That was an opportunity for Members of the Dáil to see how Estimates were put together and what were the issues that would create difficulty for Ministers in accounting for the way they spend their money. This allowed Deputies to be sufficiently well informed to ask the right questions. Now the Minister is introducing a system whereby all briefings provided for Ministers will now be suppressed. When speaking on Estimates debates there will be no opportunity to see briefings unless Ministers want to release information. Difficult issues about which Ministers ought to be questioned will be suppressed as a result and the House will lose out.</P>
    <P>Similarly, the Government is trying to re-balance its relationship with the media, which had been clearly set out in the Freedom of Information Act. Members of the media have a right to ask questions and obtain information of national importance. Now, however, the media will increasingly be denied that access. By contrast, the Government with its 81 spin doctors will have the opportunity to set out and release information other than under the Freedom of Information Act in a way that reflects favourably on it. All of this is about strengthening the Executive at the expense of those of us who are elected here to hold it accountable and the media which also attempt to hold it accountable.</P>
    <P>The Government is unwittingly, as far as the Minister is concerned, creating a charter for weak-willed spineless Ministers. We are told by the Government that if Ministers had to account for their decisions five years after those decisions were taken, this would totally undermine collective responsibility. We are led to believe that citizens must sacrifice their right to information so that Ministers will take their obligations seriously to put into memoranda their views about a decision that is coming up. This is ludicrous. If such Ministers exist &ndash; none has been identified yet &ndash; who are suppressing information due to the fear that it will be shown in a bad light in five years' time and are not willing to put forward their views until they reach Cabinet because of this, they do not deserve to have the seal of office given to them by the President.</P>
    <P>This has nothing to do with better governance. We have not had a shred of evidence that any release of information damaged the process of <Col N="47" /> government. We asked the high-level group and the Minister to cite examples. The Minister scorned the idea that the officials would release such information and had no evidence to offer. This is a shot in the dark based on a belief that the Government will suffer if this is changed.</P>
    <P>In reality for the past five years, Ministers have been operating under an obligation to release information starting on 21 April 2003. The Government has not caved in during the past five years. Whatever criticisms we can level at it, the Cabinet has not ceased to function as a body that can make decisions. It may be making bad decisions, but it is not incapable of making decisions. There is not a shred of support among the public, informed academics or the Oireachtas at large for this change. The only support for this change comes from the 15 people who see their backsides being exposed by the fact that they have to become accountable on 21 April.</P>
    <P>This is bad legislation and my amendment seeks to have it deferred until the Information Commissioner can properly examine the operation of the Act and the impact of these sections. We should have a review and none of these changes should be introduced until that much wider consultation takes place.</P>

      <P>Members of the press, who are not present for this debate but may be listening to it, may feel that what will be said over the next four and a half hours will be a repeat of what was discussed on Second and Committee Stages. That will not be the case. In the course of Committee Stage which I believe is a record for this Dáil, Opposition Members having closely scrutinised the Bill for more than 20 hours, we learned a considerable amount from the Minister for Finance and from the two replacement Ministers who stepped into the committee during the time the Minister for Finance was in Greece. In particular, we learned that a number of the amendments tabled by the Minister on Committee Stage will make the Bill far worse than when it was first published a few weeks ago.</P>
      <P>The Information Commissioner in his report refers to the constitutional unrecognisability of the committee of officials and others who from now on, for the purposes of this Bill, constitute the Government of this State. On Committee Stage, the Minister added insult to injury by repeatedly confirming that the Government will consist as heretofore of Ministers and Ministers of State and will now include officials and advisers. While some advisers are extremely exalted and well qualified, some are essentially constituency managers for their Ministers. While some advisers come from the public service, others come purely from a party political background. They will now form part of the Government without let or hindrance and so will any other persons or group whom the Government chooses to so designate as forming part of Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="48" />In an amendment which I believe was intended to placate criticism of the Bill particularly from members of the Minister's party such as Senator Mansergh, an experienced public official and civil servant of the highest calibre, the Minister introduced, both in regard to what constitutes Government and Government deliberations, a new process of certification whereby the number of certificates will be published by Secretaries General in an annual report. However, there will be no necessity to disclose the titles, subject matter or membership of these committees of Government. In effect, for the first time since the British left this part of the country, we will once again have secret Government.</P>
    <P>The Labour Party wants this Bill to receive proper legal scrutiny at the highest level. This is why we have asked for the Bill to be suspended to allow a process of consultation to take place through the Office of the Information Commissioner in order that we can all stand back over a period of a year and consider at some length the very profound implications of the Minister's proposed changes.</P>
    <P>Debate adjourned.</P>

    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government has consistently condemned the practice of paramilitary &ldquo;exiling&rdquo; of people from their place of residence as an abuse of their human rights. The right of all citizens to freely choose where they wish to live is a fundamental right which has been recognised in the Good Friday Agreement. The breaching of this right by paramilitary groups is abhorrent and unjustifiable. I have frequently called on all political parties associated with paramilitary organisations to make every effort to get those organisations to desist and to ensure that all exiles, wherever they currently reside, can return safely to their homes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is a problem which affects both communities and the demand that such activity should cease applies to all paramilitary groups, both loyalist and republican. According to BASE 2, a crisis intervention service for individuals and families placed under paramilitary threat in Northern Ireland, republican paramilitaries have been responsible for one third, and loyalist paramilitary groups for some two thirds, of threats <Col N="49" /> over the past four years. Official security statistics also show that there has been a similar breakdown in terms of responsibility for punishment shootings and assaults in recent years.</P>
    <P>In seeking to end such practices, it is important that we also understand the context in which they have occurred. Over the past 30 years of conflict, such practices have mainly occurred within communities, both loyalist and republican, where a deep distrust of the police exists. As with other difficult issues we have had to address throughout the peace process, this can only be resolved satisfactorily by addressing all the causal factors. It is the Government's consistent position, therefore, that we can best tackle the problem of exiling and punishment attacks by working to end all paramilitary activities, by developing confidence in the rule of law and the administration of justice and by building community wide support for policing, particularly through the implementation of the Patten recommendations. In short, we can best tackle this problem through the full implementation of the Good Friday Agreement.</P>
    <P>Since last October, both Governments and the pro-Agreement parties have been intensively engaged in talks aimed at achieving the acts of completion necessary to fully and rapidly implement all aspects of the Agreement. Considerable progress has been made across a range of difficult issues in this regard. The Taoiseach and the Prime Minister will return to Hillsborough tomorrow to formally present their final set of proposals.</P>
    <P>Throughout these recent discussions and throughout this entire process we have had as our overriding objective a peaceful and fair society, enjoying stable government, normal policing arrangements and the fair and equitable administration of justice for the benefit of the entire community. There is no room in that vision for paramilitarism from any quarter of the community. If we are finally to see the fulfilment of the Agreement we must see all paramilitary activities brought to a definitive end. The practice of exiling must also come to an end and exiles must feel free to return in safety.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GayMitchell" hpid="Mr. G. Mitchell Mr. G. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it the Minister's expectation that there will be a radical IRA move signalling its complete cessation as an active paramilitary organisation following tomorrow's meeting? Will the Minister accept that in a normalised society there is no place for self appointed vigilantes administering their own perverted forms of justice, whether they are so-called loyalist or republican movements and whether that be through punishment beatings or the expulsion of people from communities under the threat of such beatings or worse? Will this issue be clearly addressed in the two Governments' proposals tomorrow and will the political parties and their military wings be asked to give clear pledges on these matters?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Does the Minister accept that the time has come for Sinn Féin, the only party refusing to <Col N="50" /> take its seats on the policing board, to take those seats and in this way contribute to the building of confidence in the new beginning for policing in Northern Ireland? With regard to building confidence in a new beginning, what discussions have been held with a view to minimising the potential for violence and disorder associated with the forthcoming marching season?</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to tomorrow, I cannot pre-empt or preface the outcome of discussions which are not yet in the public domain but will be shortly. The purpose of the detailed and intensive set of discussions and negotiations over the past five months has been to bring about a situation where the full, final and faithful implementation of the Agreement is set out in detail by both Governments and where acts of completion, as envisaged in the Taoiseach's and the Prime Minister's statements last October, are brought about. In that context, we want to see those acts of completion which give sufficient confidence and trust to the process to allow us to move in due course from a peace process to a peace settlement. From the Government's point of view, that work continues as we speak.</P>
      <P>With regard to vigilantism, these practices are not characteristic of a normalised democratic society and have no place in such a society. The purpose of the policing reforms and the criminal justice administration changes is to bring about a situation where both traditions give full affiliation and allegiance to a fair and equitable system of justice, administered equally to all citizens. One expects and hopes, therefore, that the proposals being devised by the Governments, as a result of the discussions with the parties, provide further trust and confidence that the vision for policing set out in the Patten report can become a reality in which a democratically accountable, representative police force will provide the necessary policing arrangements in a divided society.</P>
      <P>The Deputy asked a further question about policing. That is best secured when there is full representation of all the parties under the Patten arrangements on the policing board mechanism set out in the policing Acts enacted by Westminster.</P>
      <P>These decisions will be taken by parties in their own way, based on their consideration of the proposals to be devised and published by the Governments. I am hopeful that they will provide an enabling context in which all these matters can be constructively addressed in due course.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards the question about the marching season, one would hope that the developments we would all like to see arising from the work of the Governments and the parties will include: a restoration of the necessary trust and confidence; the provision of a context in which the pro-Agreement parties can competitively, but constructively, go to the electorate for support; and, in the aftermath of the assembly elections on 29 May, the restoration of the assembly and the full implementation of the Agreement in all its insti<Col N="51" /> tutional architecture. That will provide a stable background against which many of these marches can proceed without controversy or problems. In areas where there have been problems, one must emphasise the need for dialogue, understanding and real interaction between those who wish to march and the residents who do not give their consent to marches going through their communities. The consent principle must apply, therefore. If we approach all those issues creatively and constructively they are amenable to solution.</P>

      <Quest>if, on behalf of the Government and in view of the catastrophic consequences of the continuation of a war in Iraq, he will instruct Ireland's permanent representative at the United Nations to initiate a uniting for peace initiative in accordance with Resolution 377 of 3 February 2003 - Chapter V - to call an emergency session of the General Assembly to discuss the grave situation into which the world has been plunged; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government's understanding is that the Arab group at the UN, following a meeting of the non-aligned movement's co-ordinating bureau, has decided to raise the matter in the General Assembly. It appears that they propose to take this course of action rather than invoking the procedure established by General Assembly Resolution 377 of 3 November 1950. It is our understanding that there is no consensus among the non-aligned movement on whether to proceed with an initiative under Resolution 377. In the absence of such a consensus, any initiative by other parties would be unlikely to garner sufficient support to have a substantial impact on the current crisis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government takes the view that in the current crisis, it is important that any measures taken in the United Nations, or other international fora, <Col N="52" /> should hold the real prospect both of making a tangible contribution to resolving the crisis and rebuilding unity and cohesion within the United Nations.</P>
    <P>The Government hopes for the earliest possible conclusion of the conflict with the minimum loss of life. Our priority in the United Nations now must be to minimise the humanitarian impact of the conflict. We will consider any initiative that holds out a realistic prospect of achieving that goal.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand that on 31 March the Organisation of Islamic States made a proposal under UN Resolution 377 of 3 November 1950. I further understand that the Malaysian representative to the United Nations indicated that he would write to the Secretary General to seek a meeting of the General Assembly under Resolution 377. As the Minister has indicated in previous replies, such steps have been taken on ten previous occasions from Suez to the Israeli occupation of the Palestinian territories. In that context, and given the possibility that such a resolution may recur, was our representative at the United Nations approached concerning this matter? Was he specifically approached by the representative of the United States? Is the Minister aware that a communication has been put into the public realm concerning other states that were approached? It was suggested to them that the United States would not welcome this initiative.</P>
      <P>Would it not be positive to have a united peace initiative to ensure that the conflict does not spread to other countries, such as Indonesia and Malaysia, which between them have more than 400 million Muslim citizens? The peace initiative would also serve as a barrier to the extension of the declaration of war within and beyond the Middle East.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not aware of any such approach having been made to our UN representative. As I mentioned in my reply, this &ldquo;united for peace&rdquo; procedure has been used on approximately ten previous occasions. There was perhaps one occasion when the procedure resulted in a measure of success, which was the case of Suez. Taking the current situation, however, I am not sure to what extent declaratory debates on these matters in the United Nations would be effective, given that there is no consensus within the non-aligned movement. In any event, the proposal does not seem to have sufficient support. The Secretary General and the rest of us are trying to create a meaningful role for the United Nations in the present evolving situation. Rather than having a debate on yesterday's &ldquo;what if?&rdquo; agenda, which will be of interest in subsequent analyses of the situation, the pragmatic reality we are now dealing with concerns how to deal with the short-term humanitarian needs of the Iraqi people. The bottom line informing our policy is how we can help the Iraqi people in relation to <Col N="53" /> what appears to be a tilting of the conflict to the point where the regime is certainly losing its authority, based on what we have seen happening in Baghdad today. We still do not know what further pockets of resistance exist there and we have certainly not reached the end of this conflict but we still have to deal with the humanitarian requirements of the Iraqi people in the short-term.</P>
      <P>As the Taoiseach said when addressing these issues yesterday, we obviously have to seek a vital and central role whenever and in whatever fora we can. The Thesaurus has been exhausted as to what will be the UN's role but we want a role that will give the Iraqi people the prospect of democratic government under which the resources of the country will be used for the benefit of its people. Pending the end of the conflict, interim arrangements must be geared to bringing about such a situation as soon as possible, with the UN having a role for the purpose of legitimacy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>In his reply, the Minister has wandered somewhat from the substance of the question. Of course, I agree with him that we must concentrate on the provision of humanitarian relief. It is interesting that the joint statement issued in Northern Ireland did not indicate any corridors for such relief to be delivered, nor did it indicate a role for any of the United Nations' humanitarian organisations in relation to Baghdad. Being pragmatic and realistic, the same number of people are still dependent on food as before. The children and the institutions are still dependent as before but we did not hear anything about them in the statement. We can turn to those matters in subsequent questions.</P>
      <P>The Minister suggested that it is neither pragmatic nor realistic to speak of Resolution 377. However, that resolution of 3 November 1950, was moved in the knowledge that there was a danger that the veto would be used, thus rendering the Security Council impotent. In the current situation, the Security Council cannot, at the peril of destroying the United Nations, retrospectively regard an illegal act as being legal. Therefore, it surely behoves, if ever any circumstances did, the General Assembly to deal with the situation in which the United Nations now finds itself. The assembly should discuss the future of the region and obtain assurances that there will be no more illegal and non-authorised invasions in other jurisdictions. That would help to ease tensions in the Islamic world. I would have thought that the conditions are perfect for the &ldquo;united for peace&rdquo; resolution which, it is interesting to note, is supported by several other Governments as well as the Parliament of Thailand. In addition, it is supported by international women's organisations, churches and a number of countries, including some in Europe. I cannot understand what is holding Ireland back from supporting such an initiative.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>The problem is that the premise upon which Deputy Higgins pursues his argument is contended by those who are engaged in the military action. The Deputy suggests that this action is illegal and lacks a sufficient mandate but that argument is not accepted by the coalition forces which say they are acting on the basis of existing UN mandates. That is precisely the point. This is an argument that will continue to run. I am sure there will be plenty of interesting academic literature on this point as far as international legal experts and students are concerned in the immediate future and thereafter. What we must concern ourselves with is the reality on the ground as this situation evolves.</P>
      <P>I assure the Deputy that the question of humanitarian aid was raised by the Taoiseach with the United States President and with the British Prime Minister. It has been a consistent theme of this Government's approach and it is entirely consistent with our foreign policy traditions.</P>
      <P>As regards what we will do for the Iraqi people, their concerns are that the demise of this regime is completed as quickly as possible and that it should be replaced by a democratic, representative and properly constituted government for the people for Iraq where the resources of Iraq can be used for the benefit of Iraq. That is what the people of Iraq want. I will work with others to deal with that.</P>
      <P>As I said in my initial reply, I question whether debates in the UN, which by their nature would be divisive, would enhance a more meaningful role for the UN, which we all seek. We must make sure in our political debate, dialogue and discussions at EU, UN and every other level and by way of bilateral contracts that the objective, with which we all agree, is brought about as quickly as possible and that the role of the UN is brought to bear on that situation in as effective and meaningful a way as is possible.</P>

      <P>Surely the opinion of the General Assembly would be important in relation to the future of the UN.

      <P>I would tell the Organisation for Islamic States that the priority being accorded by this Government at this moment is the need for humanitarian relief within Iraq. I will give consideration to any proposal from any organisation within the United Nations, but I again make the point that I question the wisdom of further debates in the United Nations at this time as we try to ensure that it is brought back centre stage into this situation.</P>

      <Quest>if he will make a statement on his contacts with representatives of the United States Government in 2003 on the use of Shannon Airport by US military aircraft.</Quest>

    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>The arrangements whereby US military and civilian aircraft may refuel at Shannon have arisen at a number of meetings with representatives of the US Government since the beginning of the year. President Bush expressed appreciation for the Shannon facilities when he met the Taoiseach in Washington in March and he repeated this in Hillsborough yesterday. Secretary of State Mr. Powell and Ambassador Mr. Richard Haass, the US Administration's Special Representative for Northern Ireland, have both expressed their thanks in recent meetings with me.</P>
      <P>In view of Ireland's geographic location on the main flight path between North America and Europe, US aircraft for many decades have found Shannon a convenient location to touch down in Ireland. Following my meeting with the Ambassador Mr. Haass in February, he commented that the use of Shannon was particularly appreciated by the US because of its capacity and location.</P>
      <P>Officials of my Department maintain regular contact with the United States Embassy on a range of issues, including in relation to the use of Shannon. In January of this year, for instance, it was pointed out to the US authorities that the civilian charter airlines carrying US troops were obliged to seek the permission of the Minister of Transport to carry weapons, and ammunition connected with those weapons. Also, following discussion between my Department and the US Embassy in January, the embassy sought, and was granted, ministerial permission to wear duty uniform in the &ldquo;immediate vicinity of an arrival/departure area&rdquo;. Any requests for exceptions to this policy have to be submitted to my Department.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeHiggins" hpid="Mr. J. Higgins Mr. J. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister feel embarrassed and compromised that President Bush thanks him and the Government for facilitating the criminal invasion of Iraq, which in three weeks has had such devastating consequences for innocent Iraqi civilians and generally for that country? Does he agree that appealing to a 50 year precedent and the fact that this facility was available during the equally criminal invasion of Vietnam is not a moral justification for continuing something?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Were specific discussions requested by the United States Government with the Minister before the invasion was launched to tell him that the invasion was going to be launched and to seek the consent of the Government that the facilities would continue in what was an entirely new situation? Whereas the Government argued that before the invasion the facilities could be justified under Resolution 1441, once the invasion began that argument could no longer apply because the Government said that a second resolution was <Col N="56" /> necessary and, hence, the invasion had no legal authority. If the United States Government was so arrogant that it thought it could continue to use this State to progress its invasion, why did the Government not seek immediate meetings with it in order to object to the imperial venture that it was about to undertake and to threaten to withdraw the facilities?</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>Is that the end of the Deputy's question? As I outlined here previously, the decision the Government took on this matter was consistent with our foreign policy traditions and with the exercise of our military neutrality policy since it was initiated. That is entirely consistent with previous Government positions. Despite the Deputy's invective, I do not feel embarrassed. I am very proud to be a member of this Government, to be Minister for Foreign Affairs, to have the mandate of the people and to make decisions in the interests of the Irish people.</P>
      <P>The premise of the Deputy's argument suggests that it has been accepted in all circumstances that this has been an illegal action, a criminal invasion of Iraq and that we facilitated it. Successive Attorneys General advice has confirmed that we are not participating in this action. We are providing for the continuation of these facilities, as was the case in the past, which is entirely consistent with the policy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeHiggins" hpid="Mr. J. Higgins Mr. J. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I put it to the Minister that if he is not embarrassed, a large majority of the Irish people are embarrassed that the Government would facilitate this invasion. It is a duplicity on the part of the Government to deny any involvement. To refer to an analogy I made previously, if the people who came to plant the Dublin and Monaghan bombs were facilitated at a petrol station along the way with the knowledge of the petrol station owner as to what they were doing and where they were going, would the Government say that person had nothing to do with it? Under our law, would that person not be aiding and abetting and subject probably to the same charges of mass murder as those who left the car? What is the difference in facilitating bombers to blow children, women and men to bits as we saw in recent days?</P>
      <P>Now that the United States army of occupation is in Baghdad it is the intention of the Government to continue to facilitate the maintenance of that occupation? Lest we forget, this was a war allegedly to hunt down weapons of mass destruction? If the Minister woke up tomorrow morning not having known the details of the conflict and he heard that one side had killed 120 soldiers of the other side and had killed 20 to 30 times that number in civilians and conscripts, who would the Minister guess had the weapons of most destruction? Where are the weapons of mass destruction, the poison gas, the chemicals that was allegedly a threat to the United States and Britain?</P>

      <P>I will answer the question, however inappropriate some aspects of it are. In relation the question of weapons of mass destruction, we hope that whatever capacity is there is found. I am not so sure that we were supposed to find them by the end of 8 or 9 April. I did not know that was the requirement.</P>
      <P>There would be some situation if we had a dictator who subjected his own people to fear and impoverishment to control them and did not have weapons of mass destruction but used a sanction regime to control his own people for the past 12 years. That would be a pretty despicable act. Rather than getting involved in conjecture, we are in a situation where the conflict has not even ended yet. We have to await the outcome and see what develops. I make clear that the view of the Government is to do all we can to help with the humanitarian needs of the Iraqi people and to provide for representative government in Iraq as soon as possible.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs (Mr. Kitt)</NameTxt>
      <P>From the outset I have emphasised that the UN must play a central role in any humanitarian relief operation in Iraq. The UN has the authority to co-ordinate humanitarian responses world-wide and also has a substantial record of achievement in this area. The recent experience of the UN's role in East Timor clearly shows how strong a force for good the UN can be when its members act in a united manner and its work in Afghanistan has also been particularly valuable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The UN system includes a wide range of humanitarian agencies such as UNICEF, the World Food Programme and UNHCR, which have unparalleled experience in responding to natural and man-made emergencies throughout the world. The UN also works in close co-ordination with NGOs and other agencies. This collaboration has been very effective in the current <Col N="58" /> food crisis in southern Africa and can be effective in Iraq too.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach conveyed the Government's strong views on the critical importance of the UN role in Iraq in his meeting yesterday with President Bush and the Prime Minister Mr. Blair. The Deputy will be aware that in their joint press statement, the President and the Prime Minister made it clear that the United Nations &ldquo;has a vital role to play in the reconstruction of Iraq&rdquo;. They stated they plan to seek the adoption of new United Nations Security Council Resolutions that would affirm Iraq's territorial integrity, ensure rapid delivery of humanitarian relief and endorse an appropriate post-conflict administration for Iraq.</P>
    <P>They also welcomed the appointment by the Secretary General of a special adviser for Iraq. The Taoiseach has also written to the Secretary General of the United Nations and the President of the Security Council emphasising the concerns of Ireland about the humanitarian situation of the people of Iraq. The Taoiseach also requested regular humanitarian briefings from the Secretary General and his colleagues. In addition, in recent days the Taoiseach has spoken by telephone with the Secretary General on the importance of the United Nations in post-conflict Iraq.</P>
    <P>I greatly welcome the unanimous decision of the Security Council, through Resolution 1472, authorising the Secretary General to administer the oil for food programme. I hope the resumption of the programme will mean that basic food assistance can once again reach those who are most vulnerable.</P>
    <P>The European Council at its meeting of 21-22 March highlighted the need for the UN to play a central role during and after the current crisis and urged the Security Council to give it a strong mandate for this mission. We have announced an emergency assistance package of &euro;5 million for the people of Iraq and this will be disbursed through NGOs and international agencies including the UN. In addition the Government has provided almost &euro;15 million in un-earmarked funding for UNICEF and UNHCR to enable these UN agencies to respond flexibly to international emergencies such as that now occurring in Iraq. In addition &euro;750,000 has been provided to the UN Office for the Co-ordination of Humanitarian Assistance. The UN has issued a special appeal for Iraq which we are now examining. Our intention is to respond to this with funding from within the allocation of &euro;5 million.</P>

      <P>Arising from the Minister of State's reply, we hear that it is important and vital that the UN plays a crucial role in Iraq. There is a European Council meeting this weekend in Athens. What steps have the Minister and Minister of State for Foreign Affairs taken to persuade their colleagues at the meeting that the European Council should be centrally involved in ensuring the UN has a central, leading role in the future administration of Iraq?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="59" />Is the Minister of State concerned that there are elements within the US administration which appear to take the view that persons involved in the military Government of Iraq in the past, with definite records of genocide, are suitable candidates to run or participate in running Iraq after the departure of Saddam Hussein? Has the Minister of State raised this concern with the US administration?</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomKitt" hpid="Mr. Kitt Mr. Kitt">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the Deputy that the EU has a vital role in this period. The Minister for Foreign Affairs and the Taoiseach have emphasised this while working to try to bring consensus to the EU. We have acknowledged that that has not been easy but the Secretary General will attend this Council meeting and the purpose of the Irish Government's representation there is to ensure we can get that common ground and work with the Secretary General.</P>
      <P>Regarding the Deputy's second question, I can only go by the statement from President Bush and the Prime Minister Mr. Blair yesterday regarding their ideas on to how to proceed. The one word that encouraged me was &ldquo;partnership&rdquo;&ndash; that from now on we would have a partnership role between the US and the UK, the countries in Iraq at present, and the United Nations. We are beginning to see the pattern of how things will develop.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will know our position on the central role of the UN and I outlined in my reply what we want to happen, though obviously I cannot answer for the Governments of the US or Britain on the details of how they see this developing. I assure the Deputy that our Government, mainly as part of the EU but also by using our strong connections and contacts with the Secretary General of the UN, will proceed along the lines I outlined. We will continue to work with our colleagues in that regard.</P>

A person under house arrest in Denmark and facing inquiries about genocide, if not definite charges, has apparently been spirited out to the Middle East. Does the Minister of State agree that it would be totally wrong and unacceptable for a person with that pedigree to be considered suitable to participate in the post-Saddam Hussein government of Iraq?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomKitt" hpid="Mr. Kitt Mr. Kitt">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>As we speak the situation is evolving and changing and will continue to do so up to the weekend. Our main concern is to see an end to this conflict and the minimum loss of life, as we have said time and again. On the basis of the updated position at the weekend, I am confident our position will be one from which we strive to <Col N="60" /> reach consensus among our EU colleagues. That will be our approach.</P>
      <P>Regarding particular individuals, clearly we are anxious to see the best people involved at every level. However, as I said earlier, a clear outline of how things will shape up in the future was presented by Mr. Bush and Mr. Blair yesterday and we now clearly see our role in bringing about the best possible solution. The Deputy has outlined his concerns and I share his concerns about individuals. We will endeavour to ensure the best possible people are in place in the process with which we will have to deal. Our bottom line is to get the Iraqi people involved in governing their own country. A number of stages are involved in bringing that about and the important point is that the UN will be involved in areas with which we are closely involved &ndash; the humanitarian and administration processes. The UN special adviser will be involved in that all along the way but I agree with the Deputy that the EU also has a crucial role to play in the process.</P>

      <P>I am satisfied that Ireland's long-standing policy of military neutrality, as followed by successive Governments, is fully protected. As recently as last October, it was upheld by the amendment to the Constitution approved by the electorate in the context of the referendum on the Treaty of Nice. This confirmed the central and defining characteristic of the Government's policy in this area, that is, non-participation in military alliances. A commitment was made not to enter into a common defence arrangement in the EU unless the people decide otherwise in a referendum.</P>
      <P>Irish neutrality is a policy choice. It is not defined exclusively on the basis of international legal instruments, such as the Hague Convention of 1907; neither is it described in the Constitution, nor should it be. Arguments about whether an action was compatible with a policy of neutrality as referred to in the Constitution would give rise to endless legal challenges and take decisions out of the hands of the Government and the Oireachtas where the Constitution has placed them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As the Deputy will be aware, successive Governments have also made clear that Ireland <Col N="61" /> is not ideologically neutral. Neutrality policy has also been informed by the view that military neutrality on its own is not sufficient to maintain conditions of peace and security internationally. This is especially so in the context of the fundamental challenges to global peace and security which the world currently faces. Ireland, notably through the United Nations and now also through regional organisations such as the European Union, has sought to play a proactive role in preventing and managing conflicts and keeping peace.</P>
    <P>With regard to the current conflict in Iraq to which the Deputy refers, I reiterate that the Government does not regard the provision of landing and overflight facilities to foreign aircraft at Shannon Airport as participation in the military conflict. The provision of facilities does not make Ireland a member of a military coalition.</P>
    <P>Taking these considerations into account, a comprehensive neutrality audit, as suggested by the Deputy, is not appropriate, nor do I support the creation of what is described as a &ldquo;neutrality commission&rdquo; to undertake such a public audit.</P>

      <P>I find the Minister's reply interesting as it is the first time I have heard a member of the Government state he or she does not accept the Hague Convention's definition of neutrality. If, when it was pursuing the second referendum on the Nice treaty, the Government had explained to the people that it did not accept the definition set out in the convention, but was, instead, preparing to sell off what remained of neutrality in this State, they would not have supported the treaty. Time and again, during the Nice treaty campaigns and beforehand, we were told the State is militarily neutral. I find odd the Minister's refusal to accept that there is an internationally accepted definition of neutrality, namely, that contained in the Hague Convention. Why is the Government not willing to accept this definition? What definition of neutrality does it accept?</P>
      <P>I requested a neutrality audit as it would allow people to understand whether our neutrality was breached by allowing military aeroplanes to land at Shannon, Dublin and Baldonnel airports during the current war, the Vietnam war and the invasions of Grenada and Panama, all of which have been cited in the court case currently before the High Court. Does the Minister accept the Hague Convention's definition of neutrality? In light of his comment that the Government's definition differed from that of the convention, will he inform the House how they differ? What is the source or basis for the Government's definition?</P>

      <P>I am forced to reiterate my reply as the Deputy seeks to misrepresent what I said. I stated that Irish neutrality is a policy choice and is not defined exclusively on the basis of international legal instruments such as the Hague Convention of 1907. In other words, if the <Col N="62" /> Deputy, in his efforts to understand our neutrality policy, restricts his understanding to the view that the Hague Convention encapsulates our policy, he is grievously wrong and all the empirical evidence on the exercise and conduct of our neutrality policy since its initiation and as pursued until now by successive Governments is against him. That is the basic failure of comprehension on the part of the Deputy as he seeks to redefine neutrality policy by defining it exclusively within the framework of a convention laid down in 1907. He may have heard of a number of international instruments, including the United Nations Charter, which have been passed since then.</P>
      <P>With respect, the person who has a problem in this regard is the Deputy as he is seeking to define neutrality policy on the basis of the Hague Convention of 1907. The United Nations Charter, which was signed subsequent to the convention by the then Government, allows for enforcement action and support for military action in certain circumstances. This is one of the reasons one cannot define one's neutrality policy on the basis of the Hague Convention. If this is the first time the Deputy has heard these facts, I am glad he has joined the club.</P>

      <P>I have still not received a straight answer. If the Minister accepts that the Hague Convention is part of neutrality policy &ndash; I am not asking anybody to sign up to it &ndash; it specifically states that neutral countries must forbid belligerent troops moving across one's territory. What part of that does the Minister not understand? Which subsequent United Nations charter undid this section of the Hague Convention? Which part of the definition of neutrality, that is, that one does not take sides in a conflict in which one is not involved, does the Minister not accept? These are simple questions.</P>
      <P>My premise is that the people would not have accepted the Government's word on its supposed definition of neutrality if they had been informed, at the time the Nice referendum and other questions related to neutrality were put to the people, that the Minister had a secret definition of neutrality.</P>

      <P>The Laeken Declaration under which the convention was established explicitly asked it to consider whether the Charter of Fundamental Rights should be included in the basic treaty of the European Union. To do so would give the charter, which currently has the status of a political declaration, binding legal effect.</P>
      <P>The Government strongly supported promulgation of the charter at the Nice summit as a clear statement of the important values shared by the member states of the European Union. It has worked in the convention to ensure that if the charter is to be incorporated in the new treaty, there is the greatest possible legal certainty as to its scope and application. This is important not only for the Union's institutions and the member states, which will be bound by its provisions in so far as they are implementing Union law, but also for our citizens for whom we hope the new treaty will be a clearer, more comprehensible document.</P>
      <P>Significant progress has been made at the convention. As a result of efforts by the Irish and United Kingdom representatives on the relevant working group, it recommended a set of amendments to the charter's so-called horizontal provisions which should help to bring greater legal precision. It would also be helpful for the commentary provided by the presidium of the charter convention, which sets out the thinking underpinning the inclusion of each of the various articles in the charter, to be given appropriate status. There has been extensive discussion of the issue by the Government as matters have progressed. The implications of incorporation have been given the most careful consideration. As I said in my speech in Brussels last week, I am pleased that it looks increasingly likely that it will be possible to incorporate the charter into the constitutional treaty in a manner that does not risk inadvertently creating new competences for the Union.</P>
      <P>The recent meeting in Luxembourg, which was attended by the Taoiseach and me, brought together the heads of Government and Foreign Ministers of seven member states primarily to discuss institutional matters at the convention. A great deal of common ground was identified. including our shared requirement for the preservation of equality between member states, and balance between the Union's institutions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government has set out its broad approach to the convention, and the future of Europe generally, on a number of occasions, including in my speech in Brussels last week. We hope that the process which is begun at the convention, and which will he concluded at the Intergovernmental Conference, will result in a simplified treaty which is more legible and accessible for our citizens. We hope it will prepare the institutions to face the challenges that lie ahead, including enlargement. We have been positive and constructive at the convention and our rep<Col N="66" /> resentative, the Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs, Deputy Roche, has been particularly active and engaged in building networks which can help to advance and protect our interests. The Taoiseach and I have also had meetings with our counterparts in various member states and, of course, with president Giscard d'Estaing during his recent visit to Dublin.</P>
    <P>The convention has moved into its final drafting phase. Draft texts published to date include the treaty's general and final provisions. I emphasise that the draft article on ratification will not alter the current arrangements whereby a treaty cannot enter into force unless ratified by all the Union's member states. I do not believe that any other arrangement would have the necessary political or legal legitimacy. I do not support the arrangements proposed in the so-called Penelope document drafted informally within the Commission for that reason.</P>
    <P>While good progress has been made by the convention, draft texts on important areas have yet to be brought forward. Articles on institutional matters and on CFSP and defence will be published towards the end of this month and debated in May. The European Council has asked president Giscard d'Estaing to present the convention's final recommendations to it at Thessaloniki in June. However, he has asked that there be a special European Council meeting at the end of June and will seek agreement for this in Athens next week. The Government is open to some modest extension. However, as I said previously, we strongly believe that, irrespective of when the convention finishes, there should then be a significant period of reflection to allow us to digest its recommendations and to allow for the necessary and important process of public debate.</P>

      <P>The grouping of the questions means two separate matters are being dealt with but I am not interested in wasting time. My question relates to the charter while the others deal with the work and future of the convention. Do I take it that the Government's position is that the European Convention on Human Rights will be accepted in totality, without reservation, including its four additional protocols, and, therefore, the incorporation of the charter will be additional to the convention?</P>
      <P>What distinction does the Minister draw between principles, as declared in the charter, and legal certainty, which arises under the European convention? In other words, is it proposed to extend the convention, give it constitutional status and extend citizens' rights or is it proposed to have a lesser existence, therefore incorporating aspects of the charter, as published?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>The European Convention on Human Rights is a separate issue from the charter and has not been anticipated as part of a supplementary question. My understanding is that the acquisition by the Union of a single legal personality provides for the prospect of incorpor<Col N="67" /> ation of the convention more easily into the treaties by reason of the Union having a single legal personality. I am not totally on solid ground on that but that is my understanding of the situation. It is being considered by the convention and will be considered in due course by the Intergovernmental Conference.</P>
      <P>The issue relating to the charter's incorporation has been to make sure the scope of application of the horizontal clauses will ensure the Union's institutions adhere to the provisions of the charter and the human rights standards set out therein and a non-complementary or competitive set of jurisprudence within the constitution <i>vis-à-vis</i> the European Convention on Human Rights, which is a separate legal jurisprudence, will not be created.</P>
      <P>The purpose here is to be sure about how we fit in the charter. It is not a question of anyone trying to dilute the provisions of the charter of fundamental rights but to incorporate them in a way that will not create further competing uncertainties in the legal framework between those provisions and how they will be interpreted and established provisions under the convention on human rights and how they are interpreted by the court in Strasbourg.</P>

      <P>Until recently, my understanding had been that the Government wanted the charter of fundamental rights included by way of protocol. However, in his reply the Minister accepts that it can be incorporated. Will he explain why he has changed his mind?</P>
      <P>The Minister of State, Deputy Roche, has done a fine job in terms of establishing networks. Does the Minister accept that smaller countries and many people on the convention are opposed to the idea of an elected president of the Council and the majority of people who spoke at the convention opposed this idea? Does he further accept that if the larger countries get their way with this proposal, that would demonstrate a lack of democracy in the convention?</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>It is important not to attribute something to the convention that it would be impossible for it to fulfil. The convention is a consultative forum, as representative as it can be of the institutions, parliaments and a limited number of other bodies. It cannot be suggested that if something comes out of it, it is not democratic. The convention is a consultative body that has been asked to brainstorm on critical and difficult issues. As I stated in my speech last week, a great deal of good work has been done by the convention which had not been done during past Intergovernmental Conferences regarding single legal personality and how to incorporate the charter, for example, into a new treaty. That work was necessary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy asked why we are taking the view we are taking. We are more certain now that incorporating the charter will not cause the legal <Col N="68" /> problems and competitions with established human rights jurisprudence under the European convention on human rights, which would otherwise have been the case, because of the work that has been done on the horizontal clauses. This has been done in a way to achieve conformity and to reduce confusion that might have arisen if that necessary work had not been conducted. That work was conducted following publication of the charter of fundamental rights and freedoms. It is a question of making sure the wish to incorporate something into a treaty has the effect that one would like it to have and will not have a consequential effect, anticipated or otherwise, in regard to human rights law under the European convention. That is the reason there is greater clarity on our position now in comparison to previously.</P>
    <P>How consensus is defined in the convention is becoming a difficult issue to grasp.</P>

      <P>The Minister referred to the fact that fundamental rights will be justiciable. Where will stand the protocols to the treaties that have been negotiated, particularly the protocol relating to abortion, which recognises the Irish constitutional provision? What discussions have taken place on the status of the existing protocols, following publication of the Giscard d'Estaing convention report? A report will be given to a European Council meeting in June &ndash; presumably not the final report. When does the Minister anticipate that Giscard d'Estaing will vacate the stage and that the process of reflection, in between the end of the Convention and the start of the Intergovernmental Conference, will take place? Is it likely there will be a second treaty of Rome, is it more likely to be a treaty of Dublin, or will it go beyond that? What time scale has the Minister in mind?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>In relation to the charter, it is important to point out that it will provide protection for citizens in respect of the manner in which European institutions interface or interact with citizens. There are national standards even higher than those in the charter and it is our view that they should apply. It is a matter of incorporating these legal concepts into the charter. While nobody would have any principled objection to any of them, it has to be done in a manner which does not allow jurisprudence to develop which would interfere with other established human rights, as I have already outlined. The protections in the charter will apply largely to the interface between citizens and the institutions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to existing treaty provisions being consolidated in a new treaty, that issue is still up there in the ether. I do not have the answers to all those questions at the moment. Clearly, however, whatever protections we have, we will endeavour to retain because they are important. The time-scale depends very much on when the convention ends. The convention has a very tight timetable, <Col N="69" /> with very significant work still to do. It is envisaged that the final report will be at a special European Council beyond Thessalonica, by the end of June, followed by a period of reflection which we and other countries would like to take place and which is a requirement in some jurisdictions. In Sweden and Finland, for example, parliamentary consideration is essential before their Governments can go into an intergovernmental conference. It is expected that, on best guess, some time in the late autumn of the Italian Presidency this year, an Intergovernmental Conference will commence. We do not know, at this stage, how long that work will take, nor do we know what degree of consensus or agreement will emerge from the convention, what sticky problems will remain to be resolved or whether the political will to resolve them quickly will exist. It could come into the Irish Presidency.</P>

      <P>My point related to the distinction between principles and justiciable law. Is it the Minister's opinion that the European Convention on Human Rights will be capable of being added to, or is he speaking of two parallel streams which might have the effect of not adding to the net rights of citizens? I will put it much more simply and directly. As I understand it, the discussions so far were in the context of creating the capacity within the European Union, as a non-sovereign entity, to accommodate and accept the ECHR. If that is the case, would a very confusing situation not have been created for the citizen if the charter preceded the acceptance of that capacity?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>The issues which the Deputy is raising are precisely at the nub of the situation. On the basis that there is a convention on human rights and that a jurisprudence has been built up in the Strasbourg court, if one proceeds to incorporate that into the institutions of the EU, which has its own European Court of Justice, there is the prospect of parallel court interpretations. The question arises as to the extent to which citizens' rights are being served by clarity, quite apart from rights or entitlements. While I am always open to good ideas which might be incorporated in a human rights context, one can sometimes create more difficulties than solutions. While one may be in favour of some suggestion, one has to make sure, when it comes down to the detailed work, that one is adding value, rather than detracting from existing reputable human rights law and jurisprudence which has been built up in the Strasbourg court. My position is that, while I have no objection in principle and I have heard of routes and means whereby it might be incorporated, I have yet to come to a firm decision as <Col N="70" /> to what the Government's position should be, in terms of supporting it or not. I would need to see the detail and, so to speak, the devil is in the detail in relation to all of those legal matters.</P>

      <P>We are discussing human rights and fundamental rights. Why has the Government totally changed tack and reversed engines with regard to Europe's position concerning the proposed UN convention on rights of people with disabilities? Is it true that the Government is, at least, not committed or, at worst, opposed to such a convention? Has it moved from an earlier position where the Government was proposing such a convention? Will the Minister clarify the position with regard to this very important convention? Why does the Government now appear to be opposed to it and, by extension, in this European Year of People with Disabilities, opposed to services for people with disabilities?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>The matter requires substantial discussion to establish how we should deal with it. The Government has had a long-standing commitment towards advancing improvements for people with disabilities. There is no question of anybody in this House being opposed to that, although there have been arguments about the inability of successive Governments to provide adequate resources. Reality does not always correspond to the rhetoric. There are legal issues which have to be addressed in a dispassionate manner to ensure that we sign up to something which will be effective, helpful and add value. The need for proper consideration of these detailed matters should not be interpreted as, in some way, a resiling by Government from the principle of supporting people with disabilities. Nothing could be further from the truth. Rather than rushing to sign up to several different provisions, we must deal with the issues on their merits, contribute constructively to devising these international instruments and proceed objectively and intelligently.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>I am taking it that the Deputy's question &ndash; although expressed in general terms &ndash; relates both to the treatment of detainees in Guantanamo Bay and the five Cuban citizens convicted of espionage and other charges in the United States. The Government's concern that the detainees in Guantanamo Bay be treated in accordance with the provisions of international human rights and humanitarian law has been communicated to the US authorities. In this regard I refer the Deputy to my reply to Parliamentary Questions, reference nos. 3976 and 3977, of 7 February 2002.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In addition, in discussions on the matter with our EU partners, my Department has learned that a number of partners whose nationals are being held in Guantanamo Bay are seeking to resolve the issues relating to their treatment with the US authorities. It is the hope of the Govern<Col N="72" /> ment that a speedy solution to these issues can be reached.</P>
    <P>As regards the five Cuban nationals convicted in the US, I have already reported to the House on a number of occasions that these individuals were found guilty by a court in Miami of charges ranging from espionage to conspiracy in first degree murder, following an investigation into the deaths of two young Cuban-Americans when the aeroplane they were piloting was shot down on its way to drop leaflets over Havana in support of a human rights demonstration in the city. I understand that appeals against the convictions began on Monday, 7 April in the 11th Circuit Court of Appeals in Atlanta. It is essential that this appeal be conducted in a manner that is fair and impartial and free from political considerations. It would be inappropriate, therefore, for me to comment on the trial.</P>
    <P>I am aware also that concern has been expressed in recent weeks about the fact that the men were being held in solitary confinement. It is my understanding that the defendants were released from solitary confinement late last week.</P>

      <P>I thank the Minister for his reply. I hope he will continue to raise these cases in a constructive way and seek to safeguard the human rights of prisoners, no matter what they have been found guilty of. Does the Minister agree that the representatives of the Cuban Embassy and the chargé d'affaires of Cuba have some neck to ask Members of this House to raise questions of this kind when people that criticised President Castro in Cuba were given lengthy prison sentences for daring to criticise the regime? What steps is the Minister taking to raise this issue with the Cuban authorities and the UN Human Rights Commission?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gormley</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister accept that the detention of 641 men at Guantanamo Bay is in breach of 15 articles of the Geneva Convention? Does he also accept that the distinction made by the US between what it calls &ldquo;prisoners of war&rdquo; and &ldquo;unlawful combatants&rdquo; is spurious? If this were applied in the case of American prisoners in Iraq, they too could be considered as unlawful combatants as this war is illegal.</P>

      <P>Deputy Gormley has mentioned the breach of 15 articles of the Geneva Convention and that is not to speak of the humiliating conditions in which people were transferred there. In view of the outrageous breaches of international law and human rights that prevail in Guantanamo Bay, can I take it that the Minister or the Taoiseach have indicated in their discussions on Iraq with the Americans that they will <Col N="73" /> oppose the removal of anybody from Iraq to Guantanamo Bay? What practical initiatives is the Minister taking to ensure human rights and the rule of law is administered? Has he had discussions with the US Embassy on the basis of the detention of people in Guantanamo Bay outside any international legal process? Will he object to the removal of more people to this black hole that is outside any protection of domestic or international law?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>I have not had any discussions with anybody on this matter. I am not aware that this specific point was raised in the discussions held with the President of the United States and the British Prime Minister yesterday. The matter that is taking up everyone's attention is that the conflict in Iraq has not yet been ended. We want to see an end to the conflict and humanitarian needs addressed. We are talking about how a representative government can be put in place and what the interim arrangements will be. We are also considering what discussions need to take place between coalition forces and other organisations, including the UN. The EU will meet next week to discuss these matters and the UN Secretary General will come to the meeting.</P>
      <P>How soon this war will end is the real question. We must seek to ensure the minimisation of the loss of human life and have arrangements put in place to meet the humanitarian needs of people. We must ask, as we did yesterday, what we can do for the provision of field hospitals. I met the international wing of the Red Cross in Geneva last week and we must ask what we can do to help bring better facilities into existing hospitals. The Red Cross is the only NGO that can work there in times of conflict. This is a situation that is developing by the hour and I ask that cognisance be taken of this. I take on board the concerns raised by the Deputies. These are matters we will raise with the Americans as matters develop.</P>
      <P>Regarding the legal status of those already in Guantanamo Bay, Deputies will be aware that the US has asserted that the persons detained there can be regarded as falling into a distinct category of detainee, namely, &ldquo;unlawful combatants&rdquo;. While not being entitled to prisoner of war status, they are being provided with selected prisoner of war privileges. Several commentators have pointed out that this category of detainee is not mentioned in the Geneva Convention, nor is it known in international law.</P>

      <P>He had no reply to make to the Labour Party's contention that in introducing the amendments he introduced on Committee Stage he has cleared the way for an extension of the concept of government to extend to members of the Government, Ministers of State, advisers of all types and any other person or group of persons &ndash; this could include consultants, experts and review groups as there is no limit on what this can be. The Minister and his officials can shake their heads and say they will be careful about this. The Information Commissioner reported that this definition of Government was &ldquo;constitutionally unrecognisable&rdquo;. No less an individual than Senator Mansergh has warned that the inclusion of the section of &ldquo;other persons&rdquo;&ndash; where &ldquo;other persons&rdquo; are undefined &ndash; in Government is something that many of us will have cause to regret some day. The Information Commissioner specifically warned in his report that it was likely to lead to costly litigation in the future. Such circumstances also led Mr. Justice Hamilton to comment at the end of the beef tribunal that had it been possible to get answers to the questions put, the tribunal might never have been necessary.</P>
      <P>I heard the Taoiseach say that in his lengthy service and experience in Government, civil servants have effectively abandoned the business of keeping proper records and writing proper memoranda. The Taoiseach appears to be presiding over the keeping of bad records by the Civil Service. The Public Service Users Group specifically said in its report that record keeping in the Civil Service was good. What is the Taoiseach talking about? Is the Civil Service to be blamed because it is unwilling to keep records? It is to be the fall-guy and patsy for the Government abandoning and essentially dismembering freedom of information?</P>
      <P>That is an unfair way of dealing with the public service which has served this country honourably and with ethical values and dignity. When the Committee on Finance and the Public Service met the high-level group, that group &ndash; no better set of people to defend its own patch &ndash; made it abundantly clear that theirs was an input into the Government's right to re-examine and review the Freedom of Information Act. They were not responsible &ndash; they made this clear during the presentation to the committee &ndash; for many of the amendments and in particular they were not responsible for this new definition and expansion of the understanding of what Government in the Republic of Ireland means. Under cover of a desire to expand the period after which records should be disclosed from five to seven years and to undertake the review process as set out in the original Act &ndash; and properly provided for there &ndash; the Government decided to do a smash and grab run on the Freedom of Information Act as it operated and essentially close it down.</P>

The Taoiseach, again, claimed this morning there had been widespread consultation on the matter. There was no consultation. A Government backbencher, Deputy Finneran, questioned the high level group and the Information Commissioner. He asked the Information Commissioner if he had been consulted and had he heard about the review. The Information Commissioner told him he heard it through the media. Deputy Finneran went on to ask him if he heard it on the grapevine. The Information Commissioner indicated he had learned of the changes through the media.</P>

      <P>This Government is presenting the people with a shabby deal. I praised the Minister's generosity when he acknowledged during the Committee Stage debate that what the Government was doing posed grave personal difficulties for more than 100,000 Irish people such as those in institutions and those who had various dealings with health services etc. at different stages.</P>
      <P>The Government smelled political pressure following the presentation by Colm O'Gorman of One in Four to the committee. Deputy Fiona O'Malley announced her unhappiness in this regard and the Minister correctly decided to throw in the towel on that particular part of the Bill which was never suggested by the high level group. That provision came out of the blue. It was meant to tidy up and hide more secrets, particularly those which were deeply personal to large groups of Irish people.</P>
      <P>If in that case the Government recognised it got it wrong, why is it not prepared to listen to other bodies, interest groups, NGOs and members of the public who are telling it this Bill is wrong? Last week I brought to the Minister's attention a letter recently issued by his Department to a request for freedom of information regarding advice given to him on cutbacks in Government services in the period before the general election. The citizen who applied for that information &ndash; this is an indication of the proposed new regime &ndash; received a letter from the Department, much of which related to parliamentary questions and replies thereto from people like Deputy Paul McGrath, requesting he pay &euro;2,900 with a deposit of &euro;500 to be paid up front.</P>

The Minister's Department is claiming it will take it 130 Civil Service hours to compile such information.</P>
      <P>This matter was discussed in committee with the Information Commissioner. If Departments felt that requests were inappropriate, over the top or vexatious, there was recourse available in the Act or to go to the Information Commissioner. If this is to be the type of charging regime the Department of Finance is holding up as a model, it means that for the vast majority of citizens freedom of information will now be almost entirely beyond their reach when it relates to general Government decisions or decisions of public bodies.</P>
      <P>In its presentation to the committee, an organisation called The Wheel pointed out that many NGOs, charities and voluntary and community organisations use FOI in relation to environmental information and local issues that affect such groups. The kind of charging regime that the Minister's Department is now setting as a headline appears to be deeply unfair unless we get an explanation of the way it has been worked out.</P>
      <P>If the Minister fails again to accept the reasonable points made by the Opposition, which is to allow more time under the auspices of the Information Commissioner for proper consultation with all the affected parties, including the Opposition, and if he persists in his obdurate refusal to listen to reasonable critiques of what he has brought forward, including the dangerous extension of the notion of what constitutes government in this country, I hope that when the Bill concludes all Stages in these Houses and is sent to the President for her signature, interested citizens and NGOs may take up the issue with the President and ask her to give the Bill to the Council of State for its consideration. That is the last recourse to citizens and citizens' groups.</P>
      <P>In regard to the charging regime the Minister will introduce and the important work done under the Freedom of Information Act, there are four or five significant stories in today's edition of <i>The Examiner,</i> the <i>Irish Independent</i> and <i>The Irish Times</i> which come from FOI sources. There is a detailed story on compensation paid by the Garda to gardaí who were injured and made claims against the State. That information came from the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform through the Freedom of Information Act.</P>
      <P>If it is the intention, as per the headline set by the Minister's Department, to introduce an exorbitant charging regime for such information, it will be out of bounds to the many freelance journalists who are the mechanism by which the media uses the Act. It must be remembered that it is the media which supply most of our citizens with information about the doings of Government. We had the farcical situation, and I will finish on this point&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Boyle</NameTxt>
      <P>Addressing amendments Nos. 2 and 4 as they relate to the Information Commissioner, it is a rich irony that one of the few unamended sections of the principal Act is section 36, which <Col N="80" /> refers to the right of the Information Commissioner to initiate a review of the workings of the Freedom of Information Act. It is an irony because when the outgoing Information Commissioner chose to exercise that very power, he was subject to vilification by a Cabinet colleague of the Minister's, in a committee of Members of this House and the other House. He was subject to vilification without being corrected by any other member of the Government or by the Minister. He is now retiring from his office after an honourable, distinguished and effective service but a cloud hangs over the Government in failing to respond to the criticism made of a public servant in exercising his public duty. This Government does not appreciate irony.</P>
      <P>The fact that section 36 is still on the Statute Book means that the Government believes any future review by the Information Commissioner will be ineffective. That is why it is essential that these two amendments are accepted. Before any new amendment of the principal Act comes into place, there must be a detailed examination by the Information Commissioner and his successor to make sure that the rights of the public are not trampled on to the extent that many of us in Opposition have seen.</P>
      <P>I was nauseated to hear the Taoiseach say today that the Information Commissioner had been consulted in relation to this legislation. It is clear from his contributions to the Committee on Finance and the Public Service that the Information Commissioner heard of the existence of the high level civil servants' group on the grapevine. A high-level civil servants' group was set up to examine the workings of the Freedom of Information Act and the Information Commissioner, whose job it is to overview the workings of that Act, was not told that the group was being formed. He heard on the grapevine that the group was in existence. He heard through the media that an amendment Bill was being put in place. At the very last minute, on his own initiative and not having been asked by the high-level group or by the Government, he presented a set of amendments for consideration before the Bill was finally drafted and presented to the Seanad and ultimately to this House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Anyone who would argue that that is an acceptable method of using the public servant who has a specific responsibility under legislation to ensure that freedom of information works for the benefit of the citizen has a poor understanding of the reason there is a need for freedom of information and why it must be allowed to work to the highest effective level. Amendment No. 2 refers to the involvement of the Information Commissioner at that level. Amendment No. 4 goes further and outlines the consultation process that should exist and be followed, even at this late stage. It mentions particular groups, some by name such as the National Union of Journalists and some generically like business users. The fact that the users group, which existed as a result of the 1997 Act, only met on a few occasions and <Col N="81" /> has not met since March 2001 means this Government has given up on the very idea of consultation. That should not surprise any of us in this House because this is a Government which believes it already knows the answers to the question of what it wants to set out in its own programme. It is a Government which does not brook opposition. It does not accept amendments. It certainly does not want to expose its decision-making processes to anybody else, either inside or outside this House, in a way that any fair-minded and democratically committed Government should do.</P>
    <P>On these terms, these are self-evident amendments which should be accepted and would be accepted by a Government which had a firm commitment to the real idea of freedom of information. I do not expect that either amendment will be accepted, but I hope that even at this stage the Minister has a road to Damascus conversion &ndash; perhaps we should call it a road to Baghdad conversion. I hope he uses the remaining hours available on Report Stage to critically accept much of what the Opposition is saying and to produce an amending Bill which goes some way towards being a workable document for citizens.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CaoimhglinOCaolain" hpid="Caoimhghín Ó Caoláin Caoimhghín Ó Caoláin">
      <NameTxt>Caoimhghín Ó Caoláin</NameTxt>
      <P>I support amendments Nos. 2 and 4 in the names of Deputies Richard Bruton and Burton. The argument for a proper assessment, which these amendments seek, was clearly outlined in the Second Stage address of the Minister. On Second Stage, he stated that the Government's position on freedom of information is quite simple and straightforward, that the changes to the legislation proposed in the Bill are based on the need to ensure the business of Government can be properly and efficiently organised, and that the purpose of the Bill is to allow the Government to carry out its work, no more, no less.</P>
      <P>It seems to me from that particular section of the Minister's Second Stage address that he is strongly of the view that the Freedom of Information Act 1997 in some way was a restrictive measure in terms of processing the work of Government. We have challenged him repeatedly on Committee Stage and again today to show the evidence of how the Freedom of Information Act 1997 was a restriction or a curtailment of the business of Government. He has failed to offer any evidence to support his contention and there appears to be no research or documentary evidence to support that view &ndash; all the more reason that should now occur. Otherwise the only interpretation we can put on his contribution is that the Minister himself believes that the more secretive the deliberations of Cabinet and all of the information flow to Cabinet, the better the working of Government. That, of course, is to run in the face of the ethos of the Freedom of Information Act 1997.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For that reason, and also because this new so-called amending legislation seeks to not only restrict access but also to introduce new elements, <Col N="82" /> in terms of the accepted norm of Government by the extension to unnamed committees made up of unidentified individuals who will carry the responsibility of deliberation and advice directly to Cabinet but without scrutiny and the opportunity to be held accountable, this is a major change to existing legislation. It is a retrograde step that needs proper and careful evaluation by an objective person such as the Information Commissioner, who will be in a position to assess the suitability or otherwise of the proposition.</P>
    <P>The Bill also introduces prohibitive fees. On Committee Stage, we outlined to the Minister that this will leave the option of utilisation of the Freedom of Information Act as the preserve of those who can afford to secure&mdash;</P>

      <P>I might have finished at this stage, which is the pattern I have noted throughout today.</P>
      <P>Altogether apart from the fact that the greatest number of requests are made by individuals, and while a great number of others are also made by representatives of the media, another element which needs to be addressed by the Information Commissioner is the restrictions in the case of advocacy groups such as SOCA &ndash; Survivors of Child Abuse, Parents for Justice or the representatives of the intellectually disabled who last night presented themselves in such numbers in this city.</P>
      <P>All of these important points need to be taken on board. The Bill, and what the Minister is proposing to do, flies in the face of the intent of the Freedom of Information Act 1997. He is preparing, not for better Government but for a Government that will be tied up in litigation for some considerable time to come until the measures involved in this amending legislation are reversed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan" hpid="Mr. Durkan Mr. Durkan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
      <P>Taking up where the last speaker left off, it is not a question of providing for better Government but of providing for Government in hiding because it appears as if the Government is about to go into hiding.</P>
      <P>I support the two amendments which are fundamental to what has been discussed over the past two or three weeks. What amazes me most is that the Minister, who is a good constituency colleague of mine and for whom I have great respect and admiration, should ignore this opportunity to be the great liberal and to come forward and accept the two amendments. That would be in keeping with his membership of this House, certainly for as long as I have been in it. That is much sought-after and would be appreciated by the general public.</P>
      <P>I am also disappointed that the Progressive Democrats are not here to assist me in this argument. There was a time when they stood by the Republic, but even in republics where they grow bananas this kind of legislation would not be introduced, notwithstanding the evidence and the benefit of the bananas and the ensuing danger when they are thrown on the ground.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not know where the campaign came from to change the legislation that has sat so freely on the Government's shoulders for the past number of years. What is it afraid of? Why does it not accept the amendments? Would this not be more <Col N="84" /> simple? It would be a clear indication of its acceptance of the rights of the Opposition and the case it has made. The Government should accept that it should not always be necessary to go down the hard road and prise out information by way of parliamentary questions. We know how difficult that can be; it hurts us greatly on this side of the House that we have no control over the replies, something to which we have referred on several occasions in the past. May the day fast approach&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
      <P>Absolutely, the Ceann Comhairle will see that in a couple of seconds.</P>
      <P>The whole point of the two amendments is that there should be further consultation with the Information Commissioner and with other people who have an interest in obtaining the information. Why does the Government not do this? It would be simple. It would not require a huge expenditure from any quarter, nor would it require the establishment of a commission of inquiry &ndash; there have been enough of those. It does not require any great imagination from the Government at all to accept two simple amendments.</P>
      <P>I have heard much discussion and debate in the past couple of weeks about the Minister's acceptance of certain elements of the Opposition's proposals. I am not so certain about the full benefit and weight of those concessions to the Opposition so far. These amendments are fundamental to what the Opposition has been talking about. Its requests have not been unreasonable. What it is really asking is that the Government continue to have an honourable and ongoing discussion, after which the Opposition will have no difficulty with reasonable suggestions from the Government if it is proven in a debate that they are reasonable. We have a problem with the fact that the Government, having obtained the collective wisdom of those who gave the advice, many of whom will be directly affected by these changes, is now hiding behind smoke and mirrors and moving backwards in time. All governments throughout Europe are moving forward towards creating a greater degree of openness and shedding more light on what happens in government.</P>
      <P>These two amendments are the minimum that is required by this side of the House. The Minister would do the House and the nation a good turn by accepting these amendments without question. He would be seen as a liberal Minister who favours change and setting aside old attitudes and prejudices. If the amendments are accepted, it does not necessarily mean that the Opposition is running the Government. God between us and all harm, we would not like to be associated with it, given some of the things that have been happening.</P>

It would be a clear indication that the Government's intentions were honourable and genuine. However, I am worried that the reason this proposal is not being accepted is that the Government is afraid. It has something up its sleeve. It does not want this discussion to take place over the next few months. It does not want these amendments to shine light into the corridors of power because it could become embarrassing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government may also have something in mind that it has not told us about &ndash; some little present for the Opposition that it has not mentioned, not even to the Progressive Democrats. It would not be safe to mention it because the Progressive Democrats are supposed to be the watchdogs. Perhaps I would be better off appealing to the watchdogs in this case.

He should come forward now and let us see that he is a true reformer by accepting the two amendments. Moreover, the Progressive Democrats, the arm of Government that protects the people from the Government &ndash; a wonderful, unique position &ndash; should come forward and tell us that they intend to support these two amendments because they are standing by the people.</P>

      <P>As I indicated on Committee Stage last week, I will not be accepting amendment No. 4 that effectively replicates the general thrust of the recent Private Members' Bill sponsored by the Labour Party, which was fully debated in this House and defeated.</P>
      <P>The purpose of the Bill is to strike the appropriate balance between openness, transparency and accountability on the one hand and the proper functioning of the government process on the other. The core principle of the Bill is that it is in the public interest that the institution of Cabinet works well and effectively. This Bill is a carefully balanced package of measures which preserves the basic objective of freedom of information while ensuring that Government can conduct its business in an effective manner, in accordance with the public interest.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Freedom of Information Act has made an important contribution to improving the quality of public debate in this country; it has opened up <Col N="87" /> access to personal information by individuals and it has made an important contribution to the ongoing process of public sector reform. However, freedom of information cannot be the main factor in determining how the Government conducts its business.</P>
    <P>This Bill is narrow in focus. It strengthens the protection for records relating to Government business, it provides certainty in relation to the deliberative process of Departments and it contains a number of technical changes designed to improve the operation of the Act.</P>
    <P>The Bill did not emerge from a vacuum, as these amendments would seem to suggest. I explained in some detail on previous Stages the system that exists for supporting FOI and how this had served to keep the Act under continual review. I also explained how a very considered report had been prepared by the high-level group. I explained how previous reports on the Act had been available to that group and to the Government, including the reports prepared by the Information Commissioner and the Civil Service Users Network. I explained the mechanisms that have existed for channelling the views of FOI stakeholders on the operation of the Act.</P>
    <P>The Bill has now been debated for 27 hours in the Seanad and for 35 hours in the Dáil and will be debated further today and tomorrow. The Joint Committee on Finance and the Public Service devoted considerable time to consideration of the high-level group report and to submissions from various interested parties. We have had debate on the Private Members' Bill sponsored by the Labour Party. The Information Commissioner has published his commentary.</P>
    <P>The implication from these amendments that a further 12 months consultation is either necessary or appropriate is as specious as the suggestion that the introduction of provisions of the Bill should effectively be made subject to a report prepared by the Information Commissioner.</P>
    <P>The core of the Bill was informed by the high level group. As far as these provisions are concerned, I have no hesitation in saying that Ministers and Secretaries General are in the best position to assess the effective functioning of Government. The Government decided to amend the FOI Act for no other reason than to ensure continued good government and to promote efficient administration. It chose to adopt what it knew would be an unpopular course not because it wanted to hide information but because of legitimate concerns about aspects of the 1997 Act. There is no other agenda.</P>
    <P>As I said on Second Stage, the report of the Information Commissioner was examined by my officials in consultation with the Office of the Attorney General. I am fully satisfied that the concerns about legal issues raised by the commissioner are not justified.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>The truth is now beginning to come out in the Minister's reply. Although I can<Col N="88" /> not quote him exactly he said that Government is in the best position to assess what is needed to protect Government or in other words Government knows best. Anything that serves the convenience of Government and protects Ministers from undue scrutiny of what they are doing is best for the people. This is the paternalistic approach that we thought was dead and buried. We thought the lessons of the tribunals, which Ministers on the other side of the House repeatedly say they have learnt, had influenced policy.</P>
      <P>However, the Minister is blatantly telling us that they know best how to protect the public from information they would be better not having. It might damage them to know these secrets. This is the sort of arrogance that is not in character with the Minister for Finance. I cannot understand why he seeks to protect weak willed people around him who are unwilling to stand up and take responsibility for the decisions they make. This has not been a hallmark of his political career. For the Minister to introduce a charter for these weak kneed Ministers is a disgrace and lets down his high standards.</P>
      <P>We need a proper review as proposed here. This Act is not the plaything of Government to be changed any time it causes embarrassment or a bit of difficulty. It is not the Government's property to treat in this way but is the property of Irish citizens who should have been consulted. The cardinal sin is this was done without any notice or suggestion of it in the lead up to Government. It would be ludicrous to believe that two or three weeks after coming into Government the scales fell from their eyes and they suddenly discovered the enormous damage that freedom of information was doing to the system of government. The Government came in with an overall majority and knew it could jackboot through anything it wanted and it decided to take that opportunity.</P>

      <P>The Minister often talks of favouring Boston over Brussels in his approach to politics. I remind him of what James Madison said about the development of the American Constitution:</P>
      <P>Knowledge will forever govern ignorance; and a people who mean to be their own governors must arm themselves with the power which knowledge gives.</P>
      <P>In the Minister's comment that higher level civil servants and Ministers know what is best for Government, he has basically thrown out all the notions that arose in response to the tribunals of openness, transparency and accountability. The Minister was one of the most trenchant critics of Mr. Haughey and the GUBU era when we had grotesque, unbelievable and unprecedented events.</P>

      <P>These events led to incredibly costly tribunals and procedures, which unfortu<Col N="89" /> nately have debased the whole currency of politics. The concept of freedom of information was developed by the Labour Party largely in the context of a more modern, confident, successful and open Ireland, which had the power to tell the citizenry what was going on. The Taoiseach, unfortunately with the agreement of the Minister for Finance, wants to cut and run and to say that from now on the public will be told what the Government chooses to tell them. It will be for people in the Dáil to try by various stratagems to dig out the truth.</P>

Their absence is particularly marked. Throughout Committee Stage, the Minister of State in the Department of Finance failed to make one appearance.

      <P>I wish to refer again to the Minister's comment in his opening contribution on Second Stage when he said: &ldquo;I do not accept that it is in the public interest that the Government's consideration of issues should be weakened.&rdquo;  In that statement the Minister was saying that the Freedom of Information Act has in some way weakened the process of government. However, it is being recognised by a growing section of the population that the weakening of the Government has nothing to do with the Freedom of Information Act but is due to the Government's component parts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister is flying in the face of everything that was good, purposeful and direct in the Freedom of Information Act 1997. There should be a full review of the working of this Bill. I wish to highlight one section which needs to be <Col N="91" /> addressed, that which refers to the Offences Against the State Act. This will be employed as a crutch to refuse access to information that is critical to people who have been denied the opportunity of seeking compensation following the Supreme Court decision in 1991 in relation to the outworkings of the Offences Against the State Act and the denial to them of the right to employment within the Civil Service and the various arms of Government, nationally and locally. A review by the Information Commissioner would highlight the unconstitutionality of this continued association with the Offences Against the State Acts, which series of Acts were committed by this Government for review and repeal directly as a result of the Good Friday Agreement. It is wrong to continue to include that section in the so-called amending legislation. I support Amendments Nos. 2 and 4.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government must be able to carry out its business in an orderly way. All organisations have the right to decide how to carry out their business and the Government is no different. The Government has considered this Bill carefully. It is not a rushed measure. We set up a high-level group of Secretaries General to examine all aspects of the existing freedom of information legislation. The group looked carefully at the working of the Act and made a number of recommendations which are now being implemented in this Bill.</P>
      <P>Freedom of information is important but it cannot be allowed to interfere with the Government doing its business efficiently in the interests of the community. While the various interest groups may have a legitimate view about the operation of Government, they are not responsible to the Oireachtas and the electorate. The Government is mindful of its responsibility to the people through the parliamentary process. It is in the public interest that Government acts in an efficient and effective way, and this is what the Bill is about.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Government was mindful of the political process, the Minister would not guillotine every debate here. Neither would he have gone to the Seanad without even having his amendments ready. The Seanad sought to debate an issue about which the Houses of the Oireachtas had not had the opportunity to have any hearings. Even though Ministers were saying on air that they welcomed hearings, they were trying to ram the Bill through the Seanad. The Government has little or no respect for Parliament. One of the key measures in the Bill is to remove the right to obtain background information on parliamentary business. It is a direct assault on Parliament's ability to have some opportunity of gaining access to a reasonable amount of information.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As Deputy Boyle said, the empty Progressive Democrats benches tell us everything. I can recall <Col N="92" /> the words of Deputy O'Donnell in 1997 when she said: &ldquo;I can envisage the Government of the day, which has possession of certain information, being determined to bleed the public interest in order to withhold that information&rdquo;. That is precisely what we have today. The Minister is seeking to withhold information and his explanation is that the public interest demands it. What evidence does he offer for that? None.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Interestingly, I tabled parliamentary questions to each Minister in turn to know if they had any examples in their Departments of cases where information had been released that had been damaging to the decision-making process or the public interest. Not one Minister volunteered any such information and some of the replies are revealing. For example, the Minister for Foreign Affairs was not even aware that under section 19, which deals with Government, there is discretion and that it is not a mandatory refusal to release information. He said that it provides for no public interest test, so he does not even understand the legislation he now purports to be a party to amending.</P>
      <P>Similarly, the Minister for the Environment and Local Government was not aware of that provision. At least the Minister for Health and Children is frank; he said &ldquo;I am not aware of any case where disclosure by any office has had a significant, negative impact on the public interest&rdquo;. He is perhaps one of the Ministers who has had more occasion than most to see issues being debated in public that have emerged from public interest requests. At least that is one Minister who is honest.</P>
      <P>The reply from the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform is quite extraordinary. He said, &ldquo;I am not clear as to how the public interest could be better served in any instance by, in effect, refusing to comply with the law of the land&rdquo;. He is conscious that no damage has ever been done to the decision-making process by releasing information under a public interest request, yet he is a member of the Government that is seeking to change the legislation. It is absolutely clear that there is no evidential or other basis for making these changes. If the Government was sincere about what it is doing it would give the public an opportunity to have a say by agreeing to the sort of review that is at the heart of these amendments. In that way we would have a period during which the Government could produce evidence of damage that could be done, if there is any. No such evidence has been cited, however.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One suggestion was that the New Zealand example had revealed such evidence but when I went to check that I discovered the legislation dates back many years and the so-called sudden discovery of potential damage pre-dated the introduction of our legislation. The Government <Col N="93" /> has no evidence to support the contention that the public interest has been damaged by the Freedom of Information Act 1997.</P>
    <P>The Government is unwilling to accept the basis on which it was elected to Government. Ministers were given their seals of office on the basis that their decisions would be subject to examination and scrutiny five years after being reached but they now wish to step back from that commitment. It is unrealistic to bring in procedures such as, for example, the certification system whereby there will be no review, appeal or test of reasonableness. We are expected to accept that sort of system which shuts down access to information. The Bill is a bad day's work. The House should agree to the review that is the subject of these two amendments so that at least we can gain time and the weight of public opinion can penetrate the thinking of the 15 Cabinet Minister's on the other side of the House.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DanBoyle" hpid="Mr. Boyle Mr. Boyle">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boyle</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 3:</P>
      <P>In page 5, between lines 7 and 8, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;1.&ndash;The long title of the Principal Act is amended by substituting &lsquo;PERSONS' for &lsquo;MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC'.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This amendment arises from the suggestion of the Information Commissioner in his commentary. He believes that in order to remove any confusion on whether the right of access is confined to natural persons, the reference to &ldquo;members of the public&rdquo; in the Principal Act should be replaced by &ldquo;persons&rdquo;. There seems to be some logic in suggesting this change. Having listened to the Minister's arguments on Committee Stage, I am not too sure what his logic is in not accepting it. The amendment is mainly technical in nature and I would again ask the Minister to accept it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Amendment No. 7 builds upon that change in that having changed the reference to &ldquo;members of the public&rdquo; to &ldquo;persons&rdquo;, an interpretative definition of &ldquo;person&rdquo; is required within the Bill. In his commentary, the Information Com<Col N="94" /> missioner suggested that the definition of &ldquo;person&rdquo;, as it appears in the Interpretation Act 1937, without the clause unless the contrary intention appears, is sufficient and should be included. Amendments Nos. 3 and 7, therefore, are linked in that respect.</P>
    <P>Amendments Nos. 8 and 9 are variations of my amendment No. 7 and either one or the other would be acceptable in terms of bringing about a necessary change to the Bill.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 13, as the Minister brought to our notice on Committee Stage, would insert a technical change in the Bill concerning a statutory regulation the Minister made to include local authorities and health boards. The reference needs to be specially made in the Bill and it seems to be acceptable as it was reported to us on Committee Stage. I only hope the Minister will be as willing to accept Opposition amendments as we have been to accept sensible Government amendments on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>Even at this late stage in our consideration of the Bill, perhaps the Minister could respond to one question. The Minister has always used the argument that the changes he was making to the Bill were to bring our legislation in line with similar provisions in other jurisdictions. I challenge the Minister, however, to name one parliamentary democracy that is introducing additional legislation that seeks to restrict freedom of information laws already granted to its citizens. He will find that we are the only country that is going in the opposite direction. Having produced legislation in 1997, which is a template for other parliamentary democracies &ndash; in fact, it has been adopted in its entirety by the Scottish Parliament &ndash; the Government has deliberately chosen to restrict information in a way that runs counter to every other country in the developed world.</P>

      <P>I wish to address amendment No. 3, as did Deputy Boyle.</P>
      <P>I will also address amendment No. 9 in my name, the spirit of which is also reflected in amendments Nos. 7 and 8. These amendments were recommended by the Information Commissioner and, as such, must hold some weight. They are extremely important in that they seek to verify the definition of a person and the right of an individual to access directly information on his or her own behalf or on behalf of an advocacy or representative group representing the interests and information needs of those for whom often times the prospect is daunting or prohibitive. We have had many examples in the recent past of important work being carried out by advocacy groups and we have named them repeatedly. I reflect again on the important work of SOCA, the One in Four group, Parents for Justice and a range of others who are doing important and wonderful work on behalf of many who could not organise access to critical information on their own behalf.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Supplanting the word &ldquo;persons&rdquo; for &ldquo;members of the public&rdquo; clearly and explicitly spells out the <Col N="95" /> real intent of the initial legislation and removes any prospect of debarment being placed in the way of legitimate inquiries. I appeal to the Minister to accept this important amendment which seeks to uphold the rights and entitlements of all to information.</P>
    <P>On amendment No. 9, the definition of &ldquo;person&rdquo;, as presented in the wording, is in line with the stated formula in the Interpretation Act 1937 and, therefore, already has a status in legislation to which surely the Minister will not now object. I urge the Minister to accept amendments Nos. 3 and 9 and the related amendments.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB" hpid="Ms Burton Ms Burton">
      <NameTxt>Ms Burton</NameTxt>
      <P>Amendment No. 8 is in line with recommendations made by the Information Commissioner. In the Minister's pathetic attempt to suggest that a broad-ranging consultation process took place, he made the suggestion that the Information Commissioner had been consulted and that his recommendations had been taken on board. However, I repeat that the Information Commissioner told the committee that he found out about the work of the high-level review group through the media and in reply to a question from Deputy Finneran he said that he heard about it, to use Deputy Finneran's words, &ldquo;through the grapevine&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The way the Government has chosen to deal with this public office holder who is independent of the Dáil and Government is shabby and underhand. It is particularly shabby when it is allied to the unprecedented and unwarranted attack on this office holder by no less a person than the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform who normally sits smirking and squirming on the benches opposite, but today no member of his party nor his august self is present to hear any part of the discussion on Report Stage of the Bill.</P>
      <P>What is happening is very much what the Greeks call &ldquo;hubris&rdquo;, in that the Government, two weeks after being re-elected, decided that empowering the citizenry to find out what was going on, to request information on the activities of Government and on their personal records, represented too much openness and transparency. With the prospect of five more years in office, it decided there was a lot to be done and that it would start by changing the Freedom of Information Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I regret the intemperate attacks made by the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform on the holder of the Office of Information Commissioner. In many ways this Minister has supplemented that insult made to the independent office holder by repeating, as the Taoiseach did this morning, the suggestion that the office holder was consulted. The office holder was not consulted. He rushed to put forward a number of suggested amendments, of which this is one. It behoves the Government to accept the amendments which have been offered by the Information Commissioner based on his experience of the operation of the Act over a five year period <Col N="96" /> and on his impartial holding of an office to which he has given great credit.</P>
    <P>When the newspaper proprietors made a presentation to the committee, one of the points they made, which was also made by others, was that the Freedom of Information Act was legislation of which a modern and prosperous Ireland could be proud. They also pointed out that the Act not only has been used as a model in recent times by the Scottish Executive in preparing the Scottish freedom of information Act, but has been widely used in eastern Europe by those states which are in the process of joining the Europe Union over the next few years.</P>
    <P>It is ironic that just as Ireland has a law of which politicians and the public service can be justifiably proud, the Government should rush to change it. It is a mark of the Taoiseach and the Government, particularly the Minister for Finance, that in their bad-tempered response to the mere notion that their motives for changing the Freedom of Information Act might be impugned or exposed for what they are, basically to hide information from the public, they should in such a cavalier fashion reject out of hand those amendments, such as the one I tabled, which were legitimately put forward by an independent office holder for consideration by the Government.</P>

      <P>I will not be accepting amendments Nos. 3, 7, 8 or 9. I explained on Committee Stage that the Attorney General has advised against such amendments on the basis that the Freedom of Information Act, taken with the 1937 Interpretation Act, provides that the right of access under FOI to records is conferred on natural persons. The advice I have received is that a formula that conferred such a right on three different yet apparently equal categories could create a legally problematic situation in the event of competing claims being made as to the ownership of information released under the FOI.</P>
      <P>Amendment No. 13 in my name will supersede Statutory Instruments 516 and 517 of 1998, which defined the commencement date of the Act for local authorities and health boards as 21 October 1998 and removed a potential overlap between section 6(9) of the principal Act and the First Schedule. These statutory instruments will be revoked.</P>
      <P>Deputy Boyle made the point that our FOI system is more liberal in terms of protection of records of Government than other jurisdictions. The purpose of this Bill is to bring the level of protection of such records up to a comparable standard. Even after enactment of this Bill, Ireland will continue to have a liberal FOI regime on the international stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For those who contend that the Government is out of step or that the measures in this Bill go too far, I draw their attention to the following provisions of Freedom of Information Acts overseas with which our Act is commonly compared. In Australia, the secretary to the Department of the Prime Minister has the power to certify that <Col N="97" /> a document is a Cabinet document. Such a certificate establishes conclusively that the document is exempt. In New Zealand, a record may be withheld if it is necessary to maintain the constitutional conventions which protect collective and individual ministerial responsibility or the confidentiality of advice tendered by Ministers of the Crown and officials. In Canada, the Act does not apply at all for 20 years to a long and non-exhaustive list of Cabinet confidences including communications used for reflecting communications or discussions between Ministers of the Crown on matters relating to the making of Government decisions or the formulation of Government policy and records, the purpose of which is to brief Ministers of the Crown in relation to matters that are before Cabinet. In the United Kingdom, specific protection is afforded to ministerial communications and protection is also afforded to information which would or would be likely to prejudice the maintenance of the convention of collective ministerial responsibility or which would or would be likely to inhibit the free and frank provision of advice or exchange of views for the purpose of deliberation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>By using those examples the Minister is illustrating the Opposition's point. In the case of the UK they are talking about the likelihood of certain things emerging &ndash; in other words, there is to be a harm test in relation to the protection of Government records. Here we are proposing that there should be no harm test; the whole thrust of what the Minister is doing is to dismantle the harm tests which have been carefully put into the existing Act.</P>
      <P>To bring in a certification procedure without appeal, review or any test of reasonableness flies in the face of the examples cited by the Minister. We have seen evidence of this with the high-level group to which the Minister refers in glowing terms. It has not offered any examples of damage or harm being done. The situation is the same in New Zealand, where the restrictive protections afforded are tightly linked to Cabinet and Government decisions. We are talking here about throwing a very wide net of secrecy so that virtually all ministerial communications will be protected. There is no test for a document being furnished to Cabinet or memorandum in Cabinet in the Minister's provisions. He is giving blanket protection to ministerial communications if there is anything under consideration, and &ldquo;under consideration&rdquo; can be defined so widely, it will not be the tight procedure he pretends it will be.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister is giving examples to deflect attention from what he is doing. Let us judge this against our own standards and needs. We have had serious problems with tribunals arising out of a culture of secrecy about decisions and we must lay those problems to rest. Rather than looking for examples to bolster the wrong position he is adopting, the Minister should look at this honestly and ask if Ireland needs to bring this code <Col N="98" /> of secrecy, this <i>omertà,</i> into our system of Government. We do not need it and citing obscure examples from other countries will not convince me it is needed. We have had five years of good operation of the Freedom of Information Act and there is no evidence of damage being done to justify these changes. We should allow the Act to continue working successfully as it has done in the past.</P>

      <P>The Minister did not respond to my question in his reply. He has not given one example of a country where existing freedom of information legislation has been made more restrictive. The argument constantly made by the Government relates to common law systems and cites Canada, Australia and New Zealand. As Deputy Bruton said, the harm-based measure is most common in these systems, particularly in New Zealand, not the class-based measure. The Minister's boast that we will continue to have a liberal system after this Act is implemented is untrue and stretches credibility.</P>
      <P>The Minister restricted his contributions to common law systems but he totally eschewed the Scandinavian models, which are far ahead of us in liberality. It is also a fact that Canada and Australia are reviewing their legislation to make it less restrictive. The Minister's statement that we are making our situation the same as everyone else's when everyone else is making their legislation better is an insult to the House and to our citizens. He is totally ignoring the experience of the Information Commissioner in this area and pouring cold water over necessary amendments forged on the basis of that experience.</P>

      <P>The Minister cited the example of Australia but he should know the amendments made to the Australian legislation are widely regarded there and in other countries as significantly shutting down access to freedom of information. In his remarks on the Australian legislation the Minister referred to the Secretary General to the Cabinet being able to certify the deliberative process.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This legislation, in a departure from what the high-level group recommended, provides that the <Col N="99" /> certification process is not confined to the Secretary General to the Cabinet. According to section 14, the Secretary General of any Department can certify the deliberative process without end &ndash; there are no time limits whatsoever. A Secretary General can certify the deliberative process not just in relation to his or her Department but in relation to any other Department also.</P>
    <P>The most odious sections of the Bill are sections 13 and 14, which deal with the extension of the concept of Government to everybody and anybody and the certification process. What has been done to the freedom of information legislation in Australia has been much criticised as extremely damaging but the Minister has gone much further with this legislation. He has also gone further than the high-level group's report and now we have a process opening up which is effectively a secret Government.</P>
    <P>All the Secretary General has to do under the new Act is certify and give the number of certificates. He or she does not have to give the topics of the certification process or the members of the Cabinet committee or group of officials who may be part of that deliberative process. This is serious interference and the amendments introduced by the Minister on Committee Stage have made the Bill a much more secretive and destructive measure.</P>

      <NameTxt>Caoimhghín Ó Caoláin</NameTxt>
      <P>When replying the Minister stated that the amending legislation was bringing the existing Act &ldquo;up to a comparable standard&rdquo;. The reality is that we recognise, as does the Minister, that he is bringing the Act down to a comparable standard rather than up to best practice. The high-level review group looked at international experience and referred to the British legislation when examining some aspects of our existing Act; this is reflected in some of the amendments which were presented. British legislation is inferior to ours and has always been recognised as such. The Minister should be ashamed of bringing down our standards. We have legislation in place of which he, like everyone else, should be proud.</P>
      <P>Important legislation will be emasculated through the Minister's refusal to accept the thrust of the amendments, which seek to guarantee the right of access not only of individuals, but also of those who would represent them. He went some way towards accepting this assessment in relation to parents, siblings and representatives of the deceased in one of the small concessions he made on Committee Stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Given the reluctance of many of those within the named bodies under the Freedom of Information Act to fully co-operate with the legislation and the minimalist attitude many of them adopt, there are genuine concerns that advocacy groups will be faced with denial and refusal to release information. As I have stated before, the proposals will tie the Government in legal knots. <Col N="100" /> Rather than facilitating the better working of Government, the Minister is introducing mechanisms which will act as trip wires along the way and into the future.</P>
    <P>All the changes being introduced will be undone at some point in the future. This Minister will not do so, but it will be done. Irrespective of the <i>raison d'être</i> behind the approach to the legislation, namely, the fast approaching 21 April deadline, everything the Minister seeks to conceal will ultimately be revealed.</P>

      <P>Deputy Burton referred to the revisions made by the Australians to their freedom of information legislation. The question must be asked as to why they felt it was important to so do. They introduced a high level of charges and made some significant changes.</P>
      <P>It is interesting to note that the United Kingdom Act will not come into force until January 2005. It could not, therefore, be clear to Deputy Richard Bruton how the harm test in its sections will be interpreted.</P>

      <P>I wish to comment on a point Deputy Burton made on the last amendment and on previous occasions. The notion that the Freedom of Information Act 1997 grew out of the activities of Charles J. Haughey is a travesty of the historical record. Freedom of information legislation was in place in a number of countries prior to 1997 and the introduction of similar legislation here had been a long-standing goal of the Labour Party and others. The Act had nothing to do with the activities of Charles Haughey. It is ludicrous to think that, despite all that has emerged from the tribunals and other fora, freedom of information legislation, regardless of its format, would have had a bearing on some of the activities alleged to have been committed by the former Member of the House in question.</P>

Short of being shown the Attorney General's advice, I do not accept the validity of his arguments or the basis on which they have been made.

      <P>In page 5, to delete lines 21 to 23.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="102" /> This amendment has been tabled to reflect the concern that the Bill limits the definition of the term &ldquo;factual information&rdquo; to statistical or empirical data. In its submission to the Joint Committee on Finance and the Public Service, the Irish Council for Civil Liberties highlighted its concerns about this element of the amending legislation. Given the significant change it represents and its potentially severe impact on the current workings of the principal Act, the ICCL has suggested that limiting what is considered factual &ndash; and therefore accessible &ndash; material to purely empirical or statistical data could greatly increase the categories of information which will be denied or refused to an inquirer on the grounds that they would be exempt from the Act. I share the ICCL's view that this change goes to the very heart of the current statute and will result in large areas of policy being deemed outside the operation of the Act.</P>
    <P>As I indicated in my earlier contribution, the fact that the high-level review group paid particular attention to the British legislation and cites the British Act, which is by all interpretation weaker in its standards of right to information, is, therefore, a fundamental weakness in the group's approach. Rather than looking for best practice and examining examples arising from experiences in other jurisdictions which would better inform, the high-level review group seems to have confined itself to examining the British Act and cites it accordingly. It should have looked much further afield and informed itself using experiences in this area obtained in a wide international field. Accordingly, I seek the deletion of lines 21 to 23 on page 5 and that the current reference in the substantive Act stands. I ask the Minister to accept the amendment.</P>

      <P>I will not accept the amendment which would result in the removal of the definition of the term &ldquo;factual information&rdquo; from the Bill. The matter was debated at considerable length on Committee Stage when I explained that the provision had its origins in a concern expressed by the high-level group that there was some misunderstanding in this area. The definition is intended to clarify the matter and is based on the Attorney General's advice that factual information comprehends things that are known to have occurred, to exist or to be true in the sense of being tangible facts and figures.</P>

      <P>I disagree. There is a body of information from respected, informed opinion within our society that suggests what is intended is a further restriction on access to information. As with so much of the amending legislation, it offers a crutch to those within the system who want to deny or refuse the release of specific information to an individual, the representative of an individual or media interests.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I refer to the limiting of the definition of &ldquo;factual information&rdquo;. It comes as no surprise that the Government's legal advice supports such a view. <Col N="103" /> I expect this is not only the Minister's opinion but is also the result of Cabinet deliberations, of which the Attorney General is a component. This is another element of the overall thrust of the Government's effort to curtail access to information and to restrict the rights of the individual, as enshrined in the original Act and its various extensions in terms of bodies to whom it applies over the years.</P>

      <P>In page 5, between lines 28 and 29, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;3.&ndash;Section 3 of the Principal Act is amended by inserting the following subsection after subsection (6):</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&lsquo;(7) The Minister shall collect, collate and publish (within two months of the end of each calendar year) relevant statistics in relation to freedom of information usage in the relevant year and shall by regulation require public bodies to provide him or her with such statistics, and in such manner (including timescale) as the Minister deter<Col N="104" /> mines in relation to freedom of information usage in the relevant year.'.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>In his valedictory commentary on the legislation, the Information Commissioner suggested that the following key requirements, which I have attempted to put together in the amendment, should be inserted in amending legislation: an obligation on the Minister for Finance to collect, collate and publish within two months of each calendar year relevant statistics relating to freedom of information usage in the relevant year and an obligation on public bodies to provide the Minister with such statistics and in such manner, including timescale, as the Minister determines in regard to freedom of information usage in the relevant year.</P>
    <P>This amendment and similar amendments resulted in considerable debate on Committee Stage. The Minister argued that existing information statistics on usage were sufficient while Opposition members argued they were not. It was not a case of a Monty Python sketch with us saying &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; and the Minister saying &ldquo;No&rdquo;. The information presented in the various reports is nothing less than a listing of numbers and, if information is to have validity in terms of the success of freedom of information, it must be linked to the type of requests made and the circumstances in which they are made with some form of codifying in the various Departments regarding whether requests are responded to in given timescales, the number of refusals and why.</P>
    <P>Some of this information is available in tabular, numerical form but that is an empty presentation of information. It is also a format that the Information Commissioner does not consider to have a great deal of significance or value. The amendment, in these terms, should be acceptable to the Minister if it is the intention of the amending legislation to make information more widely available and to make its usage by the citizenry more comprehensible in terms of its analysis. Otherwise, it is part of the Minister's attempt to drag the legislation down to a level where it has little practical use for many people, particularly those of us who aspire to a society based on freedom of information principles.</P>

      <P>I join Deputy Boyle in recommending the amendment to the Minister. The amendment was also recommended by the Information Commissioner who, undoubtedly, had full access to the Department's publication, which the Minister happily quoted at some length on Committee Stage. However, the commissioner recognised there is an undoubted deficit that needs to be addressed in terms of the collation and presentation of information on the workings of the original Act. The operation of the Act must be kept under constant review and accurate and detailed information on its operation is essential. Despite the Minister's efforts to dissuade Opposition Members on Committee Stage, there is still a considerable argument to support the Information Commissioner's contention and we hope <Col N="105" /> the Minister will accept the amendment, which is minor in comparison to much of what is proposed in the Bill.</P>

      <P>I support the amendment. I ask the Minister to extend the certification reporting that he has introduced in the legislation to include the subject matter that has been certified as secret by the Secretary General to the Government in the case of committees or the Secretaries General of individual Departments in the case of the deliberative process. This issue was debated at considerable length on Committee Stage. The Minister sought to give assurances that there would be other ways to obtain such information but he did not succeed in convincing anyone that these ways would be open, transparent or easily accessible. He suggested that Members who wanted to know what was certified would have to table parliamentary questions on a regular basis to ascertain this information.</P>
      <P>I remind the Minister of Deputy McDaid's comments on Committee Stage of the original Bill in 1997. He stated: &ldquo;Any information that is exempted must be included in a confidentiality list with a description sufficient to enable the public to challenge the exclusion in the list.&rdquo;  Deputy McDaid was speaking then on behalf of the Fianna Fáil Party and he had the right idea. The Minister has introduced a half-hearted amendment that has only served to reveal the extent of the secrecy he intends. I assumed the Secretaries General would automatically list anything they certified and it would become a matter of public record. It was only when the Minister brought in his amendment to provide that only the number of such certificates would be recorded that the sheer scale of the secrecy he has in mind struck home. It is very important that if these extraordinary powers of certification are to come into operation, without the right of review or appeal or any test of reasonableness, at the very minimum the public should see what is being certified. At least there should be an awareness that this protection was being imposed and that citizens were being denied access to information. There could be an insistence that it would be removed as soon as either the deliberative process or the work of the committee had been concluded.</P>

Part of his contribution was to savage the health services in 1987 and the dilemma we face today is directly his legacy. Mr. Haughey, in the estimation of many people, suffered from <i>folie de grandeur,</i> in which he really believed that, as a Napoleon of the Irish political scene, he could walk on water.</P>

      <P>I have the floor, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle. May I have the protection of the Chair from the Minister's interruption? This amendment by Deputies Boyle and Ó Caoláin is a modest attempt to reinstate a culture of publication of information and statistics. It is very worthy of support. In sections 13 and 14 of this Bill, the net of secrecy has been cast far and wide. We will now have secret committees of Government, unnamed, untitled and unknown as to their subject. In relation to the deliberative process, we will have secretive certification, unnamed and untitled, by Secretaries General of Departments. The lack of capacity of the Opposition, the media and the general public to know very much about the operation of Government, except as the Government may choose to tell us through the army of spin doctors it employs, will effectively make the work of the Opposition, the media, public bodies and citizens' groups much more difficult. I am happy to support this amendment as a small step towards retaining some level of public accountability in relation to freedom of information.</P>

      <P>I am not accepting this amendment. On Committee Stage, I explained the reason I considered that a prescriptive obligation on the Minister for Finance to collect various statistics, and on public bodies to provide such statistics to the Minister, was unnecessary. Comprehensive statistics on usage of the FOI Act are already collated both by the Department of Finance and the Office of the Information Commissioner. These are published in the annual reports of the Minister for Finance and the Information Commissioner. Contacts have been established between the Department of Finance and the Office of the Information Commissioner with a view to simplifying and standardising the process of statistical collation. I gave chapter and verse on Committee Stage as to the details contained in the report of the Minister for Finance on the Freedom of Information Act. I am satisfied the statements in the annual report are comprehensive and give a very full insight into the <Col N="107" /> usage of FOI in each of the 370 bodies covered by the Act.</P>
      <P>In the interests of historical accuracy in relation to the beef tribunal report prepared by the late Mr. Justice Liam Hamilton and in fairness to Mr. Haughey and others, the passage referred to &ndash; if memory serves me correctly, as I believe it does &ndash; was in the detailed back-up documentation relating to a parliamentary question answered by Mr. Ray Burke, not by Mr. C.

      <P>The Minister is making the same argument. The information in the annual report is simply a listing of numbers. There are far better examples of annually collated information in other areas. For instance, the Ombudsman's report goes into far greater detail as to the reasons particular complaints were made. Information collected by the Department of the Environment and Local Government in terms of issues such as water and air pollution licences and breaches of same, go into quite specific detail as to breaches by local authorities, including the nature of such breaches, the period over which they occurred and the identity of complainants. We are simply asking that whatever information is sought under FOI is set out in a statistical format that is user friendly and has real meaning in terms of access and transparency. What the Minister proposes to continue is nothing but a meaningless set of statistics. I would argue that we have more than enough meaningless statistics, particularly in the Minister's Department.</P>

So much for our hopes when we come to more substantive areas of the Bill if, indeed, the time provided allows.

      <P>I propose amendment No. 11:</P>
      <P>In page 5, between lines 28 and 29, to insert the following:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;3.&ndash;Section 3 of the Principal Act is amended in subsection (1) by the addition <Col N="108" /> after paragraph (<i>a</i>) of the following paragraph:</P>
    <P>&lsquo;(<i>aa</i>) by regulations amend the Third Schedule so as to insert therein reference to any additional provision of an enactment as appears to the Minister to be appropriate having regard to the spirit and purpose of this Act,'.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The purpose of this amendment is to give effect to proposals made by the Information Commissioner. This would allow additional Acts to be added to the Third Schedule by regulations, thereby enabling such Acts to be overridden by this Act, rather than being in conflict with it. This amendment is clearly desirable. It would mean that, when legislation is introduced, it would be automatically subject to the Freedom of Information Act. The Government, during its pathetic defence of its Bill, has been at pains to point out that the Act has been extended to quite a number of public bodies, as was required by the legislation which the Labour Party introduced. The proposal by the Information Commissioner would make such a move automatic. In terms of the Information Commissioner being an independent office holder, the proposal being put forward is sensible and reasonable. It involves no discomfort to the Government, Departments or civil servants &ndash; it simply makes sense in the context of the commissioner's experience of the working of the Act. The Minister's rejection of it is part of the general disdain he has for the Information Commissioner's office.</P>
    <P>With the passage of this Act, I wonder if it will be worthwhile speaking in broad terms about an Information Commissioner as that office pertains to the working of the Government and Departments. I foresee a time in the future when recalcitrant heads of other bodies, such as health board and educational institutions, may well seek to come back under the ambit of Departments in order to get the secrecy and protection the Minister is introducing in dismantling this Act.</P>

      <P>One of the great innovations introduced by the previous Administration was the restatement process. This process means that when a Bill is amended, rather than going through a process of consolidation, a process of restatement takes place. This restates the principal Act in the format following amendments. This was introduced on the advice of the former Attorney General, Deputy McDowell. The restated Act will be available and will be easily understood.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I will not accept this amendment. On Committee Stage, I said the principal Act has given a <Col N="109" /> joint committee of the Houses a specific function in the reviewing of secrecy provisions in other enactments. It would not be appropriate for the Minister for Finance to interfere with the joint committee. I also explained that the advice of the Attorney General was against this amendment.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 12:</P>
      <P>In page 5, to delete lines 29 and 30.</P>
      <P>The purpose of this amendment is to delete the section whereby, from now on, heads of sections and senior civil servants will no longer have to place notices in <i>Iris Oifigiúil. </i> The thrust of this Bill, and the amendments the Minister introduced on Committee Stage, show the intentions of the Government and the new reign of secrecy it proposes. The former requirement of putting material into <i>Iris Oifigiúil</i> will now be suspended. In the Alice in Wonderland-type world the Government is creating in sections 13 and 14, the definition of &ldquo;Government&rdquo; will be extended not just to Ministers and Ministers of State, but to advisers &ndash; including eminent people like Senator Mansergh in his time and also constituency advisers &ndash; and any other person or group of people. This latter group could include consultants or economic advisers, we have no idea &ndash; it could be anybody. This will no longer have to be notified in any way. All that will happen under this Bill is a certification process. All that has to be published is the number of certificates issued. There is no title to explain what the committee is about, nor is the membership of the committee elaborated on.</P>
      <P>When it commented on the deliberative process, the high level group of civil servants wanted to expand the notion of the harm test. The group did not seek to go as far as the Government has gone in this Bill. The Government now proposes to give each secretary general the right to certify, without end, the deliberative process, not only for his or her own Department but for other Departments. It will be possible for the Department of Foreign Affairs to cross certify much deliberation from a range of Departments as impacting on international affairs or other issues and rendering it secret for an unlimited period.</P>
      <P>On Committee Stage, the Minister argued that <i>Iris Oifigiúil</i> was irrelevant to many people. The average punter on Grafton Street will never have heard of <i>Iris Oifigiúil.</i> Why should they have? Nonetheless, members of the Oireachtas and the media know what <i>Iris Oifigiúil</i> is and know notices published in it are often important and significant and give indications that ought to be raised here or by the media.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This section of the Act is being dismantled. While the Minister's explanation was benign, in the context of sections 13 and 14 of this Bill, the Labour Party requests the Minister to leave the notification process in <i>Iris Oifigiúil</i> intact. Such notification may be the only way we will have in <Col N="110" /> the future to access information about committees and deliberations of Government.</P>

      <P>Of all the recommendations of the Information Commissioner, it is interesting that this is the one the Minister has decided to accept. The Minister has set aside the other important and valuable recommendations of the commissioner, while Opposition Deputies argue they should be accepted. I have a difference of opinion with the Information Commissioner on this. It allows the Minister to drop part of what is currently required in the notification process and this speaks volumes.</P>
      <P>The amending Bill proposes to delete section 4 (<i>5</i>). This requires the head concerned to give notice of a delegation, revocation or amendment under subsection (3) to be published in <i>Iris Oifigiúil</i> within four weeks of the issuing of the delegation, revocation or amendment. What facilitation does this provide? It is a further curtailment on important information. Deputy Burton referred to the issue of certification by secretaries general regarding elements within the deliberative process. She instanced two Departments. I will instance the most pertinent example, as reflected in the recent past, of the secretary general in the Department of Finance <i>vis-à-vis</i> important decisions in the Department of Health and Children.</P>
      <P>This amendment contains a simple request from Opposition Deputies. The Minister may well hold on to the crutch of the Information Commissioner to argue about the use of <i>Iris Oifigiúil. Iris Oifigiúil</i> is referred to by Deputies and people who work within the Houses of the Oireachtas and is a vehicle of information from Government. It is the official Government information publication. I have no doubt it informs members of the media. Yet, the Minister is happy to adopt this singular exception from the Information Commissioner and to reject all that was good and valued in his contribution. This is most regrettable and I urge the Minister to reconsider and allow the current position to stand.</P>

      <P>I will not be accepting this amendment which would result in a requirement for notice of delegations made under section 4 of the main Act by the head of a public body to be published in <i>Iris Oifigiúil.</i> I am satisfied that the very wide range of information made available by my Department and by public bodies generally makes this requirement redundant. The suggestion that the requirement should be removed came from the Information Commissioner. I agree with his view that it is of questionable value. In my stroll through life I have made the observation that most people, politicians and journalists, often agree with people whose views coincide with theirs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The type of information about delegations made by the head of a public body only contains information regarding the grades of decision makers and reviewers in public bodies. It is of no <Col N="111" /> practical benefit to members of the public. The most useful information for members of the public is a list of FOI officers in all 370 bodies. That information is available in my Department. The list contains the names, addresses, telephone numbers, fax numbers and e-mails of all freedom of information officers.</P>

The public, therefore, effectively has no way of knowing what is going on.</P>
      <P>During Committee Stage the Minister went on at length about no longer needing to create a State Directory. That book which was compiled on a three year basis was of significant value to academics, researchers and the media who know how to use such information tools.

It can only fit into the category of seeking to shroud information, to deny official access to the deferral of responsibility by the notifying official.

      <P>In page 6, to delete lines 1 to 9.</P>
      <P>This amendment was strongly supported by the National Union of Journalists during their presentation to the committee. It proposes the deletion of the section which deals with the withdrawal of requests. That has already been done informally. The process has developed whereby when a person makes a request for information under FOI and that request is badly or poorly drawn up, the freedom of information officer, the decision maker, advises the requester that the information requested is poorly drawn or that its parameters are too wide. Informal discussions then take place between the requester and the information officer on what is the net point of his or her interest. That process has been useful.</P>
      <P>The NUJ spoke during their presentation of the work it had done, voluntarily, for the Department to assist it with training in relation to the development and use of the Act in the public service. This provision has been described by the NUJ as unnecessary. On the question of sensitive material, the question arises as to whether the balance will rest excessively with officials dealing with information requests rather than it lying with the public. There is no reason requests from the public for information should not be met. The public service and freedom information officer should endeavour, as far as possible, to facilitate such requests.</P>

      <P>The good practice of informal consultations taking place between deciding officers and requesters has greatly assisted the fair operation of the Act to the benefit of the person seeking the information. The whole spirit of the original Act was to make information available to the public unless there is a clear demonstration that the giving of such information would cause harm. The Labour Party listened to the presentation by the National Union of Journalists and we concur with its view on this matter.</P>
      <P>On the charging regime the Minister's Department is now introducing, I gave an example earlier of someone making a request for briefing documents in respect of the advice given to the Minister on cutting back on public expenditure. The documentation supplied as pertaining to this request was very wide and included dozens of parliamentary questions, advices given to the Minister by various sources and various memoranda to Government which were listed as being out of bounds under the current Act. The person making the request was requested by the Department to pay a fee of &euro;3,000 and a deposit of approximately &euro;500 even before the officials did any work. In future, if the person who made the request fails to pay such a deposit, all subsequent requests by him or her under the FOI Act will be disbarred. That is an important aspect, particularly in terms of a voluntary or community group which does not have substantial means. In the event of the request being withdrawn, will the onerous deposit of &euro;500 be refunded because there may be groups in Carrickmacross and elsewhere which might have reason to look to the Freedom of Information Act? This is potentially a very onerous section and I am not sure if the Minister has thought out the implications of what he is doing.</P>

      <P>This amendment seeks to delete the section which deals with three additional classes of information. Effectively, the public interest test is being significantly extended and the effect of this amendment is to make the Act more restrictive than is currently the case. The Act was introduced in the context of bringing in greater openness, transparency and accountability in contrast with the GUBU years, to which the Minister has already referred. It is sad that we appear to be turning the clock back in this Bill and shutting out the light in terms of our approach to freedom of information. This is a section to which organisations like the NUJ and others which appeared before the committee and which contacted Opposition Deputies had a legitimate objection. This amendment is brought forward in light of the experience of those who have used the Freedom of Information Act successfully. A glance at today's newspapers will reveal a number of interesting stories which throw light on the workings of Government but which may be closed down by this Bill in the future.</P>

This section provides that section 8 of the Principal Act is amended by substituting the words &ldquo;Subject to the provisions of this Act, in deciding&rdquo; for the words &ldquo;in deciding&rdquo; in subsection (4)(<i>b</i>) as set out in section 6.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As it is presently worded, section 8(4)(<i>b</i>) of the Principal Act provides in unqualified terms that <Col N="115" /> the motive of the person making the request cannot be considered when deciding whether to grant or refuse a request for records. This does not sit easily with section 10(1)(<i>e</i>) whereby a request can be refused if, in the opinion of the head of a public body, the request is frivolous or vexatious. The inclusion of &ldquo;Subject to the provisions of this Act&rdquo; is intended to ensure consistency between section 8(4)(<i>b</i>) and the Act generally.</P>
    <P>Section 5 also contains a consequential amendment to provisions contained elsewhere in the Bill which expand the number of exemptions that enable a public body to refuse to confirm or deny the existence of a record. I explained in some detail on Committee Stage why the potential for very specific requests to undermine protections for third party information made it necessary to expand the number of such exemptions.</P>

The Minister is now extending that from three to seven classes. Refusing to give the reasons to the person making the request is giving additional discretionary powers to civil servants to refuse information to the public.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The way the Minister has framed this Bill is an <Col N="116" /> indication of the fundamental philosophy which has informed him. That fundamental philosophy is that the public are to be denied access to information and the process is in the future to be made as difficult as possible. Once the process has been made as difficult as possible, the Minister or his successor from Fianna Fáil or the Progressive Democrats will say that people cannot even use the Act and therefore it is redundant. I am sure in due course we will see a future Minister from Fianna Fáil, or, the absent Progressive Democrats, arguing that in turn will be a reason for moving away from any notion of freedom of information altogether, which is basically what the Minister wants.</P>

      <P>What is proposed is a concealment of the existence of information sought when a refusal is decided. Why is this necessary? On what basis is this proposal required? Undoubtedly it will have a further negative effect in terms of the right to access information. The Minister has not given a logical argument to support his proposal.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Boyle</NameTxt>
      <P>This section has to do with being frivolous and vexatious, which typifies the approach of the Progressive Democrats to this Bill.</P>
      <P>In amendment No. 16, I seek to remove all references to the proposed amendment to section 10 of the principal Act, mainly because the Information Commissioner said in his commentary that in his experience, there has been a small number of freedom of information requesters whose behaviour can be regarded by certain public bodies as frivolous or vexatious, and his experience of review applications shows that there are even fewer.</P>
      <P>What the Minister is proposing, in a way that is quite insidious, is unnecessary. He is trying to introduce three sets of controls that will further limit the ability of individuals to ask whether information can be provided to them.</P>
      <P>He is introducing a subjective test by the information officer or the head of the Department as to whether the information being sought will require a great deal of work. Against the principle of natural justice, the head of a Department can regard as frivolous or vexatious a large number of requests coming from one person regardless of whether the individual requests have validity in their own right. This provision might be open to constitutional challenge. As in other areas of law, it is only possible to challenge the activity of the person not the person's record of seeking information at any given time. The Minister is leaving himself open to challenge by specifying that each individual request will not be treated equally if someone has not paid the fee for a previous request.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="119" />On each of these grounds, all of which have been described as unnecessary by the Information Commissioner, the Minister is introducing a series of controls only for the benefit of heads of Departments and all at the expense of people's right to access information. I cannot see under any heading of logic why the Minister wants to introduce such a measure. I can only presume it is in keeping with the philosophy behind this Bill, which is an attempt to make sure we do not have freedom of information legislation that is worth having.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CaoimhglinOCaolain" hpid="Caoimhghín Ó Caoláin Caoimhghín Ó Caoláin">
      <NameTxt>Caoimhghín Ó Caoláin</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to speak to each of the grouped amendments Nos. 16 to 19 and specifically to my amendment No. 17. This section in the amending legislation seeks to allow for the refusal of information to someone who has previously been a requester and who has not paid the fee prescribed. This is an injustice and a further barrier to access to information. As I argued on Committee Stage, a person may have a genuinely sustainable reason for refusing to pay at any point in time. Each request should be judged on its own merit. To introduce a further restriction, barrier and penalty on anybody who has refused to pay previously is not acceptable.</P>
      <P>On Committee Stage, the Minister failed to make the distinction between a previous failure and persistent failure and sought to equate them. In reality there is a marked difference. Somebody who has a previous failure may well be a genuine requester at any future time. A persistent failure comes under the area of frivolous or vexatious requests, which is already amply covered in the substantive legislation.</P>
      <P>Under this Bill, if a person fails to pay a fee on one occasion it may rule him or her out of exercising his or her democratic right to access information ever again, which is clearly discriminatory. It flies in the face of the intention of the substantive Act and is a major retrograde step cutting off once again the individual's entitlement. Therefore, the Minister should delete lines 1 to 3 on page 7.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB" hpid="Ms Burton Ms Burton">
      <NameTxt>Ms Burton</NameTxt>
      <P>The new arrangements proposed in the Bill are very onerous. As the Minister reminded me today, within the existing Act there are very wide powers available for dealing with vexatious or unreasonable requests. There are also very wide powers to charge requesters in some cases quite prohibitive fees.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Earlier I gave the example of somebody who recently requested information about the advice given to the Minister about public expenditure restrictions during the run up to the general election. The requester was advised this would take 14 staff members of the Department more than 130 working hours and would involve a cost of &euro;2,900 which the Department would charge the person seeking the information. To proceed with the request the person had to pay a deposit of &euro;500. That is very onerous for a small NGO, com<Col N="120" /> munity organisation or individual. It is also very onerous for freelance journalists who generally have to meet the outlay of their investigations and are only reimbursed in the event of being successful in selling on the story, which they may never even acquire.</P>
    <P>In many instances people make not just one FOI request but have to make a number of requests to different Departments. During the debate we had the example of information on trade with Poland. While the Department of Foreign Affairs excluded the request the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment was happy to give it. These are practical matters and in section 6 of the Bill which amends section 10 of the original Act the Minister is introducing a much wider discretionary power of effectively refusing information by making the cost prohibitive.</P>
    <P>Somebody who, having made a request for information, fails to meet the cost and is unable to properly withdraw the request, maybe because it is too expensive, is then effectively disbarred for life under this legislation. The Labour Party has suggested that if the Minister wants to do this, the disbarment should be for a period of 12 months.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach said today his Department does not charge for requests, unlike the Department of Finance which looks for its pound of flesh. A voluntary organisation, perhaps a community group, under its current officer board could make a request for instance for environmental information about something in the locality from the health board. Perhaps because the organisation was ill advised or was charged an excessive fee, even if it has a new officer board it will effectively be disbarred forever.</P>
    <P>I compliment the parliamentary draftsperson for the table set out on page 7, which is exceptionally clear. This provides that the head may refuse to grant a request on the grounds outlined in section (1)(<i>c</i>) of the table and section (1)(<i>e</i>) widens the frivolous or vexatious grounds. The Information Commissioner in his presentation for the Joint Committee on Finance and the Public Service pointed out that in his view this has not been sufficiently used because Departments were often afraid to use it. If this were used the vexatious example that was dragged out by dozens of Fianna Fáil backbenchers as the reason for the whole change and the desire by the Minister to withdraw freedom of information would not have arisen. The Information Commissioner pointed out that this was entirely unnecessary. The Secretary General of the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, when the high-level group came before the committee, again dragged out this one instance of a person who made numerous requests for information. This was easily dealt with, according to the Information Commissioner, under the present legislation.</P>
    <P>The Minister, however, is introducing a new and draconian regime which will rebound, in many cases, by putting freedom of information <Col N="121" /> requests out of the reach of ordinary citizens. It will damage the trade of journalism in terms of making multiple information requests to get information that should be in the public domain. In particular, it will adversely affect freelance journalists who, if they are not able to afford the large sums being demanded by the Department, may effectively find themselves disbarred for life from utilising the Act.</P>
    <P>If the Minister persists in putting this legislation, unamended, through the Dáil, I hope it will be possible for Uachtarán na hÉireann to refer it to the Council of State. It is a significant roll back on the rights of the citizenry and the free press to call the Government of the day to account. It is also an interference with the rights of Members of the Dáil and the Seanad to information.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the amendments. The Information Commissioner correctly pointed out that there are ample powers under the frivolous and vexatious provisions for heads of Departments to refuse freedom of information requests if there is a pattern of this nature. However, this power is not being used. Rather than seek to dismantle the rights of citizens in this way, the Minister should require that heads of Departments use the powers they already have.</P>
      <P>I share Deputy Burton's concern that subsection (<i>f</i>) is particularly poorly drafted. It is, effectively, a charter for catching people out. If they have failed on one previous occasion, they will be caught out. My amendment seeks to redress that and to include tests of reasonableness. The difficulty with this section is the difficulty we have with the entire Bill. Instead of having the heads of Departments assist people in getting information, the philosophy is being changed. The presumption of openness is gone, there is a mechanism to catch people out with their requests and to find ways to refuse them and there is unaccountable certification that closes down access to records.</P>
      <P>The philosophy of the Act is being undermined by this section as well as the others. People will be angry that a valuable asset is being whittled away in one way or another and this Bill is just another element in that process.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>I will not accept amendments Nos. 16, 17, 18 or 19. I am satisfied that section 6 of the Bill contains reasonable provisions which will serve to discourage inappropriate use of the Act while also serving to better protect public bodies against requests which involve a substantial and unreasonable interference with their work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to fees, it is mandatory under the existing Act for a fee to be charged to a requester in respect of search, retrieval and photocopying of records involving non-personal information, unless exceptional circumstances apply. When a decision is made to charge such fees, no records are released until the fee is paid or, if an appeal <Col N="122" /> of the fee is made, until after the appeal process under the Act has been exhausted. It is difficult to identify circumstances in which such fees could be said to be unreasonably withheld from a public body. The review mechanisms exist to deal with the issue of the reasonableness or otherwise of the existing fees. If a person believes a fee is unreasonable, he or she can exercise the right to appeal. Section 10 of the principal Act allows for discretion to be exercised so that if a person failed to pay a fee in the past for some genuine reason, such as illness or absence, the head can exercise his or her discretion in deciding whether to refuse a request if a previous fee, properly charged, is outstanding.</P>
    <P>Deputy Burton referred to Shylock in &ldquo;The Merchant of Venice&rdquo; by stating that the Department of Finance is seeking its pound of flesh. The great bard spoke in another great play, which can equally describe the comments from the Opposition during this debate, &ldquo;of sound and fury, Signifying nothing.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanBoyle" hpid="Mr. Boyle Mr. Boyle">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boyle</NameTxt>
      <P>I commend the Minister for being able to quote Shakespeare. It shows he is not a total loss or a cultural vacuum. The commentary of the Information Commissioner, especially on fees, was vivid in its warning to the Minister not to go down this road. The commissioner said he believed great caution must be exercised in taking into account, in deciding one request, the behaviour of the requester on an earlier request.</P>
      <P>He cited one case, which involved his office, between a Mr. A.B.W. and the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment. The same case was cited by the Secretary General of that Department when he spoke, as a member of the high level group, to the finance and public services committee when hearings were held on this Bill. While this individual is known within the Department and to the Information Commissioner for making a large number of requests, indeed, more than the combined number of requests made by the Irish media, none of the requests could individually be described as vexatious. All were general interest questions which should be of interest to members of the citizenry and could not be refused on any grounds. The Information Commissioner took that position.</P>
      <P>That being the case, the restrictions proposed by the Minister can be seen as nothing less than spiteful. If it is the intention to introduce new legislation that questions the right of an individual to ask as many questions as they see fit when the questions are valid, we are creating considerable problems for ourselves and our democracy.</P>

      <NameTxt>Caoimhghín Ó Caoláin</NameTxt>
      <P>I am deeply disappointed by the Minister's response to the reasonable amendments put forward by the Opposition spokespersons. We are seeking to remove a further obstacle to access which the Minister is proposing to introduce in this amending legislation. Again, I will focus on people who have not previously paid a fee. There may well be genuine <Col N="123" /> reasons for refusals that have already been reported. It is imperative that people do not face what has correctly been described by an earlier speaker as a life sentence of refusal to access information under the freedom of information legislation or to exercise their democratic right to secure information under that Act. Each request must be judged on its merit.</P>
      <P>This Bill is a further facilitation of refusal, which is the substance of the Minister's approach in rowing back on the important measures that were enshrined in the initial legislation. The fee, not only in the instance where there has already been a refusal to pay but also in the imposition of a fee for requests for information, is a tax on the individual and on civic action by those from the community and voluntary sector, something we highlighted to the Minister on Committee Stage. I strongly urge the Minister to reconsider. I reject this amending legislation outright.</P>

      <P>I will indicate that later, a Cheann Comhairle. I am delighted to have an opportunity to speak on the motion which deals with a subject that is of interest to many households. While we must accept that there is a problem, it is wrong to accuse the Government of ignoring the problem of school buildings. Since 1997, there has been a major investment in primary and post-primary schools throughout the country. We all have to accept responsibility for the fact that over the years previous Administrations did not invest adequate funds to provide proper accommodation and, as a result, a number of schools are in poor condition. However, the difficulties experienced by these schools can often be exaggerated. For example, when one hears about schools being rat infested one would have to ask questions about the boards of management involved. What board of management would allow a school to become rat infested? Most of us would have had experience of mice in schools, which was always a cause for laughter, but there is no excuse for having a rat-infested school.</P>
      <P>Some schools are in very poor condition, however, and it is important to address that matter. In his speech to the House yesterday, the Minister indicated that discussions were taking place between himself and the Minister for Finance with a view to putting in place a five-year capital programme. It is only right and fitting that that should be done because if a Minister knows what funds he will have for only one year, it is difficult for him to draw up a proper capital programme. I would like to see agreement being reached by both Ministers on that programme. The Minister, Deputy Noel Dempsey, should take account of the huge population increases that have occurred in the counties bordering Dublin. I am speaking specifically about Kildare with which I am most familiar. Small villages and towns in that county, where there was little or no growth up to five or six years ago, have witnessed a huge increase in population. That in turn has resulted in overcrowded conditions in many local schools. When the Minister examines the situation he should acknowledge that fact and provide the necessary resources to deal with it.</P>

    <P>When the Minister published his list during the year, many schools that were not included on it expressed their annoyance. In the long run, however, it will be to everyone's benefit to pursue the system that has now been started by the Mini<Col N="126" /> ster, which is much more transparent and will serve us well.</P>

      <P>This year the Minister introduced a pilot scheme for small rural schools which will have to be expanded upon. Up to now, the Department of Education and Science was dealing solely with builders whose only objective was to get as much profit out of any project as they could. Many people are willing to give something back to the community and they would have an opportunity to do so if this scheme was expanded. This is particularly the case concerning people whose children are attending local schools or who are themselves past pupils of such schools. They may be prepared to provide their services at a reduced cost &ndash; not seeking a profit but giving something back to the school from which they received so much themselves.</P>

      <P>Tá áthas orm an seans seo a fháil labhairt faoi chúrsaí oideachais mar níl aon rud níos tábhachtaí agus an t-airgead atá caite agus atá leagtha amach le caitheamh orthu ag an Aire, Nollaig Ó Diomsaigh. Having spent many years as a teacher, I welcome the Labour Party motion because it affords me a chance to debate education. Nothing affects our lives more than education, particularly in recent years when it has led to economic growth and, for want of a better term, the famous Celtic tiger.</P>
      <P>I note the word &ldquo;transparency&rdquo; in the motion but I would include the words balance and objectivity also. Although I am new to politics, I am not naive enough to expect Opposition parties to congratulate Governments on their achievements. Objectivity suggests, however, that the success of the past four or five years should at least be acknowledged. I will admit readily that there is an accommodation deficit in primary and post-primary schools but we should examine the contributory factors, some of which are the result of our success as a Government over the past few years.</P>
      <P>We must recognise that education has been under-resourced for many years by Governments of all colours. Another contributory factor is that the population growth predicted for 2011 on the east coast has already been surpassed and, thus, more children are seeking school places. Over the past four or five years, the Department of Education and Science has supplied 4,800 resource teachers, formerly referred to as remedial teachers, from a level of 400 or 500. Quite often such teachers have one room with one pupil, which obviously puts a strain on the system, although nobody would suggest that it was wrong to increase the supply of resource teachers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the same period, the Government has succeeded in reducing the pupil-teacher ratio to 19:1 <Col N="127" /> in primary schools and 15:1 in secondary schools. Since there are fewer students per school room, consequently more rooms are required. We must also consider the factor of competing needs and in this regard we should assess what the Government has spent its money on. I have already instanced the increase in resource teachers but there has also been a huge increase in the number of classroom assistants or special needs assistants as they are called. There has been unprecedented expenditure on new information and communication technology in addition to a welcome increase in expenditure on the disability sector. Given that only so much money is available, competing needs together with historical under-funding and the other factors I mentioned have all led to an accommodation deficit.</P>
    <P>Let us examine the alarm that has been caused by the Opposition over what it terms the &ldquo;huge cutback&rdquo;. I would not choose to use that term because the reality is that under the programme for 2003, &euro;342.9 million will be spent on the primary and post-primary sectors. That must be compared to the &euro;344 million that was spent in 2002. To my way of thinking, that represents a decrease of &euro;1.1 million, which is not a huge cutback. Later I will instance other cutbacks that have occurred under other Governments. There has been an overall increase in funding of 87% since 1997, the last time the Labour Party, the proposers of the motion, were in power. The number of primary teachers has increased by 3,450 and the number of secondary teachers has increased by 1,225. That represents a good use of resources.</P>
    <P>In 1997 when the Labour Party was last in power, some 30 primary school and 12 secondary school building projects were under way. In 2003, under this Government some 92 large-scale primary school and 12 secondary school projects have been addressed. That is not too bad if one compares like with like.</P>

      <P>Not enough. I am coming to that and I would be delighted to accept any help the Deputy might offer in having some completed in Wexford.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am bitterly disappointed that Gaelscoil Wexford did not come about. The Presentation Convent Wexford which opened in 1979 was promised a gymnasium. In 1994, a delegation from the school accompanied by Deputy Howlin met the former Minister, Niamh Bhreathnach. In a letter I received from the school, I note that the school understood that it had secured the gymnasium but that was not the case. In 1987, the Labour Party introduced a cutback &ndash; I believe it was introduced by the then Minister, Niamh Bhreathnach &ndash; and approximately 2,400 teachers left the primary school system. Therefore, cutbacks are not new. We should be realistic when we talk <Col N="128" /> about what is in place and together, le chéile, caithfimid dul ar aghaidh agus airgead a chaitheamh chun ceist an oideachais a chur chun cinn.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BeverleyCooperFlynn" hpid="Ms Cooper-Flynn Ms Cooper-Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Ms Cooper-Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to speak on the Government amendment to this motion. Having listened to the criticism levelled at the Minister for Education and Science and at the lack of funding for education in recent months, one can easily forget all the major and significant improvements that have occurred since 1997. Having spoken to school principals, parents and teachers in recent years, I am aware that there have been major and significant improvements in our education system since 1997.</P>
      <P>On the night we are debating this issue, it is important to reflect on what has been done. Every Deputy is aware of the needs in education and of the constant need for capital moneys to be spent on the improvement of schools. That is nothing new. Therefore, it was not a great brain wave that occurred to Members on the Opposite side of the House which prompted them to bring a motion such as this before the House. I hope that all Deputies are big enough to acknowledge the significant spend that has been invested in the area of education, which is something I support and of which the Government has been extremely supportive since 1997. There was a serious amount of under-funding in education by successive Governments prior to 1997. It takes a number of years to address the imbalance that existed and to try to correct the situation. Since 1997, this Government and the previous Government have made serious attempts to achieve that.</P>
      <P>Since 1997 funding in education has increased by 87% from &euro;2.9 billion to &euro;5.4 billion, which by any person's reckoning is a a massive amount of money. Capital funding has increased from &euro;124 million to &euro;608 million which represents an increase of 388%. The capitation funding for primary schools has increased from &euro;57 per pupil to &euro;101 per pupil, representing an increase of 80%. School principals recognise that is a significant improvement. The number of teaching places has increased by 288%. How many times in recent years have we spoken in this House about the pupil-teacher ratio and the need to encourage more young people to become teachers. That is exactly what successive Ministers on this side of the House have done since 1997 to seriously address the issue of the pupil-teacher ratio and to provide for special needs teachers in our education system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Some 2,500 additional special needs assistants have been placed in our schools. I am sure Deputies on all sides of the House receive representations from schools when a new school or an extension to a school is required. When I was elected in 1997 I remember the major financial burden placed on the trustees of schools to try to acquire sites for new schools. However, since January 1999 Fianna Fáil-led Governments have put in place a measure whereby the State acquires <Col N="129" /> sites for new schools. That has eased the burden on parents and teachers. Many members of my family and associates of mine have been involved in the teaching profession for many years. I am aware that those involved in the profession were under a major burden to fund raise to maintain their jobs and schools. That measure was a major improvement and benefit for parents, teachers and pupils.</P>
    <P>In the past the trustees of schools had to pay 10% of the capital cost of a new school or an extension. That cost has now been capped at &euro;63,000 for a new school and &euro;31,500 for a school extension. It is easy to gloss over all the improvements that have been made in education in recent years, particularly in a year when there are budgetary constraints. It is easy to ignore the improvements that have been made and to bring what I believe is a politically opportunistic&mdash;</P>

We recognise that additional improvements need to be made, but we must recognise that there has been a major spend in education and a major benefit from that. I commend the Minister on the various innovative approaches he has taken in a time of tight budgetary constraints. He is now examining how we can get better value for money in the new schools building programme. I regret I do not have more time to cover all I wanted to say.</P>

I do not believe that the people of Kingswood and rest of the Dublin South-West sent Charlie O'Connor to the Dáil because everything was fine. I believe that the 7,155 good souls in Dublin South-West who voted for me, and I thank them all, sent me here because they wanted a strong advocate. They wanted someone who would raise the relevant issues and do the job and that is what I am doing. I come into the Dáil every day and I am not afraid to talk to Ministers and to debate the issues. I will deal with all the issues without fear or favour.</P>

The Minister acknowledged that in the midst of heckles from the members of the Labour Party last night. In this day and age every second level school in this State should have a PE hall. Firhouse Community College in my constituency does not have a PE hall and it should have one. There is a need to update the facilities in Glenasmole school. The asbestos roof on Ard Mhuire School, in Belgard in my own parish should be dealt with. The building programme for St. Thomas's national school in Jobstown, which is attended by a number of disadvantaged pupils, should be urgently addressed. Something should be done urgently about its building programme. I want to highlight two specific schools.</P>

      <P>I am glad to compliment the Minister for Education and Science on his excellent work. He was a teacher and has a great understanding of education. He has given long service on local authorities and in the House as a Deputy and Minister. He follows in the footsteps of many others in Fianna Fáil who have been pioneers in developments in education. When the Government completes its full term Deputy Noel Dempsey will have left a positive mark on education. He has my support in this work and he has much to offer, as we will see in years to come.</P>
      <P>Some facts need to be put on the record regarding the Minister's contribution to the schools programme 2003. I thank him for the programme of school development he sanctioned for my constituency this year and I am pleased he gave the go-ahead for three major extensions &ndash; which might be considered new schools &ndash; in Roxboro, Ballyfeeney and Clooneyquinn in Roscommon. It is a great achievement to have those three schools included and I thank the Minister.</P>
      <P>There is another list which the Opposition never mentions but it should also be put on the record. Scores of schools are renovated under the smaller programmes and three other schools in my constituency benefited from those &ndash; Ballintleva, Clooncagh and Fairymount. Knockcroghery was included in a public private partnership and we hope that school goes ahead under the new scheme. The situation was the same last year, when three schools were developed &ndash; Summerhill national school got &euro;3.1 million.</P>
      <P>If we look at the overall situation, in 2003, 149 schools under all headings are to be dealt with in the schools programme. That is a sizeable figure in any year. I compare it with five years ago, when there were 42 schools. That is a comparison with 1997 and it is not a fictitious figure.</P>

      <P>He referred in his contribution to the historic difficulties which arose because of underinvestment in education and to the increased number of pupils, teachers and services at various levels. He referred to the figures in 1997 &ndash; which was an election year, as Members will remember &ndash; which compare unfavourably with the 2003 figures. At that time 30 primary school buildings were under way and a mere 12 second level projects. In 2003, 90 primary schools were recently completed and 85 are currently under way, while there are 36 post-primary schools completed and 38 under construction. There are a further 26 to go to construction later this year. There has been a significant increase in the number of major projects in a short time.</P>
      <P>There is a perception among parents and management at some schools that this motion has the capacity to vote additional funding for the schools building programme.

    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome the publication of the 2003 primary and post-primary school building programme, which sets out objective criteria for the first time, provides a significant level of information in a transparent manner and puts that information into the public domain. The devolved building <Col N="134" /> initiative which the Minister introduced in this programme has been welcomed by management in small rural schools. It provides for direct funding to a small number of schools initially, but it will eventually become the blueprint in particular for the provision of extensions to smaller and rural schools. It provides for the board of management and local community to have a major input into how the project proceeds. It will be quicker and provide better value for money.</P>
    <P>At last the Department is busy devising standard plans for various school sizes. The Minister indicated in his contribution that he was looking at doing the same for extensions, which would make an enormous difference in the costs of preparing projects. Much of the demand has been driven by the need for accommodation for remedial and resource teachers, as well as the dramatically reduced pupil-teacher ratios in some instances. A previous speaker said there was an increase of 3,690 primary teachers since 1997. The pupil-teacher ratio has gone from 21.7:1 to 18.4:1. This is a dramatic improvement in the area which most benefits students.</P>
    <P>Likewise, there are 1,868 additional second level teachers. Not so long ago I taught in a primary school where there were 82 children divided approximately equally between two teachers. Before I entered the House in 1992, I had never had the wonderful experience of having as a co-worker either a resource or remedial teacher. There have, therefore, been dramatic improvements in the past five or six years in the level of staffing which have naturally put pressure on the building programme.</P>
    <P>There is considerable dissatisfaction and disaffection with the provision of temporary accommodation. While this relates in some instances to delays in providing such accommodation, it is particularly evident with regard to the provision of buildings which are neither durable nor cost efficient in the first instance and extremely expensive to run and maintain subsequently. I am glad the Minister has indicated he is prepared to consider giving management authorities the right to use the money made available to them to provide more durable structures.</P>

      <P>I broadly welcome the Labour Party motion, although it is not strong on specifics. A message needs to be sent out loud and clear to the Minister's office, the Government and those watching proceedings on the monitor that schools building projects are a major concern. As a first world country, we have a second rate educational system as far as buildings and several other areas are concerned and a Third World sys<Col N="135" /> tem as far as Gaelscoileanna and Educate Together schools are concerned.</P>

      <P>I represent a constituency with some of the fastest growing areas in the country. As I already indicated, some schools in Clondalkin are badly in need of refurbishment or approval for new building projects. I will focus on my home town of Lucan which is, according to the recent census, the fastest growing town in the country. Lucan has experienced a vast increase in its population and housing, and a significant amount of land has been rezoned. Questions need to be answered about dodgy rezoning decisions but I will not dwell on the issue now. Houses have been built, but matching facilities have been lacking and we are now playing catch-up.</P>
      <P>The possibility of building 10,000 houses on 500 acres of land at Adamstown is being discussed. The Department of Education and Science would be happy if the land at Adamstown were to be built on, provided new schools remained features on a map rather than planning in progress. I hope my Green Party colleague, Fintan McCarthy, will play a role in stopping the proposal.</P>
      <P>I will take as a case study the Griffeen Valley Educate Together school. Realising there was a school crisis, parents in the area got off their backsides and ensured the school was opened. They now have a classroom operating in the scouts den on a temporary basis and want to move forward. Lands set aside for a school off Griffeen Avenue at the time housing estates were built years ago remain unused. The developer of the land, Castelthorne Construction, is willing to lease or sell it to the school. Once again, however, the Department is prevaricating.</P>
      <P>I tabled parliamentary questions on this issue several times last year and more recently in February. As I plan to tackle the Minister on the issue tomorrow by means of a parliamentary question, I will not get into specifics. It appears the Office of Public Works is playing funny games in terms of whether sufficient money is available to finance the leasing of the site. While it may suit the Department to prevaricate, for the parents who, in many cases, have put their child's name down for this school only, the issue at stake is their children's future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The matter should not be taken so lightly and put aside until the last minute as it causes stress to parents and major hassle for other overcrowded schools in Lucan. Parents have to put their chil<Col N="136" /> dren's names down for places in other schools which creates a lottery. People who do not belong to the local parish have no chance of a place for their children. There are huge lists for places in Educate Together schools and Gaelscoileanna. For example, Lucan Educate Together has 160 names on its current list, yet Griffeen Valley school has only 40 places available this year. This group of 40 which has received provisional places, and perhaps a few others, will not be able to start in the school until the Department agrees to fund prefabricated buildings on the site owned by Castlethorne Construction.</P>
    <P>There is a broader issue at stake in this regard. If one listens to the &ldquo;Marian Finucane Show&rdquo; or representatives of TLC, one finds that the same problems occur throughout the country. Schools are operating in run-down prefabricated buildings, offices and sports centres. This is not acceptable.</P>
    <P>The Green Party proposes that the Minister goes back to his gambling friend, the Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, asks for a four year funding package and tells him to forget about public private partnerships. The current allocation of &euro;343 million should be increased to &euro;650 million to play catch-up in terms of building projects. Funding of &euro;1 billion is required for primary schools with a further &euro;1.5 billion needed for secondary schools. Let us not sell parents across the country a cock and bull story. This money is needed and can be found either through borrowing or increased taxation. If the Minister proposed raising taxes to generate the required funding, people would welcome it as they want facilities for their children's schools. I support the motion.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ArthurMorganSF" hpid="Mr. Morgan Mr. Morgan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morgan</NameTxt>
      <P>Sinn Féin supports the motion. Much has been made of the fact that 130,000 people attended the anti-war march in Dublin on 15 February. However, perhaps because it was not centred in Dublin, a national protest involving 140,000 parents, teachers and students in more than 700 primary schools across the Twenty-six Counties has not been given the same attention. That less than a month after its founding Tuismitheoirí agus Teagascóirí Le Chéile can organise a show of anger on this scale is not only a tribute to the organisers, but is an illustration of the level of frustration felt by parents and teachers across the State.</P>
      <P>Teachers and principals are finding that now, in addition to running their schools and managing staff and the curriculum, they must also be architects, chief fundraisers and political activists to meet the needs of their pupils. Parents are finding themselves organising raffles, plays, sponsored walks, cycles and anything else they can think of to purchase with their own money the basic fundamentals required in schools.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the Oireachtas canteen just last week, raffle tickets were being sold on behalf of a member of staff of a Government Deputy who was trying to raise money for her child's school. This is per<Col N="137" /> fectly normal. It is how money is raised to buy luxuries and extras for schools, such as roofs, furniture and classrooms.</P>

      <P>The decision of the Government not to increase the back to school allowance for primary children is all the more serious when we remember that in addition to uniforms, pens and books, a pupil attending a modern primary school here in the 21st century also needs other things. For example, he or she needs a good supply of quality rat poison. A first aid kit is always useful and a bucket to collect the rain which leaks through the leaking roof is a must for every seven year old attending a school in a working class area.</P>
      <P>I will highlight the cases of two schools in my constituency, one primary and one secondary. Scoil Mhuire Fatima national school in Drogheda was built more than 140 years ago. I have received numerous representations from parents and children who are distraught due to the condition of their school. Parents who were promised a new school in 1998 feel misled and betrayed by the Government about the schools building programme.</P>
      <P>The school is located on the main Dublin to Belfast road. There is only a narrow footpath between this noisy, busy road and the school. There are no parking facilities for parents or teachers. Parents cannot park outside the school to drop off or collect their children. The school is split into two sections and children are forced to walk along the busy Dublin Road to get to the school hall for assembly or physical education classes.</P>
      <P>The building is too small for the number of children attending. Junior and senior infants classes are held in prefabricated buildings constructed in the 1970s and intended as a temporary measure. There are 60 junior infants in one prefabricated building dating from 1971. Parents who themselves attended school in these prefabs in the early 1970s are horrified that 30 years later their own children are forced to attend classes in these same prefabs. Classrooms are so crowded that one cannot walk between desks. The school is a serious fire hazard and does not meet the current building standards regulations. There is a serious danger from faulty electrical wiring. The school urgently needs to be re-wired but because it is a listed building it would have to be evacuated in order for this work to be carried out. Walkways leading to fire exits and the exits themselves are very dangerous. Accidents have occurred during fire drills where small children are forced to negotiate rusty old fire escapes.</P>
      <P>Scoil Uí Mhuirí in Dunleer was promised a replacement school 20 years ago. In March 1985 the Minister for Education stated:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My Department has approved a proposal to develop Dunleer Vocational School and architectural planning is under way. The project will <Col N="138" /> replace all existing prefabricated accommodation at the school.</P>
    <P>The school currently has 14 prefabricated classrooms, one prefabricated staff room and one prefabricated staff toilet. Parents and teachers are angry that they have had to wait so long and they fear that there is no end in sight to their wait. I urge support for the motion and call on the Government to recognise that damage is being done to future generations because of the lack of funding and provision of adequate conditions.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaudgeConnolly" hpid="Mr. Connolly Mr. Connolly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connolly</NameTxt>
      <P>Too many of our schools are crumbling, crowded and obsolete. Teachers and parents' organisations have been speaking out for years to little avail but now the problem has assumed the dimensions of a national emergency. Every child deserves the opportunity to learn in a modern classroom equipped with the latest educational technology. Too many pupils &ndash; one in four according to recent estimates &ndash; attend classes in schools that fail to meet these criteria. If we want our children to learn the skills they need to thrive in the 21st century, they deserve classrooms that indicate the Department of Education and Science regards their future as a priority. Pupils attending substandard schools get the message quickly that in the eyes of the Department they do not matter much and it will not waste much money on them.</P>
      <P>The condition of schools is related to pupil achievement. A growing body of research links classroom achievement and behaviour to the school building, conditions and overcrowding. Studies have demonstrated that achievement is upwards of 10% lower in substandard schools compared to those in good condition. Physical conditions also have positive and negative effects on teachers' morale, sense of personal safety and effectiveness in the classroom. Despair and frustration are common feelings in dilapidated schools in sharp contrast to the feelings of hope and staff commitment evident in schools undergoing renovations and improvements. Poor working conditions result in higher teacher absenteeism, lower morale and effectiveness and reduced job satisfaction.</P>
      <P>One week prior to last year's general election, the Minister for Education and Science published a list of 2,800 schools requiring funding, of which 850 had applied for major funding and 496 received the go-ahead to go to tender. Many of these schools received departmental instructions to appoint architects and quantity surveyors whose joint fees amount to in excess of &euro;50,000 per project. Boards of management have not as yet received &euro;1 to pay for these services. The U-turn subsequently performed by the Department is particularly inconceivable and unforgivable. It would make infinitely more sense for the Department to proceed with its planned projects, in which it has heavily invested, than to leave the plans gather dust until the next general election.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Department has reneged on the commitment given prior to the election and its continued <Col N="139" /> neglect of hazardous, unhealthy and unhygienic conditions places both the Minister and the Department firmly in breach of health and safety regulations and liable to prosecution. Another generation of children and teachers deserve better than to be sentenced to 19th century conditions in condemned school premises with outdoor toilets more than 30 metres away reeking of dampness and unstable walls and floors. It is time for the Department to reassure every pupil that it believes they deserve a modern, safe and conducive environment in which to learn. I support the motion.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MarianHarkinIND" hpid="Ms Harkin Ms Harkin">
      <NameTxt>Ms Harkin</NameTxt>
      <P>Yesterday the Minister referred to the motion as a politically motivated debate but everybody knows this is about the day-to-day reality in many of our primary schools and not about politics. The debate is about totally unsafe, inadequate and overcrowded conditions for students and teachers alike. I have been in politics for less than 12 months, yet I have received many representations regarding difficult and, in some cases, impossible conditions in primary schools.</P>
      <P>I could spend my time listing those schools but I will refer only to two cases, which reflect the worst conditions. The first is the Holy Family school in Tubbercurry. Planning permission was granted in 1972, more than 30 years ago, for a school extension. A total of 16 staff, male and female, use one toilet. The school has 130 pupils of whom ten have special needs. Five pupils are refugees while another five are Travellers. Classes are held in the staff room, two classes are held in the entrance hall and the special needs class is held in the infants cloakroom. The flat roof in the girls toilet has fallen in so when it rains, it is flooded. The boiler house is collapsing and the boiler works with a kick and a bang.</P>
      <P>The electrical system has been condemned both by health and safety officers and the ESB. The system was installed in 1956 and the school cannot even get spare parts. A local contribution of &euro;32,000 has been collected and is ready and waiting to be used. The local convent has donated a two acre site for the extension and Tubbercurry national school, which is taking pupils from five new housing estates that have been built in the town over the past two years, is entering its 32nd year on the waiting list.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Colry national school, a few miles outside Sligo, does not have substandard accommodation, but suffers from chronic overcrowding. The school does not have a general purpose room, office or storage space or a learning support room. Drama, sport and science classes are regularly cancelled. Students are not getting access to the full curriculum and this impacts adversely on their education. A local contribution of &euro;25,000 is also waiting and ready to be used. These two schools reflect the situation throughout Sligo and Leitrim and, whether it is Mohill in south Leitrim <Col N="140" /> or Ard Cairn in south Sligo, the position is the same.</P>
    <P>I do not expect the Minister to pull a rabbit out of a hat at the end of the debate and tell us that all the issues in the motion tabled by the Labour Party, which I support, will be addressed by the end of the school year. However, every year the Minister for Finance puts &euro;1 billion in the national pension reserve fund, yet the census results show that Ireland's age profile is different from that of most European countries. In most EU member states, for every 12 people aged over 50, there are only nine under 20, which means they have an ageing population. The opposite is true in Ireland. For every 12 people aged under 20, there are nine over 50. Ireland, therefore, has a young, wealth creating population. The &euro;1 billion that the Minister for Finance diverts to the pension fund every year, which is losing money, should be reallocated to the primary school building programme.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FinianMcGrath" hpid="Mr. F. McGrath Mr. F. McGrath">
      <NameTxt>Mr. F. McGrath</NameTxt>
      <P>I am grateful for the opportunity to speak on the motion about the school building programme and the condition of our schools. I welcome the opportunity to address these issues, especially as one who has worked in the primary education sector for more than 20 years in a north inner city Dublin school. I support the motion, even though I am critical of successive Governments in regard to education in general. Successive Governments have tried to get education on the cheap and have ignored the views of teachers, parents and pupils. If one believes in equality, one must support education by funding it and addressing the overcrowded conditions in hundreds of schools. Members of the Government want to go back to the days of the hedge schools. They think that education and decent classrooms are privileges and people should pay extra for them.</P>
      <P>A word of warning is required, however. We can go down that road and damage our schools and education services, just as was done in other countries such as America and Great Britain. Alternatively, we can invest in our schools, improve our pupils and have a strong economy in future. Education is a right and a public service to be guarded and nurtured. If it is damaged or neglected in any way, all of us will lose. What is currently happening in this country regarding education in substandard schools is simply educational vandalism. Cuts in expenditure under the schools building programme are damaging our children's future and constitute an attack on civil rights. Some schools cannot even reach health and safety standards. This is unacceptable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In my constituency, excellent schools, such as Gaelscoil Colmcille in Whitehall, have been waiting endlessly for buildings. Others, such as Scoil Mhuire, Griffith Avenue, Marino, cannot get a computer room, even in this IT age. Other schools have a lack of space. In other areas, poorer schools are constantly under pressure, particularly at board of management level, being <Col N="141" /> unable to fund their operations and constantly seeking finance elsewhere. This approach to education seriously undermines morale and is not good enough. Any Minister or Department worth their salt would stand up to the bully boys in the Cabinet, particularly in the Department of Finance, and fight for education. That being said, I accept the reality that we have to do something about these schools. There are now 500 schools on the stalled planning list and that is the reason I support the motion. I support the idea of a supplementary Estimate to address this urgent issue. We need new, radical ideas to raise funds to assist our educational services. This motion is about pupils, schools, teachers and, above all, protecting and defending our education services.</P>

      <P>I wish to share time with Deputies Sherlock, McManus, Upton, Wall and Seán Ryan. I congratulate my colleague, Deputy O'Sullivan, for her presentation of the case for this motion and her speech demanding a realistic building programme for national and secondary schools. Before the last general election in May 2002, Fianna Fáil candidates, with the support and knowledge of the Government and, particularly, the Minister for Education and Science, mounted a country-wide campaign of lies and deceit. They gave firm undertakings, written and oral, with the approval of the Fianna Fáil Minister for Education and Science, that school building programmes would be given top priority &ndash; there would be no more delays or snags and money was no problem.</P>
      <P>My constituency differed uniquely from others, however. The principal Fianna Fáil candidate was none other than the outgoing and present Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy. While he was actively planning cuts in the education budget, particularly in the schools building programme, he had his workers actively informing parents, teachers and school boards that their schools would get priority and there were no money problems. They and I believed the story &ndash; fools that we were. Kildare North wins the prize for the biggest and most deliberately planned lie of all.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What was promised and what did we get? St. Laurence's national school required seven classrooms which were promised, with no problem, to go ahead in 2003 &ndash; a deliberate lie. The truth is that there is no hope in 2003, no money even for prefabs and 76 children are left without places in September of this year. A new national school in Naas was deemed essential, with a promise to go ahead in 2003. Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats put up a big hoarding to indicate where the school would be built. Spec houses are now being built there &ndash; a deliberate lie by Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats. The truth is that there is no progress in 2003 and no hope for 2004. Scoil Mochua, Celbridge, was promised four new classrooms and a general purpose room &ndash; another lie. The truth is there is no <Col N="142" /> chance or hope in 2003, although the project was deemed essential.</P>
    <P>At Rathmore national school, a new building was required to replace a substandard structure. It was promised to go to tender forthwith &ndash; another deliberate lie. The truth is that it is now on the back boiler. Scoil na Mainistreach, Celbridge, was promised six new classrooms, four resource rooms, a library, computer room, staff room and office, all deemed essential &ndash; another broken promise. The truth is that it is on hold for 2005, 2006 or 2007. Gaelscoil Uí Riada, Kilcock, was promised a new building for 300 pupils, which was deemed essential but there is no hope of progress &ndash; yet another lie. Presentation Convent, Maynooth, was promised two classrooms, four resource rooms, a general purpose room, a library and three administration rooms. Although this project is deemed essential, it will have to wait years for progress &ndash; another deliberate lie.</P>
    <P>Scoil Chocha Naofa, Kilcock, was the worst case in the constituency, built in 1953 and having four prefabs, one being 20 years old. There is no prediction as to when any work will be done, although it was firmly promised by Fianna Fáil before the election last May &ndash; a shameful deceit and lie by Fianna Fáil in that constituency. Tiermoghan national school was promised two classrooms last May but the promise was replaced by two prefabs &ndash; another let down, another lie. At Kill national school, where a new school was promised on a greenfield site, there is no sign or hope of progress in the near future. This was the old school of the Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy.</P>
    <P>Scoil Phádraig national school, Clane, was promised, at least, prefabs to relieve gross overcrowding, with at least 70 pupils over capacity. There is no sign of any development &ndash; another lie. In the case of North Kildare Educate Together, Celbridge, a new school costing &euro;3.5 million was due to open in May of this year, with every mod con promised. However, the Minister refuses to sanction funding for furniture or blackboards &ndash; the most stupid lie of all. The 13 schools I have listed are not an exhaustive list. There are others. The parents, teachers and boards of management who believed the Government's lies are now disappointed and angry.</P>
    <P>There is yet another lie &ndash; there is no shortage of money. Despite a surplus of &euro;5 billion on our revenue account last year, there was a deliberate decision to cut services and use the revenue account for capital expenditure &ndash; a typical accountant's actions. A sum of &euro;500 million per year is being wasted on the savings accounts scheme. The Labour Party now demands that money for jets and chocolates should no longer be a priority but that we spend money on the educational rights of children.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeSherlock" hpid="Mr. Sherlock Mr. Sherlock">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherlock</NameTxt>
      <P>The Labour Party and others in Opposition have presented facts in this debate. All we have heard from the Government party, Fianna Fáil, is empty rhetoric. It is incredible that <Col N="143" /> Government party spokespersons could make the type of presentation we have heard from them in the House. I wish to give one relevant example. Last year, 2002, I received a letter from the Minister of State at the Department of Finance, Deputy Parlon, stating that the Office of Public Works had recommended three sites in the Rathcormac area. It is regrettable that the Minister of State, Deputy Michael Ahern, is not present to hear this. The three sites were rejected by the Department of Education and Science, which is now suggesting refurbishment and extension. This is a five-teacher school in a vast developing area. A report in a local newspaper has described Scoil Bhríde, Rathcormac, as having been abandoned in the 2003 programme.</P>
      <P>When the former Deputy Niamh Bhreathnach was Minister for Education, she decided to retain Buttevant community school. In 2002, the Department stated that Buttevant does not have a sewerage scheme and it would not allow the school project to go to tender. Although that issue was sorted out with Cork County Council, the tender process has still not been allowed to proceed. In Burnfort, just outside Mallow, the children had to come out in protest at the situation. At Ballygowan, between Mallow and Mitchelstown, which serves a big catchment area, I witnessed classroom furniture having to be moved out to facilitate music lessons. The degree of congestion in that school would deem it a health and safety hazard.</P>

      <P>No other issue strikes such a chord with Irish people as that of education. Fianna Fáil has always prided itself on being in touch with the popular mood. Fianna Fáil was the party, after all, that took the great leap forward and introduced free secondary education. With the publication of the 2003 school building programme, it is clear that Fianna Fáil has not only lost touch but there is now a contempt in the leadership of the party for the public and for the public good.</P>
      <P>The last general election was a bought election. It was bought on promises, stories and fabrications. It was bought on lies. Across the country, teachers, parents, principals and boards of management were led a merry dance regarding their projects, their leaking roof, their school extension, their chance to get children walking along corridors instead of walking in the rain when going from classroom to classroom. In my county, primary schools like Moneystown, Lacken, Glendalough, Hollywood, St. Brigid's, Greystones, Gaelscoil Uí Cheadaigh and many others are stuck.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The most critical case of all is that of Avondale Community College in Rathdrum. A school extension was proposed, an architect employed and an audit of the school was carried out. It was clear that demolition of part of the school had to be carried out and four classrooms decommissioned as a result of fire and safety regu<Col N="144" /> lations. The programme involved two phases of building to meet the needs of the growing school numbers. The programme was submitted and a meeting was held in the Department of Education and Science in February 2002, four months before the election. The VEC was sufficiently assured that the programme would go to plan. Demolition of offices, computer and staff rooms went ahead and the usual shantytown of temporary prefabs was erected.</P>
    <P>The programme aimed to start the building project in October 2002. The Department knew this and while nothing was put in writing, the clear understanding the VEC had was that the programme would proceed accordingly. Were that not the understanding nobody at local level would have proceeded with the demolition of part of the school. They went ahead in good faith, the election was won on bad faith, and ever since Avondale Community College has been denied the sanction to even apply for planning permission. The project is completely stalled. I do not know of any other example where part of a school has been knocked down and an internal wall now stands exposed to the elements, with bewildered staff and students trying to cope as best they can. It is insupportable that this situation should persist, yet it does. A school is partially knocked down, children are housed in prefabs, the staff and principal are without offices, no work is proceeding and a deep, deafening silence emanates from the Department.</P>

    <P>Inchicore national school awaits a new school. This school agreed an amicable amalgamation of the boys and girls school in early 2000. Its board had participated in what they considered to be a number of good and productive meetings with Department officials. They were told that an agreement had been arrived at whereby, following the amalgamation of the two schools, there was a commitment that there would be a new school within two years. That was early in 2000, and the teachers and pupils are still in their prefabs and making do with cramped and totally <Col N="145" /> inappropriate conditions. It is now more than three years since they were given a commitment and they do not even feature on the now infamous website.</P>
    <P>Has the Minister visited any of the schools that I have listed since his appointment? Has either of his predecessors visited any of these schools during their terms of office? Most of the schools that I have mentioned are located in areas that are considered to be disadvantaged. The Minister should undertake to visit the schools and meet the teachers, pupils, parents and boards of management and hear for himself what they have to say about the conditions they are operating in daily. I would like him to explain to them why they were all misled and let down and why they are still waiting for some progress on the promised building programme.</P>
    <P>The Government has made much of the fact that disadvantaged areas were to be given preferential treatment, through programmes like RAPID. RAPID turns out to have the same substance as the tooth fairy, or Mary Make Believe. Most of the schools I have referred to are located in areas designated as disadvantaged and it seems that they will suffer the same fate as RAPID.</P>
    <P>I listened to Government spokespersons outlining the great investment or, in their own words, the remarkable expansion of the past five years. Maybe they would like to look up the meanings of &ldquo;remarkable&rdquo; and &ldquo;expansion&rdquo; and tell me how it refers to the schools building programme.</P>

      <P>I am sure any Deputy would appreciate it when a child from his or her constituency would write a letter to them. I have received a number of letters in recent days and alarm bells started to ring when I read them. Rachel Donohue wrote:</P>
      <P>My name is Rachel Donohue, I am 12 years old and I am in sixth class. I think the conditions in the school are appalling. We have one shabby prefab that is old and stuffy, and what makes it worse is that children in classes one and two have to come across the yard in hail, rain or snow just to go to the toilet.</P>
      <P>Stephen Donnellan wrote:</P>
      <P>The children in the prefab are also getting sickness such as asthma. On 1 April 2003, April Fools' Day, the whole school went on a walk at 10 a.m. Third, fourth, fifth and sixth classes put a lot of work into banners and posters. The main slogan was &ldquo;We're no fools, fund our schools.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Niamh Mulvanney wrote:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The halls are damp and wrecked and some of the ceiling fell down in Mrs Mooney's room. Junior and senior infants desks are all wrecked and parts are falling off. It is unsafe for children. Mrs O'Loughlin is a resource teacher and she has to teach out in the damp, leaky hall. Also, in my classroom, fifth and sixth class, one <Col N="146" /> of the windows is smashed. There have been at least five break-ins in the schools since I have been here. There are also our four legged friends the mice. The school was first built in 1960.</P>
    <P>Sinead Moran wrote:</P>
    <P>Robertstown National School was built in 1960. In 43 years the Government has not done one good thing for us. Forty-three years of cracked ceilings, walls and goalposts are falling down. Our grannies and granddads could have been sitting at our desks. We also have friends, little ones, four legged friends that leave presents to clear up. Robertstown National School had its hopes up in May 2002 when the Government promised a new school and new prefabs but we went back to the way it used to be. In 2003 we got a call saying nothing was going to go ahead. The boys and girls of Robertstown think it is bad and unfair that they only have five toilets with ten teachers having only one toilet between them.</P>
    <P>These are some of the letters I received from a particular school. At another meeting I attended, the principal of a school told parents of his grave disappointment that the new school that had been promised before the election would not go ahead. What made it worse is that the school is in my town of Castledermot. While the Government promised a school, there is no sign of a site being purchased, much less the provision of a school.</P>
    <P>I could go on to talk about Nurney etc., but time restraints do not allow me to do so. The disappointment that is felt across the board is reflected in those letters from the unfortunate school children of Robertstown.</P>

      <P>Tonight we are addressing the conditions under which our children are being educated. The school building programme is a betrayal of pupils and teachers all over the country who were grossly misled by Fianna Fáil and Progressive Democrats candidates before the general election. The school building programme should make every Government Deputy hang their heads in shame. They were elected on false promises to parents all over the country that work would commence or be completed on their school within weeks of the election. Many of those candidates that are Deputies now do not have the guts to come into the House during this debate to explain their empty promises and the Minister does not have the guts to listen to the contribution that was made by my colleague, Deputy Wall.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Arising from these reports there is no guarantee that work on a permanent school for St. Cronan's junior school, Ballyboughal national school, St. Joseph's secondary, Rush and Malahide Community School will commence even in 2004. Furthermore the Department does not seem to acknowledge the need for new permanent buildings for St. Cronan's senior national school, Lor<Col N="147" /> etto, Balbriggan, and Scoil An Duinnínigh, Swords. This is scandalous given the conditions under which the children are being educated.</P>
    <P>Since the election we have been told time and again by Ministers that money is now scarce and it is not possible to do all they would like to do, or all they promised. This is an excuse to justify its broken promises. It is totally unacceptable and will not wash with the majority of people who are now keenly aware they were conned and lied to prior to the last general election.</P>

      <P>This is a rich country. Allocation of funds relates to choices. What groups of people &ndash; I said this before in the House and I have no difficulty saying it again &ndash; demanded SSIS accounts? From where did that come? Did the Minister listen to the parents who demanded new schools? Did he listen to those who crammed into buildings all over the country looking for answers regarding provisions for the disabled. He did not.</P>
      <P>The Minister stated last week that the SSIS will cost the State &euro;535 million this year and will cost &euro;2.6 billion over the five year period. We could do a lot with that money if it were allocated to people in need, for schools and children being taught in draught-ridden, rat-infested and over-crowded buildings throughout the country. Priorities must be made.</P>
      <P>The time is coming when the people will look at the promises made and wonder in what sort of country they wish to live. What are our priorities? They are based on social justice and equality. We should not give in to those backing Fianna Fáil, those taxpayers and consultants who are making millions of pounds in profit. When the Minister does not get what he requires from one report he simply commissions another. The time has come to stand up and be counted. I am delighted the people are going to take on the Government once and for all.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Education and Science (Miss de Valera)</NameTxt>
      <P>In the very short time available to me, I am glad to come to the House and stand over the record of the Government in its efforts to tackle the educational infrastructural deficit. Never before in our history has so much money been invested in improving educational infrastructure. Acknowledging achievement should not and does not detract from the serious challenges that remain. The House can be fully assured of the Government's commitment to continue its work in this area. No one can deny it is the current Government which possessed the foresight and capacity to take on board the problem which has persisted for many years and has been largely ignored by successive Governments as has been admitted by all sides tonight.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="148" />In 1998, when the current Government parties presented the budget for the first time, substantial capital funding was allocated for school accommodation. Year after year since this unwavering commitment to tackle an acknowledged problem unprecedented levels of funding have been allocated to address this problem. As I have already indicated, the job is not complete and the Government has never attempted to pretend otherwise.</P>
    <P>In his speech to this House last night, the Minister, Deputy Dempsey, indicated he is determined to secure a multi-annual funding envelope that will allow the Government to address identified needs in an effective manner. In addition to securing the necessary funding, the Minister continues to assess new ways of delivering accommodation to schools in a more effective manner. The Minister spoke last night about the delivery of new accommodation in the conventional way, which is slow, and he put forward a number of proposals which will prove extremely useful in the years ahead. The Minister also referred to the fact that the further education sector has also been the recipient of capital funding from the schools building programme. I will refer now to the areas for which I have specific responsibility.</P>
    <P>In the area of further and adult education, there has been an increase of &euro;2.7 million in the adult literacy and community education budget, an increase of &euro;5.7 million for the full year cost of back to education and an increase in investment in adult guidance service with regard to literacy which is a priority for the Government. The figure in that area for 2003 was increased by &euro;1.5 million, amounting in all to a total of &euro;17.9 million available for this year.</P>
    <P>In 1997, there were only 5,000 learners in VEC services, now there are almost 24,000 in over 770 venues. I also have responsibility for PLCs. The number of participants in this area have doubled from 12,000 to more than 24,000 from 1989-90 to 1999-2000. Enrolment for 2001 and 2002 was more than 26,500. All these moneys have come from the one pot.</P>
    <P>I will continue the work which the Government has begun not only in this Administration but over the past five years. We have been consistent in our approach to this problem. I wholeheartedly commend the Government motion before the House. A fair and rational analysis of the fact demonstrates that no Government has done more to improve the conditions of schools. The Government will continue to do so in a fair and transparent manner.</P>

      <P>An article in the <i>Westmeath Examiner</i> dated 13 April 2002, just before the last election, headed &ldquo;Minister's good news to Coralstown school deputation&rdquo; reads:</P>
      <P>The campaign to expedite the provision of a new school building at Coralstown, Kinnegad came to a successful conclusion in recent days, the <i>Westmeath Examiner</i> has learned. It has been announced that the total allocation of funds for the completion of the work has been put in place and that officials from the Department of Education and Science will be in direct contact with the school authorities in relation to the work.</P>
      <P>On Saturday last, April 6th the Minister for Education and Science, Mr. Michael Woods, T.D. met with a deputation from Coralstown school and conveyed the good news to them. The injection of funds for the project will ensure that the school will be open to enrol students in September 2003.</P>

That school has also disappeared from the list. I could mention many other schools around the country such as Timahoe, the College of Further Studies in Cavan, Killeen school, Galmoy school, Curnanool school in Mayo, which I attended, and Swinford school which borrowed money on the strength of recommendations for IT grants. The Government has left a litany of broken promises around the country. If consistency is the hallmark of the Government, truth is not.</P>

      <P>I thank colleagues on this side of the House who came into the House to support the motion put down by Deputy O'Sullivan, a Labour Party attempt to highlight one of the great scandals of the last general election.</P>
      <P>In her contribution, Deputy Harkin pointed out that this was not about playing politics. This is a political issue that fundamentally affects the lives of so many of our young people. That is the issue and as Deputy O'Sullivan put it, there is no adequate excuse for substandard school buildings in 2003. That is the reason an organisation like Tuismitheoirí-Teageascoirí Le Chéile has come into existence. Its members are concerned that their children get the opportunity in education in a reasonable environment that many of them did not get in less affluent times. The climate has changed in terms of the economic well-being of this country but the position is that some of the schools have not experienced similar change. When Deputy O'Sullivan said there is no adequate excuse for substandard school buildings in 2003, she was quoting from the Fianna Fáil manifesto. That was the heading on the chapter on education &ndash; it stated that there was no adequate excuse for substandard buildings.</P>
      <P>We remember what went on in this House coming up to the general election when the then Minister, Deputy Woods, conducted the schools refurbishment programme with a secrecy that would be appropriate to a secret order, but he was not slow to go around the country, as Deputy O'Sullivan said, with a spade on his shoulder turning a sod in any field he was passing where it looked like there was a school nearby.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny" hpid="Mr. Kenny Mr. Kenny">

    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to briefly recap the net points Deputy O'Sullivan made rather than go <Col N="151" /> back over the terms of our motion. She pointed to the fact that there are 12 schools in the primary sector and 14 schools in the post-primary sector in the programme, making a total of 26 schools. A total of &euro;5 million has been allocated on a first come, first served basis to 20 small rural schools. One could say, therefore, that there are 46 schools on the programme but as Deputy O'Sullivan made clear, the work on some of those schools had already started.</P>
      <P>The Minister, Deputy Noel Dempsey, came into the House and made a big play about transparency. The Minister is one of these Fianna Fáil Deputies who always wants to be on the side of the angels. In fairness to the rest of them, they accept, like the rest of us, that they are fallible but the Minister is not. He wants to be on the side of the angels. &ldquo;Look at the new transparent system I have brought in,&rdquo; was his song last night and, as Deputy O'Sullivan pointed out, there is nothing transparent about the new system. The 60 schools in category 2, for example, do not know whether they are No. 59 or No. 1 or what that means in terms of the year the work will be done.</P>
      <P>The Minister's script was laden with what I call &ldquo;mandarin speak&rdquo;. One would need a translator to divine what he meant, if anything, by the statements he made. I will instance one which relates to this new transparency he has introduced. The previous Minister, Deputy Woods, was congenitally incapable of letting his left hand know what his right hand was doing but the current Minister, Deputy Noel Dempsey, is bringing in a new era. A school may think it knows where it is in the band and the category it is in &ndash; there is a quote at the bottom of one of the pages of the script which qualifies it. It states: &ldquo;The initial assignment of a project to a particular priority band does not preclude its subsequent reassignment to a different band as circumstances change.&rdquo;  That is worthless and the Minister, Deputy Noel Dempsey, knows it is worthless.</P>
      <P>Over the past two nights I have listened to a litany of disappointed schools. Some of the colleagues on the Fianna Fáil and PD benches, many of whom are now skulking in their offices watching this debate, had their own litany of disappointed schools which are in different categories and varying degrees of deterioration. They read them out as if they were supporting them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I might as well take the opportunity, like everyone else, of commenting on some of those schools in my constituency that my friend, Deputy O'Connor, forgot to mention in his contribution. He mentioned schools like Ard Mhuire and others but let me take the example of Ballycragh. Ballycragh is one of the smaller schools in my constituency and it fits into the category of explanation the Minister tried to give when he said that due to geographical considerations, there are many places now freed up in different parts of Dublin and so on. That is of no use to a new area like Ballycragh servicing thousands of houses, <Col N="152" /> with all those families at family formation stage, and which has the highest proportion of non-national children from 23 different countries. The school has three new junior infant classes seeking enrolment this year but can only accommodate one because even the broom closet is adapted as the office of the deputy principal. There is no room to move in the school and they have now been told, unequivocally, that the new classrooms will not proceed. There is no point in telling the people of Ballycragh &ndash; most of the mandarins in Marlborough Street do not have the vaguest idea where it is &ndash; that the population is decreasing on the northside.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Connor, in his litany, said that every secondary school should have a sports hall.</P>

Members should have seen the helter-skelter on the door steps to commit the Fianna Fáil candidates to it. Needless to say, it is gone.</P>
      <P>Deputy O'Connor then went on &ndash; I do not want to pick on Deputy O'Connor in particular; he made a stressful speech and I do not want to add to the stress &ndash; to refer to Kingswood, where the letters were thrust in the doors every evening to assure the people in the area that the school would be refurbished. He said in his contribution that the letters came from Tullamore. I have one here. Can anyone recognise this good looking, grey-haired man? He does not work in Tullamore.</P>

He was one of the local Fianna Fáil candidates and not only was he happy telling the people that there was tender go-ahead for St. Killian's school, with JCBs moving in in the morning and so on, he said that he viewed the matter so seriously that he also raised it with the Taoiseach. He got it straight from the horse's mouth. The Taoiseach himself would deliver the project.</P>
      <P>The Minister, Deputy Noel Dempsey, is missing the point. The point is not that we do not have enough money to refurbish every school the same year. We all accept that. The point is the litany of broken promises. They knew that last May at the time of the general election, as they know it now, yet they were successful in electing Deputies in marginal constituencies of which Deputy O'Connor is but an example. They hide when the issues have to be confronted but they are the ones who promised the schools.</P>

      <P>Another example is the SSIA scheme which cost &euro;553 million. Can we think up anything else? The national pension reserve fund lost &euro;773 in 2002 &ndash;&euro;773 million lost on the Stock Market. There was money for all kinds of issues <Col N="154" /> you could think of, and that is why my friend, Deputy O'Connor, is feeling the pinch now in the shoe. Fianna Fáil Deputies, in the five years they presided over the economy, which was handed over to them by my colleague, Deputy Quinn, were accustomed to going around the country and having petals strewn in their path. There was no problem that could not be fixed with money. Where did the Minister, Deputy McCreevy, get the reputation for fiscal rectitude? He got it in Opposition. During the five years there was no project, no matter how daft, to which he could not have given money.</P>
      <P>The money was frittered away, the fruits of the boom were squandered and we are left with an infrastructural deficit in a variety of areas in Irish life, not least in the schools infrastructure to educate our children, the young people of the future. That is how grim it is.</P>
      <P>That is the issue, the broken promises. There is no point coming in here whinging about changed public finances. Why did each and every one of them promise those matters last May? The letters, counter-signed in this case by the Taoiseach, stated that the JCBs would move in the next day. Now 550 schools are excluded and they deserve everything that comes down on their heads.</P>

      <P>Many wind farm projects will not qualify for AER VI because of unwarranted delays in the planning process caused by Dúchas. The forthcoming AER VI competition commences on 15 April and terminates on 24 April. Dúchas, the heritage service, is responsible for designating suitable areas of the country as special protection areas, SPAs, for the protection of the hen harrier under Article 4(1) of the birds directive. Broadly speaking we accept the principle of designation pertaining to areas of national importance. However, serious issues arise with the methodology used by Dúchas in relation to the lack of a clearly defined policy for designating SPAs.</P>
      <P>I have particular concern about a number of sites identified and designated as suitable for wind farm developments under many county development plans. In these areas developers and landowners have invested significant time and resources in undertaking environmental assessments as part of the planning process and having followed all procedures, they find themselves in the unlikely position of having had planning unduly delayed due to recent developments regarding the hen harrier and the proposed designation of these areas as SPAs.</P>
      <P>Wind farm developers and landowners in these areas are at odds to understand how areas designated as suitable for wind farm developments had not come to the attention of Dúchas prior to ratification of the county development plan. Similarly, the habitats directive does not specify a particular area of land to comply with the provisions of the directive. Nevertheless, Dúchas has adopted a blanket designation approach to areas under consideration for SPA designation. This position is completely untenable where a State organisation is introducing such a designation in the absence of proper research being conducted on the effect of such developments on the hen harrier. In the midst of this confusion planners have consequently delayed granting planning permission for these developments.</P>
      <P>The lack of any policy on the part of Dúchas has resulted in unreasonable delays in arriving at decisions in planning for such strategic developments. I therefore strongly advise the Minister to consider the following recommendations. There should be an extension of the AER VI entry period for developers who have suffered unreasonable delays as a result of this lack of policy and direction, either at county council level or during the appeal process to an Bord Pleanála. There should be site-specific compensation for losses, which will be incurred for projects not qualifying for AER VI directly resulting from this lack of policy by Dúchas in areas zoned as having potential for wind farm developments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister for the Environment and Local Government, Deputy Cullen, clearly acknow<Col N="159" /> ledged in the Dáil Chamber on 1 April that mistakes have been made when he said:</P>
    <P>I am glad the Deputy has raised this issue and I agree with much of what he said. I fully support wind farms as a source of renewable energy, which affords us great hope for the future. I have been straightforward in my response to the House on this matter. I do not see an incompatibility between special areas of conservation and. the use of wind energy. There is not an incompatibility between them.</P>
    <P>Importantly he continued by saying:</P>
    <P>That applies to the issue that has arisen lately with regard to the hen harrier in the south west. As Minister responsible, I regret that the communications systems that were in place were not adequate to make clear the fact we have only entered into a consultation process. Incorrect presumptions were made as to the impact of these. I am confident that we will have compatibility between wind energy, afforestation and areas of preservation.</P>
    <P>Developers and landowners, who have made every effort to comply with all planning and legislative requirements to build wind farms within these identified strategic zones, seek only fair treatment in the process resulting from delays, which are outside their control. I urgently seek a resolution to this and strongly recommend that the Minister deal with this matter immediately given the time constraints on AER VI.</P>
    <Speaker pid="IvorCallely" hpid="Mr. Callely Mr. Callely">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children (Mr. Callely)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Murphy for raising this issue and I appreciate the sentiments he expressed, a number of which are correct. The Green Paper on Sustainable Energy published by the Government in 1999 recommended that a group be established to report on the impediments to the greater deployment of wind energy technology in electricity production.</P>
      <P>In a report subsequently published by the renewable energy strategy group three key elements &ndash; electricity market, electricity network and spatial planning &ndash; were identified as needing to be integrated into a plan led approach to wind energy deployment. Among the many recommendations made by the group was a recommendation that, in the short-term, market mechanisms such as the AER process should concentrate on facilitating the development of capacity that has or can obtain the necessary authorisation in particular planning permissions. When the report was published in 2000 full planning permission had been granted to wind farms with a combined installed electricity generating capacity of more than 155 MW.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The current position indicates a significant change in the ability of wind energy projects to obtain full planning permission from local authorities and an Bord Pleanála. Currently it is esti<Col N="160" /> mated that in excess of 750 MW of renewable energy projects have full planning permission. In February this year my colleague, the Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources, Deputy Dermot Ahern, launched the sixth round of the alternative energy requirement competition. The building of an additional 578 MW of new green power by the end of 2005 will meet the target set out in the Green Paper on Sustainable Energy of 500 MW of renewable energy sourced electricity by 2005 and treble the supply of green energy by the end of 2005.</P>
    <P>The AER VI programme was launched in February and applications will be accepted in the Department from 15 to 24 April. The programme is run in accordance with European Union procurement rules. Any changes to the terms and conditions of the competition would necessitate a withdrawal of the current round and a complete re-advertisement. This would have the effect of delaying construction of plant, which is vital. In addition, as indicated earlier, there are more than sufficient projects with full planning permission to allow the AER VI round to proceed. On the wider issue of planning, the steering group felt that there was a need to review and update the planning guidelines for wind farm developments. My colleague, the Minister for the Environment and Local Government, Deputy Cullen, has acted upon this recommendation.</P>
    <P>The 1996 guidelines for planning authorities on wind farm development are intended to facilitate implementation of Government policy regarding the development of renewable sources of energy. They are designed to assist planning authorities in making suitable provision for wind farm development in their development plans and to ensure a consistency of approach throughout the country to the treatment of planning applications for such developments.</P>
    <P>The guidelines are currently being reviewed in light of experience since they were issued to ensure that they continue to be relevant and useful. As part of the review, a public consultation process has been undertaken. All comments received will be taken into consideration in the preparation of revised guidelines which will be published later in the year. It is important that the revised planning guidelines address both the accommodation of wind farming and nature conservation requirements. I will ask the Department to keep the Deputy informed of developments.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. F. McGrath</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Ceann Comhairle for the opportunity to raise the lack of services for people with intellectual disabilities. Last night, I attended a packed meeting in the Mansion House in Dublin. Families from all over Ireland travelled to the meeting. It was refreshing to see the Minister of State, Deputy Tim O'Malley, present to listen to the views and concerns of the parents. We must listen to the parents of children and adults with disabilities, understand <Col N="161" /> them and act through the provision of quality services.</P>
      <P>The present situation is a nightmare for many families. I urge the Minister to act, particularly this year when the Special Olympics will be held in this country. This is the largest sporting event to take place in Ireland. A total of 7,000 athletes and 3,000 coaches will visit this country and compete in different sports. Over 150 countries will be represented. We are proud of that and everybody should get behind our team.</P>
      <P>However, will the Government tell these athletes and the world about our waiting lists for people with disabilities? The situation is scandalous. A total of 1,711 people need full-time residential service, 861 people need a day care service, 1,014 people need a respite service, 462 people are without any service while 485 people are in psychiatric hospitals. This is a human rights issue. There seems to be nothing special about these Irish citizens. Will the Government enjoy the positive side of the events while, at the same time, ignoring the crisis for people with intellectual disabilities?</P>
      <P>This scandal should be exposed. On the north side of Dublin, St. Michael's House provides an excellent service but there are massive waiting lists. There are now 345 people waiting for residential places. Many of them have elderly parents. In the current year St. Michael's has been allocated 11 residential places. Thirty of these people are in extreme need. Capital moneys which were promised for 2002 have been effectively withdrawn and are under review. Seven of the people on the waiting list have parents who are seriously ill, some of them terminally ill.</P>
      <P>This is the real world for the families of people with intellectual disabilities. There have been five years of economic boom and the Celtic tiger. The Government should act immediately. Many parents believe cases dealing with the lack of services should be brought before the European Court of Human Rights. I support the Irish Wheelchair Association's efforts to highlight the fact that an estimated 6,000 people are waiting for grants. In human terms this means the ability to install a stairlift, a downstairs toilet and washing facilities. This is just another example of the lack of care and concern on the part of the Government.</P>
      <P>For many families of people with physical and intellectual disabilities the situation is getting worse. In the past few weeks alone, I have dealt with a number of queries on disability services. The family of one child with a severe intellectual disability cannot get respite care while the family of a child who is visually impaired cannot get a school for next September. Many of them have to travel outside the State to get services. A man with a physical disability cannot get rented accommodation because his weekly allowance is inadequate. I have dealt with many other cases.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Clearly, there is a major crisis in the services. Many people feel excluded. There is a long way to go before we create a so-called just society. There is, however, a way around the problem. <Col N="162" /> The Minister could introduce a disability Bill that would guarantee services as a matter of right. Rights-based legislation is the way forward. After listening to the parents at last night's meeting, the least the Government can do is bring forward rights-based legislation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="IvorCallely" hpid="Mr. Callely Mr. Callely">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Callely</NameTxt>
      <P>On behalf of my colleague, Deputy Martin, I thank the Deputy for raising this issue and for giving me the opportunity to outline the position in this regard. Given that an Independent Deputy has raised this matter, it should be pointed out that the Government, with the support of Independent Deputies, has since 1997 allocated significant levels of funding across the disability sector, which has resulted in significant and unprecedented developments in health-related services being provided to people with disabilities.</P>
      <P>Additional funding has been put in place in numerous areas. A total of &euro;288 million has been made available to these services in recent years and this sum is built into the ongoing budget base. Approximately &euro;100 million in additional ongoing revenue has been provided for the maintenance and development of services to people with physical and sensory disabilities. A significant proportion of this funding, over &euro;20 million, has been provided for home support services and a further &euro;81 million has been provided in once off grants for capital projects and issues such as the provision of technical aids and appliances. There have been other developments in this area, too, regarding removing some of the bureaucracy and obstacles to drawing down such grants.</P>
      <P>Between 1997 and 2002, an extra &euro;188 million revenue and &euro;139 million capital funding has been provided, making a total additional investment of &euro;327 million for the maintenance and development of services for persons with an intellectual disability and those with autism. Included in this funding is &euro;27.2 million which was allocated to meet identified needs in existing services. The additional funding provided by this and the previous Government between 2000 and 2002 was used to put in place, in addition to a range of other services, over 900 residential, 380 respite and around 2,000 new day places for people with an intellectual disability and those with autism.</P>
      <P>In the current year, further additional funding has been allocated to services for persons with an intellectual disability or autism to meet the full year cost of the 2002 developments and to further enhance the health-related support services for children with an intellectual disability or autism. This funding brings the total extra investment in these services to &euro;340 million over seven years. Of this total amount, over &euro;200 million has been built into the ongoing budget base.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Most people will agree that many additional services are in place because of the commitment this and the previous Government have to the required improvement to such services. However, I agree with the slogan that a lot has been done and there is more to do. That is particularly true <Col N="163" /> in this area. We have done a lot and it would be unfair not to recognise that. Indeed, given the additional funding that has been made available recently, the services were probably operating at their maximum capacity. Equally, I acknowledge that there is a lot more to be done and it is the Government's intention to do so. I recognise that there are growing demands and requirements in the area and it is our intention to address them.</P>
    <P>The Government has been proactive with regard to the disability Bill. The Government gave a commitment in An Agreed Programme for Government, in June 2002, to complete consultations on the disability Bill and to bring an amended Bill through the Oireachtas, including provisions for rights of assessment, appeals, provision and enforcement. With the recent conclusion of the consultation process initiated by the Government, and in view of the cross-cutting and complex nature of the issues arising in this context, the process of overseeing the preparation of the new disability Bill has been referred by the Government to the Cabinet sub-committee on social inclusion. I am sure the Deputy will welcome these developments.</P>
    <P>This referral is expected to expedite the process, with the result that the publication and enactment of the disability Bill can be achieved in 2003, in line with the commitment given in the new partnership agreement Sustaining Progress. At this stage in the process, I am not in a position to comment on the precise nature or scope of the proposed legislation, or to speculate on the provisions which it might contain. I believe, however, that the Deputy who raised the question will welcome it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cregan</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank you, a Cheann Comhairle, for giving me an opportunity to raise this important issue. The Minister of State is aware of my interest in trying to ensure that the people I represent have the best possible health services. I am supporting a proposal to establish a radiotherapy service in the mid-west region for the benefit of cancer patients and their families. This proposal was initiated at a meeting of the Mid-Western Health Board in January. It involves a public private partnership between the health board, the Mid-Western Hospitals Development Trust and the Mater Private Hospital in Dublin.</P>
      <P>Under the terms of the proposals, the Mid-Western Health Board will provide a site adjacent to the existing to the cancer centre at the Mid-Western Regional Hospital where planning permission already exists for a radiotherapy unit. The Mid-Western Regional Hospital's development will provide about &euro;6 million for building and equipping the unit. The Mater Private Hospital will be responsible for the operating costs, including the staffing and equipment replacement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>About 1,500 people are diagnosed with cancer in the mid-west region each year, about half of <Col N="164" /> whom require radiotherapy treatment. At present, there are four centres, including two private facilities, delivering radiotherapy services. Three of those centres are in Dublin and one in Cork, which is insufficient to meet current demand. The result is that there are long waiting lists of people from my region in particular who are experiencing difficulty in receiving treatment due to the distances involved. They have to spend approximately six weeks away from their homes to obtain treatment in Dublin or Cork. This is particularly the case for patients with terminal illness who require radiotherapy services to ease their pain and suffering. A local unit would transform their lives.</P>
    <P>The only funding which the Mid-Western Health Board is seeking from the Exchequer is to pay for the cost of treatment for public patients. This will be approximately &euro;5 million initially and about &euro;1.5 million when the unit is fully up and running. By doing this, there will be no barriers to the treatment of public patients who will have the same access as patients covered by health insurance.</P>
    <P>This is a golden opportunity to put in place the final component of a world class cancer service for the people of the mid-west region. If given the go ahead, the unit could be operational within two years, and it would put an end to the hardship which sick and vulnerable people are currently enduring.</P>
    <P>I would be grateful if the Minister of State could examine this proposal. We are not asking for much. There is a public private partnership ready to take off and I ask the Minister of State to give it his favourable consideration.</P>

      <P>I thank Deputy Cregan for raising this matter on the Adjournment and for giving me the opportunity to consider further this proposal as well as setting out the current position regarding the provision of radiotherapy services nationally.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy is aware, a group has been established to examine the appropriate future development of radiotherapy services. The group comprises a multidisciplinary team of experts in radiation oncology, surgical oncology, nursing, epidemiology and palliative care. The group has conducted a national assessment of needs for radiotherapy services having regard to the demography and epidemiology of cancer and the gaps in current service provision.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The group's report will address the following key issues: access to radiotherapy services; the need to provide a high quality, evidence-based service; the need to take account of current and new developments in health technology; the requirements of the system in terms of human resources; international norms regarding service provision, planning and staffing; and the organisational development of the services in terms of the structures and processes required in a radiotherapy facility. I understand that the report of the expert review group on radiotherapy services <Col N="165" /> is at the final editing stage and will be submitted shortly to the Minister for Health and Children.</P>
    <P>All health boards, including the Mid-Western Health Board, have been afforded the opportunity to meet with and make submissions to the group. I am aware that the Mid-Western Health Board has submitted a proposal to the Department of Health and Children for the development of radiotherapy services in its region. I am pleased that my colleague, Deputy Cregan, has taken a special interest in the proposal that has been submitted to my Department. The Deputy has quite rightly put a strong case as to why the proposal should receive favourable consideration. I have been informed that consideration of this proposal will be informed by the report of the expert group on radiotherapy services.</P>
    <P>The provision of additional radiotherapy services nationally will be considered in the context of the report. The case the Deputy has made, and which he made privately to me earlier, merits due consideration. I do not wish to pre-empt whatever the expert group's report may conclude but I understand that following consideration of the report, the Minister for Health and Children will be in a position to submit proposals for consideration by the Government.</P>

      <P>I also wish to thank the Minister, Deputy Ó Cuív, for attending the House personally to deal with this important adjournment matter. He gave me and Deputy O'Dowd an opportunity to meet with him earlier. This is a serious issue for many people. The Monaghan and Cavan partnerships are the two I know best, of the 70 such partnerships that are in place nationally. Monaghan was advised earlier this year that it had a budget of &euro;1.04 million available, which is now being cut back to less than &euro;800,000. The partnership gives support to small farmers in isolated areas who will not now be served by Teagasc. They help those who are long-term unemployed. That has been difficult since the restrictions were placed on the back to work scheme, which is now only available to those who have been unemployed for more than five years. They also help those with various disabilities. They are deeply involved in community and voluntary groups generally, which will be deprived of services and funding due to these massive cutbacks.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Where stands the three year contracts signed by partnership companies with ADM in spring 2001? To whom is ADM answerable? What steps will be taken to ensure that local partnership boards are allocated the necessary funds to meet <Col N="166" /> their commitments, which are based on what they were advised earlier this year? </P>
    <P>These cutbacks will result in a further reduction in services. Everybody was assured in spring 2002 that such services would be the norm. When Fine Gael even dared to question the basis for some of the commitments, the Minister, Deputy McCreevy, said, and put in writing, that no cuts were planned or envisaged. However, there have been cuts in the CE schemes, summer job schemes and back to education grants. I questioned the Minister on a number of occasions on the budget available to CLÁR, a programme which both he and I appreciate. There are also delays in the operation of other schemes.</P>
    <P>The major cutback in partnership funds is the main issue I am raising. Mostly volunteers are involved in partnership boards. They came together with great expectations of what could be done. They want to know to whom is ADM responsible? There are many organisations, including health boards, in place. The Ceann Comhairle knows all about the hospital issue in Monaghan and that we cannot get answers in that regard. There is also ADM and there are many other organisations that are supposed to be responsible, but to whom are they responsible? We want answers and money to ensure that these groups can continue to operate.</P>

      <P>Molaim an tAire as ucht a theacht anseo anocht. Is rud an-mhaith é go dtagann Aire go dtí díospóireacht mar seo. Mar a dúirt an Teachta Crawford, bhí sé ag caint linn tráthnóar an scéal práinneach seo a bhfuil lán daoine buartha faoi. Caithfimid an fhírinne a fháil ón Aire agus níl aon dabht ach go bhfaighimid í, ach caithfear rud níos mó ná sin a fháil. Caithfimid an t-airgead a fháil dos na daoine bochta atá ag brath ar an Aire agus ar na scéimeanna páirtíochta timpeall na tíre.</P>
      <P>We need to get the facts. I acknowledge the courtesy of the Minister and his Department officials in meeting us to discuss this matter. As my colleague said, there are two points of views. One view is that the partnerships are under extreme pressure for funding. They firmly believe that their budgets have been significantly cut back and that nationally the partnerships, on average, face cutbacks of 28%.</P>
      <P>The Estimate for the Minister's Department states that they will face cutbacks of 6%. From speaking to people in partnerships throughout the country, they do not have a problem with the 6% cutback, but they have a problem with the major shortfall for projects such as the breakfast clubs, the homework clubs, services for Travellers, single parents and other people who are deprived and in extreme circumstances.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I acknowledge the personal commitment the Minister has to look after people in this area and the work he has done, but my community in Drogheda is deeply concerned. Having spoken to people in ADM and to its chief executive, Dr. Tony Crooks, they are convinced not only that <Col N="167" /> jobs will be lost, but that the frontline delivery of important services to communities is under significant threat. In the partnership in Drogheda, in September there will be no homework clubs, breakfast clubs or proper services for single parents and others. This is an important issue, which the Minister must address immediately.</P>

      <P>Ba mhaith liom buíochas a ghlacadh leis an mbeirt Teachta as ucht na ceist seo a thógáil liom tráthnóna. Is ceist thromchúiseach í agus tá sé tábhachtach go mbeinn féin, mar Aire atá freagrach aisti, i láthair leis an bhfírinne faoin scéal seo a mhíniú.</P>
      <P>It is important that we set the record straight. I have been contacted by partnerships. The record is simple. An amount of &euro;44.6 million has been provided in the Vote of my Department for the local development programme in 2003. This figure represents a reduction of 6% in the local development subhead over the 2002 figure. I emphasise that it is a 6% reduction.</P>
      <P>In 2001 and 2002, funding of &euro;45.5 million and &euro;47.6 million was provided in the Estimates to deliver the three sub-measures of the programme. The outturn for those years was &euro;43.2 million in 2001 and &euro;53.6 million in 2002. An additional &euro;6 million in 2002 was provided from savings within the Vote of my Department and allocated to the local development programme in December 2002. In other words, it was not part of the normal budget, but there were some savings and they was refunded at the end of the year. That additional funding was possible, but the partnerships could not have expected it and should not have counted on it.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will be aware that ADM manages the local development social inclusion programme on behalf of my Department. The programme is delivered on the ground by 38 partnerships and 33 community groups. Allocations from within the budget available for the programme in 2003 were recently agreed by the board of ADM. The Minister has nothing to do with the individual allocations &ndash; they are agreed by the board of ADM and notified to each partnership and community group.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As the Deputies will appreciate, ADM must manage the programme within the budget avail<Col N="168" /> able in my Department's Vote. Reductions in available funding for 2003 are being managed on a sliding scale, ranging from 4% to 7%, depending on the annual budget of the partnership and community group. In other words, the cutbacks this year are between 4% and 7% &ndash; there is no cutback of 33%.</P>
    <P>I understand the partnerships and community groups may have had the expectation of the carry-over of commitments into 2003. Their understanding was that to the extent to which they had not spent NDP moneys in previous years, that they could do so, that they could roll them forward into 2003. This might have arisen because prior to 2000 under the previous national plan, this scheme was EU funded on a multiannual funding basis. However, this scheme is Exchequer funded only and, as everybody is aware, where a scheme is Exchequer funded, the Department operates on a cash basis each year, not on an accrual basis. Every Deputy fully appreciates that is the way we voted through the Estimates and we are involved in the Estimates procedure. There was no question of carrying money forward from one year to the next.</P>
    <P>It is important to distinguish between commitments of partnership and community groups as opposed to unpaid liabilities brought forward from 2002 to 2003, in other words, bills etc. in hand. Net unpaid liabilities being brought forward by partnerships this year are quite small, in the order of &euro;600,000. Presumably at the end of this year they will carry forward approximately the same amount of money into 2004. That is understandable because everyone knows that we will not have every bill at the end of the year.</P>
    <P>It should be possible, therefore, for full programmes to continue. If a full programme could be completed with funding of &euro;47 million last year and funding of &euro;43 million the year before, it should be possible with funding of &euro;44.6 billion this year &ndash; they are looking after the pennies this year. I have no doubt that this will be the outcome. This matter has come like a shot out of the blue in the past two weeks. I cannot see where the problem is in this regard. In the meantime I am working with ADM and the partnerships to minimise as far as possible the impact of the reduction of 6% in funding this year.</P>

      <P>The ultimate authority for actions taken to remove Iraq's weapons of mass destruction derives from Security Council Resolution 687, which decided that Iraq &ldquo;shall unconditionally accept the destruction, removal, or rendering harmless under international supervision&rdquo; of its weapons of mass destruction and long-range missiles. This remains the position.</P>
      <P>The onus was on Iraq firstly to present a full list of its banned weapons and then to produce all weapons on that list for destruction. Resolution 687 established UNSCOM as a special commission of the Security Council, and mandated its arms inspectors to verify Iraq's compliance with those requirements and to destroy all weapons produced.</P>
      <P>Security Resolution 1284 established the successor of UNSCOM, UNMOVIC, as a subsidiary body of the Security Council, with the same mandate as UNSCOM and increased powers and responsibilities in relation to enforcing Iraq's compliance with its obligations.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>When Ireland joined the United Nations Security Council on 1 January 2001, it was engaged in a wider range of issues of international peace and security than at any other time in its history. The Government developed an independent national position on each of these issues, taking account of common positions of the European Union, where these existed. The Government articulated these positions firmly and consistently, and worked constructively and flexibly to help achieve, where possible, a fair and practical outcome in the <Col N="170" /> broadest interest of the parties involved and of the international community.</P>
      <P>Ireland took a consultative and transparent approach to our membership of the Security Council, as promised during the election campaign. We kept our EU partners closely informed of the work of the Security Council and took their concerns on the various issues into account. Ireland worked to ensure that human rights and humanitarian needs were central to Security Council discussions and decisions, and that its primary responsibility under the UN Charter for the maintenance of international peace and security was respected.</P>
      <P>During the period of our membership, the Security Council was confronted by a number of very serious challenges. These included the 11 September attacks, and the ensuing military action in Afghanistan, which commenced during Ireland's Presidency of the Security Council in October 2001. During its Presidency, Ireland was in a position to ensure that the action taken in Afghanistan was fully in accord with the letter and spirit of the UN Charter, that the Security Council was and remained fully involved, and that the grave humanitarian situation of the Afghan people remained at the centre of its concerns. It is a matter of particular satisfaction to the Government that the United Nations was placed at the centre of reconstruction efforts.</P>
      <P>The reform of the sanctions regime on Iraq to ameliorate its effects on the Iraqi people was a major aim of the Government, and this was achieved in large measure by the adoption of Resolution 1409 in May of last year. When the active disarmament of Iraq came to the forefront of the Council's agenda, Ireland, with others, insisted on the central role of the Security Council and on the importance of offering Iraq the option of peaceful disarmament. In the negotiation and adoption of Resolution 1441, we made clear that, as far as Ireland was concerned, it was for the Security Council to determine the course of action in the event that Iraq refused to avail of the final opportunity offered by the resolution to comply with its disarmament obligations.</P>
      <P>On the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, Ireland argued at every stage for a strengthened Security Council role, and for a balanced international approach. In the face of a deteriorating situation, Ireland played a central role in ensuring that the Security Council resumed its rightful position at the centre of efforts to resolve the conflict, and that it formally enshrined in a resolution &ndash; Resolution 1397 &ndash; the concept of a two-state solution. The UN's role at the centre of the process as a member of the quartet was consolidated. Ireland at all times called for parallel progress on the political, security and economic-humanitarian fronts and supported the role of the Quartet in their work of developing a roadmap leading to the achievement of the two-state solution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Ireland pressed strongly for increased Security Council engagement with African issues, in particular for support for the peace processes in the <Col N="171" /> Democratic Republic of the Congo, Burundi and Sierra Leone. Ireland was particularly active in bringing about the re-engagement by the UN with Somalia, in the face of enormous reluctance on the part of some in the international community, in the wake of events in the early 1990s. Ireland's permanent representative was a particularly active chairman of the Angola sanctions committee, and proved to be its last chairman, with the Security Council lifting the sanctions in December 2002, as Angola's long civil war was brought to an end.</P>
    <P>The protection of civilians in armed conflict was a particular concern for Ireland, and we succeeded in securing the adoption of a checklist of issues in this area to be taken account of when establishing or modifying peace-keeping mandates. We also pressed for a changed approach to sanctions, to ensure that coercive measures were narrowly targeted on the parties being coerced, and that unintended effects on civilian populations were avoided. These principles were applied in a number of sanctions regimes.</P>
    <P>In the Security Council's counter-terrorism activity, greatly enhanced after the events of 11 September, Ireland was insistent that the fight against terrorism be conducted in full conformity with international law, including humanitarian law, and with full respect for human rights. I had the honour of chairing an important meeting of the Security Council on East Timor on the last day of our Presidency, which was gratifying given the hard work put in by Ireland and others in ensuring a strong UN presence to assist the people of East Timor achieve and consolidate their independence. It was a source of great satisfaction to the Government that Ireland was able to vote last year in the Security Council to recommend the admission of Timor Leste as the newest member of the United Nations.</P>

      <P>I propose to answer Questions Nos. 56 and 134 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government is acutely conscious of the need to strengthen the United Nations in order to fulfil the commitment made by the Taoiseach and his fellow heads of Government in the Millennium Summit declaration to ensure a more effective instrument for pursuing the fight for <Col N="172" /> peace and development and against poverty, ignorance and disease.</P>
    <P>The Secretary General's report of September 2002 on reform of the UN system, Strengthening of the United Nations: an Agenda for Further Change, represented a further significant step in the reform process. In response to the Secretary General's report, the General Assembly, on 20 December 2002, adopted by consensus a comprehensive resolution on strengthening the UN system. The important task now is to secure implementation of the commitments contained in the resolution. As far as Ireland and its EU partners are concerned, the reform process is not a cost-cutting exercise, but an essential series of steps aimed at strengthening and renewing the UN system.</P>
    <P>United arrears payments have eased budgetary pressure and added impetus to the reform process. Co-operation between the Security Council and countries contributing troops to UN peacekeeping operations has been strengthened. As a permanent troop-contributor, Ireland pressed very strongly for this while on the Council. Major reforms have been undertaken in UN peacekeeping operations, based on the recommendations of the report of the panel on UN peace operations.</P>
    <P>Extensive administrative reform is under way in the implementation of the UN's development programmes. Far-reaching reforms have been implemented within several of the UN's funds and programmes, involving the restructuring of management and the streamlining of operations.</P>
    <P>One of the most difficult issues facing the UN membership generally is the question of Security Council reform. The General Assembly decided in 1993 to establish a working group, open to all UN member states, to address this issue in a comprehensive way. The working group has been meeting regularly in New York since 1993, with Ireland as an active participant, but it has to be said that progress to date on this very complex issue has been disappointing. The key issues involved are enlargement of Security Council membership, the Council's working methods and its decision-making procedures including, crucially, the use of the veto.</P>
    <P>Ireland supports a small, regionally balanced increase in both the permanent and the elected membership to create an enlarged Security Council of between 20 and 25 members. Ireland does not believe that this should be at the expense of smaller members. As for the veto, Ireland would like to see it eliminated altogether. The Government recognises, however, the strong opposition of the permanent members and, in a spirit of realism and practicality, has proposed that they be invited to accept a limitation of the veto whereby they would exercise it only when the question in hand was one of vital national importance, taking into account the interests of the United Nations as a whole. At the same time, any new permanent members of the Security Council would commit themselves not to exercise the veto. Despite the lack of tangible progress to <Col N="173" /> date, Ireland will continue to play an active and constructive role in seeking agreement on reform of the Security Council.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, may I assure the House that reform of the UN remains very much a live issue, on which more work remains to be done. Ireland will continue to support the reform process and will remain actively involved in it.</P>

      <P>Timor Leste became a sovereign state on 20 May 2002. A decision to establish diplomatic relations with Timor Leste was taken by the Government on 15 October 2002. Last month, the Government announced that Ireland had accorded Timor Leste programme country status for development co-operation purposes. This announcement is recognition of the significant progress made to date in Timor Leste, and demonstrates our continuing commitment to the political and socio-economic development of Timor Leste, and to the promotion of good governance and human rights in these crucial formative years. The Ireland Aid Timor Leste country strategy covers the period 2003-05, and provides for funding of more than &euro;11 million.</P>
      <P>My colleague, the Minister of State with responsibility for overseas development and human rights, Deputy Kitt, visited Timor Leste from 9-13 March 2003, and met with President Gusmao, Prime Minister Alkatiri, the special representative of the United Nations Secretary General, the commander of the UN peacekeeping forces, and members of international and national civil society organisations. I met with Foreign Minster Ramos Horta at the UN on 16 September 2002. During our meeting, he briefed me on developments in Timor Leste, and emphasised the need for continuing support from the international community for the judicial sector, and the Indonesian Special Human Rights Court.</P>
      <P>In their efforts to build a nation, the people of Timor Leste have shown great political maturity, and good progress has been made in the establishment of democracy there. Free and fair elections to a Constituent Assembly and for the position of President, were held in 2002. Every effort is being made by the new government to consolidate the fragile democratic institutions and the rule of law.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The current focus is on building and developing local government, and it is hoped that local government elections will be held later this year. Reforms are also under way in the public service, including the police and the judicial service. We welcome the government of Timor Leste's commitment to respect human rights. A National Commission for Reception, Truth and Reconcili<Col N="174" /> ation has been established, and is in the process of investigating human rights abuses in the period leading up to independence. Diplomatic relations have been established with Indonesia, and a special commission has been set up to delineate the border between the two countries.</P>
    <P>In spite of the achievements of the past three years, and despite continued progress, there are still major tasks to be accomplished in the coming months, and years. Timor Leste faces a number of challenges as one of the poorest nations in South East Asia. There is a critical need for continued support of the international community.</P>
    <P>On the security front, Under-Secretary General Guéhenno briefed the UN Security Council in March 2003, and pointed to two potentially, worrying developments: the threat of civil disturbance, and a rise in the activity of armed groups in rural areas. He added that there are significant deficiencies in the ability of the authorities to address these threats, and recommended a delay in the downsizing of the international military and police presence in UNMISET. The Security Council will continue to monitor developments in Timor Leste. Ireland will continue to play its part in the provision of ongoing international support for Timor Leste and will continue to follow developments there very closely.</P>

      <P>I propose to answer Questions Nos. 58, 114 and 175 together.</P>
      <P>The Government acted quickly in responding to the humanitarian crisis in Iraq. On 25 March, I announced a significant emergency humanitarian funding package of &euro;5 million for Iraq, with a particular emphasis on the needs of women and children. These funds will be delivered through international humanitarian agencies and NGOs with a proven record and capacity to deliver aid effectively and impartially. The key objectives of this assistance are to provide for the immediate needs of the most vulnerable Iraqis. The focus will be on food distribution, shelter, emergency health interventions, water and sanitation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="175" />In addition to this latest package, the Government has also already made significant contributions to UNICEF and the United Nations High Commission for Refugees, UNHCR, for their global operations. In 2003 these contributions have come to almost &euro;15 million. This funding has been ear-marked, thus giving these humanitarian organisations the flexibility and the fast delivery which can improve effectiveness and save more lives. In addition, I have approved funding of &euro;500,000 in support of start-up costs of key Irish NGOs. This will now enable them to respond to major humanitarian emergencies, such as Iraq, in a more effective and timely manner.</P>
    <P>As the situation in Iraq unfolds, Ireland will work as part of a concerted international humanitarian effort involving the United Nations, the European Union and NGOs to alleviate the effects of suffering on the most vulnerable Iraqi people.</P>

      <P>Since it was established in October 2001, the National Forum on Europe has played an important role in ensuring an inclusive and broadly-based debate on Ireland's participation in the European Union, and on the overall functioning and future development of the Union. Over the course of the past 18 months, the forum has actively engaged politicians and the general public both at national and regional levels. It will have conducted 60 meetings in 30 locations throughout the country by this summer. In doing so, the forum has played a significant role in strengthening the public's understanding of Ireland's role in the European Union and of how the Union will function when it grows from 15 to 25 members in May 2004.</P>
      <P>To date, the broad themes addressed by the forum have been enlargement, issues arising from the Nice referendum, and the work of the Convention on the Future of Europe. The third report of the chairman of the forum, which covers its work from June 2002 to January 2003, was published last month. In my view the forum, under the capable and independent chairmanship of Senator Maurice Hayes, is continuing to make a very positive contribution to the national debate on the European Union.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The forum is currently focusing on the Convention on the Future of Europe. Tomorrow it will meet in Dublin Castle to discuss the work of the convention working group on the Charter of Fundamental Rights. Further such meetings are planned for the weeks ahead. These meetings, which will take place at a number of different venues, will focus on the issues emerging at the <Col N="176" /> convention which is due to complete its work during the summer.</P>
    <P>The Government will be reflecting, in consultation with the chairman of the forum, on its precise role beyond the summer. It will take account of the forum's innovative, important and effective role which indeed is widely regarded as a model of best practice, including in many of the accession countries. The stimulation of informed ongoing public debate about Europe will remain important in the context of the forthcoming Intergovernmental Conference and the referendum which seems set to follow.</P>

      <P>The negotiations on the accession of the Republic of Cyprus to the European Union gave impetus to the peace talks sponsored by the United Nations for a comprehensive settlement of the Cyprus problem. I regret that, so far, the UN talks process has not succeeded. The most recent session of these talks, in The Hague on 10-11 March, failed to reach agreement. The Government of the Republic of Cyprus will sign the Treaty of Accession to the EU on 16 April. As matters stand, application of the terms of the treaty will be applied only in those areas of the island that are under the Government's control.</P>
      <P>I wish to pay tribute to the tireless efforts of the UN Secretary General, Kofi Annan, and his special adviser, Alvaro de Soto, in the search for a settlement of the Cyprus problem. They have been engaged in intensive rounds of peace talks since December 1999. In November 2002, the Secretary General conveyed a detailed peace plan to the Greek Cypriot and Turkish Cypriot sides, as the basis for further negotiation. In early December, following comments by both sides, he produced a revised plan, with a view to agreement by 28 February 2003, which would have enabled the necessary arrangements to be made for the accession to the EU of a united Cyprus.</P>
      <P>The Copenhagen European Council in December 2002 stated its strong preference for the accession of a united Cyprus and undertook to accommodate the terms of a settlement in the Treaty of Accession. It also confirmed that, in the absence of a settlement, the application of the Union's laws and regulations to the northern part of the island would be suspended. The Council welcomed the commitment of both sides to continue to negotiate on the basis of the Secretary General's proposals.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Despite the efforts of Secretary General Annan, who visited Ankara, Athens and Cyprus between 23 and 26 February with the aim of brokering agreement, it became clear that agreement would not be forthcoming. On 27 February, <Col N="177" /> the Secretary General invited the newly-elected President of Cyprus, Mr. Tassos Papadopoulos, and the Turkish Cypriot leader, Mr. Rauf Denktash, to come to The Hague on 10 March, and to commit themselves to holding separate referenda on 30 March 2003 on a new revised peace plan. Regrettably, agreement did not prove possible.</P>
    <P>At its meeting on 20-21 March 2003, the European Council regretted that Secretary General Annan's efforts to find a comprehensive settlement to the Cyprus problem had failed. It reaffirmed its decisions at Copenhagen regarding the accession of Cyprus to the EU. The European Council strongly supported the continuation of the Secretary General's mission of good offices and of continued negotiation on the basis of his proposals. It urged all parties to continue to work for a comprehensive settlement and, in particular, called on the Turkish Cypriot leadership to reconsider its position on the negotiations.</P>
    <P>I continue to believe that a comprehensive solution to the Cyprus problem can be found if all parties take the necessary steps and make the difficult compromises required. The Secretary General will report to the Security Council on the situation this week, and the European Union will continue to give its full support to his efforts.</P>

      <P>The UN Commission on Human Rights deals with a wide range of issues. This year, for instance, at the session currently ongoing in Geneva, it is expected to adopt over 90 resolutions. Most of these will be adopted by consensus, but some draft resolutions may be put to the vote. Co-sponsorship of a draft resolution indicates a strong degree of support for the issue it addresses.</P>
      <P>At the current session of the commission, Ireland is the principal sponsor of a resolution on the elimination of all forms of religious intolerance. Greece, on behalf of the European Union, will also present a number of draft resolutions, all of which Ireland will co-sponsor. I expect that these will include resolutions on the death penalty and on the rights of the child, as well as resolutions on the human rights situation in a number of countries, which are likely to include Burma-Myanmar, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, the Democratic People's Republic of North Korea, Iraq, Israeli Settlements in the Occupied Territories, Sudan, Turkmenistan, and Zimbabwe.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In addition, EU partners and other like-minded countries will put forward draft resolutions on the human rights situations in a number of countries, <Col N="178" /> as well as other issues which we consider to be particularly important, and we will indicate our strong support for them through co-sponsorship. In each case, the question of co-sponsorship will be decided by the merits of the draft resolution. Even if Ireland does not co-sponsor a draft resolution, it is still open to us, as members of the commission, to indicate our support for it through joining consensus or through a positive vote, if one is called.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy will be aware that Ireland has had a continuous presence in UN peacekeeping operations since 1958. Since then, Irish personnel have served over 50,000 individual missions on United Nations peacekeeping operations. In addition, Irish peacekeepers have served and are serving in multi-national peacekeeping forces sanctioned by the UN Security Council such as the Kosovo Force, KFOR, the Stabilisation Force in Bosnia and Herzegovina, SFOR, and the International Security Assistance Force, ISAF, in Afghanistan.</P>
      <P>Ireland's involvement in peacekeeping represents a major contribution to international peace and security. It is a record of which the Irish people can justly be proud. In the case of Iraq, the failure of the Security Council to reach agreement before the commencement of the military engagement was clearly regrettable. However, the Security Council is uniquely charged with the maintenance of international peace and the Government are confident that it will retain its primary responsibility for international peace and security and remain closely involved in conflict prevention, peacekeeping and post-conflict peace-building.</P>
      <P>There are currently close to 40,000 peacekeepers engaged in missions mandated by the Security Council, and thousands more taking part in missions mounted by groups of states under Security Council authorisation. Far from being sidelined, therefore, the United Nations Security Council is working intensively on a wide range of issues of international peace and security. Whatever differences have arisen, this core responsibility remains as does the need for peacekeepers from countries such as Ireland with proven track records of excellence in peacekeeping. I would add that during its two-year tenure as a Security Council member, recently completed, Ireland worked hard to ensure that the Security Council assumed its responsibility for the maintenance of international peace and security, and that its primary role in that regard was fully respected.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="179" />Moreover, on the specific case of Iraq, in the period since the commencement of military action, the Security Council, in adopting Resolution 1472, reached an important agreement on granting authority to the UN Secretary General to re-commence the oil for food programme. This was vital given the needs of the Iraqi people but also a good augury for the central involvement of the United Nations.</P>
    <P>The Government will follow closely efforts to reach agreement in the Security Council on a central role for the United Nations in post-war Iraq. Immediately upon the outbreak of war, the Taoiseach wrote to Secretary General Annan and the President of the Security Council regarding the Council's involvement. He spoke to Mr. Annan last Monday and raised the issue personally with President Bush and Prime Minister Blair at Hillsborough. It is the Government's view that a central role for the United Nations will be in the best interests of Iraq, and offer the best prospects for peace and security in the region.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 63 and 148 together.</P>
      <P>Ireland fully supports the ongoing development of European Union peacekeeping and crisis management capabilities in the context of European security and defence policy that has derived from the Amsterdam Treaty and the conclusions of successive European Councils. As the Government has consistently made clear, including during the recent Nice treaty referenda campaigns, Ireland will take its own sovereign decision on whether Irish military personnel should participate in any humanitarian or crisis management tasks undertaken by the EU, based on the triple lock of United Nations authorisation, Government decision and Dáil approval.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am conscious that the Deputies' questions arise against the background of Ireland's non-participation in the EU military monitoring and stabilisation mission which has recently commenced in the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, FYROM. Irish participation was precluded due to legal advice supplied by the Attorney General which indicated that the particular expression of UN endorsement for the outgoing NATO-led operation in FYROM, as <Col N="180" /> contained in Security Council Resolution 1371 of 26 September 2001, does not fully meet the requirements specified in the Defence Acts for participation in missions abroad by Defence Forces personnel.</P>
    <P>While this does not detract from our overall political support for the EU operation in FYROM, it would have to be acknowledged that the legislation in question dates from a period in which it was not envisaged that the UN would someday become reliant upon regional organisations to provide assistance with such operations. That said, I do not anticipate that the triple lock policy will unduly impinge upon Ireland's future ability to become involved in peace-keeping and crisis management missions. In this regard, I would point to Ireland's participation in the current NATO-led-UN-authorised SFOR military mission in Bosnia-Herzegovina and to the prospect of our continuing involvement in the expected EU take over of that mission in 2004.</P>
    <P>In view of the fact that UN reliance on organisations such as the EU is likely only to increase rather than diminish, it may be necessary to reflect on the implications of the current position and on ways by which we can overcome the problems which have arisen in this case, while retaining public confidence in the arrangements for the deployment of Defence Forces personnel overseas.</P>

      <P>There has been considerable progress over the past year in setting in place the framework for the external and internal security of Montenegro. On 4 February 2003, following protracted negotiations facilitated by the European Union, the state union of Serbia and Montenegro was proclaimed, in succession to the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. The new state union will have a common foreign and defence policy and will operate as a single economic space. I would like to pay tribute to the co-operative efforts of the Governments of the two constituent republics, and especially of Prime Minister Djukanovic of Montenegro and the late Prime Minister Djindjic of Serbia in ensuring the efficient establishment of the new federal institutions. I welcome the clear commitment of the new Serbian Prime Minister, Zoran Zivkovic, to continue this co-operation in the difficult circumstances following the tragic assassination of Zoran Djindjic.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The European Union is taking the lead in promoting peace, stability and reform in the western Balkans. The European Council on 20-21 March reaffirmed its full support for the political leaders of Serbia and Montenegro and the General Affairs and External Relations Council, which I will attend on 14 March, will consider proposals <Col N="181" /> for increased assistance to the reform process in the country.</P>
    <P>The stability of Montenegro is crucially dependent on the establishment of regional stability and regional co-operation, which are at the centre of the relationship between the EU and the countries of the western Balkans. The EU-western Balkans summit, which will be held in Thessaloniki on 21 June, will reaffirm the commitment of the European Union to working with the countries of the region towards their eventual integration into European structures. The basic framework is provided by the stabilisation and association process, which involves the implementation of wide-ranging political, economic and administrative reforms, with the objective of consolidating democratic government based on respect for human rights and the rule of law.</P>
    <P>In the wake of a decade of conflict in the western Balkans, organised crime and corruption are endemic in the region. At the London conference on organised crime last November, the EU member states and all the Governments of the region recognised the importance of co-operation in the fight against organised crime for the political stability and the security of the western Balkans. The Governments of the region have undertaken to implement specific action plans, with the assistance of the EU, and these will be reviewed with a view to further action at the Thessaloniki summit.</P>
    <P>The European Union is providing direct assistance to the Montenegrin Government in its judicial reform agenda, on police reform and on the urgent strengthening of the border management regime. Ireland is playing its part bilaterally as the major donor for a three-year Council of Europe programme of human rights training for all judges and prosecutors in Serbia and Montenegro and for lawyers and NGO experts. Ireland Aid has committed &euro;500,000 to the programme, which focuses on the development of expertise in international human rights law, in particular the European Convention on Human Rights and the application of its principles in Serbia and Montenegro.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>I share the Deputy's concern about the human rights and humanitarian situation in the eastern part of the Democratic Republic of the Congo. A great deal of progress has been made in the peace process in the Democratic Republic of the Congo over the past two years, including the signing last week of the final act of the Inter-Congolese Dialogue. Under the final act, the parties agreed to establish a transitional, power-sharing government for two years, to be followed by elections. This agreement marks a watershed in the peace process and will contribute significantly to resolv<Col N="182" /> ing the conflict, including the current tensions in Ituri. Nonetheless, the Democratic Republic of the Congo will face many serious challenges in the period ahead, not least in the east of the country.</P>
      <P>The United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights has reported that all parties to the conflict in the Democratic Republic of the Congo have been implicated in gross violations of human rights. In particular, grave violations of human rights have been committed in recent months in Ituri. There has been a strong ethnic component to the atrocities, and I am deeply disturbed by the reported massacre of up to 1,000 people in Ituri late last week. This is an appalling tragedy, which must be condemned without reservation. I understand that the UN is investigating the incident and seeking to establish the likely perpetrators of this heinous crime.</P>
      <P>The Security Council has condemned systematic violations of international humanitarian law and human rights in Ituri and declared that those responsible should be brought to justice. The Security Council has encouraged the transitional government to establish, as soon as possible, a truth and reconciliation commission, to be charged with determining responsibility for serious violations of international human rights and humanitarian law. The Security Council has also requested the Secretary General, in consultation with the High Commissioner for Human Rights, to make recommendations on other ways to help the transitional government to address the issue of impunity.</P>
      <P>The Government fully supports these actions. I should also add that at the UN Commission on Human Rights, which is under way in Geneva, the European Union is presenting a draft resolution on the human rights situation in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Throughout our membership of the Security Council, Ireland maintained a focus on the human rights and humanitarian situation in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. We consistently called on the parties to refrain from human rights violations and to respect the provisions of international humanitarian law. On 18 October last, the Security Council agreed a presidential statement condemning the intensification of ethnically targeted violence in the Ituri region. The European Union has asked the United Nations to continue to monitor the situation in Ituri closely and to make, if necessary, the appropriate adjustments to the mandate of the UN peacekeeping force in the country in the light of the crisis, a point which Ireland raised as a member of the Security Council.</P>
      <P>Towards the end of March, the European Union demarched the Governments of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Rwanda and Uganda about the situation in Ituri. The European Union expressed grave concern about the situation there, and called on the countries concerned to use their influence to reduce tensions in the region.</P>

      <P>The quartet road map has been developed after long and careful consultation between the quartet members &ndash; the United States, the European Union, Russia and the United Nations. A text was agreed at the ministerial level meeting in Washington on 20 December 2002, but has not yet been formally adopted and presented to the parties. President Bush indicated on 14 March that he wishes to see the roadmap presented to the parties as soon as the new Palestinian Government has been formed and approved by the Palestinian Legislative Council. This is expected to happen before the middle of April.</P>
      <P>The current text of the road map was endorsed by the quartet members in December last. The Palestinian Authority has indicated that the text as it stands is acceptable. The Government of Israel has expressed reservations about certain aspects of the road map. While Ireland and our EU partners consider that the road map should be adopted as it stands, it will be open to the members of the Quartet and the parties to make amendments by common consent and in the light of changing circumstances over the implementation period of the roadmap.</P>
      <P>The current crisis in Iraq makes it all the more imperative that there should be visible progress on the Middle East peace process and that the publication and implementation of the roadmap should not be further delayed.</P>

      <P>In the past weeks, I have continued to meet regularly with the pro-Agreement parties in Northern Ireland and with the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, Paul Murphy. In these discussions we have addressed a number of issues related to the ongoing efforts to achieve the full implementation of all aspects of the Agreement, including the restoration of the devolved institutions on a sustainable basis. The two Governments intend to present our proposals later this week when the Taoiseach and Prime Minister Blair return to Hillsborough.</P>
      <P>Yesterday at Hillsborough, the Taoiseach, along with Prime Minister Blair and President Bush, met with pro-Agreement parties to reiterate the collective commitment of the Governments to the full and complete implementation of the Agreement. We emphasised the need for acts of completion to bring the current political uncertainty to an end and to facilitate a strong and credible pro-Agreement platform for the Assembly elections on 29 May. When the two Governments publish our proposals later this week, I hope that the political parties and civic society in Northern Ireland will be able to endorse and fully support them.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>On 3 April, I attended a lunch meeting of EU and NATO Foreign Ministers with United States Secretary of State, Colin Powell. It was an informal meeting and there were no agreed conclusions. The meeting, which was convened at short notice took place at the request of the Secretary of State. Both during the meeting and in his subsequent press conference, the Secretary of State made clear that he had come to Brussels to <Col N="185" /> talk with, and to listen to the views of European Foreign Ministers on the transatlantic relationship and on the post-war situation in Iraq. For his part, the Secretary of State made clear that the US wanted to move past the disagreements over Iraq and renew transatlantic co-operation across the broad range of challenges and threats that face the international community. There was broad agreement on this goal.</P>
    <P>I can report that there was a good and productive atmosphere at the meeting, with all the participants agreed on the importance of sustained and sincere transatlantic co-operation. The large number of issues where transatlantic co-operation was achieving good results &ndash; the western Balkans, Afghanistan, terrorism &ndash; were noted. I, and a number of other Ministers, underlined the importance of multilateralism in providing the widest degree of international solidarity to meet the challenges and threats that face us all. I also raised, as did many of my European Union colleagues, the imperative of forward progress in the Middle East peace process based not only on the early publication of the Quartet road map, but also pressure for its early implementation.</P>
    <P>On the post-conflict situation in Iraq, Greek Foreign Minister George Papendreou, acting as EU Presidency, explained that there was unanimity in the EU on the importance of a central role for the United Nations. EU Ministers noted the UN's experience in managing the post-conflict situations in places like East Timor, Afghanistan, Namibia and Cambodia and that this expertise should be drawn on in Iraq. We also noted the willingness of UN Secretary General Kofi Annan to devote the resources of the organisation to addressing the needs of the Iraqi people once the UN Security Council makes a request. The Greek Presidency, on behalf of the EU, underlined the importance of the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Iraq; the importance of the United Nations providing legitimacy and a basis for a wider international consensus in the post conflict phase; and the commitment of the EU to do what it can to address the humanitarian needs of the Iraqi people. As I have indicated, there were no agreed conclusions from the meeting, but it was certainly a useful opportunity for me and other EU Ministers to discuss and make known our views on these important issues.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 70 and 138 together.</P>
      <P>Our national programme of assistance to developing countries comprises two elements. The major component is my Department's Vote for International Co-operation, &euro;374 million in 2003, while elements of official development assistance, ODA, expected to total some &euro;80 million in 2003, are administered by other Departments.</P>
      <P>Total ODA has increased substantially in recent years, from &euro;177 million in 1998 to &euro;420 million in 2002. A further increase was provided for in 2003 bringing the total allocation for ODA to an expected &euro;450 million, the highest ever allocation in the history of the programme. Current indications are that we will again reach 0.41% of GNP in 2003. Maintaining our contribution as a proportion of GNP in these difficult times is a measure of the Government's clear commitment to the aid programme and to achieving the United Nations target of 0.7% by 2007. The scale and timing of the increases in funding required to achieve the 0.7% target by 2007 will be reviewed on an ongoing basis.</P>

      <P>The refugee policy of Britain, Denmark, Norway, Sweden and the US is a matter for those Governments. I do not consider it would be appropriate for me to comment on the refugee policies of individual states. As regards the Irish refugee process, the Minister with responsibility for this area is the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform. He has informed me that the processing of asylum applications from Iraqi nationals has been suspended by the office of the refugee applications commissioner since 28 March 2003. This suspension is in accordance with advice received from the office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees in respect of the rapidly evolving circumstances in Iraq. Consideration of appeals has also been suspended by the office of the refugee appeals tribunal from the same date and for the same reason. The matter is being kept under constant review by both offices.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="187" />While the processing of Iraqi asylum applications has been suspended, I understand that new applications from asylum applicants, including Iraqi nationals, entering the country on their own initiative continue to be accepted in accordance with the provisions of the Refugee Act 1996. The accommodation and other needs of all asylum applicants and programme refugees will continue to be met by the reception and integration agency which has responsibility for such matters. As regards the detention of asylum applicants, the grounds on which an applicant for asylum may be detained are set out in section 9(8) of the Refugee Act.</P>

      <P>Ireland takes every opportunity to register its concerns about the practices of the Burmese regime. We take an active role in initiating and strengthening actions in this connection at the United Nations, including through the UN Commission on Human Rights, at which a resolution on the human rights situation in Burma is currently under consideration, and at the UN General Assembly.</P>
      <P>The reports to which the Deputy refers involve rape, and other forms of sexual violence carried out by members of the armed forces, on ethnic Shan women, and others. These are particularly serious reports, and are indicative of the more general human rights situation in the country. In this regard, my colleague, the Minister of State with responsibility for overseas development and human rights, Deputy Kitt, met, in September of 2002, with Mr. Harn Yawnghwe of the European Burma Office, along with representatives of Burma Action Ireland, Amnesty International, and Trócaire. In 2002, Ireland Aid approved funding of &euro;79,900 for a project on capacity building for the Burmese Democratic Movement in Exile. This is the third year in succession that Ireland Aid has funded this project. Total funding thus far approximates to &euro;250,000. Officials of my Department meet regularly to review issues of concern with representatives of Burma Action Ireland, Amnesty, Trócaire and other involved NGOs. The next such meeting with officials is taking place later this month, and will be attended by representatives of the Women's League of Burma, one of whom is a member of the Shan Women's Action Network.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government also takes an active role in this matter in the European Union. The Union's common position is due for renewal on 29 April. <Col N="188" /> I will be attending the External Relations Council next week, at which the strengthening of the common position will be taken up. I attended the EU-ASEAN Foreign Ministers Meeting on 27-28 January, at which the EU took the opportunity to express its strong concerns about the situation in Burma to the Burmese delegation.</P>
    <P>The EU has previously expressed its willingness to support a substantive process of national reconciliation, leading to the restoration of a democratic order and greater respect for human rights in Burma. The UN Secretary General's special representative to Burma, Mr. Razali Ismail, recently briefed the EU's Asia working group in Brussels on the situation in Burma. Mr. Razali expressed his dissatisfaction with the lack of progress towards the restoration of democracy in Burma. The EU fully supports his attempts to help build confidence and co-operation with all sections of Burmese society, particularly with regard to human rights issues.</P>
    <P>Mr. Sérgio Pinheiro, special rapporteur on the human rights situation in Burma, recently presented a summary of his report to the UN Commission on Human Rights, which is currently meeting in Geneva. Mr. Pinheiro reported that the ICRC had been allowed to extend its presence in Burma, and that Amnesty International made its first ever visit to Burma. Overall, however, he reported that there was not sufficient progress on human rights. The special rapporteur called for an investigation of the allegations of rape against ethnic Shan women, but the Burmese regime has not responded to his request. He also reports that the rate of release of political prisoners has slowed, and is being used as a bargaining tool in talks with the National League for Democracy, one of the principal opposition groups. He also reiterated that Burma still operates under a military structure; poverty is widespread; a third of children are under weight, and that while the regime says they are working for constructive dialogue with the NLD, in reality this is not being demonstrated. In view of the above, we will continue to take every opportunity to register our serious concern at the practices of the Burmese regime and, along with our EU partners, follow events in Burma closely.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 74, 89, 93 and 111 together.</P>
      <P>The Government views with concern the actions of North Korea throughout the current crisis, which began in October 2002. On 10 January, I issued a statement noting with great regret North Korea's announcement that it was withdrawing from the Non-Proliferation Treaty.</P>
      <P>In view of both the gravity of the situation, and the very serious potential consequences for the wider international community of the continued refusal by North Korea to fulfil its nuclear non-proliferation obligations, the Government does not consider that this matter is solely a bilateral issue with the United States, as characterised by the Pyongyang Government. On the contrary, we regard it as a matter which affects the international community, and thus one which demands a comprehensive, multilateral solution. In this regard, I warmly welcome the fact that the United Nations Security Council is scheduled to discuss the issue today.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In January 2003, the European Union General Affairs and External Relations Council agreed in principle to send a high-level EU delegation to Pyongyang, but as a result of difficulties relating to the level at which the delegation would be received, and conditions laid down by the North Koreans, the delegation has effectively been prevented going to Pyongyang. However, the External Relations Council remains actively seized of the matter and Members of the Council and the High Representative are in regular consultation with countries in the region, including Japan, the Republic of Korea and China, on how <Col N="190" /> this matter might be peacefully taken forward. Beyond these ongoing contacts, I am not aware of representations by Japan to the EU regarding the activities of the North Korean regime.</P>
    <P>Ireland does not have diplomatic relations with North Korea. At the present time, I would not foresee such relations being established until North Korea engages in a meaningful way with the international community.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the central role of the European Union in the promotion of peace, stability and prosperity in the western Balkans, the situation in the region is a permanent item on agenda for the monthly meetings of the General Affairs and External Relations Council. Developments in Bosnia and Herzegovina, and the encouragement of the difficult reform process in the country, are discussed regularly at meetings of the Council. At our next meeting, on 14-15 April 2003, the Council will review the Commission's second annual report on the stabilisation and association process for the western Balkans. The report on Bosnia and Herzegovina notes that, seven years after the end of the conflict, thousands of human rights abuses, including disappearances, remain to be fully investigated, punished or redressed. It is essential for the future stability of Bosnia that the tragedy of missing victims of the conflict be addressed fully, and that those responsible for human rights abuses are brought to account. In this context, the Council continues to emphasise the need for improved levels of co-operation by all states and parties in the region with the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is estimated that there could be as many as 40,000 people still missing throughout the area of the former Yugoslavia as a result of the conflicts. The signatories of the Dayton Peace Agreement in 1996 committed themselves to co-operating with the International Committee of the Red Cross in trying to establish the fate of missing persons in Bosnia and Herzegovina. In the period January 1995 to February 2001, tracing requests were received from the families of 20,527 missing persons, and in February this year the ICRC reported that over 16,000 people remained unaccounted for. The ICRC is continuing to co-ordinate action to establish the fate of these people, in co-operation with the European Union and the wider international community and the Bosnian authorities. A key organisation in this effort is the International Commission for Missing Persons, ICMP, which was established by the G-7 Summit in 1996 and continues to operate throughout the areas affected by the conflicts in the 1990s. It <Col N="191" /> works in co-operation with the governments of the region and with civil society, notably family associations. It has established a forensic science programme, which has pioneered systems of large-scale DNA matching. Ireland fully supports the work of the ICMP and in 2002 contributed &euro;120,000 to its programmes throughout the western Balkans.</P>

      <P>On 18 March 2003, in the lead-up to the outbreak of hostilities in Iraq, my Department issued travel advice to Irish citizens in the Middle East region or intending to travel there. This advice is available on my Department's website at www.irlgov.ie/iveagh. In addition, our embassies in Riyadh, Cairo and Tel Aviv have maintained close contact with Irish citizens in their area of accreditation and have been ready to provide emergency assistance should this be necessary.</P>
      <P>The following is the current travel advice provided by my Department: The Department advises against all non-essential travel to the Middle East region until it is clear that there is no longer any likelihood of military operations. More specific advice for individual countries is given below. Further advice may be issued as the situation in the region develops. Irish citizens generally, and in particular in the Middle Eastern region, should be aware of the increased possibility of terrorist attacks as a result of the conflict in Iraq and should exercise extreme vigilance and caution in their movements at all times.</P>
      <P>Iraq: Any Irish citizens remaining in Iraq are strongly advised to leave the country immediately. As all EU missions have withdrawn from Baghdad it will not be possible to provide consular assistance to Irish citizens in Iraq.</P>
      <P>Kuwait: Irish citizens in Kuwait are urged to leave as quickly as possible. Irish citizens who intend to remain in Kuwait have been asked to confirm this to the Irish Consul at the Kuwait Palace Hotel. However, they should be aware that, depending on the extent of the conflict, it may not be possible for the Irish Consul to assist them once hostilities have commenced.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Israel and the occupied territories: Irish citizens are advised against non-essential travel to Israel. Irish citizens resident in Israel are advised to leave unless they consider their presence essential. Those who choose to remain are advised to maintain regular contact with the Irish Embassy in Tel Aviv and to ensure that their travel documents are in order. Irish citizens are advised against all travel to the West Bank and Gaza, and <Col N="192" /> Irish citizens in the occupied territories are advised to leave.</P>
    <P>Saudi Arabia and the Gulf States: Irish citizens are advised against non-essential travel to Saudi Arabia, Qatar and Bahrain. Irish citizens resident in these countries are advised to consider leaving unless they regard their presence as essential. Those who remain are advised to maintain regular contact with the Irish Embassy in Riyadh.</P>
    <P>Syria: Irish citizens are advised against non-essential travel to Syria. Irish citizens resident in Syria are advised to ensure they are registered with the Irish Honorary Consulate in Damascus, and to consider whether their continued presence is essential.</P>
    <P>Jordan: Irish citizens are advised against non-essential travel to Jordan. Pending the reopening of the Irish Honorary Consulate, Irish citizens residing in Jordan are advised to ensure that they are registered with the British Embassy in Amman and to leave unless they consider their continued presence is essential.</P>
    <P>Yemen: Irish citizens are advised against non-essential travel to Yemen. Irish citizens resident in this country are advised to consider leaving unless they regard their presence as essential.</P>

      <P>The Government has consistently taken the view that the transfer of its own population into occupied territory by an occupying power is a flagrant breach of the Fourth Geneva Convention. The settlements established in the occupied Palestinian territories of the West Bank and the Gaza Strip by the Israeli authorities are illegal and must be dismantled. Land seizures by the occupation forces for purposes of settlement are null and void.</P>
      <P>The case referred to by the Deputy appears to be a particularly disturbing example of this policy in action. My Department will follow closely the progress of this case before the Supreme Court of Israel, where the next hearing is due on 27 April.</P>

      <P>As the Deputy is aware, primary responsibility for advancing the objectives of the European Year of People with Disabilities at the international and European Union levels rests with the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform. A number of other Ministers also have responsibilities relating to people with disabilities. Ireland is committed to promoting and protecting the human rights of persons with disabilities and the Government will work with like minded countries in international fora to address this issue.</P>
      <P>Persons with disabilities are entitled to all the fundamental human rights set out in international human rights instruments on the same basis as every other human being. The General Assembly established the foundation for the promotion and protection of human rights in 1948 when it proclaimed the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. This proclaimed that all human beings are born free and equal in dignity and rights, and that everyone is entitled to all the rights and freedoms set forth in it, without distinction of any kind.</P>
      <P>This approach is also central to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights. Together they form the most comprehensive international code of binding legal provisions in the area of human rights. The two covenants develop and supplement the provisions of the Universal Declaration, and the three instruments together make up what has come to be known as the International Bill of Human Rights.</P>
      <P>Following on from the two covenants, other human rights instruments have been drafted to address specific forms of discrimination faced by different groups. These instruments elaborate in more detail the rights set out in the International Bill of Human Rights and also affirm certain rights not specified in those documents. The other main human rights instruments are the Convention Against Torture, the Convention on the Rights of the Child, the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women and the Convention on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination. The rights contained in these instruments also apply fully to persons with disabilities.</P>
      <P>A number of the instruments have specific references to disability rights. These include Article 23 of the Convention on the Rights of the Child. The Convention Against Torture contains standards which are to be used for preventing disability. The optional protocol to the Convention on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination, which was adopted by the General Assembly in 1999, specifically deals with the issue of women with disabilities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="194" />There have been a significant number of declarations and resolutions concerning the rights of persons with disabilities at UN level. Although they are important in raising the awareness of disability rights and apply to all member states of the UN they do not have the same legal force as legally binding instruments.</P>
    <P>As the Deputy may be aware, the United Nations has for some time been considering the question of a new instrument aimed at the protection and promotion of the human rights of persons with disabilities. The first meeting of the UN <i>ad hoc</i> committee to consider proposals for a comprehensive and integral international convention on protection and promotion of the rights and dignity of persons with disabilities was held in New York from 29 July to 9 August 2002. The next meeting of the committee will be held from 16 to 27 June next in New York.</P>
    <P>Ireland believes that the guiding principle of the <i>ad hoc</i> committee should be to ensure that persons with disabilities can better enjoy their human rights. We consider that a new legally binding instrument should facilitate the implementation of existing rights to the specific situations faced by persons with disabilities. Ireland along with our EU partners will aim to ensure that the processes and outcomes of the ad-hoc committee meet this principle. In advance of its next meeting, Ireland will work with our EU partners in an effort to reach a common position in regard to the work of the ad-hoc committee.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>I refer to my reply to Question No. 244 of 25 March 2003. Human rights issues are an important element of contacts at all levels between Ireland and the Government of Turkey. The embassy in Ankara, along with the embassies of our European Union partners and the representation of the European Commission, monitors the human rights situation in Turkey and regularly raises with the authorities, both formally and informally, allegations of torture and ill-treatment of people in custody. The general issue of sexual violence against women and men in detention in Turkey, and specific allegations, have been raised by the EU with the Turkish Government as part of this process.</P>
      <P>Turkey adopted a series of human rights reforms during 2002, which included legislation aimed at the abolition of torture and ill treatment of people in custody. I have welcomed these reforms, and I welcome the willingness on the part of the Turkish Government to address the issue of torture, in all its forms. It is important now that the legislative reforms be fully implemented.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="195" />The Copenhagen European Council in December 2002 reaffirmed that Turkey is a candidate country destined to join the European Union on the basis of the same political criteria which apply to other candidate countries. These include the political criteria laid down by the Copenhagen European Council in 1993, which stipulate that a candidate country must achieve stability of institutions guaranteeing democracy, the rule of law, human rights and respect for and protection of minorities.</P>
    <P>The European Commission's 2002 report on Turkey's progress towards accession, stated that the adoption of the human rights reforms demonstrates the determination of the majority of Turkey's political leaders to move towards further alignment with the values and standards of the European Union. It noted that these reforms were adopted under difficult political and economic circumstances, and represented a major shift in the Turkish context.</P>
    <P>The Copenhagen European Council last December strongly welcomed the legislative packages and implementation measures adopted by Turkey and encouraged the energetic pursuit of the reform process. It gave the commitment that if the European Council in December 2004 decides that Turkey has fulfilled the Copenhagen political criteria, the EU will open accession negotiations without delay. The eradication of all forms of torture and ill-treatment, including sexual violence against women in custody, will be an important element of the assessment of the human rights situation in Turkey in this context.</P>

    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>As I stated in my reply to a question from Deputy Bernard Durkan on 27 June 2002, the following priorities were adopted at the Council of Europe's last summit in 1997: human rights, democratic stability, the rule of law, culture and education and social cohesion. This is the framework in which Ireland pursues our key priorities at the Council of Europe and supports the core function of the Council to ensure that fundamental human values are the basis for the development of democratic states governed by the rule of law throughout the European continent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Ireland attaches the highest priority to the work of the Council of Europe and we continue to see the council performing a key function in Europe in this century. Through its legal instruments, the council has developed a unique <i>acquis </i>and unrivalled legitimacy in the field of democracy and human rights. Ireland is determined to <Col N="196" /> ensure that the European Convention on Human Rights remains the essential reference point for the protection of human rights in Europe as a whole.</P>
    <P>As I stated above, we attach priority importance to the council's work in human rights. Most recently, Ireland has been pursuing its initiative to support and reform the European Court of Human Rights. Following a report prepared by Ireland's Permanent Representation in Strasbourg, the ministerial session in November adopted a declaration on the court instructing that work be accelerated in order that substantive decisions on reforms can be taken at the next session in May 2003.</P>
    <P>In the field of democratic stability and social cohesion, Ireland has committed &euro;1.8 million in funding for Council of Europe human rights and democratisation projects in Russia and South East Europe for the years 2002-04. In addition, the Department of Finance is currently preparing the necessary legislation to allow for Ireland's accession to the Council of Europe Development Bank.</P>
    <P>There have been several recent Council of Europe meetings in Ireland, including, on 24 March last, a seminar on the European Social Charter organised in conjunction with the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, the Irish Centre for European Law and the Council of Europe. In November 2002, the Human Rights Commission and the Northern Ireland Human Rights Commission jointly hosted meetings in Dublin and Belfast for the national human rights institutions of the Council of Europe member states. Other recent seminars have examined issues related to Roma and Traveller rights and self-government.</P>
    <P>The ministerial session in November 2002 approved a draft protocol to the European Convention on the Suppression of Terrorism. Ireland welcomed this new mechanism which will help ensure that the response to terrorism balances effective protection of society with the safeguarding of human rights. The protocol will be opened for signature during the next ministerial session on 15 May 2003 and I hope that Ireland will be in a position to sign on that date.</P>
    <P>Ireland continues to support the reinforcement of co-operation between the Council of Europe and other organisations, in particular the European Union and the OSCE. In the CFSP context, Ireland, along with our EU partners, promotes full compliance with the obligations of Council of Europe membership by all member states and encourages all member states to continue to bring their institutions, legislation and practice fully in line with Council of Europe standards. Following the undertakings given by the new authorities to fulfil all their commitments to the council, including enhanced co-operation with the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia, Ireland welcomed the accession last week of Serbia and Montenegro as the Council's 45th member state. In this context, Ireland is making a sig<Col N="197" /> nificant bilateral contribution to Council of Europe assistance for the new state to prepare for ratification of the Convention on Human Rights.</P>
    <P>As we look ahead to medium-term issues I can confirm that Ireland supports the proposal for a third summit meeting to consolidate the future role of the Council of Europe, on condition that the summit is well prepared, with a guarantee that it will reinforce and not diminish that role.</P>

      <P>On 10 December 2002, the External Relations Council adopted Common Position 2002/960/CFSP concerning restrictive measures against Somalia. Under this common position, the supply or sale of arms and related material of all types, including weapons and ammunition, military vehicles and equipment, paramilitary equipment and spare parts, to Somalia by nationals of member states or from the territories of member states, shall be prohibited whether originating or not in their territories. The common position also prohibits the supply to Somalia of direct or indirect technical advice, financial and other assistance and training related to military activities, including technical training and assistance related to the provision, manufacture, maintenance or use of the items mentioned above by nationals of member states or from the territories of the member states.</P>
      <P>This common position reflects United Nations Security Council Resolutions 733 (1992), 1356 (2001) and 1425 (2002). The Deputy may be aware that the Security Council is currently considering a report of an expert panel on how to enhance the effectiveness of the arms embargo on Somalia. While a member of the Security Council, Ireland was very active in seeking to raise the UN profile in Somalia. We were to the fore in pressing for strengthening the arms embargo and Ireland actively pressed for the appointment of this panel to come up with concrete recommendations on improving enforcement of the embargo, as a means of helping create the conditions for peace and reconciliation in that country. We look forward to further deliberation of this issue by the Security Council.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>I <Col N="198" /> propose to take Questions Nos. 84 and 187 together.</P>
      <P>On 11 March 2003, I made a statement to the House concerning the situation in Afghanistan. Since then, the progress towards re-establishing a democratic civil government in Afghanistan has continued. This process commenced with the formation of the Afghan Interim Authority following the Bonn Agreement in December 2001. The interim authority was replaced by the Afghanistan Transitional Authority, ATA, chosen by an Emergency Loya Jirga on 22 June 2002, which also confirmed the appointment of Hamid Karzai as President of the ATA.</P>
      <P>The Afghanistan Transitional Authority will be replaced by an elected government in accordance with the provisions of the Bonn Agreement. These elections are due to take place in June 2004. The United Nations mission in Afghanistan, UNAMA, has already started to organise the electoral process and is co-ordinating the international assistance which has been offered.</P>
      <P>Since 17 December 2002, the important process of drafting a new constitution for Afghanistan has advanced. President Karzai is preparing a decree which details the main elements of the new constitution and provides for the establishment of a constitutional commission. Public consultations on the new constitution will then follow.</P>
      <P>Other encouraging developments include the reform of the national army, and the creation of a national police force. On 21 March 2003, President Karzai announced the establishment of the DDR programme. This provides for the disarmament, demobilisation and reintegration of irregular military forces into the national army and civil society in Afghanistan. Also on a positive note, on 10 February 2003, the leadership of the International Security Assistance Force, ISAF, with which Irish troops continue to serve in Kabul, was transferred smoothly from Turkey, to Germany and the Netherlands.</P>
      <P>Despite this progress, the human rights and security situation in Afghanistan continue to raise concerns. On 27 March 2003, a staff member of the International Committee of the Red Cross was murdered, one of a series of incidents which have been perpetrated over recent months, against the Afghan population and the international aid community. The poppy eradication programme has also met with opposition in the east of Afghanistan, and there have been reports of attacks on the offices of some international organisations there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Ireland is committed to the process of reconstruction in Afghanistan. Our ambassador in Tehran presented his credentials in Kabul on 5 March 2003. He held a series of meetings with the Afghan authorities, Irish NGOs in the field and international organisations, which have further contributed to our assessment of the ongoing needs of the Afghan people and to informing our overall approach. Ireland has provided over &euro;14.2 million in funding to Afghanistan since 2000 which, I am pleased to report, makes us one of <Col N="199" /> the leading international donors to Afghanistan, on a per capita basis.</P>
    <P>Together with our EU partners, Ireland remains committed to, and will continue to support, the reconstruction and rehabilitation of Afghanistan, to ensure that, with the help of the international community, it may emerge as a stable and peaceful democracy.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 85, 97 and 120 together.</P>
      <P>As part of the institutionalised political dialogue commitments which the European Union has with third countries and regional groups, a series of ministerial meetings with Latin American countries and groups took place in Athens on 27-28 March 2003. On 27 March, separate meetings took place with Mexico, Chile, the Andean Community and Mercosur; followed on 28 March by the 11th regular meeting between the EU and the Rio Group, attended by Foreign Ministers from the EU and all of Latin America.</P>
      <P>Mercosur &ndash; the Southern Cone Common Market &ndash; was founded by Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay and Uruguay in March 1991 with the ambitious goal of creating a customs union and ultimately a common market between the participating countries. Mercosur represents a market of 200 million people and a joint GDP of more than US $1 trillion, which places it among the four largest economic blocs of the world after NAFTA, the EU and Japan. In 1996, Mercosur signed association agreements with Chile and Bolivia establishing free trade areas with these countries, who have associate status. A free trade agreement is currently under negotiation with the Andean Community.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The European Union is Mercosur's main trade partner, source of direct investment and aid donor. At present, EU-Mercosur relations are based on the 1995 EU-Mercosur Inter-regional Framework Co-operation Agreement, the objective of which is to strengthen existing relations between the parties and to lay the groundwork <Col N="200" /> for the creation of an inter-regional association agreement. In June 1999, the EU and Mercosur announced the start of negotiations on such an agreement. The first round took place in November 1999. Progress has been relatively slow. The ninth round of negotiations took place from 17-21 March 2003 in Brussels and the next round is expected to take place in Asunción from 23-27 June 2003.</P>
    <P>The ministerial meeting between the EU and Mercosur, with Bolivia and Chile, on 27 March 2003 was held in the framework of the 1995 Framework Co-operation Agreement, which established the principles, the objectives and the mechanisms of political dialogue. The agenda included discussions on regional integration, EU-Mercosur negotiations for an association agreement, strengthening of EU-Mercosur political co-operation in international fora, and major international issues. The Mercosur side briefed the meeting on their efforts to step up their regional integration, in particular through the possible establishment of a regional parliament, consolidation of the customs union, and a strengthening of the social dimension of Mercosur.</P>
    <P>In view of the similar positions held by EU member states and Mercosur on important issues on the international agenda, it was decided to intensify efforts for the co-ordination of positions before the next UN General Assembly. Ministers also reaffirmed the central role of the United Nations for the peaceful resolution of conflicts. As regards the EU-Mercosur negotiations, both sides reiterated their common objective to make rapid progress and to conclude the negotiations as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>The permanent mechanism of political consultation and co-ordination, also known as the Rio Group, was created in 1986 in Rio de Janeiro. The early members of the group were Argentina, Bolivia, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Ecuador, Mexico, Panama, Paraguay, Peru, Uruguay and Venezuela, as well as a representative from CARICOM, the Caribbean Community. In June 2000, the Central American states of Costa Rica, the Dominican Republic, El Salvador, Honduras and Nicaragua joined the Rio Group. The major objectives of the group are to expand and systematise political co-operation between the participating states; to co-ordinate common positions on international issues; to present appropriate solutions to the problems and conflicts affecting the Latin American region; and to explore jointly new fields of co-operation which enhance economic, social, scientific and technological development.</P>
    <P>The Rome Declaration of 1990 formalised relations between the EU and the Rio Group and provided for annual meetings &ndash; traditionally held during the first Semester &ndash; between the Foreign Ministers of both sides, except in those years when an EU-Latin America-Caribbean Summit is taking place. EU Foreign Ministers and their Rio Group counterparts also meet <i>en marge</i> of the UN General Assembly in the autumn. At <Col N="201" /> the EU-Rio Group meeting on 28 March 2003, Ministers discussed relations between the two entities, major international issues and the question of social cohesion in an increasingly globalised world. The meeting welcomed the progress recently achieved in establishing closer relations between the two regions, including the implementation of the EU-Mexico Global Agreement and of the Interim EU-Chile Association Agreement, as well as the progress made to date in the EU-Mercosur negotiations. In addition, Ministers welcomed the recent adoption by the EU General Affairs and External Relations Council of two decisions authorising the Commission to open negotiations with Central America and the Andean community for the conclusion of political dialogue and co-operation agreements. They took note of the decision to hold the first round of negotiations in both cases in May 2003.</P>
    <P>With Irish support, the meeting emphasised the importance of developing programmes to improve social cohesion, a topic which is likely to feature prominently in advance of the third EU-Latin America &ndash; Caribbean summit, to be held in Mexico during the Irish EU Presidency in the first half of 2004.</P>

      <P>I refer the Deputy to my reply to a question of 5 March 2003 in which I informed the House that following the start of Ireland's participation in Partnership for Peace on 1 December 1999, the bilateral ambassador to Belgium was designated as head of a liaison mission between Ireland and NATO. This assignment was facilitated by the presentation document of Ireland for Partnership for Peace, approved by Dáil Éireann in November 1999, which provides for the appointment of representatives to the NATO headquarters in Brussels. The assignment of the bilateral Ambassador to Belgium to this role is in keeping with the practice of the other neutral and non-aligned participants in Partnership for Peace, namely Austria, Finland, Sweden and Switzerland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While the overwhelming majority of the ambassador's time is taken up with his bilateral accreditation to Belgium, he has, over the past twelve months, in his capacity as head of the liaison mission to NATO, continued to represent Ireland at ambassadorial level meetings of the Euro-Atlantic Partnership Council, the multilateral political framework for Partnership for Peace countries. As the senior official in Brussels dealing with Partnership for Peace and Euro-Atlantic Partnership Council issues, he oversees on an ongoing basis the work of the liaison mission, which comprises staff from the Departments of <Col N="202" /> Foreign Affairs and Defence, as well as from the Defence Forces.</P>

      <P>It is assumed that the Deputy is referring to recent ethnic clashes in the Ituri region of the Democratic Republic of Congo. There have been clashes between the Hema and Lendu tribes in this region of the DRC on many occasions in the past. The countries neighbouring the region in question, Uganda and Rwanda, have deployed troops within the DRC, justifying this with reference to their own security. As part of a comprehensive peace settlement, Rwanda has withdrawn its troops and Uganda is committed to completing its withdrawal by 24 April. The focus is now on finding a basis to resolve, or at least contain, the underlying ethnic divisions.</P>
      <P>On 3 April, MONUC, the United Nations mission to the DRC, discovered the remains of up to one thousand members of the Hema apparently victims of a tribal massacre. MONUC has initiated an investigation. Our development co-operation programme in Uganda is heavily focused on poverty reduction in all its dimensions. We maintain a critical dialogue with the Ugandan authorities on a wide range of issues, both internal to Uganda and relating to the wider Great Lakes region. Through this dialogue, and our development programme, we believe we are in a position to help influence positive change. Significant changes have already been made in Uganda in terms of poverty reduction, and we believe our programme has helped to foster this process. Against the background of the programme's strong poverty focus, and the critical dialogue which we maintain with the Ugandan authorities on all issues, including ethnic clashes in the DRC, a reduction of our aid to Uganda would not be warranted.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 90 and 129 together.</P>
      <P>Successive Governments have traditionally availed of the period around St Patrick's Day to capitalise on the goodwill and unparalleled opportunities generated by the celebrations to promote Ireland around the world, including in terms of highlighting Ireland as an attractive tourist destination. I carried out a full programme of events and meetings while I was in the San Francisco area. During the course of my engagements, I met with the Mayors of Oakland and San Francisco and with representatives of state agencies, including Tourism Ireland, the IDA and Enterprise Ireland during my engagements in Silicon Valley.</P>
      <P>I also had discussions on trade and investment issues with representatives of local business, and participated in a number of St Patrick's Day-related events, including speaking engagements at the Hibernian Newman lunch in San Francisco and the Parade Grand Marshal's dinner, which I used as additional opportunities to promote tourism to Ireland. I also met with members of the large Irish Community in San Francisco and San José, and availed of opportunities throughout my visit to update contacts in the US on developments in the peace process and to thank them for their on-going support.</P>

      <P>Resolution 1472, 2003, was adopted so as to facilitate the use of the existing resources and commitments of the oil for food programme for the humanitarian needs of the civilian population of Iraq. The Secretary General has been given the authority &ndash; in relation to existing contracts and resources &ndash; to decide priorities and modes of distribution. The Secretary General has also been given the authority to negotiate new contracts for essential medical supplies. I am confident that the Secretary General will fulfil these new responsibilities in a timely and professional way.

      <P>Ireland is a long-standing supporter of the right of the Saharawi people to self-determination. The Government played an active role in seeking a solution to the Western Sahara dispute during our recent term on the Security Council, including meeting with representatives of all sides. On 25 March, the United Nations Security Council adopted Resolution 1469, which extended the mandate of the UN Mission for the Referendum in Western Sahara, MINUESO, and requested the UN Secretary-General, Kofi Annan, to provide a report on the situation by 19 May. This resolution followed the presentation to the parties by the personal envoy of the Secretary General, Mr. James Baker, of a new proposal for a solution to the dispute. We have not been given sight of this new proposal and are not aware of the detail of its provisions. Our initial contacts with the parties indicate, however, that there are a number of issues which are of concern, particularly to POLISARIO, the representatives of the Saharawi people.</P>
      <P>The Government will continue to follow the situation closely. In general, we continue to consider the UN settlement plan, which provides for the holding of a referendum to determine the future status of Western Sahara, as a reasonable basis for a just political solution to the conflict. At the same time, we welcome political negotiations on possible alternative proposals for a solution, though these must embrace the consent of all parties to the conflict.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">

      <P>I refer the Deputy to the reply I gave to his colleague on 5 March 2003, ref 6443.03, which confirmed that the Irish ambassador to Israel received a response from the Israeli authorities on the matter in question dated 24 December 2002. The Israeli response states that, as the Irish citizen in question refused to speak to the Israeli authorities investigating the incident, they have not been able to verify the details set out in the note sent to the Israeli Ministry of Foreign Affairs from the Irish Embassy on 26 November 2002.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Specifically, the Israeli authorities say it has not been possible to ascertain the exact place or circumstances in which the individual concerned was wounded. The reply states that following an investigation by the Israeli Defence Forces, it was established that armed Palestinian elements were shooting at Israeli forces, from immediately <Col N="205" /> adjacent to the United Nations compound where the individual concerned was seen. The reply expresses regret for the injury caused to the individual in question and other innocent civilians, and asserts that Israeli military actions on the day in question were directed solely against terrorists.</P>
    <P>As I outlined in my previous reply of 5 March 2003, regrettably, the response of the Israeli authorities does not meet the concerns raised in our embassy's protest. As I said then, it is clearly a responsibility of the Israeli occupation forces not to use disproportionate or excessive force in response to perceived threats. Random, or even worse, targeted, shootings of civilians and international personnel are completely unacceptable. I shall continue to draw the attention of the Israeli authorities to their responsibilities in international law, particularly the Fourth Geneva Convention, and publicly condemn their excesses where merited.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government's view is that humanitarian actions should be based on the principles of humanitarian law and the need for impartiality and independence in the delivery of aid. Emergency relief can best be delivered when there is a clear separation between the roles of aid workers and military personnel. Humanitarian workers run the risk of becoming targets if there is confusion between the military and relief efforts.</P>
      <P>Concerns have been expressed by a number of humanitarian NGOs and other agencies in relation to recent chaotic scenes of food being thrown off the back of military trucks. I share these concerns. Distribution of food in this haphazard way is no substitute for the painstaking efforts of NGOs and UN agencies who determine those who are most in need and deliver assistance on that basis.</P>
      <P>In emergencies all over the world, NGOs, the United Nations and others, such as the Red Cross family, have clearly demonstrated that they are best equipped to provide the most effective assistance. We have only to look at their work in southern Africa, the Horn of Africa, East Timor and Afghanistan to see how effective they can be. I would hope that safe corridors for delivery of aid can be established as soon as possible. I would like to see NGOs, the UN and other internationally recognised humanitarian agencies take the lead in the delivery of essential items to those most in need.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 96 and 131 together.</P>
      <P>Preparation for the Irish Presidency of the EU started in late 2001 and is increasing in intensity as the Presidency approaches. It involves enhanced ministerial and interdepartmental co-ordination, contacts with previous and future presidencies and enhanced contacts at all levels with the EU institutions and with current and new member states.</P>
      <P>Two interdepartmental committees were established in 2001, chaired by the Department of Foreign Affairs, to co-ordinate the preparations for the Presidency. The interdepartmental committee for co-ordinating the Presidency deals with programming and policy related matters and the inter-departmental administrative planning group deals with logistical planning. Both groups report through the Department of Foreign Affairs to the interdepartmental co-ordinating committee on European Union affairs and to the Cabinet Sub-Committee on European Affairs. In addition, the Department of the Taoiseach chairs an interdepartmental Lisbon Group which will co-ordinate preparations for the Spring European Council.</P>
      <P>Preparation in a number of areas including the calendar of Council meetings and the compilation of the list of chairpersons and national delegates for committees and working groups is already well advanced. In addition a series of high level visits have been taking place, with the presidency as a principal focus, to current and future member states.</P>
      <P>The additional staff resources required for the Presidency are being put in place and the Centre for Management and Organisation Development, CMOD, at the Department of Finance is currently conducting a wide range of training courses to train staff at all levels for the presidency. Work is also well advanced on the development of a Presidency logo and website.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Work on the development of the presidency programme is taking place against the background of the decisions taken at the Seville European Council in June 2002 with regard to improving the functioning of the Council. In accordance with the Seville conclusions, a three year multi-annual strategic programme, drawn up by the six presidencies concerned, will be adopted by the European Council in December 2003. In the light <Col N="207" /> of this, an annual operating programme for 2004 drawn up jointly by the Irish and Netherlands' presidencies will be adopted by the General Affairs and External Relations Council in December 2003. The Irish Presidency programme for the first six months of next year should be seen in the context of these processes.</P>
    <P>Work in relation to Ireland's presidency priorities is ongoing. While the process is still at an early stage we can already anticipate a number of key issues that will feature on the Union's agenda in 2004. These include enlargement with the accession of the new member states on 1 May 2004, the ongoing accession negotiations with Bulgaria and Romania and the development of relations with Turkey; the conduct and possible conclusion of the Intergovernmental Conference on the Future of Europe, depending on decisions to be taken by the European Council in the light of the outcome of the Convention on the Future of Europe; progressing the Lisbon Agenda, which is aimed at advancing economic reform and competitiveness at the Spring European Council in March 2004 and the implementation of agreed commitments in the area of Freedom, Security and Justice by the treaty deadline of 1 May 2004.</P>
    <P>We can also anticipate a heavy agenda in the external relations area. In the light of the current international situation, transatlantic relations will be high on the agenda, as will international and regional issues such as Iraq, the Middle East, the Western Balkans, North Korea as well as ongoing crises in other parts of Asia and Africa. Relations with Russia and our other neighbours to the East will be intensified as the EU completes this enlargement, and relations with Latin America and the Caribbean will be high on our agenda in preparation for a EU-LAC summit in Mexico in May.</P>
    <P>Other issues will emerge in the coming months across the whole range of the EU agenda depending on the progress made during the preceding Greek and Italian presidencies and in the light of the conclusions of the European Councils which will take place later this year.</P>

      <P>These are not just principles that inform our foreign policy but are also in our national interest. As a small nation, our interests are best served by an international political and economic order that is governed by law. On this basis, I would disagree with the implication in the Deputy's question that there is a conflict between our principles and our interests. I and my colleagues in Government approach foreign policy issues in accordance with the principles and traditions that have always informed our approach, including assessing each issue on its merits. In doing so, we act in the best interests of, and with a view to protecting, the Irish people's economic and political well-being.

      <P>Since Ethiopia and Eritrea signed the Algiers Agreement in December 2000, considerable progress has been achieved in the peace process between the two countries. In April 2002, the Boundary Commission, established by the two parties, ruled on the delimitation of the border between Ethiopia and Eritrea. Both sides have expressed satisfaction with the decision of the commission and have undertaken to accept the decision as final and binding. The next stage of implementation of the Algiers Agreement will be the physical demarcation of the border, which is expected to begin shortly. We have reminded both parties that the ruling of the Boundary Commission is final and binding, and we have impressed upon them the need to co-operate fully with the Boundary Commission for the expeditious demarcation of the border.</P>
      <P>In addition to Ireland Aid's programme with Ethiopia, Ireland has contributed $50,000 in funding to the Boundary Commission. In July 2002, my Department contributed &euro;200,000 to quick impact projects organised by the United Nations peacekeeping force on the border between Ethiopia and Eritrea, UNMEE. There are over 200 Irish troops serving with UNMEE.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards the wider humanitarian situation, it is clear that if we are to break the cyclical nature of food insecurity in Ethiopia, the underlying structural problems affecting poverty and stability must be addressed. Ireland Aid continues to deliver long-term development support to Ethiopia, focusing in particular on poverty reduction. It is estimated that in 2003, such long-term sup<Col N="209" /> port for Ethiopia will exceed &euro;27 million. The Government receives regular updates on the situation in Ethiopia and stands prepared to deliver further appropriate assistance over the coming months.</P>

      <P>The situation in Lebanon is marked by economic uncertainty, including a serious fiscal deficit. On the other hand, the situation is politically relatively stable, with the main organs of the state functioning with reasonable efficiency. In South Lebanon, there is a degree of tension on the border with Israel due to the regional security situation. Israeli aircraft, for instance, make regular illegal over-flights through Lebanese airspace.</P>
      <P>Israel continues to occupy the area known as the Shabaa Farms in the Northern Golan. Lebanon claims that this territory is Lebanese, giving rise to continuing to tension.

Ireland accepts the determination of the United Nations.</P>

      <P>Agreements relevant to the Deputy's question that are within the remit of my Department would normally be made in conjunction with our EU partners. The European Union does not yet have any formal agreements with Iran. Co-operation with Iran has remained limited to efforts to combat illegal drugs trafficking and issues related to assistance with refugee flows. In addition, a working group on energy was established in May 1999. It has identified six major sectors for dialogue and potential co-operation. The group held its third meeting in Tehran in October 2002, and added energy-related transport issues to its agenda. However, negotiations are now under way between Iran and the EU on a number of other issues on which agreement is sought.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The European Union, at the General Affairs Council on 17 June 2002, agreed in principle to put its cooperation with Iran, particularly in the areas of trade and economic cooperation, on a contractual basis. The speed of progress in this area will depend on the pace and success of economic reforms in Iran and developments in the area of human rights. Negotiations on a trade and co-operation agreement between Iran and the <Col N="210" /> EU began on 12 December 2002. The agreement will be accompanied by parallel agreements on political dialogue and on co-operation in the fight against terrorism. As is customary, the trade and co-operation agreement itself will include provisions on respect for human rights. By consensus, EU partners accept that progress both of negotiations and subsequent implementation should be dependent on Iran's compliance with internationally accepted norms in relation to human rights, the fight against terrorism and the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. Ireland supports the idea of a trade and co-operation agreement. The EU considers it indispensable that the agreement and political dialogue proceed in parallel. The next round of negotiations on the agreement will take place this week.</P>
    <P>The General Affairs and External Relations Council, on 21 October 2002, decided to proceed with a human rights dialogue following a positive recommendation from an exploratory visit by experts at the beginning of that month. The first session of this dialogue took place on 16-17 November 2002, focusing on torture and discrimination, and another session followed on the 14-15 March. There are significant areas of disagreement between the European Union and Iran on this issue but discussions are continuing.</P>
    <P>A number of memoranda of understanding exist between Ireland and Iran. The memorandum on the establishment of an Ireland-Iran joint commission on economic, commercial and scientific and technical co-operation was signed in 1990 by the then Minister for Foreign Affairs, Gerard Collins MEP. Four meetings of the joint commission have taken place, the most recent was held in Dublin, 9-10 December 2002. At the conclusion of this meeting a memorandum of understanding was signed outlining areas of future co-operation. A memorandum on further training of Iranian doctors in Ireland was signed in 1993 by the then Minister for Health, Deputy Howlin. A memorandum of understanding on marine matters was signed by the then Minister for Marine, David Andrews in 1994.</P>
    <P>A memorandum of understanding between Ireland and Iran on English language training and third level education has been finalised but has not yet been signed. The Minister for the Education and Science, Deputy Dempsey, has been invited to Iran to sign the memorandum.</P>

      <P>The Government is of the view that threats to international peace and security should be dealt with through the United Nations, and in accordance with the charter of the United Nations.</P>
      <P>Article 2(4) of the United Nations Charter contains a general prohibition on the use of force: subject to two exceptions, both set out in chapter VII of the charter. These are self defence, Article 51, and collective enforcement action authorised by the Security Council in response to threats to or breaches of international peace and security or acts of aggression, Article 42.</P>
      <P>Article 51 of the charter recognises the right of states to take action in pursuit of individual or collective self-defence, if an armed attack occurs against a member of the United Nations. The charter requires states taking such action to notify the Security Council immediately.</P>
      <P>It is widely accepted that the right to self-defence encompasses an entitlement to take limited and proportionate action where necessary to counter the threat of imminent attack. In any case, it is clear from the charter that the right to act in self-defence is recognised only until such time as the Security Council has itself taken measures necessary to maintain or restore international peace and security.</P>

      <P>Policing in Northern Ireland has changed more in the past 18 months than in the previous 80 years, with the implementation of the Patten reforms and the establishment of the policing board in November 2001. The performance of the board &ndash; and that of the Police Ombudsman, Chief Constable Orde, the Oversight Commissioner and the Inspector of Constabulary &ndash; has demonstrated that this dynamic of change is reaching all areas of policing and is continuing apace.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In addition, a number of significant changes are being made to the Police (NI) Act 2000 by the new Police Bill which will be enacted shortly. This Bill gives legislative effect to the commitments entered into by the British Government at Weston Park in July 2001. It brings key sections of the 2000 Act into line with Patten by enhancing the powers of the policing board and the Ombudsman, as well as emphasising the importance of the core principle of policing with the community. It will also provide for secondments between the Garda Síochána and the PSNI, and it will act as a catalyst in the civilianisation pro<Col N="212" /> cess by making provision for giving police powers to police support staff. Along with these legislative changes, many significant changes are also being effected in police policies and practices.</P>
    <P>Taken together, these progressive steps &ndash; coming on top of the institution of a new police service in November 2001, with a new name, new badge and new flag &ndash; represent a very positive development in the nature of policing in Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>The question of Sinn Féin support for these new arrangements, including any decision by that party to join the policing board, is theirs alone to take. At the recent Sinn Féin Ard Fheis, the leadership indicated there could be &ldquo;a time when it would be appropriate for Sinn Féin to join the Policing Board, and participate fully in the policing arrangements&rdquo;. However, the party has yet to signal when this might happen.</P>
    <P>The Government's position is clear: we want a police service representative of all sections of the community, supported by all sections of the community, and being held accountable by the chosen representatives of all sections of the community. People have to decide in their own democratic way how to address issues, but it is clear that the time has come when the new Police Service &ndash; and its officers now being recruited on an equal basis as Patten intended &ndash; are entitled to the support and co-operation of the entire community.</P>
    <P>We look forward to seeing Sinn Féin taking their place on the policing board sooner rather than later. We believe that such a move will be facilitated by the continued implementation of the Patten reforms and through the delivery of all acts of completion necessary to bring about the full implementation of the Good Friday Agreement.</P>

      <P>As the Deputy is aware, the Taoiseach reported fully to the Dáil on 25 March 2003 on the outcome of the recent European Council in Brussels and I participated in the debate that followed. Most of the discussions in Brussels took place at the European Council itself and focused principally on the Lisbon strategy which is designed to enable the Union to become the most competitive and dynamic knowledge-based economy by 2010.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The European Council reaffirmed the commitment of the EU to the territorial integrity, the sovereignty, the political stability and the full and effective disarmament of Iraq in all its territory. It expressed its continued support for the UN system and for the UN Secretary Generals proposal to meet the humanitarian needs of the Iraqi <Col N="213" /> people through the &ldquo;Oil for Food&rdquo; programme and committed itself to active involvement in assisting with the humanitarian issue.</P>
    <P>The European Council gave particular attention to the continuing Israeli-Palestinian conflict and adopted conclusions on the matter. It reiterated its commitment to the vision of two states living side by side in peace and security on the basis of the 1967 borders. It welcomed the announcement by President Bush that he wishes to see the Quartet road map for a Palestinian state presented to the parties after the confirmation of the new Palestinian Prime Minister, Mr. Mahmoud Abbas. Israel's policy of illegal settlements in the West Bank and the Gaza Strip constitute a significant obstacle to peace. The Council emphasised this and called for a reversal of Israeli policy.</P>
    <P>Discussions also took place on the role the EU could play in achieving a comprehensive, multilateral solution to the current crisis concerning the DPRK. The European Council agreed in its conclusions to call on North Korea to abstain from any action which could aggravate the situation further, and to reaffirm that North Korea's non-compliance with its international obligations in the field of nuclear weapons is a serious concern for the whole of the international community, and is detrimental to its own interests. The conclusions reaffirm the Council's willingness to contribute to a diplomatic solution of the crisis. My EU colleagues and I will have further discussions on this matter at the GAERC on 14 April.</P>
    <P>The Council discussed the situation in the western Balkans following the tragic assassination on 12 March of the Prime Minister of Serbia, Zoran Djindjic. It welcomed the commitment of the new Prime Minister, Zoran Zivkovic, to press ahead with the reform process in Serbia and expressed the full support of the EU for the new political leadership in implementing the reforms required for the development of closer relations between Serbia and Montenegro and the EU. The Council asked High Representative Solana and Commissioner Patten to draw up concrete proposals for EU support for the reform process, and these will be considered at the next meeting of the General Affairs and External Relations Council on 14 April. The central role of the EU in promoting the development of stability, democracy and economic progress in the region will be reaffirmed at the forthcoming EU-Western Balkans Summit, in Thessaloniki on 21 June.</P>
    <P>The European Council also considered the question of Cyprus, in the light of the failure of UN-sponsored talks in the Hague on 11 March. It expressed the strong support of the EU for the continuation of the mission of good offices of UN Secretary General Kofi Annan and urged all parties to commit themselves to working for a just and viable comprehensive settlement. In particular, the Council called on the Turkish Cypriot leadership to reconsider its position. The Council reaffirmed the decision of the Copenhagen Euro<Col N="214" /> pean Council in December 2002 regarding the accession of Cyprus to the European Union. As a result, the Republic of Cyprus will sign the Treaty of Accession on 16 April. The application of the laws and regulations of the Union to the northern part of the island will be suspended.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>I refer to my replies to Questions No. 172 of 5 March and 242 of 25 March 2003.</P>
      <P>In recent reports, Amnesty International expressed its concern regarding the human rights in Serbia and Montenegro, focusing in particular on the unsatisfactory level of co-operation with the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia and continuing allegations of torture and ill-treatment by police. The authorities in Belgrade are aware of the Government's concern on both of these serious issues.</P>
      <P>Full co-operation with the tribunal in the Hague is an obligation on all states and parties in the western Balkans. The tribunal itself has stated clearly that, despite the transfer to the Hague of Slobodan Milosevic and a number of other prominent suspects, the level of co-operation by Serbia and Montenegro remains unsatisfactory, both in relation to the transfer of indicted persons and access to evidence. Improvement in the area of human rights is an essential element of the reform process required for the further development of relations with the EU. This includes full co-operation with the international tribunal. I welcome the commitments to improved co-operation given by the President of Serbia and Montenegro and Foreign Minister Goran Svilanovic in the context of the accession of Serbia and Montenegro to the Council of Europe on 3 April. I hope the renewed commitment by the Government of Serbia to the reform process and to the fight against organised crime in the wake of the tragic assassination of Prime Minister Djindjic will enable early progress in improving co-operation with the international tribunal, in the interests of the consolidation of democracy, stability and respect for human rights in Serbia and Montenegro.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The persistence of allegations of police torture and ill-treatment remains of concern. I recognise, that there has been some progress in recent months. Article 9 of the Constitutional Charter of the new state union of Serbia and Montenegro commits the authorities to ensuring the protection of human rights and minority rights. One of the first acts of the new federal parliament was the adoption of a charter on human rights and minorities. Membership of the Council of Europe imposes obligations on respect for human rights, <Col N="215" /> which the Government of Serbia and Montenegro has formally accepted.</P>
    <P>Following the assassination of Prime Minister Djindjic on 12 March, a state of emergency has been declared in Serbia. I welcome the determination of the new Serbian Government under Prime Minister Zivkovic, and of the federal authorities, to continue to pursue the reform process. They will have the full support of the EU. I look forward to the early stabilisation of the situation in Serbia and to the lifting of the state of emergency.</P>
    <P>The continued implementation of policing and judicial reforms will be essential for the ending of all torture and ill-treatment by police. The international community is assisting in a number of ways, including an OSCE programme of police training in Montenegro, southern Serbia and Belgrade. Ireland is also playing its part bilaterally, as the major donor for a three-year Council of Europe programme of human rights training for all judges and prosecutors in Serbia and Montenegro, and for lawyers and NGO experts. Ireland Aid has committed &euro;500,000 to the programme, which focuses on the development of expertise in international human rights law, in particular the European Convention on Human Rights and the application of its principles in Serbia and Montenegro.</P>

      <P>The European Union recognises Syria's important role in the Middle East peace process and the fact that a comprehensive peace settlement in the region must include a peace treaty between Syria and Israel. The European Union has many concerns about human rights in Syria. The European Union raises these concerns with the Syrian authorities in regular contacts.</P>
      <P>Relations between the European Union and Syria are based primarily on a co-operation agreement which was signed on 18 January 1977 and which entered into force on 1 November 1978.

The Barcelona Process links the European Union and the member states with 12 partners from the southern and eastern Mediterranean.

Negotiations for an association agreement with Syria started in 1997 but progress to date has been slow.

      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>From August 2002 there were clear indications that erratic rainfall would lead to a large shortfall in Ethiopias crop production and that the priority in terms of humanitarian relief would be food assistance. A joint Ethiopian Government-UN Appeal was issued on 7 December 2002, following a multi-agency needs assessment carried out in November. The appeal confirmed that more than 11.3 million people would require food assistance, while another 3 million would remain under close monitoring. In the coming months the affected population will need 1.45 million metric tonnes of food assistance plus US $75 million in assistance to implement non-food responses such as water, health, agriculture and capacity building activities.</P>
      <P>The Government has allocated &euro;3.7 million for emergency assistance in Ethiopia since the crisis emerged last year. This assistance is focused on the needs of the most vulnerable people with an emphasis on food, water and emergency health interventions.</P>
      <P>Funding has been allocated to the United Nations World Food Programme and UNICEF for food and other essential needs. Support has also been given to Irish non-governmental organisations for supplementary feeding and emergency health interventions for malnourished children.</P>
      <P>In addition, a critical gap exists in relation to seeds and tools for vulnerable farmers. Timely distribution of these items is essential to ensure that adequate crop planting is undertaken for the next harvest. Funding from Ireland Aid has been allocated to meet this gap.</P>
      <P>Co-ordination of the international relief response will be critical to ensure that all needs are adequately met. During his visit to Ethiopia in January last the Minister of State with responsibility for development co-operation and human rights, Deputy Tom Kitt, held discussions with Ethiopian Prime Minister Meles as well as key development actors such as the WFP, the EU Commission and the NGO community. Discussions were held on ways of effectively mobilising resources for the millions who will require food assistance in the coming months. On foot of the visit, the Minister of State Deputy Kitt wrote to his EU counterparts to call for a redoubling of efforts to tackle this crisis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If we are to break the cyclical nature of food <Col N="218" /> insecurity and conflict in Ethiopia, the underlying structural problems affecting poverty and stability must be addressed. Ireland Aid is delivering long-term development support to Ethiopia with an emphasis on poverty reduction through the provision of basic needs and capacity building support. Food security needs are addressed as part of this approach. In 2003 it is estimated that such long-term support for Ethiopia will exceed &euro;27 million.</P>
    <P>The Government receives regular updates on the situation in Ethiopia and stands prepared to deliver further appropriate assistance from Ireland Aid over the coming months. In addition, we will work with our donor partners to ensure maximum co-ordination and coherence in the international response to this crisis.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Niger delta region of Nigeria is the main source of oil production in Nigeria. Since oil was first discovered in the area in 1956 there has been a pattern of endemic social unrest between the various ethnic groups who live in the region, the Federal Government and the oil companies, exemplified most notably in the trial and execution of the human rights activist Ken Saro-Wiwa in 1995.</P>
      <P>The Amnesty report referred to by the Deputy raises some serious concerns regarding the repression of women protesters in the Delta region by the security forces in July and August 2002. While some of the protests had been resolved in a peaceful manner and without the use of force on the part of the authorities, as in the case of the protests at the Chevron Nigeria platform in Escravos in July 2002 , it is most regrettable that this has not always been the case and I welcome the Amnesty report in highlighting these important concerns.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy may be aware there is currently a serious conflict ongoing in the Warri area of the Delta region between two ethnic groups. This conflict has resulted in the shutting down of production at major oil refineries and production platforms in the region.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Ireland Aid has been active in funding many projects in the Delta region over the past eight years. Funding totalling over &euro;1 million has been provided for water and sanitation, primary health care, basic education and rural development projects. Many of these projects have been made possible only by the long standing presence in the Delta region of Irish missionaries and aid workers who have been closely involved in development work, in conflict resolution between the different <Col N="219" /> ethnic groups and in mediating between the local people and the oil companies.</P>
    <P>The problems in the Delta region are complex and deep rooted but repression of people' s rights is never a solution. The Government hopes that the Nigerian authorities will deal with future protests in a restrained and appropriate manner. My Department, through our Embassy in Nigeria, will continue to closely monitor developments in the Delta region.</P>

      <P>The Government takes seriously the issue of respect for the human rights of Falun Dafa practitioners. Both the Taoiseach and I have raised this issue on a number of occasions with the Chinese Government, and we will continue to use such bilateral contacts to further the cause of human rights in China.</P>
      <P>I discussed this matter with my EU colleagues at the meeting of the General Affairs and External Relations Council in March 2003. We agreed that at the current session of the UN Commission on Human Rights, the EU would convey its deep concern over the violations of human rights in China, and at the lack of progress in a number of areas. In our conclusions, we agreed that the Union will urge China to take clear steps to improve the situation generally, and more specifically with regard to respect for the freedoms of expression, religion and belief, which have a particular impact on practitioners of Falun Dafa.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy will be aware, the EU discusses these key human rights concerns with China within the framework of the EU-China Human Rights Dialogue. The most recent session of the dialogue took place in Athens on 5 and 6 March this year, and discussions were particularly frank and open, facilitating a substantial exchange of views. The EU continues to evaluate the results of the human rights dialogue at regular intervals to determine how far its expectations have been met, and how improvements could be made.</P>
      <P>It is a welcome development that a visit to China by Mr. Sergio Vieira de Mello, the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, has been scheduled for later this year. I also welcome China's announcement of its intention to issue as soon as possible, an unconditional, formal invitation to the UN Special Rapporteur on freedom of religion or belief, Mr. Abdelfattah Amor to visit the country.</P>

      <P>Following on from the discussion at the External Relations Council, on 18 February 2003 the EU extended for a further 12 months the sanctions it had imposed on Zimbabwe. The sanctions include an embargo on the sale or supply to Zimbabwe of arms or equipment which could be used for internal repression; a freezing of funds or assets belonging to listed individuals; and a ban on travel to, or transit through, the EU by these individuals.</P>
      <P>The targeted sanctions are aimed solely at those whom the EU judges to be responsible for the violations of human rights in Zimbabwe, and are designed not to adversely affect the ordinary people of Zimbabwe.</P>
      <P>The sanctions are a clear display of the EU's concern at the serious situation in Zimbabwe. Sanctions are having an impact. They are restricting the regimes freedom to operate at an international level, freezing bank accounts held in EU financial institutions and banning the sale of arms or instruments of repression. I consider that sanctions have been effective in highlighting our opposition to the regimes policies and serve as a means of increasing pressure on the government of Zimbabwe.</P>
      <P>The EU is consistently vocal in its opposition to human rights abuses in Zimbabwe. On 28 March, the EU issued a declaration condemning the violence and repression against the opposition following the two days of national strikes called by the opposition on 18 and 19 March. The EU is particularly concerned about the high level of arbitrary arrests.</P>

      <P>The Treaty of Nice provides for the extension of enhanced co-operation to the Common Foreign and Security Policy when implementing common positions or joint actions which have already been agreed by unanimity. Under this provision, a group of member states can take forward implementation of a joint action or common position using the enhanced co-operation arrangements provided for in the treaty if a decision to do so is taken in Council by qualified majority vote. The treaty, as amended at Nice, also provides for an &ldquo;emergency brake&rdquo; where a member state feels its vital national interest is at issue. To date, these provisions have not been used.</P>
      <P>Security and defence matters were specifically excluded from the scope of enhanced co-operation under the Amsterdam treaty and this position was carried over into the Treaty of Nice.</P>
      <P>I am aware of recent joint proposals in this area put forward by Germany and France in the context of discussions under way in the Convention on the Future of Europe. While we are prepared to listen to the views of these and other EU partners on this matter, the Government considers that the parameters of any proposed provision for enhanced co-operation in this area would need to be very carefully considered. I would note once again that the EU already has the potential to achieve much under existing arrangements, including through constructive abstention.</P>
      <P>Following approval of the constitutional amendment put forward by the Government, Ireland may not participate in an EU Common Defence without further amendment of the Constitution approved by the people in a referendum.</P>

      <P>In September 2000, at the UN Millennium Summit in New York, Heads of State and Government adopted eight over-arching millennium development goals to be achieved by 2015. The millennium development goals focus on fundamental development issues such as poverty eradication, health, education, maternal mortality, HIV-AIDS and international partnership. The overarching goal is to reduce by half the number of people, currently 1.2 billion, living in extreme poverty, less than $1 per day, by 2015.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The International Conference on Financing for Development held in Monterrey, Mexico in April 2002 focused on mobilising funding in support of <Col N="222" /> the millennium development goals. The outcome of the conference, the Monterrey Consensus, deals with all aspects of development finance including the mobilisation of domestic resources, trade, investment, overseas development assistance and debt. At the conference the EU announced that it would increase average EU ODA from 0.33% of EU GNP to 0.39% of EU GNP by 2006. EU member states also announced that each member state would devote a minimum of 0.33% of GNP to ODA by 2006. The EU Commission is, at present, carrying out an analysis of how EU member states intend to deliver on the Monterrey commitment. Ireland's ODA, 0.41% of GNP in 2002, is already above the EU target announced at Monterrey.</P>
    <P>The World Summit on Sustainable Development in Johannesburg in September 2002 focused on the achievement of the MDGs through sustainable development with particular reference to water, energy, health, agriculture and biodiversity. Johannesburg put the promotion of poverty eradication through sustainable development at the heart of its work and was the first major summit to treat all aspects of sustainable development &ndash; economic, social and environmental &ndash; in a coherent and integrated way. Johannesburg confirmed the millennium development goals and agreed a number of additional commitments, including the goal of universal access to sanitation by 2015.</P>
    <P>Within the EU, the Council has initiated work on the implementation of the Johannesburg Programme of Action in the member states. The Johannesburg commitments in areas such as water, sanitation, energy, chemicals, forests and biodiversity are being integrated into EU strategies and work-programmes under the overall direction of the European Council.</P>
    <P>In 2005 the UN Secretary General will present the first comprehensive global report on progress towards the MDGs since their adoption at the summit in 2000. This report, which will be prepared in collaboration with the World Bank, the IMF and the WTO, will give the international community a clear picture of how the commitments made at the summit, and at the succeeding conferences, have contributed to eradicating poverty. The discussion by the UN General Assembly of this report will provide the international community with an opportunity to take stock of progress towards the achievement of the millennium development goals and the extent to which UN member states have lived up to the commitments that were made at the UN Millennium Summit and the succeeding conferences.</P>

      <P>While estimates of the scale of the humanitarian crisis in Iraq cannot easily be made as the situation changes daily, it is clear that millions of innocent civilians are threatened by conflict, hunger and disease.</P>
      <P>On 25 March, the Minister of State, Deputy Tom Kitt, announced that the sum of &euro;5 million will be set aside to support the work of non-governmental agencies and international agencies as they respond to the unfolding crisis. We are quite clear however, that this will mean no diminution in funding for humanitarian emergencies in other parts of the world, especially the food security crisis in Africa. During a visit to Ethiopia last January, the Minister of State, Deputy Kitt, made clear our view that the looming conflict in Iraq should not lead to any reduction in the international efforts being made to address the food crisis in the Horn of Africa and southern Africa. He called, for a redoubling of efforts to combat the emergency created by the current shortages in many parts of Africa.</P>
      <P>The Government is working closely with its partners in the EU and the UN to ensure that the needs of the most vulnerable in Africa continue to be met. The Minister of State, Deputy Kitt has given priority attention to the crisis in the Horn of Africa and southern Africa. He has visited each of the regions and has met key figures, including representatives of the Governments concerned, the EU Commissioner with responsibility for development, the deputy executive director of the UN World Food Programme and the Secretary General of the International Federation of the Red Cross.</P>
      <P>The key focus of the Governments official development assistance programme will continue to be on Africa. Ireland Aid is expected to deliver more than &euro;140 million to Africa in 2003 in long-term development assistance. In addition, we are contributing very significant sums to a wide range of NGOs and other agencies involved in development activities on the continent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Ireland Aid's emergency humanitarian budget, which currently stands at &euro;23 million, is designed to be flexible. It is not allocated to any particular region or emergency in advance, but is available <Col N="224" /> to save lives and livelihoods wherever there is greatest need.</P>
    <P>Working with the full resources at its disposal, the Government will continue to deliver assistance for humanitarian and longer-term needs in Africa over the coming months. In addition, we will work with our aid partners to ensure maximum co-ordination and coherence in the international response to Africa's food security crisis.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>Mine clearance activities on the part of the European Union are directly related to the goals set by the international community in the context of the Convention on the Prohibition of the Use, Stockpiling, Production and Transfer of Anti-Personnel Mines and on their Destruction (Ottawa Convention) of 1999.</P>
      <P>In July 2001 the Council and the European Parliament adopted two regulations on action against anti-personnel landmines, the first one covering developing countries and the second one covering other countries. The regulations require the Commission to submit an overall assessment of all Community mine actions, together with suggestions for the future of the regulations, to the European Parliament and the Council every three years. The first report is expected in the second half of 2004.</P>
      <P>The regulations also request the Commission to prepare an anti-personnel landmines multi-annual strategy. In December 2002 the Commission adopted the EU Mine Action Strategy for 2002-04 and detailed multi-annual indicative programming which will mobilise approximately &euro;105 million over the period 2002-04 to support mine action activities and the economic and social rehabilitation of the de-mined regions and the resettled populations. In formulating this strategy the Commission consulted EU member states in various Council fora.</P>
      <P>The Commission has also established a mine action co-ordination group which produces an annual report on mine actions by the European Commission and EU member states. The report which is normally issued prior to the annual meeting of states parties to the Ottawa Convention gives information on assistance by EU members states to mine affected countries. The fourth edition of the report is currently in preparation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In 2000 Ireland Aid donated &euro;1,809,536 towards mine clearance, assistance and rehabilitation in Cambodia, Kosovo, Angola, Somalia, Sudan and Afghanistan. In 2001 Ireland Aid donated &euro;1,438,653 towards mine clearance assistance and rehabilitation in Angola, Cambodia, Afghanistan, and Vietnam. In 2002 it <Col N="225" /> donated &euro;1,416,500 towards mine clearance assistance and rehabilitation in Afghanistan, Angola and Eritrea. In 2003 Ireland Aid entered into a strategic relationship with Ireland's largest demining partner, Halo Trust. An annual block grant of &euro;1 million has been allocated to the organisation for its activities in four countries: Afghanistan, Angola, Eritrea and Somalia.</P>

      <P>The Good Friday Agreement provided that consideration be given to the establishment of an independent consultative forum appointed by the two administrations, North and South, and representative of civil society on the island.</P>
      <P>At the fourth plenary meeting of the North-South Ministerial Council, which took place in Armagh on 28 June 2002, an outline structure for the Forum was agreed by the Council, which involved a twice yearly conference, alternating between North and South and comprising representatives of civil society on the island. The planning and organisation of the first conference would be undertaken by a steering committee drawn from the Northern Ireland Civic Forum and the social partners in the South. The steering committee would also invite representatives from a range of relevant organisations, North and South, to participate in the conferences.</P>
      <P>Some progress had been made on implementing this Council decision prior to the suspension of the Northern Ireland Assembly on 15 October 2002. However, with suspension, further progress was not possible.</P>
      <P>In the context of our continuing efforts to secure the early restoration of the Institutions, I hope it will also be possible to resume work on the establishment of the consultative forum at an early date.</P>
      <P>The valuable contribution of the social partners to North-South partnership through a range of agreed actions and objectives is recognised by the Government.

      <P>On 19 March the Taoiseach wrote to the UN Secretary-General to reiterate the concern felt in Ireland for the humanitarian situation of the people of Iraq, to express the Government's strong hope that the Security Council would continue to give the fullest weight to humanitarian considerations in its ongoing deliberations and discussions concerning Iraq and, in that regard, to suggest that the members of the Security Council receive regular and frequent humanitarian briefings from the Secretary General and his colleagues. The Taoiseach wrote on the same day to the President of the Security Council in similar terms.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will be aware that the UN Secretary-General needs no mandate from the Security Council to provide humanitarian relief. The relevant UN subsidiary agencies such as the Food and Agricultural Organisation and the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) can act on their own responsibility, according as the security situation permits, and the Government has provided funds to help them and proven non-governmental organisations in doing so.</P>
      <P>Since 1997, the UN's Office of the Iraq Programme has administered &ldquo;on the ground in Iraq&rdquo; the Oil For Food Programme which was established by Security Council Resolution 986, 1995. Following the recent commencement of large-scale military action in Iraq, the Secretary General suspended operation of the programme in Iraq.</P>
      <P>The Oil for Food Programme has been set on a new footing with the adoption of Resolution 1472 on 28 March. Secretary General Annan has been given the necessary authority to run the programme for an initial 45 day period. He has been authorised <i>inter alia</i> to prioritise the delivery of contracts already in the pipeline to accelerate the meeting of urgent humanitarian needs. He is also permitted to conclude new contracts &ldquo;drawing on appropriate available monies&rdquo; in the medical sector. This authorisation by the Security Council was critically important given the inevitable suspension of the programme at the start of the military engagement and the enormous humanitarian needs of the Iraqi people. Its passage was not a simple accomplishment given the varying and strongly held concerns of the various Security Council members. It therefore demonstrates a new unity of purpose in the Security Council, which the Government has welcomed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Taoiseach spoke personally to Secretary General Annan on Monday to ascertain his priorities for humanitarian relief and post-war reconstruction in Iraq. The Taoiseach told the <Col N="227" /> Secretary General that the Government regarded a central role for the United Nations as a matter of crucial importance. He also raised the issues directly with President Bush and the Prime Minister Mr. Blair at Hillsborough yesterday.</P>

      <P>The four Geneva Conventions allow for each party to an international armed conflict to designate a third, neutral, State as a Protecting Power. A Protecting Power is a State which safeguards the interests of one party in its relations with the other party to a conflict. As such, a Protecting Power has an obligation to ensure that the belligerents fulfil their humanitarian obligations. If a Protecting Power has not been appointed the parties to a conflict may agree to entrust to a humanitarian organisation, which offers every degree of impartiality and efficiency, the humanitarian duties incumbent on the Protecting Powers by virtue of the conventions.</P>
      <P>I understand the provisions in the Geneva Conventions for the appointment of Protecting Powers have been exercised only very rarely and that the accepted practice in situations of conflict is for the International Committee of the Red Cross to fulfil the humanitarian functions of a Protecting Power.</P>
      <P>In the case of the conflict in Iraq the appointment of Protecting Powers would be a matter for the parties to that conflict. In any event the International Committee of the Red Cross is actively undertaking its protection functions in the conflict in Iraq.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>ASEM, the Asia-Europe Meeting, consists of the 15 EU member states, the European Commission, and ten Asian countries: Brunei, China, Indonesia, Japan, Korea, Malaysia, The Philippines, Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>ASEM began as a Singaporean initiative, in Bangkok in April 1996, with a summit of Heads of State and Government, to develop productive co-operation through economic, political, cultural and people-to-people contact between its European and Asian members. The Asian ASEM countries are the EU's second largest trading <Col N="228" /> partners. More than 2 billion people live in the ASEM countries. Together, they account for more than half of worldwide production.</P>
    <P>While there are institutionalised bilateral relations between the EU and several of the Asian states, the informal and all-encompassing nature of the ASEM process has contributed to strengthening existing relations.</P>
    <P>ASEM Ministers for Foreign Affairs, for Finance and for Economic Affairs meet once a year to prepare for summits, and to develop the ASEM process. Summits involving Heads of State or Government take place every two years &ndash; the last being at Copenhagen in September 2002, at which Ireland was represented by the Taoiseach. I will represent Ireland at the next Foreign Minister's meeting to be held in Indonesia later this year. An ASEM Foreign Ministers meeting is expected to take place during Ireland's Presidency of the EU, and the fifth Heads of State and Government summit will be held at Hanoi, Vietnam, in late 2004.</P>
    <P>Since 1996, more than 40 initiatives have followed, in areas ranging from money laundering to illegal migration, trafficking in people, child welfare, human rights, environmental protection, educational exchanges, lifelong learning and international co-operation. In the medium to long-term, participants in ASEM hope to see further developments in initiatives already undertaken, and the development of initiatives. The European side is keen to ensure that political dialogue receives full attention.</P>
    <P>Against this background, recent meetings of Foreign Ministers and recent summits have demonstrated encouraging progress in the political dialogue, with declarations issued, for example, on the Middle East peace process, the situation between India and Pakistan, the Korean peninsula, and terrorism.</P>
    <P>The primary issue of concern for ASEM in the immediate future is its enlargement. On the Asian side, Burma, Cambodia and Laos wish to become members; the new member states of the European Union will also wish to participate, as their membership of ASEM is not automatically based on their membership of the EU. The EU has concerns about membership for Burma, which reflect disquiet at the refusal by the regime there to move towards democratisation. At the same time, however, the EU is worried that any attempt to block Burma's accession might lead to a counter move by Asian partners to block the accession of new EU member states. There is also a worry that an ASEM consisting of almost forty participants may become too cumbersome. These matters will be considered further with our European partners in the period ahead.</P>
    <P>Ireland remains fully committed to ASEM, and will continue to engage in a constructive and comprehensive way with partners, and in the various initiatives which have developed as a result of this process.</P>

    <P>The Irish Aviation Authority provides air traffic control and communications services to aircraft which pass through Irish controlled airspace, en-route, and aircraft landing and taking off from Irish airports, terminal. The Irish Aviation Authority controls some 100,000 sq miles of international airspace in addition to domestic airspace.</P>
    <P>Ireland exempts military flights from payment of the en-route and communications charges. Because of this arrangement the IAA costs in relation to military flights are met from the Department of Transport's vote.</P>
    <P>In relation to the terminal charge for air traffic control services for military aircraft, this is a matter for the Irish Aviation Authority.</P>
    <P>I am advised that the amount, not including VAT, paid to the IAA in the year 2002 in relation to all exempted flights other than flights under visual flight rules was &euro;1,642,541. While it is not possible to provide an exact breakdown of this total between military and other exempt flights, it is estimated that the latter comprises a very small proportion of the total payment. It should be noted that the amount for 2002 includes the reimbursement of the en-route and communications charge to the IAA for all military flights in Irish controlled airspace as distinct from Irish sovereign airspace. No further breakdown of this figure is available to the Department of Transport. No <Col N="230" /> payments have been made to the Irish Aviation Authority to date in 2003.</P>

      <P>The United Nations Charter provides that all members shall refrain in their international relations from the threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of any state, or in any other manner inconsistent with the purposes of the United Nations.</P>
      <P>The charter also provides that nothing contained in the charter shall authorise the United Nations to intervene in matters which are essentially within the domestic jurisdiction of any state but that this principle shall not prejudice the application of enforcement measures under Chapter VII of the charter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="231" />Chapter VII confers on the Security Council authority to take action, including action by air, sea or land forces, with respect to threats to the peace, breaches of the peace and acts of aggression. These provisions were drawn up at the conclusion of the Second World War which had been caused precisely by acts of aggression on the part of a number of criminal regimes. In large measure, these provisions were enacted so as to equip the international community, acting collectively, to prevent a repetition of the actions that had resulted in world war. While regime change is not addressed in this connection, the power of the Security Council is unprecedentedly wide, in that it can &ldquo;take such action . . .  as may be necessary to maintain or restore international peace and security&rdquo;, consistent with the charter.</P>
    <P>The General Assembly of the United Nations sought, over a period of many years, to bring about the fall of the apartheid regime to in South Africa. However, the Security Council never called for regime change there. In fact, there are no resolutions of the Council which explicitly call for regime change in particular countries.</P>
    <P>The charter also recognises the right to individual or collective self-defence, if an armed attack occurs against a member of the United Nations.</P>

      <P>Ireland is firmly committed to the purposes and principles of the UN Charter, which include promoting and encouraging respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms for all without distinction. Human rights concerns play a central role in our foreign policy and are recognised as such in An Agreed Programme for Government. In this context, we attach great importance to the Commission on Human Rights, which is the primary forum within the United Nations for the discussion of human rights matters. Ireland became a member of the Commission on Human Rights for a three year period beginning on 1 January last. Ireland was to the fore in promoting a human rights agenda during our membership of the Security Council. The Government is committed to ensuring that Ireland will also play an active and constructive role in the Commission on Human Rights with the aim of ensuring that human rights are effectively promoted and protected at the international level.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On Thursday 27 March I addressed the 59th session of the UN Commission on Human Rights. In my statement, I focused on a number of key issues: the need to advance a more people-<Col N="232" /> centred approach involving, the promotion of human rights, the advancement of human safety, and the protection of human lives; the special responsibilities that membership of the Commission carries; the need for member states to have a strong domestic human rights commitment as exemplified in Ireland's case by the establishment of the Irish Human Rights Commission; the need for the belligerents in Iraq to respect international human rights and humanitarian law; the need for the international community to address racism and the efforts Ireland has undertaken to tackle this issue; Ireland's support for the Office of the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights and for overseas development assistance; and the Northern Ireland peace process.</P>

      <P>Ireland currently maintains bilateral aid agreements with the following six countries in Africa, known as programme countries: Tanzania; Lesotho; Zambia; Ethiopia; Uganda; Mozambique.</P>
      <P>The report of the Ireland Aid review committee in 2002 whose recommendations the Government has accepted, proposed that at least one and possibly two new programme countries might be selected from the least developed countries in that region, sub-Saharan Africa, whose needs are acute and which could be expected to respond well to an Ireland Aid engagement building on the experience gained from existing bilateral programmes.</P>
      <P>While the report did not recommend the addition of any programme countries in West Africa, it suggested that Sierra Leone and other countries, emerging from years of civil war which have devastated their economic and social infrastructures, might be given support in the humanitarian field. Acknowledging that longer term development co-operation programmes were not feasible in current circumstances, the report recommended continued involvement in the provision of emergency humanitarian assistance to such countries, often carried out through Irish NGOs. It also stated that if and when progress is made towards the resolution of these conflicts, there would be scope for Ireland Aid to assist with the rehabilitation and reconstruction of these countries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Ireland Aid has had a development engagement with Sierra Leone since 1997. Over the past three years a total of &euro;3.28 million has been provided in humanitarian assistance to Sierra Leone through international agencies and Irish NGOs. In 2003, &euro;500,000 was given to the International <Col N="233" /> Organisation for Migration towards the provision of community based assistance for resettled internally displaced persons. In addition, &euro;174,000 was allocated to the NGO, Tearfund, to help fund the provision of clean water, community health education and agricultural equipment to almost 9,000 civilian returnees.</P>
    <P>In January, and again very recently, my officials had discussions with the Sierra Leone High Commissioner to Britain, who raised the question of future Ireland Aid assistance to his country. My officials indicated, with particular reference to the progress made since the elections in May 2002, that Ireland Aid would be happy to build on the support provided to date and would look at the possibility of providing additional assistance for a national recovery programme.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>At the time of its dissolution in 1991, the Soviet Union consisted of 15 Soviet Republics. The largest of these was the Russian Federal Soviet Socialist Republic, now the Russian Federation. The other Republics which became independent are Lithuania, Latvia, Estonia, Belarus, Ukraine, Moldova, Georgia, Azerbaijan, Armenia. Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, Turkmenistan, Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan are in Central Asia.</P>
      <P>During the Soviet period, military, political and economic priorities for the Republics were set within the centrally planned Communist system; local development needs were assessed in Moscow, and local government was very limited in scope.</P>
      <P>For this reason, when the Soviet system collapsed, the norms of economic, political and social development which we associate with democratic statehood and free market economies were absent. Standards which we take for granted &ndash; a functioning court system, an independent judiciary and respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms &ndash; were fragile or absent. Many of the former Soviet Republics faced the future in 1991 ill-prepared for the challenge of democratic change.</P>
      <P>Progress since 1991 has been very uneven. Latvia, Lithuania and Estonia have made outstanding progress. Last year they concluded accession negotiations, and I look forward to welcoming them as EU member states under the Irish Presidency next year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The challenges that faced Russia, the largest and most powerful of the Soviet Republics, were unique. Since 1991, Russia has made significant progress, moving towards the norms of representative democracy, and transforming its identity <Col N="234" /> and the nature of its influence on world affairs. As for the Caucasus, frozen conflicts and ethnic rivalries have made progress difficult; while in Central Asia, especially serious problems of respect for human rights and democratic governance remain to be solved. Through the activities of the Council of Europe and the OSCE, democratisation, respect for human rights and the rule of law are actively being promoted.</P>
    <P>With the collapse of the former Soviet Union, the European Union decided to support the transition process towards market economies and democratic societies in the countries of Eastern Europe and Central Asia. Since the beginning of the nineties, the EU has developed a much more formal and political relationship with these countries. Partnership and co-operation agreements have been concluded with most of these countries. The EUs co-operation objectives are to build relationships with these countries in which the respect of democratic principles, the rule of law and human rights, as well as the consolidation of a market economy are fostered and supported.</P>
    <P>The economic performance of the states of the former Soviet Union has generally improved in recent years. Economic growth rates in 2002 have in general slowed compared to 2001, but the slowdown has been less severe than in other parts of the world. Growth in 2003 is expected to be broadly similar to that of 2002.</P>
    <P>However, the countries of the former Soviet Union are at quite different stages in terms of economic development. The Baltic countries embraced structural change relatively quickly while others are still at the beginning of the transition process. This is reflected in economic growth rates with states such as Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania experiencing gross domestic product growth rates in excess of 5% in 2002. On the other hand Belarus, Kyrgyzstan, Uzbekistan and Georgia experienced growth of under 5% last year.</P>
    <P>Some of the former Soviet Union states such as Armenia, Azerbaijan, Georgia, Kyrgyzstan, Moldova, Tajikistan and Uzbekistan have faced particularly difficult transitions as a result of their land-locked locations, distance from developed economies and modest natural resource endowments. Further structural reforms are likely to be necessary to put these countries on the path to sustainable economic growth.</P>
    <P>Apart from Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania, no former Soviet Republic has formally sought membership of the EU. Article 49 of the Treaty on European Union stipulates that any European State may apply to become a member of the European Union. Before any application could be considered, a country has to meet the criteria set out at the Copenhagen European Council in 1993. These criteria state that &ldquo;Membership requires that the candidate country has achieved stability of institutions guaranteeing democracy, the rule of law, human rights and respect for and protection of minorities, the existence of a functioning market economy as well as the capacity to <Col N="235" /> cope with competitive pressure and market forces within the Union. Membership presupposes the candidate's ability to take on the obligations of membership including adherence to the aims of political, economic and monetary union&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>On 11 March this year, the European Commission published a working paper, proposing broad guidelines for future policy towards our neighbours to the east and in the southern Mediterranean. This &ldquo;Wider Europe/New Neighbourhood&rdquo; initiative aims to strengthen the EU's bilateral relations with its neighbours, including, <i>inter alia,</i> Ukraine, Belarus and Moldova, with the intention of developing a &ldquo;ring of friends&rdquo;, with which the EU can enjoy close, peaceful and co-operative relations. In return for concrete progress demonstrating shared values and the effective implementation of political, institutional reforms, the new neighbours could potentially benefit from closer economic integration with the EU.</P>
    <P>The last 12 years have seen enormous transformations in Central and Eastern Europe; the political and economic context is significantly different to what it was during our last Presidency in 1996. I am confident that in our Presidency next year, we will succeed in developing our relations with our new neighbours to the benefit of all our peoples.</P>

      <P>Amnesty International and other human rights organisations have long expressed serious concern about widespread human rights abuses in Mexico, including &ldquo;disappearances&rdquo;, killings, torture by police, arbitrary detentions, death threats and ill-treatment by prison and military authorities.</P>
      <P>The latest Amnesty International report, published on 25 March 2003, focuses on the question of unsafe convictions resulting from serious violations of the right to due process, and points out that when these violations occur the criminal justice system appears incapable of providing remedies for its own defects, permitting virtually complete impunity for those in official positions responsible for abuse of due process, corruption and torture.</P>
      <P>President Vicente Fox has fully acknowledged Mexico's human rights deficiencies and attaches a high priority to correcting them. On taking office he appointed the founder of Mexico's first ever human rights NGO, Ms Mariclaire Acosta, as Vice Minister for Human Rights and Democracy. As the recent Amnesty reports points out, the President also established human rights units in the Ministry of the Interior and in the Office of the Public Prosecutor.</P>
      <P>These decisions led to the publication in August 2002 of the Government's first major report on human rights: &ldquo;Advances and Challenges for the Federal Government in relation to Human Rights Matters&rdquo;. The Mexican Government has adopted an open and productive relationship on human rights matters with representatives of civil society and NGOs.</P>
      <P>This open and constructive attitude also applies to Mexico's dialogue on human rights with the European Union and the United Nations. An office of the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights is being established in Mexico City to support the Government and civil society in their efforts to implement effective programmes to protect human rights.</P>
      <P>President Fox's administration acknowledges that it faces a formidable task in seeking to reform a deeply entrenched culture of disregard for human rights within the criminal justice system, but has expressed its clear determination to try to ensure over time that the new initiatives it is taking, in conjunction with its international partners, will bring real change throughout the system.</P>
      <P>I have little doubt, for example, that the Mexican Government will listen carefully to the recommendation in Amnesty's latest report for the reopening of all cases where there are reasonable grounds for believing that persons were convicted on the basis of coerced confessions, and that adequate measures be taken to ensure that judicial remedies are available where it is established that such abuses have occurred.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Ireland expects that all states will uphold their obligations under international human rights instruments to which they are party including the <Col N="238" /> Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and the UN Convention Against Torture.</P>
    <P>More generally, it will be recalled that the comprehensive EU-Mexico Agreement, which has been in force since October 2000, is based on democratic principles and respect for human rights. At the most recent meeting of the EU-Mexico Joint Council on 27 March 2003, both sides reconfirmed their joint commitment to the vindication of human rights as a shared responsibility of the international community.</P>

      <P>On 17 December 2002, on 5 March, and again on 25 March of this year, I set out the Government's position with respect to the situation in West Papua. I confirmed that this is a matter of ongoing concern to the Government.</P>
      <P>The question of an initiative in the UN General Assembly, or through the committees or agencies of the UN, towards achieving the independence of West Papua would require the support of UN member states. Inquiries, made at my request by our Permanent Representative to the UN, confirm that at present there is no significant support for such an initiative, which would require revisiting the Act of Free Choice of 1969. There is, moreover, concern that such an approach might prejudice on-going efforts to initiate a meaningful dialogue with the Government in Jakarta, and would not contribute to the amelioration of the current situation of the West Papuan people.</P>
      <P>Ireland, together with our EU partners, supports the development of a strengthened dialogue and partnership between the EU and Indonesia. EU member states are due to discuss the situation in Indonesia later this month.</P>
      <P>Deputies can be assured that the Government will continue to monitor very closely the situation in West Papua, and will continue to encourage the Indonesian authorities to act with due regard to the rights and interests of the people of West Papua.</P>

      <P>My speech to the National Forum on Europe of 6 <Col N="239" /> March covered a range of issues relating to the ongoing work of the Convention on the Future of Europe and to recommendations contained in the separate reports by the external relations and defence working groups of the convention. I have arranged for a copy of the speech to be placed in the Oireachtas Library.</P>
      <P>The particular reference raised by the Deputy relates to the Government's position that Ireland should be open to the idea of a possible solidarity clause that would assist in the EU's response to emergency situations and new threats arising from terrorist and non-state entities directed against civilian populations and democratic institutions situated within EU territory.</P>
      <P>As I have underlined previously, the idea that in the event of an emergency the Union would be in a position to mobilise all of its assets, and call on those of its member states, both civilian and military, is very much in keeping with our own traditions. In principle, Austria, Finland and Sweden also support a solidarity clause along these lines.</P>
      <P>The idea of a solidarity and common security clause, extending beyond such emergency situations, would be more problematic, especially if it was in the direction of a mutual defence clause. Again, it will be necessary to maintain a clear distinction between emergency arrangements arising from natural or man-made disasters and more hard defence issues. In this latter regard, and as stated in my speech of 6 March, Ireland's constitutional position is unambiguous. Ireland cannot join a common defence without the approval of the Irish people in a referendum.</P>
      <P>My comments to the National Forum on Europe should be seen in that context. Much in this area will hinge on the content of the draft treaty provisions which are shortly expected to emerge out of the convention and on subsequent negotiations in the framework of the forthcoming intergovernmental conference.</P>

      <Quest>the steps he has taken to address the issue of parades in Northern Ireland by proscribed groups.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>Parades in Northern Ireland by proscribed groups take two forms. Firstly, parades or public displays by proscribed organisations are illegal and, as such, are a matter for the security forces. Secondly, parades authorised by the Parades Commission have been marred on occasion by participants wearing paramilitary-style uniforms or displaying paramilitary-style flags and other trappings.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The conduct of all parades is a matter for the Parades Commission. Under the Public Procession (Northern Ireland) Act 1998, the commission is tasked with facilitating mediation <Col N="240" /> between parties to particular disputed parades and, in the event of failure to reach agreement between the parties, to issue determinations in respect of proposed public processions.</P>
    <P>In addition, under section 3 of that Act, the commission is required to issue a code providing guidance to persons organising a public procession or protest meeting. Clearly set out in the appendices to the commission's most recent code of conduct are the requirements that: no paramilitary-style clothing is to be worn at any time during a parade; no musical instrument will bear any inscription or mark of a proscribed organisation; and, in no circumstances should flags or other displays relating to a proscribed organisation be displayed.</P>
    <P>In addition, participants should refrain from conduct, words, music or behaviour which could reasonably be perceived as intentionally sectarian, provocative, threatening, abusive, insulting or lewd.</P>
    <P>In this context, the Parades Commission has noted that &ldquo;bands generally set the tone for most parades and the Commission hears complaints about the behaviour of some bands whose anti-social treatment of their host communities gives great offence&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The Parades Commission makes clear that the organisers of any march or protest are to be held responsible for the behaviour of all participants and for ensuring compliance with the code of conduct. Compliance with this code is a factor which the commission takes into account in deciding whether to impose conditions or restrictions on a parade. For example, a number of determinations issued by the Parades Commission since its inception have included specifications that only certain bands may participate in the parades because of past unacceptable behaviour on the part of other bands.</P>
    <P>Furthermore, the fourth annual report of the Parades Commission, April 2001 &ndash; March 2002, set out a number of parading principles . This includes a condemnation of those who use parades to further sectarian or bigoted political agendas.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>The members of the United Nations have conferred on the Security Council primary responsibility for the maintenance of international peace and security. All the member states are agreed, under the terms of the United Nations Charter, that the Security Council acts on their behalf in carrying out its duties in accordance with this responsibility. While Ireland was a member of the Security Council in 2001-02, it was the Government's constant concern to ensure as far as possible that the Council assumed the responsibilities conferred on it by the United Nations Charter.</P>
      <P>The Taoiseach and I have several times in recent weeks expressed the Government's regret that the Security Council did not remain united in respect of Iraq, and was unable to address effectively the situation foreseen in Resolution 1441. This failure should not, however, obscure the considerable achievements of the Security Council on a range of other issues, which demonstrate that the Council is well capable of living up to its responsibility to maintain and restore international peace and security, when the international community acts in concert through it. This was well attested during our own recent experience as a Security Council member, on issues such as Sierra Leone, East Timor, Afghanistan, and terrorism.</P>
      <P>We should not forget that there are currently close on 40,000 UN peacekeepers engaged on peacekeeping missions mandated by the Security Council, and thousands more on missions undertaken by coalitions of states under Security Council authorisation. It is abundantly clear, therefore, that the United Nations Security Council is an indispensable institution for the maintenance of international peace and security.</P>
      <P>There is a general recognition among UN member states that the Security Council is in need of reform. Ireland has taken, and will continue to take, an active role in the working group on reform of the Security Council. This group is examining the composition of the Council, its working methods, and its decision-making process including the issue of the veto.</P>

      <P>The task force on policy regarding emigrants was established in December 2001 on foot of a commitment in the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness &ldquo;to address the special needs of those Irish emigrants abroad who are particularly marginalised or at greatest risk of exclusion&rdquo;. The purpose of the task force was to develop a coherent, long-term approach to our emigrants and their needs. The task force presented its report to me at the end of August 2002. The report has been published by my Department and is available on the Department's website.</P>
      <P>I welcome the report which provides a comprehensive analysis of the issues relating to emigration and presents them in a forward-looking way that focuses on the needs of the future. I believe that the report provides a template for a new approach to supporting our emigrants abroad, in particular those who are most vulnerable and disadvantaged.</P>
      <P>In October 2002, the Government approved the establishment of an interdepartmental working group to examine the recommendations in the report with a view to preparing proposals for submission to the Government. The working group has met a number of times and will be reporting to me shortly.</P>
      <P>Responsibility for the Díon fund, which assists vulnerable Irish emigrants in Britain, was transferred to my Department from the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment in February 2003. This was to comply with a recommendation of the task force report which proposed that all Government funding for emigrant services should be brought together under the Vote for Foreign Affairs.</P>
      <P>The draft partnership agreement Sustaining Progress, the successor to the PPF, which is currently being finalised, contains a chapter on special initiatives which will be addressed during the lifetime of the programme. One of these special initiatives is migration and inter-culturalism and, included under this heading, is a provision for the development, arising from the conclusions and recommendations of the task force, of a coherent set of initiatives to be developed in consultation with the relevant interests.</P>
      <P>The arrangements for carrying out this work will be decided by the steering group which will be established to manage the implementation of the agreement. These arrangements, which will include representatives of Government and the social partners, will provide a mechanism for advancing the implementation of the task force's report.</P>

      <P>I assume that the Deputy is referring to the Trócaire briefing paper entitled Addressing Europe's Global Responsibilities: Development Cooperation and the European Convention.</P>
      <P>On 5 March 2003, at a meeting with the Government's Representative at the Convention, the Minister of State for European Affairs, Deputy Roche, Trócaire representatives indicated concerns about the treatment of development co-operation within the convention. In reply, the Minister of State, Deputy Roche, stated that he appreciated the role which Trócaire has been playing in highlighting this important issue. He reaffirmed that Ireland's consistent approach at the convention has been that development co-operation should be defined as an EU policy area with its own specific objectives, which would be set out in the treaties. Development co-operation should also be endowed with a standing in the treaties similar to other areas of EU external policy.</P>
      <P>Ireland's interventions in the convention's external relations working group have been based on these principles. In particular, we have been to the fore in arguing that a basic objective of the Union's external action should be poverty reduction in low-income countries. Our efforts, combined with those of others, have helped to secure agreement on this aim in the external action report. We will continue to work on the basis of the foregoing principles over the remainder of the convention.</P>

      <P>Allocations of milk quota from the national reserve are granted on the basis of recommendations from the milk quota appeals tribunal. The tribunal is a body established to consider and advise on applications for additional quota from individual producers who have suffered severe hardship in the context of the milk quota system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The named person submitted an application for additional quota on the grounds of hardship. However, the amount of quota available for allocation at any given time is limited in the context of the large number of applications submitted. There was insufficient quota available in the 2002-03 milk quota year to enable the tribunal to recommend any further allocations and, unfortunately, it was not possible to make an allocation to the named person. A letter issued to him, outlining the above position. However, his application <Col N="246" /> will be further considered in the context of the hardship scheme for the 2003-04 milk quota year.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 167 and 170 together.</P>
      <P>The UN Fund for Population Activities, UNFPA, which is supported by 119 countries, is the largest multilateral source of assistance on population issues for developing countries. The needs in this area are acute: it is estimated that some 0.5 million women in the developing world die each year due to pregnancy-related causes and that 350 million women have no access to any form of contraception.</P>
      <P>One of UNFPA's key tasks is to contribute to the implementation of the millennium development goal of reducing the maternal mortality rate by 75% by 2015. UNFPA's programmes also have a major focus on the fight against HIV-AIDS, one of the biggest challenges facing developing countries and an overarching priority of Ireland's development assistance. In 2003, Ireland Aid has committed &euro;2.539 million to support UNFPA's core resources which are focused primarily on the world's poorest countries.</P>
      <P>UNFPA is committed by its mandates to the principles of voluntarism and all of its programmes of assistance throughout the world are based on the principles of freedom of choice and informed consent. Its guiding policy, as laid down by its Governing Council in 1985, stipulates that UNFPA is &ldquo;not to provide assistance for abortions, abortion services and abortion-related equipment and supplies as a method of family planning&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>In recent years, there have been a number of allegations that UNFPA has supported coercive family planning programmes and-or abortion. Many of these allegations have been made by the Population Research Institute, a private body based in the United States. In response to representations from Ireland, the fund has categorically denied all of these allegations and insisted that it continues to abide by its mandate. In the case of China, a number of independent investigations have taken place into allegation made against UNFPA. All of these investigations have confirmed that UNFPA does not support China's one-child policy and is making an important contribution to encouraging the Chinese authorities away from coercive family planning measures.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Ireland served a three year term on the executive board on UNFPA from 1998-2000 and was closely involved in discussions on UNFPA's policies and programmes. We were impressed by the <Col N="250" /> quality of UNFPA's development activities, the commitment of its staff and the support it provides to some of the world's poorest countries. Ireland Aid continues to monitor UNFPA closely and attends all of the executive board meetings of the organisation. Over the past year, the Minister of State, Deputy Kitt, has had a number of meetings with Ms Thoraya Obaid, the executive director of the fund, to discuss our contribution and the fund's activities.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that UNFPA is playing an important role in supporting the efforts of developing countries to improve maternal health and welfare and to fight HIV/AIDS. It continues to abide by its mandate and does not promote abortion as a method of family planning. Ireland's funding of UNFPA is, therefore, fully warranted and helps the organisation provide much needed assistance to people living in extreme poverty.</P>

      <P>At this point we do not know what circumstances may attend the end of the conflict in Iraq. Various arrangements could be envisaged for the administration of Iraq in the event that the current Government of Iraq is no longer in control of the country.</P>
      <P>One possibility could be the early appointment of an interim authority, whose composition has yet to be decided, which would then be endorsed by the UN Security Council. This body would pave the way for elections leading to the formation of a Government. It will be essential to encourage the development of indigenous political forces.</P>
      <P>Ireland is of the view that the UN should play a central and substantive role in whatever arrangement is decided upon. We look forward to the establishment of a functioning, viable democracy in Iraq.</P>
      <P>The Secretary General of the United Nations, Mr. Kofi Annan, is consulting the members of the Security Council on the role to be taken by the UN and he has already appointed Mr. Rafeeudin Ahmed as his special adviser on Iraq.</P>
      <P>The Government will consider the situation as it evolves. It has been the policy of successive Irish Governments to limit recognition to states and not to formally recognise governments. We will wish to co-operate with legitimate authorities as they emerge in humanitarian assistance and the rebuilding of Iraq.</P>

      <P>I have therefore asked that this matter be raised with the British authorities through the British-Irish Intergovernmental Secretariat. I would be grateful to receive any further details which the Deputy may have regarding this incident.</P>
      <P>The Government has continually stressed that all aspects of the Good Friday Agreement need to be implemented fully, including swift and ongoing movement towards full security normalisation throughout Northern Ireland. Under the Agreement, normalisation involves a reduction of the numbers and role of the security forces deployed in Northern Ireland to levels compatible with a normal peaceful society, as well as the removal of security installations.</P>
      <P>To date, some 40 military installations have been closed, vacated or demolished since February 1995, troops have been withdrawn from ten police stations and troop levels overall have been reduced by circa 3,500 to 14,000.</P>
      <P>Some 57 military installations remain in operation at the present time. Over the past number of months, both Governments have been seeking to secure &ldquo;acts of completion&rdquo; in regard to all aspects of the Agreement. In this context, the complete normalisation of security arrangements has been a key part of the intensive discussions between both Governments and the political parties.

      <P>The Deputy's question refers to the atrocious attacks carried out on the Bosnian Muslim population in Srebrenica by the Bosnian Serb Army in July 1995 and specifically to the fall of Srebrenica on <Col N="252" /> 11 July 1995, following which thousands of Muslims, mostly men and boys, were brutally massacred. A contingent of 200 peacekeepers from the 600-strong Netherlands contingent in the United Nations Protection Force was unable to prevent the enclave falling into the hands of the Bosnian Serb forces and to protect its population.</P>
      <P>The actions of the Bosnian Serb forces were universally condemned, including by all parties in Dáil Éireann and by the European Union. They led to renewed determination on the part of the international community to protect the Bosnian Muslim population and to bring the war in Bosnia-Herzegovina to an end.</P>
      <P>The failure to protect the civilian population in the UN-designated safe areas prompted a call in the United Nations General Assembly for a comprehensive report. Secretary General Annan issued a report on 15 November 1999, entitled &ldquo;The Fall of Srebrenica&rdquo;, which examined the whole question of the safe havens in Bosnia-Herzegovina and the circumstances whereby the United Nations Protection Force was unable to protect the Srebrenica enclave and its population. The report drew a series of lessons for the future, to ensure that such events will never occur again.</P>
      <P>It is a matter of regret to the Government that those accused of primary responsibility for the massacre, the Bosnian Serb leaders Radovan Karadic and Ratko Mladic, have not yet been apprehended and brought before the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government is deeply conscious of the enormity of the challenges facing countries in the Horn of Africa as they seek to build the foundations of economic and social development, often in a climate of famine and strife. The Government has moved rapidly to respond to the humanitarian situation in this region since the food security crisis began there last year. Emergency and humanitarian assistance provided by the Government for the region amounts to &euro;9 million.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Last January the Minister of State with responsibility for development co-operation and human rights, Deputy Tom Kitt, visited Ethiopia to view and assess the impact that the prolonged drought is having on the country. During the visit the Minister of State, Deputy Kitt, held discussions with Ethiopian Prime Minister Meles as well as other Ministers. He also met with key development actors such as the UN World Food Programme, the EU Commission and representatives of the NGO community. Discussions were held on ways of effectively mobilising resources <Col N="253" /> for the more than 11 million people who will require food assistance in the coming months.</P>
    <P>On foot of the visit, the Minister of State, Deputy Kitt, wrote to his EU counterparts to call for a redoubling of efforts to tackle this crisis. The Government has allocated &euro;3.7 million for emergency assistance for vulnerable people in Ethiopia, with an emphasis on food, water and emergency health interventions.</P>
    <P>Ireland's emergency assistance will be integrated closely with our long-term development activities in Ethiopia and thus address the underlying causes of drought and hunger.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State, Deputy Kitt, took the opportunity during his visit to witness first hand the positive effects that Ireland's long-term assistance programme is having on many rural communities in Ethiopia. The partnership for development established with the Ethiopian authorities represents the best way forward in tackling once and for all the structural problems associated with food insecurity in that country.</P>
    <P>In Eritrea, UN reports indicate that over 60% of the country's 3.3 million people are facing food shortages. On 17 February last, the Minister of State, Deputy Kitt, allocated emergency funding of &euro;550,000 for food and other essential assistance for the people of Eritrea. This brings to &euro;1.6 million Ireland's assistance to Eritrea in the past year.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State, Deputy Kitt, has raised the crisis in the Horn of Africa on a number of occasions with EU Commissioner Poul Nielson, most recently on 18 February in Dublin. During the latter meeting, he briefed the Commissioner on his visit to Ethiopia and discussed ways of improving co-ordination among EU members in relation to the famine response. The EU and its member states have so far allocated &euro;160 million in humanitarian assistance for the Horn of Africa, of which approximately two thirds has been provided by the Commission.</P>
    <P>We will continue to follow the unfolding situation in the Horn of Africa closely. The Government stands prepared to deliver further assistance from Ireland Aid over the coming months. In addition, we will work with our donor partners to ensure maximum co-ordination and coherence in the international response to the humanitarian crisis.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>Ireland's future role in European defence and security matters will continue to be brought forward within the framework of European Security and Defence Policy &ndash; ESDP &ndash; as established under the Treaty of Amsterdam and in accord<Col N="254" /> ance with the conclusions of successive European Council meetings.</P>
    <P>Ireland has already played an active role in the development of ESDP, while at the same time respecting our traditions and values and remaining in full conformity with our traditional policy of military neutrality. Co-operation with other EU member states, particularly the other neutral and non-aligned countries, has proved important in this regard. This approach will continue to apply in the future, as will our attachment to the primary role of the United Nations Security Council in matters of international peace and security.</P>

      <P>Ireland's stance at the United Nations will remain as it was prior to the current conflict in Iraq: expressly, an abiding belief in the primacy of the United Nations in the maintenance of international peace and security and firm adherence to the multilateral system of collective security represented by the UN. Accordingly, the Government is of the view that any threat to international peace and security should be dealt with through the United Nations and in accordance with the charter of the United Nations. This has informed our approach to the United Nations and is reflected in the continuous participation since 1958 of our Defence Forces in United Nations peacekeeping operations and in multinational peacekeeping forces sanctioned by the United Nations Security Council.</P>
      <P>The Government foresees no change in this situation. It will continue to engage in efforts at the United Nations to bring about reform of the Security Council to make it better able to fulfil its responsibility for the maintenance of international peace and security. In the case of Iraq, the Taoiseach and I have on a number of occasions expressed the Government's regrets that the Security Council was unable to forge a unified response to the failure of the Iraqi administration to seize the final opportunity afforded by Resolution 1441 to comply with the obligations imposed on it by of the Security Council. The Government, on the other hand, welcomed the unity more recently shown by the council in the adoption of Resolution 1472, which gave the Secretary General, Mr. Annan, the flexibility needed in the current circumstances to ensure that the oil for food programme is adapted to meet the urgent humanitarian needs of the Iraqi people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Taoiseach has emphasised to Mr. Annan, as well as to President Bush and the British Prime <Col N="255" /> Minister, Mr. Blair, the importance to the Government of the UN's being afforded a central role in the recovery and reconstruction of Iraq.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government's priorities for Ireland Aid flow essentially from the millennium development goals and include education, health, agriculture and food security, water and sanitation, the construction of rural roads, and good governance, including democracy-building and human rights. These priorities are for all of our aid programmes, both bilateral and multilateral. Our support to the multilateral aid agencies has been increasing in line with the increase in our overall aid budget and will continue to reflect the overall growth trend. This year our budget for voluntary contributions to UN and other international development agencies is &euro;38 million, which is an almost fourfold increase in the level of our contribution in 1999.</P>
      <P>Whereas in the past our contributions to these agencies were given as evidence of our support for the multilateral role of the UN in promoting economic and social development, now, with the increase in the size of our contributions, multilateral aid is seen as another mechanism by which Ireland Aid can achieve our overall development objectives. We are now taking a much more focused approach to funding these agencies, as recommended by the recent Ireland Aid review and by the last peer review carried out by the development aid committee of the OECD. We are concentrating our aid across a smaller number of agencies selected on the basis of objective criteria that will ensure that these are the agencies with the closest fit to Ireland Aid's objectives. These criteria include focus on poverty, management strength and commitment to reform. The largest share of our multilateral budget goes to the three main agencies involved in development and relief work: the United Nations Development Fund, the United Nations Children's Fund, UNICEF, and the United Nations High Commission for Refugees, UNHCR.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It has now been made very clear to all of these agencies that our commitment to continue funding them is dependent on our satisfaction with their work. In this regard, a systematic framework for evaluating the work of these agencies has been put in place to ensure that we have regular and reliable feedback on their performance from our own development offices in the field, from Irish NGOs who are working with these agencies <Col N="256" /> and through our permanent missions to the UN in New York, Geneva and Vienna. In addition, Ireland Aid has now undertaken our own detailed evaluations and reviews of our main UN partners, including of their financial reporting and auditing systems. These reviews, which are in general positive, are currently being followed up. We will also continue to monitor the performance of the agencies through active participation at board meetings. Ireland is currently a member of the UNICEF executive board.</P>
    <P>Ireland will continue to support the multilateral programmes of the UN specialised agencies because of their knowledge and international experience, the neutral and untied nature of their aid and the impartial position of the UN and its consequent political outreach. Of particular importance for Ireland Aid is the fact that the UN agencies are active in almost all developing countries and therefore our funding through the UN can balance our focused bilateral programmes. We will also continue to track and monitor closely the work of these agencies to ensure that they are working in an effective and efficient manner that is complementary to our own priorities and strategies.</P>

      <P>The central objectives of the Ireland Aid programme continue to be the reduction of poverty and the achievement of sustainable development with a particular focus on basic needs, capacity building and local ownership of the development process.</P>
      <P>The report of the Ireland Aid review committee in 2002, whose findings and recommendations were accepted in full by the Government, endorsed this approach and declared that the fight against poverty should remain at the heart of all Ireland Aid policies and activities. The policy priorities for the bilateral programme are largely determined by our commitment to work along with other donors and partners towards the achievement of the millennium development goals, a series of key development targets agreed at a number of international summit meetings. The targets call for sustained measurable progress on a range of fronts by 2015. These include halving of the proportion of people living in extreme poverty, the achievement of universal primary education, the elimination of gender disparity at all levels of education provision, a reduction by two thirds in under-five mortality rates, a reduction by three quarters in maternal mortality and halting and reversing the spread of HIV and AIDS as well as measures to ensure environmental sustainability.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In order to contribute towards the achievements of these targets we will keep a sharp focus in our bilateral aid programme on education, health, water and sanitation, agriculture and rural <Col N="257" /> access. Key cross-cutting issues such as gender, environmental sustainability and HIV and AIDS will continue to be incorporated into all Ireland Aid activities, both in the bilateral programme and elsewhere. Responding to the crippling effects of AIDS will be a leading priority of the programme as a whole. There will also be a new policy focus on governance, democracy and human rights.</P>

An EU election observation mission is currently under way, in which Ireland will participate.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the main developments in Mozambique in recent months was the trial and conviction of a number of individuals involved in the killing of journalist Carlos Cardoso. Cardoso was murdered in November 2000 following his investigation of a banking scandal. The successful inves<Col N="258" /> tigation and trial were welcomed by the international community. During the trial, a number of serious issues regarding crime and corruption in Mozambique were raised.

      <P>Since my reply to the Deputy on 5 March, there have been few developments to report. The consequences of the 1994 genocide continue to dominate Rwandan political life and will impact on presidential and legislative elections scheduled to take place later this year. A referendum on the adoption of a new draft constitution is also scheduled to take place later in the year.</P>
      <P>At the General Affairs and External Relations Council last October, the EU adopted a revised common position on Rwanda which aims to support national reconciliation, reconstruction and development, the protection and promotion of human rights and fundamental civil liberties and the transition to democracy. The common position also emphasises the need to ensure that political parties are able to participate freely in the forthcoming presidential and parliamentary elections. It encourages the Government of Rwanda to continue its co-operation with the office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights and to ensure the independent and effective functioning of the national human rights commission.</P>
      <P>Ireland and our EU partners continue to press the authorities in Rwanda to ensure that conditions conducive to open and democratic elections are put in place, thereby laying solid and durable foundations for peace, democracy and reconciliation in Rwanda. We will continue to encourage the liberalisation of political activities. We will also continue to monitor freedom of expression, particularly the freedom of the media, in the run up to the election.</P>

      <P>The Government is concerned at the growing political instability and ongoing food security crisis in Zimbabwe. Principal causes of the food deficit include the prolonged drought, the devastating impact of the HIV-AIDS pandemic, economic mismanagement and extremely poor governance.</P>
      <P>An Ireland Aid emergency team visited Zimbabwe in January 2003. The team found that a rapid response by the international humanitarian community, including Ireland, had averted immense human suffering. However, the overall outlook for the country is bleak. A severe foreign currency shortage and steep economic and social decline means that assistance requirements for Zimbabwe this year will again be enormous, with up to nine million people in need of food aid by June 2003. On foot of the Ireland Aid visit, a funding strategy has been designed to ensure that our humanitarian aid targets the most vulnerable in Zimbabwe. The Government has allocated &euro;2.3 million for food and other essential needs since the crisis began last year. Financial support has been given to Irish non-governmental organisations and key international humanitarian agencies.</P>
      <P>The food crisis has been greatly exacerbated by political instability. The EU has been consistently vocal in its opposition to human rights abuses in Zimbabwe. On 28 March, the EU issued a declaration condemning the violence and repression against the opposition following two days of national strikes called by the opposition on 18 and 19 March.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>Since that reply, mid-term legislative and municipal elections have taken place. The elections on 16 March 2003 resulted in some changes in parliamentary strengths. A number of smaller opposition parties failed to reach the 3% vote threshold and will no longer be represented in Congress. Voter abstention was approximately 58%. In the 84 seat unicameral Congress, the governing National Republican Alliance or Arena of President Francisco Flores won 27 seats &ndash; two fewer seats, with approximately 32% of the vote, while the former rebel Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front or FMLN overtook Arena as the largest party, winning 31 seats &ndash; six extra seats, with approximately 34% of the vote. The balance of power in Congress will rest with smaller parties. The National Conciliation Party or PCN retains its position as the third largest party, with 16 seats &ndash; two extra seats. The Chris<Col N="260" /> tian Democratic Party or PDC and the Union for a Democratic Centre or CDU coalition won five seats each.</P>
    <P>The FMLN as the largest party is expected to occupy the presidency of the legislature. This will give it enhanced influence over parliamentary business. During the last legislative session, the PCN voted with Arena on most key issues, providing President Flores with an overall majority in Congress. Some members of PCN are now seeking to distance the party from Arena in advance of the 2004 presidential elections. It remains to be seen whether the party will continue to support Arena.</P>
    <P>In the elections for 262 municipal councils, Arena suffered losses to the FMLN in the capital, San Salvador, and in other large urban centres of population such as Santa Tecla and Soyapango. Although Arena has retained control of the majority of municipal councils, particularly those in rural areas, the FMLN, because of its large gains in densely populated areas, now has responsibility for areas in which more than 60% of the Salvadoran people reside.</P>

      <P>Human rights are, and have always been, a priority of successive Governments and central to our foreign policy. Together with our EU partners, the Government monitors human rights in many countries in Africa and the rest of the world, on the basis of information obtained from a variety of sources including non-governmental organisations. Where the situation warrants, we make known our concerns about human rights violations to the governments in question, either directly or through action at the UN General Assembly and the UN Commission on Human Rights. At these bodies, the EU regularly makes statements on human rights in a number of countries from all regions. Ireland is fully associated with these statements. The EU also introduces or supports resolutions dealing with specific countries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Active participation in multilateral organisations such as the EU, UN and the Council of Europe provides an occasion where Ireland can voice its concerns regarding human rights abuses. Through these organisations, international pressure can be brought to bear on those responsible for the violation of human rights.

In 2001, the Government decided to open new embassies in a number of EU candidate countries on a phased basis prior to the commencement of Ireland's Presidency of the EU in 2004 and subject to the availability of the necessary resources. New embassies have since been established in Estonia, Slovenia, Slovakia, Cyprus and Brazil. The opening of additional missions will be kept under ongoing review, including in the context of the availability of resources.</P>
    <P>Ireland and Bulgaria enjoyed good co-operation during our time together on the UN Security Council and the Minister for Foreign Affairs met his Bulgarian counterpart, Mr. Solomon Passi, in September 2002, <i>en marge</i> of the UN General Assembly in New York. Ireland looks forward to working closely with Bulgaria again during our Presidency of the EU in the first half of 2004 when Bulgaria will be Chairman-in-Office of the Organisation for Security and Co-operation in Europe, OSCE.</P>
    <P>Bulgarian civil servants participate in courses and seminars on EU issues in Dublin, funded by the Department of Foreign Affairs and organised in conjunction with the Institute of Public Administration, IPA. Bulgarian students' participation in the UCD masters programme in european studies is also funded by my Department.</P>
    <P>As part of the Government's programme of upgrading relations with candidate countries, the Minister of State for European Affairs, Deputy Roche, is due to visit Bulgaria at the end of this month.</P>
    <P>Total trade between Ireland and Bulgaria has increased significantly in recent years from &euro;11.06 million in 1998 to &euro;27.2 million last year. It is expected that this trend will continue as negotiations for membership of the European Union advance.</P>
    <P>A double taxation agreement between Ireland and Bulgaria came into force on 5 January 2001. The agreement provides a strong framework for the further development of economic and commercial relations. We are keen to identify opportunities for increased trade and investment flows and the Embassy of Ireland in Greece and the office of Enterprise Ireland in Budapest will continue to work in this direction.</P>
    <P>The Copenhagen European Council in December 2002 stated that, following the conclusions of the European Council in October 2002 and depending on further progress in complying with the membership criteria, the objective is to welcome Bulgaria as a member of the European Union in 2007. The EU is to increase significantly pre-accession assistance. Areas such as justice and home affairs will be treated as a priority.</P>

Initially, the <Col N="265" /> junior cycle syllabus will be introduced in 200 schools from September 2003 and the remaining schools will participate on a phased basis over the following two years.

      <P>The building project at Malahide Community School is at an early stage of architectural planning, namely pre-planning permission, and is included in section 7 of my Department's 2003 school building programme which is now readily accessible on my Department's website at www.education.ie. In view of the scale of the current capital programme and having regard to the level of financial commitments to be met from projects already in construction, I do not envisage that my Department will be in a position to allow further large scale building projects including that of Malahide Community School to progress beyond their current authorised stage of architectural planning for the time being.</P>
      <P>Section 29 of the Education Act 1998 provides for an appeal to the Secretary General of my Department where a board of management of a school or a person acting on behalf of the board refuses to enrol a student. An appeal will generally not be admitted unless it is made within 42 calendar days from the date the decision of the board of management was notified to the parent or student concerned. Under the Act an appeal must be dealt with within 30 days of its receipt with a provision for a 14 day extension to this timeframe where it is required.</P>
      <P>My Department has received 19 appeals under section 29 of the Education Act 1998 from parents of students who were refused enrolment in Malahide Community School. These appeals are currently in progress and it would not be appropriate for me to comment on the substance of an appeal until such time as it has been dealt with.</P>

      <P>The position regarding the grant scheme for minor works is set out in the 2003 school building programme which was published in January.</P>
      <P>The programme shows that &euro;18.1 million has been provided for the payment of the full grant. The programme also identifies explicitly that there are two parts to the grant &euro;12.5 million for payment of the standard grant of &euro;3,809 to each school and &euro;5.6 million for payment of the <i>per capita</i> element at &euro;12.70 per pupil.</P>
      <P>The published programme also made clear that an expenditure review of the scheme, involving inspections of up to 300 schools would be undertaken in the early part of the year. The purpose of the review is to ensure that the best use is being made of these funds by schools and to adjust the scheme in line with any recommendations that arise from the review. The review is about ensuring best practice and making the scheme as effective as possible. The published programme unambiguously states that the review is in the context of maintaining overall expenditure on the scheme at the same levels as in previous years. Arrangements for this review are being finalised at the moment. It is intended to complete it before the end of the current school year.</P>

      <P>Energy consumption in Ireland is measured on an annual basis. Figures are not yet available for 2002. In 2001, total primary energy requirement, a measure of all energy consumed in Ireland, was 14,761 thousand tonnes of oil equivalent, kTOE. The TOE is an international standard measure of energy value. Energy produced from renewable sources amounted to 259 kTOE, of which biomass contributed 152 kTOE and biogas 28 kTOE. In relation to renewable energy, I recently announced the sixth alternative energy requirement, AER VI, placing contracts for 578 MWs of electricity capacity generated from new renewable energy sources on offer. The closing date for the competition is 24 April 2003.</P>

      <P>As I stated in my reply to the previous question on this matter, to which the Deputy refers, one of the conditions of the grant allocation was the execution of a legal deed which provides, <i>inter alia,</i> for a refund of the grant in the event of the facility not continuing to be used for the purpose for which the grant was allocated. This deed, called a deed of covenant and charge, which was formerly known as a deed of trust, is invoked by my Department's legal advisers, the Chief State Solicitor's office, CSSO. Payment of the grant can only proceed when the deed of covenant and charge is in place. The CSSO is still awaiting the necessary documentation from the solicitors acting on behalf of the company in question to enable the deed of covenant and charge to be put in place. A letter was issued to the solicitors by the CSSO on 7 April 2003 requesting again the outstanding documentation. My Department has granted the company a further and final extension for the drawing down of the grant to 1 June 2003 to enable the deed of covenant and charge to be invoked.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children (Mr. T. O'Malley)</NameTxt>
      <P>Additional funding of &euro;13.3 million has been allocated to services for persons with an intellectual disability or autism in 2003 to meet the full year cost of the 2002 developments and to further enhance the health related support services to children with an intellectual disability or autism. This funding is in addition to the very significant revenue investment, amounting to &euro;188 million, which has been made in these services since 1997 and which is built into the ongoing budget base. The additional funding provided by this and the previous Government between 2000 and 2002 was used to put in place, in addition to a range of other services, more than 900 new residential, 380 new respite and around 2,000 new day places for people with an intellectual disability and those with autism.</P>
      <P>Despite this very significant investment, demographic factors are contributing to growing waiting lists for residential services in particular, even though the number of people in receipt of services, including full time residential services, continues to increase. The increased birth rate in the 1960s and 1970s has resulted in large numbers of adults in their late 20s and early 30s requiring full-time residential services. In addition, people with an intellectual disability are living longer than previously, adding to the need for services compared to previous generations. This has also been the international experience in service provision to this population.</P>
      <P>The overall economic position in 2003 has had implications for all aspects of public investment and this is reflected in the Estimates and budget adopted by the Government for 2003. Within this overall framework, however, some two-thirds of the additional funding available for non-capital investment in services has been allocated to the health services. This funding is being applied largely to maintaining existing levels of service across all service programmes, including services for people with an intellectual disability. While it is regrettable that the level of investment in these services achieved in recent years could not be maintained in 2003, my Department will work closely with the health boards and other service providers in relation to service provision this year. The Deputy will appreciate that I cannot give specific commitments for 2004 and onwards in relation to any element of the health services, as these issues form part of the Estimates and budget discussions between my Department and the Department of Finance.</P>

      <P>I previously informed the Deputy that the matter was being examined by the Chief State Solicitor's office. The Chief State Solicitor's office wrote to the firm of solicitors acting, at that stage, on behalf of the Mid-Western Health Board on 26 April 2002. The Chief State Solicitor's office has informed us that the Mid-Western Health Board dispensed with the services of that firm. The Chief State Solicitor's office wrote to the original solicitors to obtain further details. To date, no response has been received and I am, therefore, not in a position to say when the matter will come to a satisfactory conclusion. However, my Department will contact directly the Mid-Western Health Board on the matter and will be in touch with the Deputy when the board reports to the Department.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>As Minister for Health and Children, my responsibilities centre on the provision of a high quality health service and this includes ensuring, in so far as is possible, that adequate and accessible pharmacy services are generally available. I established the Pharmacy Review Group, chaired by Professor Michael Mortell, in November 2001 to examine the pharmacy issues raised in the OECD report on regulatory reform in Ireland. The group based its approach on the principles set out for evidence-based policy formulation by the EU-level Mandelkern group (The Mandelkern Group on Better Regulation Final Report, 13 November 2001). These include public and <Col N="281" /> interest group consultation, analysis of the existing position and analysis of possible options.</P>
    <P>The group consulted widely and, in particular, invited submissions from consumer interests and special interest groups such as the Asthma Society and the Irish Heart Foundation. The Pharmacy Review Group submitted its report on 31 January 2003. I am currently examining the recommendations contained in the report and it is my intention that it will be published as soon as possible. Deputies will appreciate that it would be not be appropriate for me to comment on the report's recommendations before publication.</P>

      <Quest>if his attention has been drawn to the fact that general practitioners are paid different annual rates for providing medical care for persons over 70 years of age; the reason for the differing rates; and his views on whether these differing rates lead to a different quality of service to those patients.</Quest>

    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>Since 1989, general practitioners have been paid annual capitation rates based on the age, sex and location of their patients. As a result of the Government decision to grant automatic eligibility to all persons aged 70 years and over from 1 July 2001 and a lengthy protracted industrial relations process, a higher capitation rate for persons in this age category has been paid to participating doctors for all of their patients, aged 70 years and over, who receive a medical card for the first time in the community since that date. All of these rates reflect the agreed outcome of industrial negotiations between the Department and the Irish Medical Organisation.</P>
      <P>To have any differentiation in the level or quality of treatment provided for patients, based on the remuneration given to the doctor for the persons concerned, would be totally at variance with the philosophy of the general medical services scheme. Indeed, it is a condition of the GMS scheme contract which participating doctors sign that there must be no differentiation in the level of treatment provided for a doctor's medical card and private patients. I am not aware of any such discrimination in care to patients in this age category at present, but if the Deputy has evidence to the contrary, I would be anxious that the information would be passed to me as a matter of urgency. The relevant health board would be directed to investigate the matter and to take appropriate action.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children (Mr. Callely)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 218 and 219 together.</P>
      <P>The Nursing Homes (Subvention) Regulations 1993 are administered by the health boards and the Eastern Regional Health Authority. A subvention may be paid towards the cost of a nursing home in cases where the older person has been deemed in need of nursing home care following a medical assessment in which the applicant is categorised, according to his or her level of medical dependency and a means test. There are currently three levels of dependency &ndash; medium, high and maximum &ndash; in respect of which maximum rates of &euro;114.30, &euro;152.40 and &euro;190.50 apply respectively.</P>
      <P>The second schedule of the Nursing Homes (Subvention) Regulations 1993 sets out the general rules for the assessment of means in respect of an application for a nursing home subvention. &ldquo;Means&rdquo; for the purposes of these regulations are the income and the imputed value of assets of a person in respect of whom a subvention is being sought and the income and imputed income of his or her spouse. Paragraph 2 of the second schedule provides that, in calculating the means of an applicant, a health board shall take all sources of income into account, including rental income. Means are assessed for this scheme to ensure that the available funding is directed at those older people who have the greatest need of financial assistance. Under section 6.1 of the Nursing Home Regulations 1993, where a person is deemed by a health board to be sufficiently dependent to require maintenance in a nursing home and is unable to pay any or part of the cost of maintenance in a nursing home, then that person qualifies for a subvention at the appropriate rate.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy may be aware, sections 22.3 and 22.4 of the Nursing Home (Subvention) Regulations 1993 allow health boards the discretion to contract beds in private nursing homes and to pay more than the maximum rates of subvention in such cases. However, the application of these provisions is a matter for each health board in the context of meeting the requirements of the subvention scheme within the board's revenue allocation as notified annually in the letters of determination. This is in keeping with the provisions of the Health (Amendment)(No 3) Act, 1996.</P>

      <P>Taxi and wheelchair accessible taxi licences may be granted by a licensing authority in respect of that <Col N="284" /> authority's taximeter area. This is done following the presentation of a vehicle test certificate and a certificate of suitability issued by the national car testing service, demonstration of appropriate insurance and payment of the appropriate fee.</P>
      <P>A taxi may only provide a taxi service in the taximeter area in respect of which the licence has been granted. Accordingly, taxi licences cannot be transferred from one taximeter area to another.</P>
      <P>Where a person wishes to apply for the grant of a taxi licence in respect of a vehicle which is already the subject of a taxi licence granted in another taximeter area, the application can only be processed in respect of the new taximeter area where the full qualifying conditions are complied with.</P>
      <P>That process includes the carrying out of the appropriate inspections by the NCT. These incorporate the following: a suitability test which addresses issues relating to the mounting on the vehicle of a taxi sign bearing the licence number and details of the licensing authority granting the licence; the lighting of that sign; the fitting of a taximeter; the automatic printing of a receipt that displays the full fare for the hire based on the maximum fare structure in place in that taximeter area; the date starting and finishing time of the hire; and the licence number of the taxi or wheelchair accessible taxi.</P>
      <P>It is clear that as the licensing details displayed on the taxi sign and given on the receipt, along with the fare structure programmed into the taximeter, will vary from taximeter area to taximeter area, a separate certificate of suitability is required for each taximeter area.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 236 and 237 together.</P>
      <P>The Environmental Protection Agency carries out a wide range of statutory functions, including: licensing and regulation of industrial and other activities with significant polluting potential; licensing and regulation of all significant waste disposal and recovery activities; monitoring of environmental quality and publication of periodic reports on the state of the environment; promoting and co-ordinating environmental research; implementing a permitting system for the control of emissions of volatile organic compounds; acting as the Irish competent authority for the purposes of EU directives on the contained use and deliberate release of genetically modified organisms; preparing and implementing a national hydrometric programme for the collection, analysis and publication of information on the levels, volumes and flows of water in rivers, lakes and groundwaters; and generally overseeing the performance by local authorities of their statutory environmental protection functions.</P>
      <P>The EPA is funded primarily by way of Exchequer grant. Almost &euro;19 million will be provided to the agency by my Department in 2003.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In carrying out its functions, the agency makes publicly available a wide range of reports and data on the quality of the environment, both in printed form and on its website www.epa.ie. While these reports and data demonstrate that <Col N="289" /> Ireland's overall environmental quality remains good, they also show increasing environmental pressures associated in particular with economic growth and related consumption patterns. EPA work in this regard is an important input to the ongoing development of appropriate policy responses and has been fully recognised and drawn upon in recent major policy documents from my Department on the environment such as: National Climate Change Strategy, 2000; Preventing and Recycling Waste: Delivering Change (2002); and Making Ireland's Development Sustainable (2002).</P>

      <P>The earnings disregard is a major feature of the one parent payment scheme and is designed to assist in offsetting expenses, which a lone parent may face in taking up employment opportunities, and to encourage them to consider employment as an alternative to full dependence on social welfare payments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The operation of the earnings disregard means that a lone parent may earn up to &euro;293 per week <Col N="291" /> and still retain entitlement to some level of payment. Thereafter, there are transitional arrangements in place whereby a lone parent who exceeds the earning threshold may retain 50% of the payment they had been in receipt of for a further 12 months.</P>
    <P>At the end of January 2003, the latest figures available, there were 91,477 unmarried, separated or deserted lone parents receiving the one parent family payment or a payment under a corresponding scheme. Of these, up to 20,000 beneficiaries &ndash; 22% of the total &ndash; were receiving payments at a reduced rate due to earnings from employment.</P>
    <P>Lone parents are also encouraged to pursue maintenance payments with the other parent. In this connection up to 50% of any maintenance received may be disregarded under the means test and, in addition, allowances are made for up to &euro;95.23 per week of maintenance paid in respect of vouched housing costs.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that the social welfare arrangements in place for lone parents are appropriate and support the general policy which is to provide income support for lone parents which at the same time encouraging them to consider employment as a realistic alternative. The position is being kept under review and any changes would be a matter for consideration in a budgetary context.</P>
