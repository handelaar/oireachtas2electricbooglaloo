      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 1 to 5, inclusive, together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I refer the Deputies to my reply to Questions Nos. 1 to 5, inclusive, concerning the code of conduct for office holders, which I answered on 25 June 2003. The Standards in Public Office Act 2001, an initiative of the previous Government, requires the Government to draw up a code of conduct for the guidance of office holders. The Standards in Public Office Commission was consulted during drafting and the views offered were, <Col N="522" /> by and large, reflected in the code. As the Act specifies, the purpose of the code is to indicate the standards of conduct and integrity for office holders in the performance of their functions. The Standards in Public Office Commission published the code on 3 July 2003, from which date it applies prospectively.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny" hpid="Mr. Kenny Mr. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>When the Taoiseach was first elected in 1997 he promised the people in his programme for Government that he would restore public confidence in public life through credible policing mechanisms for ethical issues. Subsequently, at his Ard-Fheis in 1998, he said that public trust requires integrity and a genuine dedication to public service. As regards the code of conduct and ethics and arising from the recent well publicised tax problems of Deputy Collins and the Taoiseach's failure to take action at the time, will he agree that the new code of conduct should include mandatory reporting by office holders of any breaches of ethics legislation which come to their attention? Does the Taoiseach believe that matter should be included in the code of conduct? Should he have been obliged to ensure that the Standards in Public Office Commission was informed of a problem of which he was aware rather than learning about it through the media? </P>
      <P>The draft code of conduct, which was circulated during the summer, includes a provision which requires that Ministers give accurate and truthful information to the Houses of the Oireachtas correcting any inadvertent error at the earliest opportunity. In view of the recent revelations that the Taoiseach's then special adviser on Northern Ireland, with his <i>imprimatur,</i> had a face to face meeting with the alleged&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand, but the code of conduct, which was circulated, states that Ministers should give accurate and truthful information to the Houses of the Oireachtas correcting any inadvertent error at the earliest opportunity.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>You, a Cheann Comhairle, told me many years ago when you were not in that Chair that the way to get information in this House was to table a question in such a way that the Minister might not realise what was behind it. That was valuable information.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny" hpid="Mr. Kenny Mr. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Taoiseach consider that the provision in the code of conduct about ethical information should have been adhered to in his own case? Does the Taoiseach accept that the findings in a recent Sunday newspaper that 50% of respondents believe that politicians are corrupt is a shocking indictment of the Government's failure over the past six years to address the issue of ethics in public office?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle An Ceann Comhairle">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is going well beyond the content of the question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent" hpid="Mr. Sargent Mr. Sargent">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
      <P>Ring Joe Duffy for advice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Kenny asked a number of questions. The code covers the Taoiseach, the Tánaiste, Ministers, Ministers of State, the Attorney General, who is a Member of the Oireachtas, a person who is Deputy Chair of Dáil Éireann or Deputy Chair of Seanad Éireann and the joint committees of both Houses of the Oireachtas. The code, which is based on the Standards in Public Office Act, is good.</P>
      <P>As regards the question about a Deputy's tax problems, that is bound under the 1995 Act and the amended Act of 2001. I know that anything which is not brought to my attention will come out in the public domain because it will be in the statutory report. I was informed in that case that it would come out in a statutory report and that it would be subject to the Standards in Public Office Act. The Deputy was aware of that. The only difference was that the Deputy understood that the report would come out the following week, but it did not come out for some time. The Deputy is dealing with those issues and with his party.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I agree totally that the House should be kept fully informed on all issues. The difficulty which has arisen in the context of recent issues &ndash; at other times also &ndash; is that when one is asked a question about a certain period, one is subject to one's recall or someone else's reminders. It is not always possible to recall the events of a more extended period. As soon as this issue was raised, I dealt with it but, in principle, I agree completely with what the Deputy said. It has always been a rule for Ministers and me that if one realises one <Col N="524" /> has not given the full facts to the House or misled it, which did not happen in this case, this should be placed on the record of the House.</P>
    <P>Deputy Kenny asked about the public's opinion of whether politicians were corrupt. We have an ongoing job to do in this House, as do parliamentarians everywhere. We have dealt with our own issues through a whole series of Acts but it is always the case that when anything such as this occurs, everybody in the House is affected. In general, politicians are hard-working and decent but there are always some breaches of the rules which must be dealt with. I do not want to make any comment about recent events because they are all subject to investigation, some in coming weeks. We must all work to make sure this code, with older legislation, is properly implemented. I will also play my part.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>As I do not want to go against the Taoiseach's wishes by going into the details of the case of a Deputy on his own benches, my question will be a general one. What is the merit of the tax clearance certificate in circumstances such as those mentioned by Deputy Kenny? Is it not the case that the public would assume one's tax affairs were in order if one had a certificate?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle An Ceann Comhairle">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>I draw the Deputy's attention to the point I raised with Deputy Kenny. The five questions with which we are dealing are unrelated to the issue the Deputy is raising. He will have to find another way to raise it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>What is the value of the reference in the code to a tax clearance certificate&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle An Ceann Comhairle">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy has made his point. The Taoiseach may make a brief response, if he wishes.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;if it is not meant to convey what the public considers it to convey?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>It is important to have tax clearance certificates. I do not have full details of the case mentioned but this issue is being investigated. However, the public is entitled to be sure, if we go to the trouble of obtaining tax clearance certificates, that they prove our affairs are in order. I thought that was the case but we will have to wait to find out what happened in this instance. I agree with the Deputy &ndash; a tax clearance certificate should be comprehensive. The whole idea was that the certificate would prove to the public and us that a person's affairs were in order. There should not be any way around this.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent" hpid="Mr. Sargent Mr. Sargent">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
      <P>The code distributed on 3 July contains quite a number of powers. It states it is open to the Oireachtas to impose sanctions on office holders. How can this be done if the Government is able to swing the result every time, no matter what the Oireachtas <i>per se</i> wishes <Col N="525" /> to do? There is a requirement for the Taoiseach, members of the Cabinet and Ministers of State to provide accurate and truthful information. There is also the question of Ministers and Ministers of State using official facilities to raise their own profiles. Is there a need for change to ensure the Government does not have the last word? We would then have more genuine Oireachtas decisions.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent" hpid="Mr. Sargent Mr. Sargent">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle An Ceann Comhairle">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>The question submitted relates to a particular issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent" hpid="Mr. Sargent Mr. Sargent">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
      <P>I am simply asking whether the code is worth anything. As you will be aware, a Cheann Comhairle, the Green Party is in favour of giving you more power to challenge members of the Government to ensure answers are truthful and complete.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>We are concerned that you might over-utilise it, a Cheann Comhairle.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent" hpid="Mr. Sargent Mr. Sargent">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Taoiseach indicate whether the Government would be in favour of you having such power in order that you would be more than a timekeeper following the minimalist approach to Standing Orders?</P>
      <P>The code refers to value for money. Does the Taoiseach regard as value for money the &euro;1.6 million spent on transport for 17 Ministers of State and the &euro;2.9 million for Ministers? Is there a need to examine serious facts that are emerging on value for money as regard expenditure by office holders?</P>

      <P>Before the Taoiseach replies, on the question of the Chair, no Chair would be in a position to judge the value or otherwise of an answer to a question from a Minister.

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I repeat that the code arises from the Standards in Public Office Act 2001 which builds on the 1995 Act and the other initiatives brought forward. It has merit. It is a detailed set of practices with which individuals must comply. It is written clearly and administered by a high powered group which will deal with the regulation of office holders. It conforms fully with statutory requirements. As I said to Deputy Kenny, there was extensive consultation with the Standards in Public Office Commission in its preparation. It complements the many other ethics requirements set out in legislation and the guidelines which have to be observed by office holders, including those which have been in place for years and others which have been updated.</P>
      <P>The House will not be doing a good job if, when we bring forward tough legislation and other rules, we say they are worth nothing. The fact is that any breaches or complaints about them by the public, the media, any Member of this House or anyone involved in the political system or outside are investigated in a detailed way. We know this from the few cases which have arisen so far. This area is far more regulated than in many others places, with which I have no difficulty. That is what we set out to do in this House but we should not say it is not worth anything. It is worth everything. I have no doubt that as time passes, it will be improved, if necessary, but this has not been proved.</P>
      <P>I have already answered the other question for Deputy Kenny. When answering a question about an issue, it is not always possible to cover all the points contained in it. One is subject to recalling everything that has happened or somebody pointing out something. That is what happened in the instance mentioned. I agree, however, that questions should be dealt with when one has to deal with them.</P>
      <P>I have no comment to make on the Chair. The matter is governed by Standing Orders as well as by what the Chair said.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>This is the trouble when a Member of the Oireachtas does not even know <Col N="527" /> what is in the code, or in the standards in public office legislation. It is governed by the Standards in Public Office Commission which is chaired by Mr. Justice Smith. It has enormous powers of investigation and so on &ndash; far more than most parliaments have, with which I agree. It is not Government &ndash; it is a legislative measure by a high powered group with considerable powers to deal with any breach. That is what it is.</P>

      <NameTxt>Caoimhghín Ó Caoláin</NameTxt>
      <P>What provision is there for revisiting the code of conduct for office holders? Is there a process to accommodate improvement? Is a review intended? Very importantly, how will compliance be monitored? Is the Taoiseach aware that the section entitled, Accountability to the Houses of the Oireachtas, states that it is of paramount importance that office holders give accurate and truthful information to the Houses of the Oireachtas? Is he aware that the appropriate counterpart to that in terms of the Assembly in the North is a far more detailed and accommodating provision? It states that Ministers must ensure all reasonable requests for information from the Assembly, users of services and individual citizens are complied with. That is a much stronger guarantee and a much better statement of intent in terms of conduct. How is it proposed to try to improve on what is now detailed? Does the Taoiseach agree there are examples of better approach, better formulation of words and greater guarantees in terms of that which applies in the Assembly? </P>
      <P>Does the Taoiseach not recognise that time and again, even if the Ceann Comhairle is not prepared to recognise the nature of some of the responses here, that, invariably, questions put to the Minister for Health and Children are referred to the individual health boards?</P>

      <P>Deputy Ó Caoláin asked me about the Standards in Public Office Commission. The code was completed in July arising from the 2001 legislation, so I do not believe there is a requirement at this stage to conduct a review.

      <P>Can the House take it that all Ministers and Ministers of State have signed up to the code of conduct? Is that also the case with all chairpersons of committees? I refer to section 2.2.4, for example, which expressly provides that an office holder shall not carry out a professional practice and must desist. Chairpersons are encompassed in the term &ldquo;office holder&rdquo; for the purposes of the code of conduct. Have chairpersons of committee signed up to the code?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a code which people should follow. It is there for people to observe and they should do so. Office holders are not prohibited from being directors but they are advised that it would be better if they were not. If I recall correctly, they are not allowed to take paid directorships. It is equally suggested it would be better if they were not directors in an unpaid capacity. The code is applicable to everyone on the list.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no question of signing &ndash; there is no signing procedure. There is a code, arising from the legislation, to which people are subject. It is like any code of practice to which people are subject. I do not know of anyone who has demurred from attempting to comply with the code.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>What steps has the Taoiseach taken to ensure that the code is being observed by all office holders to whom it applies? I draw his attention to the fact that the Ethics in Public Office Act defines &ldquo;office holder&rdquo; as including chairpersons of committees. Can I understand his first answer to mean that some persons hold non-executive directorships and that it would be better if they did not?</P>
      <P>My original question related to professional practice. An office holder should not carry on a professional practice during his tenure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with that. The code addresses the issue of business and other interests by requiring that office holders do not engage in any activities which could reasonably be regarded as being incompatible with the discharge of the duties of their office. Where the legislation gives specific incidents of behaviour where conflict of interest is possible the code requests office holders to observe the broad principle involved.</P>
      <P>I have answered Deputy Rabbitte's question with regard to Ministers and Ministers of State. I have not observed it with regard to chairmen or to the Cathaoirleach or Leas-Chathaoirleach of the Seanad. They are still subject to the code.</P>

      <P>Or any other place. There are rules governing office holders and they are re-enacted in this code. Office holders are bound by conduct of their office. I do not think chairmen are bound by the same code but Ministers and Ministers of State certainly are. Apart from the code, Ministers and Ministers of State are bound by the rules regarding whether they can hold executive or non-executive directorships. The code sets out those rules but chairs of committees are treated rather differently because they are not included in the book on office holders. They are asked to follow the code but they are not governed by the legislation which governs the Taoiseach, the Tánaiste, Ministers and Ministers of State.</P>

      <P>While I accept, a Cheann Comhairle, that it is difficult for you to judge whether we are getting worthwhile answers, it ought not be difficult for you when a point is being pursued and the Taoiseach is about to answer. The question I asked, which the Taoiseach was about to answer, was whether he had satisfied himself that all office holders are observing the terms of the code of conduct.</P>
      <P>On the latter point the Taoiseach raised, I understand exactly what he is talking about in terms of the traditional notion of office holders in the form of Ministers and Ministers of State. In his own code of conduct, &ldquo;office holder&rdquo; is described as the Taoiseach, the Tánaiste, a Minister of the Government, a Minister of State, the Attorney General, a Chairman or Deputy Chairman of Dáil Éireann or Seanad Éireann or a chairman of a committee of either House of the Oireachtas. It is in that regard that I am using the term &ldquo;office holder&rdquo;. Has the Taoiseach satisfied himself that the chairpersons of the various committees are observing the code of conduct?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I read out the categories. Under the wider Act, I am duty-bound to check office holders under the old title, which is Ministers and Ministers of State. I have not done so for chairmen of committees. Since 3 July, I have not checked chairmen of committees, or for that matter the Ceann Comhairle or the Cathaoirleach of the Seanad. Whether it is a matter for the Government or the commission to do this is another issue. I have not done it and I am not saying anybody is in breach of the requirement. <Col N="531" /> It is a code that should be followed. Under the ethics Acts, I have to deal with office holders, as defined by Deputy Rabbitte &ndash; Ministers and Ministers of State &ndash; but I have not dealt with chairmen of the Houses and chairmen of committees. To do so would mean dealing with people from across all parties and I have not done that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>What is the point of having a code of conduct if we do not know whether the people to whom it applies are observing it? Will the Taoiseach take steps to establish whether it is being observed? Has the Taoiseach satisfied himself that none of his Ministers of State, for example, is carrying out professional practice or other business that is not permitted under the Acts? I am not referring to the literary output of the Minister of State, Deputy O'Dea, in the <i>Sunday Independent.</i></P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>

Is he saying that somewhere encompassed in the posts defined as office holder there are non-executive directors? He has said this is a practice that he would rather not see. Are there any such directors or are we having an academic discussion?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>While it is an academic discussion, the public office commission has pointed out that people should not hold such positions. My interpretation, subject to checking, is that this is a code drawn up to cover everyone to whom it applies in the House. It is everybody's obligation to comply with it. As head of Government, it is my job to deal with Ministers and Ministers of State. I do not think it is my job to check others, particularly non-members of Government. It is a matter for the public office commission to do this and I do not think it would be appropriate for me to delve into that. It is a code with which everyone should be complying.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>

If Deputy Kenny is referring back to his earlier question, if somebody informs you that he or she will be listed in a report of what is an independent arm of the State and that that will be dealt with by the Standards in Public Office Commission, I do not see that the position will be as suggested by the Deputy. The person is telling you a fact. He or she is telling you not that he or she might be involved with an arm of the State, but that he or she will be so involved. The person is telling you positively that that will mean that he or she will be investigated by the commission. On that basis I do not think it is a matter for you to report.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 6 to 10, inclusive, together.</P>
      <P>The National Security Committee continues to meet as required and members liaise on an ongoing basis. It is concerned with ensuring that I and the Government are advised of high level security issues and the responses to them, but not involving operational security issues. The group, which is chaired by the Secretary General to the Government, comprises representatives at the highest levels of the Departments of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Defence and Foreign Affairs, and of the Garda and Defence Forces. The group continues to monitor developments which might have national security implications, in particular in the international arena.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny" hpid="Mr. Kenny Mr. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Taoiseach happy that the British Government has provided him with adequate information about safety and security at Sellafield, given that an attack on that nuclear plant could have potentially catastrophic consequences for this country? Does he agree for instance that strand three of the Good Friday Agreement should be invoked by him to get that information?</P>
      <P>In view of the ongoing conflict in Iraq and the growing hostility in the Arab world towards the United States, have the high level group and the Government assessed the possibility of US interests in this country becoming a target for international terrorists? Has the high level group reported to the Government on that? God forbid such an unlikely event, but does the Taoiseach share the view of the Minister for Defence, Deputy Michael Smith, that our first port of call for assistance would have to be our neighbours?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>We have raised the Sellafield issue many times, legally and politically, in <Col N="534" /> detailed correspondence with the British Government. The Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Cullen, is engaged in two separate legal actions under UNCLOS and the OSPAR Convention. While we have failed to gain access to the confidential information withheld from the UK public consultation papers, the tribunal has established an important international legal precedent in determining that Ireland has a right under the OSPAR Convention to access information on the marine environment, that the United Kingdom has an obligation to make such information available and that Ireland has a right to redress under the convention to vindicate the rights to such information on the law of the sea.</P>
      <P>The issue of competency as between UNCLOS and the European Union is ongoing. The European Commission has initiated a formal complaint which has been the subject of extensive correspondence with Ireland. It is expected that the Commission will shortly refer the complaint to the European Court of Justice for decision. The Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government recently dealt with the matter in the House.</P>
      <P>The events of 11 September 2001 showed the scale of the threat posed by international terrorism. The National Security Committee has not been made aware of any information which suggests Ireland is at risk but the overall international climate requires continued vigilance. The Minister for Defence, Deputy Michael Smith, under the task force on emergency planning and in conjunction with various State agencies, continues to monitor the situation. As has been said, God forbid anything like that should ever happen. Obviously, the scale of such events determines one's response but the office of emergency planning has put in place as good a contingency plan as is possible to deal with any eventuality. It is not unusual for countries hit by such disasters to seek international assistance.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent" hpid="Mr. Sargent Mr. Sargent">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
      <P>Notwithstanding the existence of the high level group, is the Taoiseach aware of the recent report by the Emergency Planning Society presented to the Government in late October which called for the establishment of a single emergency planning agency reporting at the highest level to manage threats from terrorism disasters and accidents or attacks on Sellafield and so on? Does he agree that, from the society's point of view, there is some confusion as to who is responsible for the management of such threats and that it has declared the exposure of weaknesses in the way the Government responded, for example, to the possible nuclear alert following the attack on America on 11 September 2001 and following the SARS threat? Will he comment on this evaluation and indicate if any measures have been taken to address the concerns expressed by the society?</P>

      <P>Did the high level group assess the ongoing cost of facilitating the US military machine at Shannon Airport and is the Taoiseach in a position to offer us a projected estimate of the cost of that operation? Did the high-level group examine the ways in which US foreign policy and the policies of the state of Israel are continuing to fuel fundamentalism? Did the group analyse the way in which the US and British Governments sought to deceive the United Nations by their attempted linkage of the terrible atrocity of 11 September 2001 with Saddam Hussein's regime in Iraq?</P>

      <P>I will reply first to Deputy Ó Caoláin. The National Security Committee is not involved with foreign relations issues. It is liaising on various issues of high-level security responses rather than operational security. In reply to Deputy Rabbitte, the group has met seven times this year so far. It deals with security issues, and, though it always happened, there is now more than ever a sharing of intelligence right across Europe in the whole justice and home affairs area, and that has been fundamental even in other jurisdictions outside Europe.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Defence (Mr. M. Smith)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 119, 191 and 208 together.</P>
      <P>The Irish Coast Guard has responsibility for the provision of search and rescue services in the Irish search and rescue region. The Air Corps provides the service off the north-west coast from Sligo Regional Airport, while Canadian Helicopters Corporation Ireland, or CHCI, a private contractor, provides the service from Shannon, Waterford and Dublin. Until recently, the Air Corps service was provided from Finner using a Dauphin helicopter. As Deputies will be aware, that service has now been replaced with an S61 aircraft operating out of Sligo Airport. The autohover-equipped S61 helicopter was leased by the Coast Guard and tasked to the Air Corps. CHCI provides and maintains the aircraft, while it is flown and operated by Air Corps personnel.</P>
      <P>The S61 commenced daylight operations in July 2003. The Air Corps continued to train on the S61 throughout the summer with the objective of moving to a full 24-hour search and rescue service in November. Regarding the current situation in the north-west, since late September there has been an unusually high incidence of sick leave among rear crew, a term covering winch men and winch operators. As service continuity could not be guaranteed with the existing rear crews, the GOC posted 13 of the 17 personnel to other duties. All available options to continue to provide the service were examined, and a course of action to expedite the phased return to a full service is currently being implemented.</P>
      <P>Several Air Corps personnel who previously served in search and rescue are now being retrained on the S61. In addition, the recruitment of personnel from within the Defence Forces to be trained as rear crew has commenced. With regard to the lead times involved in training new crews, the current plan envisages that the 12-hour, largely daylight, full search and rescue service will be available from late spring 2004, with the S61 providing a limited service of search, air ambulance, island relief, disaster relief and so on for the remaining 12 hours. The full 24-hour service on the S61 should commence in autumn 2004. In the period up to late spring 2004, the currently available, limited S61 service will of course continue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am most disappointed at this turn of events. The personnel in the Air Corps search and rescue unit have put huge effort into their training and work-up period in Sligo and, but for the illness, would have been ready to move to a full 24-hour search and rescue service later this month. For the remaining crew and pilots and the Air Corps as a whole, this has been a major setback. I would like to assure the House that, contrary to sugges<Col N="537" /> tions in recent press releases, the primary concern of the Air Corps is the safety of its personnel. The S61 provides a very robust and effective platform for search and rescue in the North Atlantic, representing a significant improvement in capability and safety for the Air Corps personnel operating the service. The implementation of the new service has been overseen by a steering group comprising the coast guard, the Air Corps, the directorate of Defence Force operations, the Department of Defence and CHCI.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Additional Information.</i>The Sligo S61 is a tried and proven search and rescue helicopter with modern equipment. Pilots and rear crew were trained and independently rated by experienced CHCI personnel. Significant investment has been made in the Sligo base in accommodation, rest areas, offices and the provision of all modern search and rescue equipment. The helicopter and all its equipment are maintained to civil aviation standards. CHCI has conducted two independent safety audits of the whole Sligo operation and is satisfied that everything is in order. In addition, the air safety officer for the Air Corps, following a detailed safety audit of the operations in Sligo, has satisfied the GOC that all safety matters have been addressed. A further audit of the operation was due to be carried out independently by both CHCI and the Air Corps before the operation moved to a 24-hour search and rescue service.</P>
    <P>As can be seen, there is huge emphasis on the safety aspects of Air Corps operations. There are procedures in place for ensuring a safe working environment and ensuring the serviceability of all equipment. For the overall operation, independent audits will continue to be carried out to ensure that standards are maintained.</P>

      <P>Has the root cause of the spate of sick leave been fully investigated? Is it true that serious concern about health and safety has been expressed by the personnel involved? Is the Minister aware that there is a serious void in the rescue services on which the north-west depends as a consequence of this problem? What does the Minister propose to do to address this matter of urgency?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>As I indicated in my reply, I am extremely disappointed by this setback. The S61 service is a massive improvement on the original service. A great deal of training was provided, support was given by CHCI and extra facilities were provided at Sligo. The Air Corps, the pilots and many of the other people involved were determined to continue this service. The 12-hour service had been achieved and everything was building up to the provision of a 24-hour service in November. I have no claim before me. Nothing &ndash; pay or otherwise &ndash; is being pursued by associations such as PDFORRA and RACO. The management of the Air Corps has to resolve the difficulties that are behind this problem. We are <Col N="538" /> doing all we can to maintain the highest possible level of service and to liaise with Shannon, Prestwick and Stornoway to ensure that emergency cover is provided. We are providing the fullest possible extent of search and rescue services from the resources available to us. We hope that a full-time service can be reinstated as quickly as possible by recruiting people from the Defence Forces and individuals who have already served in this area.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
      <P>Can the Minister tell the House what triggered the present dispute or difference of opinion? Does he feel that the original cause of this problem warrants the discommoding of the entire rescue service in the north-west? Is he conscious of the serious damage that could accrue? Does the Minister suggest to the House that further personnel are being trained to fill the void arising from this dispute? Can he assure the House that the same problems will not apply when this group of personnel has been trained? The original root cause of the dispute existed at the beginning and has not been resolved. The Minister has not indicated that it has been resolved, but can he tell us how he will help to resolve it?</P>

      <P>The answer to the Deputy's first question is &ldquo;Yes&rdquo;&ndash; we are training new people in the Defence Forces to take over winch and rear crew activities. Nobody can give a guarantee for the future, but I am concerned about what has happened. My Department has deployed resources to fund search and rescue services. The Air Corps has demonstrated its determination to maintain the services. The cost of the S61 over a three-year span exceeds &euro;16 million. Other facilities, such as accommodation and rest areas, have been provided to ensure that the personnel involved in this service have the best possible provisions. The safety issues, some of which were raised, have been substantially addressed. Everything possible is being done to ensure that nothing like this ever occurs again.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I dealt in the previous question with the service aspects of the provision by the Air Corps of search and rescue services from Sligo Airport. I will address the specific issues raised by Deputy Sherlock. I assure him there is no question of a conflict or dispute between the winch crews and the Air Corps management. The <Col N="539" /> pay claim that had been lodged by PDFORRA on behalf of the personnel was being processed under the agreed conciliation and arbitration scheme. The claim was withdrawn by the association in early September, however, and it is not pressing any other issue or claim on behalf of the personnel.</P>
      <P>Media reports have referred to the safety aspects of the provision of the service and the concerns expressed earlier this year by the crewmen in respect of some equipment. These matters have been substantively addressed. Additional checks were implemented to ensure that standing procedures for servicing date-expired equipment are fully complied with. The Deputy is aware that PDFORRA, the representative body for the winch men and winch operators, has publicly acknowledged that the concerns have been addressed and that there are no outstanding search and rescue service safety issues. There has been an unusually high incidence of sick leave among the winch men and winch operators since late September. As service continuity could not be guaranteed with the existing winch men and winch operators, the general officer commanding the Air Corps posted 13 of the 17 personnel to other appointments elsewhere in the Air Corps.</P>
      <P>The military authorities have been to the fore in addressing workplace bullying and harassment. A wide range of measures has been put in place to deal with this issue in the Defence Forces. Although there have been general references to bullying and harassment in the Air Corps, mainly in the media, specific allegations have not been made. Given the confidential nature of the Defence Forces anti-bullying services, I am not in a position to comment on individual cases. I have been assured by the military authorities, however, that allegations will be fully investigated in accordance with the arrangements. In this regard, I remind the Deputy that bullying can be defined as offensive, abusive, intimidating, malicious or insulting behaviour, or abuse of power conducted by an individual or group against others and which is generally persistent, systematic and ongoing. Harassment can be defined as any act or conduct including spoken words, gestures, the production, display or circulation of written words, pictures or other material which is unwelcome and which could reasonably be regarded as offensive, humiliating or intimidating.</P>
      <P>
        <i>Additional Information.</i>I am satisfied that the action taken by the military authorities in addressing the safety and health concerns of the search and rescue crews was in the best interests of the personnel concerned at all times. It did not fall within the scope of the definitions that have been cited.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wish to point out that the taking of any form of industrial action is irreconcilable with military service. I am satisfied that the mechanisms available to the representative associations through the Defence Forces conciliation and arbitration <Col N="540" /> scheme and the agreed arrangements provide a framework within which issues of concern can be addressed. No such issues remain outstanding in respect of the winch crews. If members of the Defence Forces were engaging in behaviour that could be regarded as industrial action, there would be very significant implications for the individuals, the representative association and representation in the Defence Forces.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeSherlock" hpid="Mr. Sherlock Mr. Sherlock">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherlock</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister agree that lives may be at risk as a result of the absence of full emergency cover in the north west? Does he agree that the safety of personnel should be an absolute priority?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>The safety of personnel in the Air Corps and in the search and rescue services provided by the Air Corps is obviously of paramount importance to me, in the first instance. The Government has not failed to provide financial resources to ensure that the best arrangements are put in place. The safety of persons who are at risk and may require search and rescue services is of paramount importance to all of us. I hoped to add substantially to the very comprehensive service that is available by providing a full 24-hour service from Sligo. I expected that the service would operate from November but, as I indicated to Deputy Durkan, I have been disappointed in that regard. Arrangements are being made to ensure that services in the periphery of the region are available if emergencies arise. Other services that are available include air ambulance services, island relief services, disaster relief services and resupply missions in maritime emergencies. The RNLI provides an excellent service up to 50 miles out to sea. The search and rescue service provided by the Air Corps is not the only rescue service that is available. A number of winch men and rear crew men are prepared to continue to operate the service. The commitment of the pilots and the others involved means that extraordinary demands can be met on limited occasions. We are doing as much as we can, but we did not foresee this problem. We could not be expected to replace all the men at such short notice.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeSherlock" hpid="Mr. Sherlock Mr. Sherlock">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherlock</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I have made no derogatory remarks and I have cast no aspersions on anybody. I have no idea what the Deputy is referring to. The relationship between the Minister for Defence, PDFORRA and RACO is being expressed in many different ways with the co-operation that is taking place at the present time in the Defence Forces. There is no issue at the moment. PDFORRA has brought no issues before me in respect of these matters. I am vulnerable and I make mistakes from time to time. I <Col N="541" /> cannot account for all of that. I am sure I am just as human as everybody else.</P>

      <Quest>if he is committed to the reopening and full upgrading of a facility (details supplied); if this is a permanent closure by stealth of the Castlebar Military Barracks facility; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>The main use of Castlebar Barracks in previous years was for the annual summer training camps for members of the Reserve Defence Force. This year, because of health and safety factors, it was not possible to hold the summer camps in Castlebar, and the necessary arrangements were made to facilitate personnel at Columb barracks, Mullingar, where accommodation and training facilities are of the highest standards.</P>
      <P>The cost of providing temporary facilities at Castlebar barracks for summer camps and the question of upgrading the present permanent accommodation and kitchen facilities at the barracks to ensure compliance with building, health and safety and fire regulations raise value for money considerations. These questions are being carefully examined in my Department and no decisions have yet been made on the matter.</P>
      <P>I have no proposals at present to close any Reserve Defence Force facility. Since my appointment, I have been totally committed to developing the Reserve Defence Force into a top-class organisation. Members of the Reserve Defence Force have already seen the benefits of this process in terms of improved equipment, more training days, enhanced levels of training and better clothing. This year saw an increase of 16% in the level of gratuity payable to personnel who attended annual training. As the current reorganisation process develops, there will be additional benefits in terms of a clearer role for the Reserve Defence Force and a better overall organisational structure. The closer integration of the Reserve Defence Force with the Army will result in additional benefits.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JerryCowleyIND" hpid="Dr. Cowley Dr. Cowley">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Cowley</NameTxt>
      <P>I know the Minister is a very sincere man and I believed everything he said when he made statements on this matter before. However, I am just a bit troubled by his statement that there is no commitment &ldquo;at present&rdquo; to close the facility. The matter is being looked at from a value-for-money perspective. In a previous reply in respect of the hiring of temporary accommodation in Castlebar in the absence the facility, the Minister stated, &ldquo;It will also be appreciated that a value for money issue arises for consideration.&rdquo; It is certainly true that the summer camps were held in Roscommon.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am very concerned about the Minister's statement regarding value for money, especially given that he is on record as having stated the import<Col N="542" /> ance of preserving the facility in Castlebar. It is the headquarters of the FCA in Mayo and there is a great need for it. Will the Minister clarify his statement that there is no proposal at present to close the facility and that the value for money issue arises? Is it possible that he will close the facility by stealth?</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>One of the nicest things we can have in this House is trust of one another. Everything we have done for the Reserve Defence Force since I became Minister has been extremely positive. I listed the benefits in terms of improved equipment, more training days, the increase in the gratuity, the move towards integration and the opportunity to join the UN.</P>
      <P>With regard to the Deputy's reserve regarding my use of the phrase &ldquo;at present&rdquo;, we are now assessing the cost of pairing, reconstructing and improving the headquarters at Castlebar. We have received quite extraordinary estimates for this, amounting to a total of &euro;6.5 million. When one takes into account that we use the barracks only for the Reserve Defence Force and for short enough periods, I could not, in all honesty, justify that kind of expenditure. However, I will certainly consider an intermediate measure.</P>
      <P>I am very much in favour of the geographical layout of the barracks. I am very conscious of Mayo and the outlying counties and I will not allow any facility to be closed that I regard as required in the future. I regard Castlebar barracks as having a very definite future. Given the competition for resources in my Department, the needs I have to meet and the competition for funding between Departments, I do not have the necessary funding just now to meet all these commitments.</P>

      <P>There are three blocks in two sections and the power is turned off in four out of six blocks, meaning that there is no light and heat. Will the Minister commit himself to turning on the power again? Without it, the facility cannot function. It is being used by the eighteenth battalion. There can never be any summer camps if the facility is not in operation.</P>
      <P>Does the Minister not agree that the FCA has provided extremely good value for money? Does he not agree that the power should be turned on immediately?</P>

An issue of health and safety has been raised in connection with the wiring of the barracks and I am in no position to give direction to have power turned on in the face of that health and safety requirement. What I have to do, as quickly as I can, is try to find the resources to meet the rewiring requirements so it can be turned on. Deputy Cowley, as a medical practitioner as distinct from a politician, will <Col N="543" /> understand that when a health and safety issue is raised, not by me or him but by those who use the facility, I have no option but to adopt my current approach.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy is aware, the main day-to-day role of the Naval Service, as a component of the Defence Forces, is to provide a fishery protection service in accordance with the State's obligations as a member of the European Union.</P>
      <P>As part of the modernisation process in December 2000, I authorised a new organisation for the Naval Service which saw an increase in personnel numbers from the 959 serving at that time to 1,144. Given the specialist nature of many of the additional positions it was not possible to fill them until such time as personnel had completed the necessary training. It was always accepted that it would take some years for all appointments to be filled by suitably qualified people.</P>
      <P>I am aware of the particular difficulties regarding the deployment of ships' engineering staff, especially engine room artificers and electrical artificers. The position regarding engine room artificers is that the number of such appointments in the Naval Service was increased from 76 to 85 following the reorganisation of the Naval Service. A total of 70 engine room artificers are serving at present and a further eight will complete their naval training later this year.</P>
      <P>Circumstances will continue to improve as significant numbers of trainee engine room artificers complete their training and come on stream over the next four years. In addition to the eight who are to complete training next year, a further 29 apprentices/trainee technicians are currently at various stages in the training process. They will all come on stream over the next four years and will meet the current shortfall and replace any further wastage that may occur.</P>
      <P>The position regarding electrical artificers is that the number of such appointments in the Naval Service was increased from 42 to 48 following the reorganisation of the service. A total of 42 are serving at present, and a further 18 are at various stages of the training process and will come on stream in the coming years.</P>
      <P>The reorganisation of the Naval Service was designed to ensure that when fully implemented all personnel would spend alternate periods of two years in a shore-based appointment followed by a ship-based appointment. Two years in a ship-based appointment does not imply that people spend two years at sea.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While the increase in the number of appointments for both engine room artificers and electri<Col N="544" /> cal artificers may have created some short-term difficulties, I am assured by the military authorities that the arrangements in place to provide suitably trained and qualified personnel will result in an early improvement in circumstances.</P>
    <P>The Naval Service has succeeded in increasing its operational deployment output by over 30% since 2000. On the basis of its deployment to date and the planned days for the remainder of this year, it is forecast that it will achieve 98.5% of its target in 2003. In the Naval Service value for money implementation plan, the Naval Service committed to achieving 95% of the target. The 5% margin is designed to facilitate events which militate against achieving the full target, such as mechanical failure, temporary specialist shortages and other unforeseen occurrences.</P>
    <P>In addition to fulfilling its main day-to-day role of providing a fishery protection service, the Naval Service also provided support to Enterprise Ireland events in China and the southern states of America. No Naval Service vessel is tied up as a result of a shortage of personnel.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan" hpid="Mr. Durkan Mr. Durkan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
      <P>If what the Minister says is true, why are all the services required and envisaged under Ireland's obligations to the European Union in terms of fisheries protection not being observed? Will the Minister state why personnel are expected to serve more than the normal period at sea? Will he confirm that the two-weeks-on, two-weeks-off rota that usually applies is not being observed because it cannot be? Furthermore, will he indicate if it was wise to proceed with the service until such time that he had put in place the necessary backup and training procedures to ensure adequate staffing for the foreseeable future?</P>

      <P>As Deputy Durkan knows, the capacity and will of the Government to support a navy is without any parallel in history. The Naval Service was waiting for a new ship for 14 years and we purchased the <i>LE Niamh</i> and <i>LE Róisín</i> at a cost of &euro;45 million. The Deputy will note from my reply the increases in personnel and the training that is taking place to make sure we meet the reorganisational requirements that were set out.</P>
      <P>In addition to meeting its fishery commitments, performing a drug interdiction role and carrying out other work, the Naval Service was able to support Enterprise Ireland in China and southern America, while also increasing its output in fishery protection and day-to-day activities by 30%. This has been achieved without any complaints to me by PDFORRA. The Naval Service should be complimented on this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While difficulties in meeting technical requirements have occurred in certain areas, each of these, as I stated, has been addressed systematically by training new appointees to meet them to the fullest possible extent. The Naval Service should be complimented on its ongoing reorganisation and general activities. There is, however, <Col N="545" /> no room for complacency and we are not taking anything for granted. The Naval Service deserves thanks for increasing its output by 30%, undertaking work on behalf of Enterprise Ireland and extending its remit in many areas. The evidence is before the Deputy.</P>

      <Quest>if he will report on the status of Defence Forces commitments to UNSAS, the rapid reaction force and NATO's Partnership for Peace, respectively; and if and the way in which such commitments continue to be in compliance with the stated Government policies of military neutrality and UN primacy.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>Ireland's commitment to collective security is pursued through the United Nations which has the primary role to play in the maintenance of international peace and security. Ireland has a long record of participation in UN and international peacekeeping, monitoring and observer missions and it is the Government's intention that the Defence Forces will continue with involvement in appropriate international missions of this nature.</P>
      <P>In October 1998 Ireland signed a memorandum of understanding with the United Nations on the UN standby arrangements system, UNSAS. Through UNSAS, Ireland offered to provide up to 850 military personnel for overseas service at any one time to meet peace support and humanitarian commitments under UN or NATO led missions. A similar commitment was made in a European Union context in 2000. The figure of 850 equates to some 10% of the Army and is not an inconsiderable commitment in this regard.</P>
      <P>Ireland's commitment under UNSAS does not entail an obligation to participate in any particular mission. Requests for Defence Forces personnel to serve on overseas missions are considered on a case-by-case basis in the prevailing circumstances within the context of UNSAS. Any decision to dispatch a contingent of 12 or more members of the Defence Forces to a specific mission must have a UN mandate, a Government decision and Dáil approval.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Irish troops are participating in 19 missions, with 365 personnel serving overseas. If approved by Dáil Éireann, approximately 430 further personnel will be deployed for service with the United Nations Mission in Liberia, UNMIL. The proposed Irish contingent will comprise a motorised infantry battalion of some 430 personnel and the deployment of a small number of personnel at force headquarters and military observers. It is also proposed to deploy personnel from the Army Ranger wing for a three month period at the request of the United Nations. This would <Col N="547" /> bring our overall contribution to peace support operations to about 800 personnel, Ireland's highest level of participation in peace support operations since our withdrawal from UNIFIL in 2001.</P>
    <P>The decision to participate in UNSAS is a tangible expression of Ireland's continuing commitment to involvement in peacekeeping operations. This participation includes the ongoing NATO led, UN authorised SFOR and KFOR operations in Bosnia-Herzegovina and Kosovo, respectively. In addition, five staff officers were appointed to the headquarters in Paris and Entebbe during the recently concluded UN mandated, EU led operation in the Democratic Republic of Congo.</P>
    <P>National sovereignty is a fundamental underlying principle of participation in any specific operation which is decided on a case-by-case basis. There are no implications for Irish neutrality in service by members of the Defence Forces with UN mandated or authorised humanitarian or crisis management operations. Ireland continues to recognise the centrality of the United Nations, including the primary role of the UN Security Council, in matters of peace and security. Participation in an overseas operation requires UN endorsement, a specific Government decision and, where the level of participation is to exceed 12, the approval of Dáil Éireann. Our commitment of 850 troops to UNSAS is the same commitment as might be deployed on EU or NATO led, UN authorised operations.</P>

      <NameTxt>Aengus Ó Snodaigh</NameTxt>
      <P>The context of my question was a joint policy paper on the Defence Forces and UN peacekeeping operations prepared by the Departments of Defence and Foreign Affairs and presented to the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs on 14 October. On the issue of UN primacy, does the Minister envisage that amendments to the Defence Acts will be required as a result of Ireland's commitments to the European Union's rapid reaction force or NATO's Partnership for Peace in the lifetime of this Dáil?</P>
      <P>The reason I ask this question is that according to the policy paper there is a discrepancy between the definition of an international United Nations force in the Defence (Amendment) Act 1993 and the interpretation of that term provided by the Department of Defence in its policy and White Paper. Given the extent of this discrepancy, one could argue that the Department's interpretation extends well beyond that provided for in law.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Defence (Amendment) Act 1993 defines an international United Nations force as an international force or body established by the Security Council or General Assembly of the United Nations, whereas the policy paper extends the definition to missions under UN mandate, including regional security missions authorised by the United Nations. By definition, therefore, the two types of mission are not identical or interchangeable. Thus, it appears the Government is stretch<Col N="548" /> ing its policy. Does the Minister plan to address this discrepancy by tabling amendments to the Defence Acts?</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>There are no proposals to amend the Defence Acts, nor is the Government considering such amendments. It will be clear from the debate we had on the Nice treaty that the general public, by and large, accepts and endorses the consistent approach of the Government in these matters through enforcing the triple lock mechanism. We have never deviated from this approach. In the case of FYROM, where the circumstances to which the Deputy refers arose, that is, it was not a UN mandated mission but an authorised UN mission, we could not participate due to the Defence Acts.</P>

      <NameTxt>Aengus Ó Snodaigh</NameTxt>
      <P>In its definition of international United Nations force the document produced by the Minister's Department refers to UN mandates, including regional security missions authorised by the United Nations. There is a discrepancy in the Defence Acts and the Minister will be open to accusations in the future that he is operating outside the law if it is not dealt with.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">

      <P>The White Paper on Defence of February 2000 sets out a figure of 10,500 personnel for the Permanent Defence Force, comprising 930 for the Air Corps, 1,144 for the Naval Service and 8,426 for the Army. The strength of the Army, the Air Corps and the Naval Service and the number of female personnel by rank within these services, as advised by the military authorities, is provided in the following table. The figures provided are as at 30 September 2003 in respect of the Army, the Air Corps and the Naval Service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In previous years the trend for general service recruitment has been that 9% of all applicants have been female and that on average 9% of enlistments have been female. It is obviously not possible to predict what the relevant percentages will be in any future intake of recruits but there is no reason to assume that this pattern will change to a great degree. A total of 15.4% of <Col N="549" /> applicants for the 2003 cadetship competition were female while 15.5% of successful candidates were female.</P>
    <P>Women are eligible for service in the Army, the Air Corps, the Naval Service and the Reserve Defence Force, and compete for all appointments on an equal basis and under the same general conditions as those which apply to men. All <Col N="550" /> female personnel undergo the same training and receive the same military education as their male counterparts. To encourage increased participation by women in the Defence Forces, I decided in March 1998 to reduce the height requirement for all female recruits to 5'4" and this height requirement now also applies to male recruits.</P>

      <P>The Minister mentioned 10,000 personnel. Is it correct that only 460 of that number are female personnel and that the percentage of female personnel has not increased in recent years? How many females were recruited in the recent recruitment campaign?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>The percentage is about 9%. The exact number is in the table. The overall number is about 20 more than the figure mentioned by the Deputy. It is approximately 480 out of 10,500. One can look at this in two ways. It is only 12 years since there was no recruitment of females to the Defence Forces. That has changed and we try to encourage, in every way, further participation by women, who have made a significant contribution to the Defence Forces. There is a significant number of female commissioned and non-commissioned officers in the Defence Forces. I have met and worked with them and will continue to encourage their further participation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeSherlock" hpid="Mr. Sherlock Mr. Sherlock">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherlock</NameTxt>
      <P>Has the Minister plans for a recruitment campaign aimed specifically at recruiting females to the Defence Forces?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not possible to do that under the equality legislation. I tried to do it when I provided that the height requirement for female participation in the Defence Forces should be lower than for males. I made that change only to discover that I was in breach of equality legislation so I had to provide for the same height requirement for male participants. This indicates the difficulty with taking the road suggested by the Deputy. However, we are anxious to encourage greater female participation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeSherlock" hpid="Mr. Sherlock Mr. Sherlock">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherlock</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister disappointed with the number of female personnel in the Defence Forces?</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>We have been fortunate in recent years to have constant recruitment so we have succeeded in having dedicated and committed people applying to join the Defence Forces. With regard to their level of education, commitment and so forth, we could not ask for more. Naturally, I would like to see greater participation, although not necessarily a reduction in the number of males that might apply. We are anxious to enhance participation. The level of participation has not increased in recent years but has levelled out. Does the Deputy have a special interest in the matter?</P>

      <P>Is the total number of personnel in the Defence Forces adequate, in light of the Minister's reply to Question No. 122 and the fact that there appears to be an insufficiency of staff in some areas? Is there an adequate number of personnel in the Defence Forces to meet all and likely requirements or is the Minister just floundering at sea?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot understand why Deputy Durkan and I cannot agree a little more. The White Paper on Defence sets out a programme for the development of the Defence Forces over the next ten years. One of the objectives of that programme was to get rid of the stop-go position on recruitment which the Defence Forces had experienced over the years. For years before I was appointed Minister there was no recruitment, with bottlenecks developing for promotions and in other areas. We moved from that position and established a set pattern. It is true that in some cases one would like to have more but I must compete&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan" hpid="Mr. Durkan Mr. Durkan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I try to live in the real world. We have tried to develop not only the personnel and inter-personnel relations side but also the equipment side. The Deputy will be most embarrassed when he reads of his party's record when it is set against that of the Government with regard to the equipment provided for the Defence Forces since it took office.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>In July 2001, the Government approved the drafting of an Ombudsman (Defence Forces) Bill, along the lines of a general scheme of a Bill presented to Government. In January 2002, the draft text of the Bill was submitted to Government and was approved for publication and circulated to Deputies. Unfortunately, due to pressing time constraints, the Bill did not proceed prior to the end of the last Dáil session. However, it is my intention that the Bill will be enacted before the end of the year and an appointment made to the new office of ombudsman for the Defence Forces as soon as practical thereafter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeSherlock" hpid="Mr. Sherlock Mr. Sherlock">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherlock</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy need have no fears. Once the Bill is passed and the subsequent appointment is made, arrangements will be put in place for that office to operate efficiently and to provide the type of structure that will add to the complaint procedures which already exist.</P>
    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>The truth is that I am a little disappointed. I moved ahead with the preparation of this legislation but there is huge competition to bring Bills to the House and a great deal of urgent work had to be done. I would prefer to answer the Deputy differently and that the Bill was already enacted with approval secured for the personnel involved to manage that office. However, I hope that by the next Question Time on defence, these issues will have been dealt with.</P>

      <P>The whole idea of establishing an ombudsman for the Defence Forces was that such an office would be independent of the military and the civilian side of the Department. Needless to say, we want a normal complaints procedure so that not everything that happens will be referred to the ombudsman and I think the Deputy would support that point. I cannot provide an estimate of the cost but the office will not be very large. For the time being, I would hope to manage things in the Defence Forces between the military and civilian sectors and <Col N="553" /> myself, as Minister, in such a way as to reduce grievance procedures. We are succeeding in doing so, although there is always a need to improve interpersonal relationships and the way things are managed, while taking account of people's difficulties. The task force and the report by Dr. Doyle on harassment and bullying have contributed to widening the scope of how we understand people's grievances and, therefore, we will not have to go down this road all the time.</P>

      <P>The Naval Service has succeeded in increasing its operational deployment output by over 30% since 2000. This deployment included the extended trade missions by Naval Service vessels to Asia in 2002 and to the United States of America earlier this year. On the basis of its operational deployment to date and the planned deployment for the remainder of this year, it is forecast that the Naval Service will achieve 98.5% of its target in 2003. In its value for money implementation plan, the Naval Service is committed to achieving 95% of the target.</P>
      <P>I have already answered this question fully, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle. I am quite happy to do so again but it was taken in response to an earlier question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan" hpid="Mr. Durkan Mr. Durkan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is getting complicated now because the Minister's previous answers are coming back to haunt him.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not mind. I am quite happy to continue and since that is what the Deputy wants, that is what I will do.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The 5% margin is designed to facilitate events which militate against achieving the full target, such as mechanical failure, temporary specialist shortages and other unforeseen occurrences. No Naval Service vessel is tied up as a result of a shortage of personnel. Where planned patrol effort has been affected in the past by unforeseen events, including temporary specialist shortages, the Naval Service has very successfully managed to minimise the consequences of such events. In addition, the Naval Service has undertaken a range of measures to address particular areas such as general recruitment, direct entry schemes, <Col N="554" /> development of training resources and review of training programmes.</P>
    <P>The main day-to-day role of the Naval Service, as a component of the Defence Forces, is to provide a fishery protection service in accordance with the State's obligations as a member of the European Union.</P>
    <P>As part of the modernisation process, in December 2000 I authorised a new organisation for the Naval Service which saw an increase in personnel numbers from 959 serving at that time to a new establishment of 1,144. Given the specialist nature of many of the additional positions, it was not possible to fill them until such time as personnel had completed the necessary training. It was always accepted that it would take a number of years for all the appointments to be filled by suitably qualified people.</P>
    <P>I am aware of the particular difficulties regarding the deployment of ships' engineering staff, especially engine-room artificers and electrical artificers. The position with engine-room artificers is that the number of such appointments in the Naval Service was increased from 76 to 85 following the reorganisation of the service.</P>
    <P>A total of 70 engine-room artificers are serving at present and a further eight will complete their naval training later this year. The situation will continue to improve as significant numbers of trainee engine-room artificers complete their training and come on stream over the next four years. In addition to the eight I have already mentioned, a further 29 apprentices-trainee technicians are currently at various stages in the training process. They will all come on stream over the next four years and will meet both the current shortfall and replace any further wastage that may occur.</P>
    <P>The position with electrical artificers is that the number of such appointments in the Naval Service was increased from 42 to 48 following the reorganisation of the service. A total of 42 are serving at present. A further 18 are at various stages in the training process and will come on stream in the coming years.</P>
    <P>The reorganisation of the Naval Service was designed to ensure that when fully implemented, all personnel would spend alternate periods of two years in a shore-based appointment followed by two years in a ship-based appointment. In this regard, two years in a ship-based appointment does not imply that people spend two years at sea.</P>
    <P>While the increased number of specialist appointments for both engine-room artificers and electrical artificers could not all be filled instantly, thus creating some transitional short-term difficulties, I am assured by the military authorities that the arrangements in place to provide suitably trained and qualified personnel will see an early improvement in the situation.</P>

      <P>It made good sense to purchase these ships, which are very necessary. They have enhanced the capacity of the Naval Service to an extraordinary degree. The military authorities have assured me that no ship has been tied up due to personnel shortages. As I indicated to Deputy Durkan earlier, the recorded output from the Naval Service in the past couple of years has gone up by 30% &ndash; one third of increased activity. The service deserves to be complimented on that. I will be visiting Haulbowline in the next week or so to announce more major capital investment, thus enabling the naval base to do whatever is necessary.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>As usual, Deputy Stanton has put his finger on a difficulty that is definitely there. The only way it can be addressed is by speeding up training programmes and the direct entry effort. In answering the question, I outlined the numbers of people who are coming on stream. When we reorganised the Naval Service, <Col N="556" /> numbers were increased in a number of areas. At the time, I said it would take a couple of years to fill the positions and that is happening. I accept that there is a certain amount of stress and that we would not have obtained the 30% increase in output and the industrial expeditions without that. I want to help them to remedy the situation as quickly as I can. However, it is false and wrong of Deputy Durkan to say that ships are being tied up, because the Naval Service has told me that is not true.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan" hpid="Mr. Durkan Mr. Durkan">

      <P>Two meetings of EU Defence Ministers will be held during Ireland's Presidency of the European Union. The first meeting will take place in Brussels on 5 and 6 April 2004 while the second will be held in the framework of the General Affairs and External Relations Council on 17 and 18 May 2004. Similar meetings between Defence Ministers have taken place over the course of previous Presidencies. As I have reported to the House following my attendance at those meetings, they have been a useful forum for Ministers to exchange views on the continued development of the European security and defence policy.</P>
      <P>In chairing the aforementioned meetings I will be conscious of the highly significant event that will be marked during our Presidency when the European Union will complete the process of enlargement to 25 member states on 1 May 2004. While the ten accession states have been attending recent Defence Ministers meetings, I will be anxious to ensure these countries are suitably assimilated into our ongoing dialogue. In this regard I expect a significant feature of the meetings, which I will chair, will relate to the contributions that the accession states can make to the European Union's efforts to develop its capabilities to carry out humanitarian, peacekeeping and crisis management operations, that is, the Petersberg tasks.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="557" />Deputies will be aware of the significant progress that has already been made since the headline goal was agreed at Helsinki in 1999. In this regard, the conclusions of the Thessaloníki European Council held in June 2003 included a statement that the European Union had operational capability across the full range of Petersberg tasks, limited and constrained by recognised shortfalls. I will be anxious to continue the work of the Italian Presidency in ensuring a pragmatic approach to addressing these shortfalls is maintained.</P>
    <P>I am also conscious of the opportunity which the Presidency brings in terms of increasing public awareness of the European Union and the positive contribution Ireland makes to the development of the Union. In particular, we will have the opportunity to increase appreciation of the contribution which the Union has made towards improving peace and stability, particularly in the Balkans, and will continue to play in preventing conflict in support of the United Nations in areas of the world where there are tensions and instability.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>That is an extraordinary question. We have been a member of the European Union for more than 30 years. We are a military neutral country and have been joined by Finland, Austria and Sweden. Our military neutrality has not been compromised and NATO countries have not tried to force us into a position where we could not keep our laws or respect for the Constitution. We have been good partners and gained immeasurably from accession to the European Union. Our trade has expanded enormously while employment levels have increased dramatically. We have not compromised our fundamental principles.</P>

He can rest assured that we will not be placed under any pressure on this issue. The European Union members know and understand our stance. However, this has not prevented us from providing troops for peacekeeping missions on four continents. We are now preparing to go to Liberia. We are the only European partner going there. We are proud of what the Defence Forces do in all of these areas. We have learned from that partnership and have received <Col N="558" /> a lot of co-operation. Such co-operation is necessary between the various contingents which serve our country in trouble and war torn places because of the type of armaments used and the difficulties they can experience.</P>

      <P>As the Deputy knows, a decision has not been taken on that issue. The Government's stance is clear. Humanitarian missions, peacekeeping and crisis management, that is, the Petersberg tasks, will engage the type of resources we have to the limit. The difference between informal and formal meetings is that the formal meetings take place in the External Relations and General Affairs Council with Foreign Affairs Ministers, while informal meetings take place only with Defence Ministers.</P>

      <P>The Taoiseach said in this House on 2 July 1996 that the time for rhetoric, slick sound bites and empty promises was past. He said it was time for action and for us to set out in a reflective and calculated way what we intended to do about organised crime. He said the time for reviews, reports and surveys was over; that it was time for considered action. He and his Government have been in office for six and a half of the seven years since those words were uttered. He has had the time and resources to follow them through.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The rule of law seems to have been abdicated and the rule of criminal gangs is worse than ever. We are now told that 30 warring gangs rule Dublin city and that the cost of a life or death is &euro;5,000. We see trials collapsing because of the intimidation of witnesses and young men being brutally murdered as a warning to others. The Garda Commissioner in his recent attendance at the Joint Committee on Justice, Equality, <Col N="560" /> Defence and Women's Rights said the force had not been given adequate resources to tackle organised crime. The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform has failed in his duty to properly administer justice. His predecessor failed to deliver on his commitment to zero tolerance.</P>
    <P>The Government, under the Taoiseach's direction, has been an abject failure in the administration of the oldest reason Government was formed, namely, the administration of justice. Will the Taoiseach take personal responsibility and show leadership in dealing with this direct challenge to him, his Government and the State? Organised crime must not rule this country. The Taoiseach must show personal responsibility and ensure the resources required by the Garda Síochána are made available to it to protect our citizens and administer justice.</P>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Crime is an enormous issue as reflected in the resources dedicated to tackling it in terms of manpower, technology, prison construction and infrastructural facilities. There have been major reductions in levels of crime in recent years, including this year. However, there are still criminal gangs operating in our society, engaging mainly in drug-related activities. The Government is conscious of this and has enforced some of the toughest laws ever, to the extent that those involved in civil liberties groups have been dubious about them. In spite of this, in the area of criminal law, among others, we continue to put laws on the Statute Book and provide the necessary resources to implement them.</P>
      <P>For a number of months we have been putting in place manned Garda resources to deal with crime in parts of this city, the names of which there is no need to mention. Our efforts in Limerick city have received a huge amount of media attention. I sympathise with the family of Mr. Eric Leamy because of the difficulty in which they find themselves. I cannot talk about the issues involved in great detail but the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform will deal with them later today.</P>
      <P>The Government discussed this matter at length today, as it has many times. We are not prepared to tolerate gangs, drug barons and other criminals. Since 1997 the Government has been tough in dealing with this issue. There is no need for me to give a litany of the extra resources, including policing resources, provided but we spent almost &euro;1 billion. We will continue to be tough on crime. Some are trying to put it up to the Government and the people. We must and will take action against this.</P>

      <P>On 12 November 1996 the Taoiseach commented in this House: &ldquo;Confidence in the administration of justice is therefore equivalent to confidence in Government.&rdquo;  Does he believe the people of the country over which he presides have confidence in the way his Government administers justice? Does he believe the <Col N="561" /> Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform is a success? Is he not the Taoiseach who, with the Progressive Democrats, promised 2,000 extra gardaí on the streets? Do we not hear gardaí, from the Commissioner down, say every day they need extra resources to carry out the investigative work required to bring criminal gangs before the courts of the land? Were we not promised that administration of justice would be fundamental to the kind of Government the Taoiseach would run?</P>
      <P>Last year saw the country's highest ever number of homicides. There were 13 gangland killings in the first half of this year. We can talk all we want about the resources being deployed &ndash; for six years we have been flinging money at problems but the action our citizens need is not being taken. People need to know that when they close their doors at night, they are safe. Gardaí themselves tell us they are not being given the resources they need. The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform talks about all the laws he is introducing but they are not being effective. There are people in inner-city Dublin and parts of Limerick who are terrorised by organised crime on the streets. The Taoiseach must take personal responsibility for ensuring his Government pushes back the wave of crime about which he spoke in November 1996.</P>

      <P>The figures reflect this. We stated at the time that perpetrators would be brought to justice by the Garda, their cases would be dealt with expeditiously by the courts and there would be enough prison spaces to ensure their sentences were served. We set about bringing Garda numbers to a record high level and building the prisons that were not in place. We dealt with the revolving door syndrome.

      <P>How can the Taoiseach reconcile his last statement about focusing on resources and sitting on serious criminals with the statement of Garda Paul Browne in October's edition of <i>Garda Review: </i>&ldquo;There are days in Limerick city when there are no members available to go out on the beat&rdquo;? I am quite happy for the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to brief the Taoiseach if he wants to.</P>

      <P>Absolutely but it is a little late. Can the Taoiseach take issue with any single statistic mentioned by Deputy Kenny? Is this not <Col N="563" /> a shameful legacy from the era of zero tolerance instigated by the previous Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform?</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>Is everything Deputy Kenny said not true?  Is this not a policing problem rather than a need for more laws? The problem is that existing laws are not being enforced. An Agreed Programme for Government, published in June 2002, states the Government stands for a society in which &ldquo;people can feel safe in their communities, business and homes&rdquo;. The Taoiseach said Fianna Fáil in government would commit even more resources to tackling crime and breaking up the gangs involved in serious crime. They are multiplying by the day. According to a television programme last night, there are 40 gangs operating in this city alone. Is it not time to demonstrate political determination and leadership and take on the gangs which are controlling communities and forcing law-abiding citizens to live under their rule? What happened to the commitment the Government made to recruit 2,000 additional gardaí? A net amount of 51 gardaí have been recruited since June 2002. What kind of response is this to the problems outlined here?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish it was as easy as that. Deputy Rabbitte says policing is the issue. For the case that sparked these questions in Limerick the Garda has put together an excellent prosecution case. It did a fine job, on which I congratulate it. The problem in this case was interference with witnesses. Let us not forget this. The article quoted by the Deputy, which the Minister has pointed out to me, goes on to state that so many resources were moved into this area in Limerick there were fewer resources available for law-abiding areas. The same has happened in this city.</P>
    </Speaker>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy asked about the extra gardaí. We have recruited 1,100 or 1,200 extra gardaí into the force and we have to pay for them every year. That is why almost &euro;1 billion is spent on justice. We provided for over 1,000 extra prison places. We have brought in additional laws and we have to continue to do that. We cannot stop reviewing, reforming and examining the issues. If it is a question of laws, resources and the dedication of the gardaí, we will continue to do that. Over the past few years we have taken many of the criminals on our streets out of circulation. Many of them are in jail serving long sentences but a new breed is coming up, many of whom are very young, and we now have to deal with those issues. We are doing that and the taxpayer is putting in almost &euro;1 billion a year to deal <Col N="564" /> with it. We have to do that in a way that deals with a new type of young criminal who is vicious and extraordinarily ruthless. Some of them are quite close to subversives in this country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>Sometimes when I hear the Taoiseach answering I do not know whether we live in the same country. I did not make a comment on how the book of evidence was compiled or the reason the Director of Public Prosecutions felt unable to give the direction other than the one he gave.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">

    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>I am talking about policing and the Taoiseach pledged 2,000 additional gardaí, but there are 51 additional gardaí. What is the purpose of the State if it is not for security, both external and internal? There are many areas of our cities under the reign of young thugs who are being directed by new criminal gangs which have been established and which are not capable of being dealt with by the gardaí because they either do not have not the manpower or the resources. This is the legacy of zero tolerance. What is the answer to the question about additional gardaí? </P>
      <P>When the tragedy occurred concerning Veronica Guerin, the Government of the day decided to make whatever legislative change and resources were necessary to deal with the break up of the gangs that dominated this city at that time. The same is required here. If we could bring in an amendment to the Offences Against the State Act in 1998, following the atrocity in Omagh, that created the crime of directing terrorist crime, why can we not create a similar offence in terms of those who direct criminal conspiracies and combinations? That is the kind of measure that is necessary to deal with this problem. It is not being dealt with and what happened yesterday is shameful in any democracy, especially one governed by a Government that claims to be putting so much emphasis on the administration of justice and enforcement of the law.</P>

I said it is not in this case because the Garda put together a good case and saturated an area, but it is dealing with very vicious people, there is no doubt about that.</P>

I brought legislation through this House in 1998 and I stated at the time that we should have tougher legislation. I argued in this House in the mid-1980s that we should have tougher criminal justice legislation but, as always happens, people from the do-gooder society believe we should not have tougher legislation. Let us have tougher legislation, more resources and more gardaí. I agree with that but people should not get weak-kneed on a tough day. I believe in being tough on crime but there were people on the opposite side of the House who stood up here and opposed the provision of extra gardaí because they wanted more rehabilitation programmes &ndash; we can name those Members.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>The courts are not in a position to call alleged murderers to account, but the High Court this morning could send six innocent residents from south Dublin to jail for three weeks and fine them very heavily. Their crime was to participate in a two hour, entirely peaceful protest against the decision of South Dublin County Council to leave uncollected the refuse bins of thousands of householders who are boycotting the bin tax. The Taoiseach might as well have worn the grey wig and banged the door of Mountjoy behind those decent taxpayers because he is responsible for those jailings.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A few months ago the Government brought in this draconian change in legislation allowing county mangers to set out on a scandalous cam<Col N="566" /> paign of blackmailing compliant taxpayers and entire communities by withdrawing a crucial service for which they have paid over a century through central and indirect taxation. The Taoiseach's gutless backbenchers did not utter a peep when this legislation was going through the House. They do not even bother to come into the Dáil any more, but it is the Taoiseach who is responsible for the system that has honest taxpayers banged up in jail within days of a peaceful protest, while years after being found out, corrupt councillors from his party, Ansbacher thieves, strut around with absolute impunity.</P>
    <P>If the Taoiseach wants to retrieve even a shred of credibility for the flawed and ailing political system over which he presides, it is in his hands to take action to defuse the current situation. Will he call off the attack on the communities of working people by instructing the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government to suspend the bin non-collection order and allow the debate on the bin tax and his local taxation policies to proceed at pace but without thousands of decent men and women being forced to use their peaceful people power in opposition to his draconian policies?</P>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I dealt with this issue previously. Nobody is in jail today for peaceful protesting. They are in breach of a court order. They defied the court.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeHiggins" hpid="Mr. J. Higgins Mr. J. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>They are in jail for peaceful protest but not for murder.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the reason they are in jail. On the wider issue, I have said previously that direct user charges for household waste collection are widely applied throughout Europe. The polluter pays principle is a requirement of the Waste Management Act. The vast bulk of householders pay the charge for waste collection and disposal. It is the law of the land. It has been passed through the democratic process and it should be respected by all citizens equally. I have no comment to make on the courts but if people do not comply with the order of the courts, the law is handed out to everybody equally.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeHiggins" hpid="Mr. J. Higgins Mr. J. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>As usual the Taoiseach completely ignored the stark double standards over which his Government presides. Is it not incredible that gardaí say they cannot muster sufficient resources and personnel to prevent the abandonment of a murder trial through naked and brutal intimidation? Working class communities wait hours, if not days, before gardaí respond to their calls but the county and city managers in Dublin can at any time muster endless numbers of gardaí to push and pull at peaceful protesters against the policy of bin non-collection. The gardaí can be freely used to brow-beat and frighten communities into giving up their opposition. Within the suburbs, incredibly, Garda stations are closing down to deal with entirely peaceful protests.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="567" />The Taoiseach's Government has turned the standards of a civilised society on its head. The innocent and compliant taxpayers, the lifelong taxpayers who are now contributory pensioners, are being hounded, harassed and jailed because the Taoiseach wants to use the courts and the paraphernalia of the State to force new taxation policies upon them, but millionaire bankers who have organised massive fraud and knife-wielding gangsters are out of reach. The Taoiseach can open the gates of Mountjoy Prison tonight for these decent residents and ensure that nobody else goes in by simply saying to the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government to instruct the county managers to suspend the non-collection of refuse and to allow the debate to continue. Will he do that in the interests of at least cutting across some of the double standards over which he presides?</P>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>

      <P>I do not object to the change in the ministerial rota. I understand the business of the Whips being informed about what happens at committees when matters are referred to them by the House has not yet been sorted out. I do not know which committee dealt with the Cartagena Protocol to the United Nations Convention on Biological Diversity. It might be appropriate that a paragraph indicating what the committee did be made available to the Whips so that we would not have to object to these matters.</P>

      <P>Although the items stand on their merits, I object to the manner in which they are being taken. The issue of the Ministers' rota for Question Time, as local an issue as one can get, is being lumped in with the question of preparation for a meeting in Malaysia next February, a global issue. Would the Dáil not be better served in recognising the separate nature of each item? By lumping the two together we demean the validity of each. I ask that they be revisited.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle An Ceann Comhairle">

      <P>I understand the two items are being taken together here but when the motions are moved, they will be decided separately. It has been agreed to take them without debate.</P>
      <P>With regard to Deputy Kenny's point, in future there will be a short report from the committee. If it recommends that the House debate the issue, it will state this. In future its view that the House should have a further debate on the issue will be listed. This should avoid the problem we have encountered in the past.</P>

      <P>Again today, a number of Deputies made requests to adjourn the Dáil under Standing Order 31 to discuss matters of interest. In view of the fact that all parties have brought forward proposals for a more effective working of the Houses of the Oireachtas, when will the Chief Whip bring forward the Government's proposals on the matter?</P>
      <P>Last year's interim report of the Flood tribunal was sent to the Director of Public Prosecutions. Has the Government received a report from the Director of Public Prosecutions regarding follow-up action which he might contemplate?</P>

      <P>The Director of Public Prosecutions does not report back to the Government.</P>
      <P>The Whips are looking at the issue of Oireachtas reform and a number of questions have arisen. A few years ago we introduced Leaders' Questions because the topical issues of the day were not being discussed. The Order of Business used to take a short time and only one question was allowed. We formalised our way of dealing with topical issues of the day. I suppose this shows what can happen.</P>

      <P>Never. It would be worth spending a minute on this because Members have forgotten was used to happen. There was an Order of Business on Tuesdays, Wednesdays and Thursdays which used to take about 15 minutes. I now regularly spend half an hour or 40 minutes on the Order of Business, which I do not mind. On Tuesdays and Wednesdays there was Question Time which, shortly before my time, was extended from one hour to one hour and a half.</P>
      <P>Because a number of Members were raising topical questions &ndash; the point Deputy Kenny has made &ndash; I agreed, in conjuction with other parties, that we would take an additional 30 minutes of Leaders' questions twice a week. We moved from having an hour and a half for questions to having Leaders' Questions for an hour, an hour and a half for parliamentary questions and God knows what for the Order of Business.</P>

When I came into this House, matters that could be considered for the Adjournment were raised by every backbencher and when the Ceann Comhairle said he could not proceed, the Deputy would ask if the matter could be considered for inclusion on the Adjournment. I do not understand this rewriting of history about the Order of Business lasting 15 minutes. There was a great deal more spontaneity and raising of current issues at the time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My colleague, Deputy Connaughton, raised the question of the landslide at Derrybrien. I do not <Col N="573" /> know what kind of landslide it would take before you, a Cheann Comhairle, would permit a debate on such an issue.</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>There is, increasingly, too little time for legislation, which is what the House is meant to be doing. Every year time is increasingly limited by giving more time to the Order of Business, Leaders' Questions, private notice questions and other special debates. We should seek ways of devoting more time to legislation, to which the Government is open. Several Ministers would be glad to be here on Fridays or earlier in the morning. It would be difficult to sit later at night because the House already sits late compared with other parliaments. We should spend more time on legislation. The Government will be happy to consider proposals to do this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have been Leader of the Opposition and a Minister in a number of Governments. When I was Leader of the Opposition, if I was not quick in getting off the blocks in the first 20 seconds of the Order of Business, I was ruled out of order <Col N="574" /> and had lost my chance to raise my issue for the entire day. It is not like that now, but that is the way it was and I complied with that.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I remember it only too well. The Deputy knows who the Chair was at that time and business moved on smartly and quickly. The position is far different now. I am not arguing about that &ndash; it does not matter &ndash; and I know it will go on after my time, but the difficulty is that we are cutting down too much on our legislation time. If the Deputy asks me what issue we should deal with, it is not jumping up and down on issues that might or might not be important, it is legislation, which is important. That is both my view and that of the Government.</P>

      <P>I thank the Taoiseach for making such a convincing argument for a five day Dáil week to provide more time for legislation and I look forward to hearing the timeframe in which it might be introduced. Perhaps the Taoiseach will elaborate on this so that we can start planning for a more productive Dáil week.</P>
      <P>As regards more effective legislative throughput, perhaps the Taoiseach will move on to the starting blocks the charities regulation Bill which has not moved forward since the Costello committee report of 1980. I think it has been passed to a third Department. I ask that it stay with the Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs and be enacted from there rather than be shifted to another Department.

      <P>Some time ago the Government voted down a Labour Party Bill requiring companies to recognise trade unions. SIPTU is currently in dispute with a company that has waste management contracts from local authorities and the company concerned refuses to recognise the union. In the context of national partnership, is it permissible for a company that holds contracts from a public authority to refuse to recognise a trade union? Is legislation required to oblige local authorities and other authorities to give contracts only to those companies that are at least willing to recognise the basic right of workers to join a trade union. It is 90 years since 1913 and, in an independent Ireland, it surely should be possible that companies would recognise trade unions.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. McDowell Mr. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. McDowell)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take all the questions together.</P>
      <P>The Irish people have established a State and a Constitution based on the rule of law and any event or series of events which challenges that Constitution or the rule of law is a challenge to each and every one of us. The Government views with the utmost gravity the challenge which recent events pose for the Irish State, for the rights of individual citizens and of entire communities, and for our system of criminal justice.</P>
      <P>On the collapsed trial in the Central Criminal Court there are clearly constraints on what any of us can say here today. First, there remains the very real likelihood of further criminal proceedings in relation to the person who has been tried and, second, other criminal proceedings may well arise for other persons arising out of those proceedings.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I know that everyone in this House, as members of a constitutional organ of State, will appreciate in these circumstances how careful we must be in making any public comment which could further damage the interests of criminal justice and the rule of law. It would, however, be equally wrong and dangerous for the democratic <Col N="580" /> Legislature and what the Constitution terms a house of public representatives to remain mute in the face of such a challenge or to exhibit a lack of appreciation of the gravity of such events. I have been in close consultation with the Garda Commissioner and the Attorney General during the past 24 hours and have briefed the Government at length on these events and their implications.</P>
    <P>At the outset it is right to repeat what Mr. Justice Carney said yesterday, namely, that he had never before encountered the likes of what had happened in that case. The criminal justice system deals successfully day in day out with a huge number of cases, including those involving what would be regarded as organised crime. It would be disproportionate because of difficulties in one particular case to suggest that the system has suddenly collapsed and that the constitutional and legal basis of that system has been discredited.</P>
    <P>Without diminishing the seriousness of those events, now is not the time for exaggerated outrage, for ill-thought-out posturing or knee-jerk reaction. Now is the time to stand by the values we cherish rather than to abandon them, belittle them or despair of them. The fundamentals of our criminal justice system, including the right to jury trial in accordance with law, are sound, but that system must be responsive to the challenges it faces. That is why, as Minister with responsibility for the criminal justice system, I announced last evening that I intended in light of recent events to review the adequacy of legislative provisions, resource allocations and administrative practice to see whether and what changes are required and to consult with all appropriate persons and organisations involved in the criminal justice system. I would of course encourage every Member of this House to participate actively in that review process.</P>
    <P>The criminal justice system had to respond previously to difficult challenges and it has done so successfully. There are many people serving lengthy sentences in prison now who once regarded themselves as untouchable and beyond the rule of law. This House responded in full measure to challenges we faced in the past. We in this House should send out a clear message today: no one is beyond the reach of the law and whatever has to be done to bring offenders to justice will be done. Just as no one is above the law, so no one is beneath it either. By that I mean that some victims of crime may have broken the law but that can never mean that they are like the outlaws of old, beyond the protection of the law or beneath the gaze of justice. The right to life is common to all in our society and the duty to vindicate and protect that right is a universal one.</P>
    <P>Gang crime poses a serious threat in this and many other jurisdictions. It gives rise to specific issues which in turn require targeted responses. Without in any way commenting on a particular court case, the situation in Limerick is further complicated by vicious feuding which quite frankly has brought about a cult of killings. It is <Col N="581" /> only right to say that the strategies adopted by the Garda have met with considerable success in Limerick and have led to a considerable number of arrests and prosecutions. I am sure nobody in this House would want to say anything which failed to recognise those achievements by the Garda Síochána.</P>
    <P>In terms of the review which I am carrying out, I have discussed these matters with the Garda Commissioner, as indeed I have on a number of occasions. I stress to some people in this House, because they seem to be making comments in the media to the contrary, that I have visited Limerick and have spoken and been briefed at great length by the Chief Superintendent there. I am closely aware of developments in that city. I am following them with great interest and supporting the efforts of the Garda Síochána in every way I can.</P>
    <P>The Garda Commissioner has assured me that he has devoted considerable resources to dealing with the problems in Limerick and Dublin. In turn I was able to tell him today that because of careful financial management during the year within the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform group of Votes as a whole, I am in a position to authorise a further &euro;2 million to be expended between now and the end of the year on Garda operations targeted against gang crime. While those operations will not be confined to any one area, this amount is in addition to the already substantial extra resources which have been devoted particularly in the Limerick area this year. While for obvious reasons I will not go into detail, I assure the House that the Garda Commissioner is determined, as is the entire Garda force, that one way or another, the climate of lawlessness which prevails in parts of Limerick and Dublin will be brought to an end.</P>
    <P>In reaction to events such as the ones we are talking about, there is an understandable clamour for the law to be changed, but we need some time to reflect on the lessons that can be learned from the events we are talking about and to assess whether any specific legislative reforms might help in dealing with this type of difficulty. I will be urgently and specifically examining precedents in Canadian law, as drawn up by Canada's Supreme Court, whereby statements, even though subsequently disputed or disavowed by witnesses, can in certain circumstances be admitted as evidence of their contents. Such law, if it were implemented by the courts as judge-made law in Ireland or by legislation on the initiative of this House, might produce very different outcomes in cases where witnesses prove hostile. In Ireland at present the courts proceed on the basis that prior inconsistent statements, as they are called, have no evidential value as to their factual content.</P>
    <P>I will also be looking at other areas of the law, including the possibility of strengthening the law on failure to report serious felonies and failing to give an account of one's knowledge of such an event in a formal statement. I assure the House <Col N="582" /> that if a specific legislative response is possible, proportionate and required I will have no hesitation in bringing one forward. In view of the remarks made earlier by the leaders of the two larger parties, I expect to have their support in bringing forward such legislative proposals.</P>
    <P>It would be foolish, on the basis of the outcome of one particular trial, to conclude that our criminal justice system has in some way irretrievably broken down. It is important that the matters raised by the Deputies are addressed effectively. The Government is committed to ensuring that will happen. It would be even more foolish for people to believe they can give the two fingers to the community in which they live and not ultimately expect to face the wrath of that community.</P>

      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>I must remind the House that questions of guilt or innocence are matters for decision by the courts and that under the <i>sub judice</i> rule there is an onus on Members to avoid comment which might prejudice the outcome of any proceedings arising from the offences.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
      <P>Notwithstanding the Minister's castigation of the Opposition for knee-jerk reactions, does he fully recognise the symbolism of what lies behind the current situation? The incident involving the two fingers is more serious than evidence in the recent past has shown. Is he aware that other jurisdictions had to take more serious steps to combat what was clearly a move in an undesirable direction? Does the Minister recognise that we are fast heading in that direction following a period of six years of zero tolerance and one and a half years into his term in office? Is he not disappointed with the efforts of the combined Administrations to date? What now does he have to offer the people of this city and others throughout the country? </P>
      <P>Will the Minister say if, as was stated earlier on a radio programme, local warlords are organising peace conferences and holding photocalls to eliminate the forces of law and order? If so, this matter is much more serious than he has indicated to the House.</P>

      <P>This Government has invested more money than any previous Government in the Garda Síochána. The Garda Síochána now has more resources available to it in terms of aircraft and infrastructure and is better equipped than in the past. It has never been stronger in numbers. Some people became very noisy earlier when the Taoiseach referred to that fact. Let me reiterate, in terms of the 2,000 extra gardaí, that both major Opposition parties opposed that vociferously during the election. Former Deputy Alan Shatter even wrote to the newspapers saying it was a bad idea. Let us be clear about this. I do not wish to hear hypocrisy from people who did not even make a proposal at the time.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>Membership of the Garda Síochána will be expanded to 12,200 by the end of 2004, a record high. That figure is higher than was ever achieved by any other party or parties in Government. The number of prison spaces in 1996, the time to which the Deputy referred, were in scandalous deficit. There was a revolving door in operation whereby people went into and automatically came out of prison. That situation has changed dramatically.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="584" />A different culture as regards parole boards has now set in.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. McDowell Mr. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>As far as I am concerned, no person convicted of murder should be freed from prison without having served at least 12 years of his or her sentence. Also, people who commit gang-type murders will be required to serve 15 to 20 years in prison. That is unlike the situation which prevailed in the past whereby people were released from prison having served only a seven-year sentence.</P>
      <P>I am taking the necessary steps to back up the Garda Síochána. I am giving it record resources. When the Estimates are published they will show &ndash; I can say this without giving away any secrets &ndash; that greater resources than ever before have been allocated to the Garda Síochána for the forthcoming year. The Taoiseach spoke of a figure close to &euro;1 billion. Significantly more than &euro;1 billion will be allocated to the Garda Síochána in the coming year.</P>
      <P>I am putting all my efforts into restructuring the Garda Síochána and into making sure its resources are committed to the fight against crime and are not dissipated in unnecessary or unproductive side activities as has been the case in the past. I am determined to ensure that that restructuring takes place. Deputy Deasy and others have asked that an organised crime unit be established. There are currently a series of support units in place, the drugs squad, the CAB, the National Bureau of Crime Investigation and the National Bureau of Fraud Investigation. Should drug-related crime be dealt with by a specialist organisation or by those dealing with paramilitaries or organising money laundering or credit card fraud? Simply saying we should wave a magic wand and re-amalgamate all the institutions of the Garda Síochána to provide for an organised crime unit is superficial thinking.</P>
      <P>I have asked the Commissioner if suggestions in that regard are appropriate. It is for him to determine and to advise Government as to whether such reorganisations are in his view desirable. He has informed me that the current situation whereby specialist units, including the ERU, are available in every corner of the country to support local gardaí is the optimal organisation. It has been suggested that the emergency response unit should be amplified and strengthened. The Commissioner keeps the strength of that unit under constant review. If it is his view that a further allocation to that unit would be appropriate I will ensure that any necessary resources to bring that about are put in place.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>We witnessed the shocking spectacle on television last night and in all today's newspapers of a young man giving the two fingers to the community. That young man was not just giving the two fingers to the community, he was giving the two fingers to our criminal justice sys<Col N="585" /> tem and democratic institutions. He is now a symbol of the way in which the pendulum has swung in favour of the criminal. That is a potent symbol.</P>
      <P>The judge said that the likes of what had happened in the case had never been encountered in his court before. That is an unprecedented statement. Does the Minister consider that he is winning the war against crime when in our third largest city witnesses will not give evidence, and citizens will not serve on a jury? Is he winning the war against crime when 18 citizens have been murdered in gangland feuds and we have only two cases being prosecuted? We are not winning the war.</P>
      <P>The Minister has been sitting idly by for the last 18 months and should not smirk at my words. He has spent as much time condemning gardaí who have leaked material to journalists, threatening them with the dire consequence of five years in prison, as in dealing with this outrageous situation. He has still not shown us any real indication, other than a paltry &euro;2 million, when he has already cut the overtime bill by &euro;40 million or whatever the figure is. It is now lower than in 1997 when the rainbow Government left office. Will the Minister accept that he has allowed a lawless situation to develop where crimes are being committed and the offenders perceive that they can do so with impunity?</P>
      <P>Where are the extra 2,000 gardaí which the Minister has promised? We have had only 51 extra gardaí since he entered office.</P>
      <P>Where are the extra resources and modern technology? Why were we relying yesterday almost exclusively on the words of witnesses which were subsequently withdrawn? Where is the forensic evidence and modern technological advancement to ensure the Director of Public Prosecutions is not solely reliant on the words of witnesses? </P>
      <P>Where is the plan with the Garda Commissioner? Two weeks ago there was an incredible situation when he appeared before the Joint Committee on Justice, Equality, Defence and Women's Rights and said gardaí knew who was committing all of the murders but could not get the evidence. I always thought that half the battle was to find out who the culprits were, after which it was easier to provide for the policing, surveillance or whatever was required to prosecute, convict and imprison them. Where is the plan? What will the Minister do, and how will he go about it?</P>
      <P>One of the Minister's last points was that the situation had got out of hand in certain areas. He said there was a cluster of areas where there was lawlessness. That cluster is growing all the time. It is not just confined to Limerick today and yesterday. Dublin is included too, and it is spreading. Once the message gets out clearly to the criminal fraternity &ndash; including the new generation of criminals who have never been brought to heel by the criminal justice system &ndash; that they can take on the criminal justice system and the police, committing murder at will and with impunity, the country will be in an extremely sorry state.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>Probably about 30 questions have been put to me. First, the Deputy seems to be of the view that somehow the investigation in question was deficient because there was no forensic evidence available. It was certainly not for the want of pursuing all evidential opportunities that the trial rested on the oral testimony of witnesses. It would be wrong to impugn the gardaí in question and suggest that they did not take obvious steps such as seeking corroborative forensic evidence or that somehow they missed an opportunity to collect such evidence and naively relied on oral testimony. Nothing could be further from the truth.</P>
      <P>The second point that the Deputy put in general terms to me was that somehow we were sinking beneath a tide of criminality. That is most emphatically not the case, although it might suit him politically to make that point. The Garda Síochána is, as I said, at record strength. It is combating crime effectively right across the country. There is no doubt that things can improve&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. McDowell Mr. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;and I am driving the process of improvement. The Deputy is well aware that I am bringing about changes to ensure all our policing resources are available for core policing issues rather than being dissipated on sideline activities, expended in circumstances where others could do the work.</P>
      <P>I agree with the Deputy that such behaviour as suborning witnesses to abandon their statements is a challenge to the rule of law and the community. As I said, I regard it as a matter of the utmost gravity. Our system is similar to that of Canada. However, in that country the Supreme Court has ruled that, if someone makes a statement to the police in solemn circumstances and comes to court only to disavow and reject it, pretending amnesia or whatever, the jury is entitled to see it, and if it is proved to have been made voluntarily and in circumstances supporting its credibility, they are entitled to act on it as primary evidence. That is the Canadians' version of the hearsay rule.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraicMcCormack" hpid="Mr. McCormack Mr. McCormack">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCormack</NameTxt>
      <P>Are we going to have that here?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. McDowell Mr. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>We in Ireland have a different approach, that is, the previous inconsistent statement can be used only to attack the credibility of the witness's present testimony but cannot stand as testimony in its own right to what the witness originally stated. I am urgently examining whether we should move to the Canadian model, as Deputy McCormack suggests. Perhaps we should now for the first time say that, if someone solemnly and voluntarily makes a statement and later resiles from it, and if that person is produced in the witness box and explains the reason he or she is no longer testifying in accordance with a <Col N="587" /> freely given formal statement, the jury should not merely be invited to disbelieve the person's later position but should also be able to take up the original testimony in the proceedings and act upon it as if it were primary testimony.</P>
      <P>As I said, the Canadian Supreme Court reversed centuries of common law to produce this. It said it was a more rational approach to criminal trials. I do not know and cannot say whether an attempt was made to invoke that authority in the recent case in the Central Criminal Court. However, one way or another, I will confer with all of the relevant authorities. If, rather than my asking the Judiciary to amend its practice and follow that Canadian precedent, it must be given a statutory basis in Irish law, I would be happy to do so. It flies in the face of logic that someone can go to a police station and set out in the form of a statutory declaration, including a statement that he or she is liable to be prosecuted if anything in the statement is false or if he or she does not know it to be true, later coming to court, disregarding that solemn accusatory evidence and saying he or she is suffering from amnesia, has forgotten or does not wish to testify, becoming unco-operative and attributing absolutely no value to that original statement.</P>
      <P>I wish to consider the second point of whether the legislative changes made in 1998 in the aftermath of the Omagh bombing, which made it an offence to withhold information about serious crime involving the loss of life and so on, are sufficient. We should consider whether we need to strengthen it further by requiring people who have information in their possession to give formal testimony, in certain circumstances and subject to legitimate excuses, in a manner which will later be usable in court if disavowed. I will examine the other aspects of criminal law that have come under the microscope recently to see if they can be strengthened. There is an absolutely ample amount of recent legislative change in respect of protecting, suborning and threatening witnesses, etc. If the common law offence of attempting to pervert the course of justice is inadequate in any way and if conspiracies to produce amnesia are proven &ndash; I do not wish to prejudice anything that might happen in the future by way of criminal prosecution &ndash; I want adequate remedies to exist so that the Garda can bring to account persons who make a statement in one direction and then go in another direction for some reason.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to speak about resources. I said earlier that the Garda Síochána's budget is on the verge of exceeding &euro;1 billion per annum. It will receive a real increase in next year's budget. I am determined to ensure that the resources available to me in the justice envelope are put to productive use in the Garda. I would like to restate something that I have not heard denied &ndash; I want to stitch it into the record again. The commitment that was made in good faith by the two parties in Government to increase the strength of the Garda by 2,000 during the lifetime of this <Col N="588" /> Government was opposed by both of the major Opposition parties during the last general election.</P>

      <P>We did &ndash; it is written down in black and white. I can show it to the Minister later. I want to use my time to express the concerns of my constituents who are living in fear. Does the Minister know what it is like to live in a community, such as parts of Limerick at the moment, where Garda resources are inadequate? Unfortunately, the message went out from the Central Criminal Court yesterday that the forces of law and order in the State cannot address the serious violence that exists in certain communities. People will go to bed tonight in a state of fear, without having received any reassurance from the Minister's comments today. I welcome the further &euro;2 million that is to be provided.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My party leader quoted Mr. Paul Browne, a representative of the Garda in Limerick, earlier today. I would like to quote more of what he had to say. He said, &ldquo;There are days in Limerick city when there are no members available to go out on the beat&rdquo;. It is true that serious crimes are being investigated &ndash; we acknowledge the very good work of the Garda in that regard &ndash; but Mr. Browne said, &ldquo;This is happening to the detriment <Col N="593" /> of normal policing&rdquo;. He claimed that the manpower levels and financial supports provided to the Garda in Limerick are &ldquo;dire&rdquo;. This is an accurate reflection of the situation on the ground in Limerick.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach referred earlier to the extra resources that were put in, but Operation Oileán ended many months ago. Some of the young men who did not give evidence yesterday live in communities that are bereft of policing. I want to know what the Minister will do about it. Will he allocate extra policing resources to the city of Limerick now? The resources are needed now because certain communities are living in fear. The police are doing their work in terms of solving crime, but they cannot prevent crime and protect ordinary citizens from crime. My constituents want the Minister to give answers to these crucial questions.</P>
    <P>When will the Minister provide funds for the reconstruction of Mary Street Garda station, which is in the heart of the one of the communities that is most affected by these problems? The Minister of State, Deputy O'Dea, promised that the Garda station would be rebuilt before the last general election and the one before it. When I telephoned the Garda station today, I was told by an answering machine to telephone Henry Street Garda station. This broken promise is not good enough. Promises have been broken in respect of the policing of the city of Limerick, because 2,000 extra gardaí were promised. I am not interested in political point-scoring; I am interested in getting gardaí to police my city. I want to know when the Minister intends to do it.</P>

      <P>&mdash;also that the Labour Party's spokesman at the time opposed such a policy when it was put forward by the Government. Let us be clear about the facts and not engage in wishful thinking.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the resources available in Limerick, I agree with Deputy O'Sullivan that those living in com<Col N="594" /> munities that are vulnerable to the actions of lawless, feuding gangs, as is the case in a minority of the communities in Limerick, are entitled to look to the State for protection and to receive it. This is why I have gone to Limerick, spoken to the local chief superintendent and promised him any resources he considers reasonably necessary. I have kept in constant touch with the Garda Commissioner regarding the problems in Limerick and am confident that he has an appreciation of the manpower needs that exist there.</P>
    <P>Deputy Shortall asked me what I intend to do. I have just indicated that the Garda Commissioner moves his forces around the country to where the threat is greatest. However, in so far as it has been suggested that the Garda is under-resourced, I have made available a special fund of &euro;2 million to be expended between now and 31 December to combat gang related crime. If the Deputy wants an answer, that is it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RoisinShortall" hpid="Ms Shortall Ms Shortall">
      <NameTxt>Ms Shortall</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the resources be made available in Limerick?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. McDowell Mr. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes. Substantial extra resources will be sent to Limerick and Deputy Shortall will see the outcome of this in the coming weeks because the Commissioner is determined that the recent challenge to the rule of law be faced down emphatically.</P>
      <P>The Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform was strongly supportive of the Judiciary's decision to bring the Central Criminal Court to Limerick so its citizens could see at close hand and participate in the administration of justice in their city. It was a successful endeavour until relatively recently. It was to ensure that gardaí involved in major cases would not be dragged up to Dublin unnecessarily for the duration of trials and that the series of very serious prosecutions that arose in the Limerick area would not, ironically, suck police resources out of the Limerick area. I now have to confer with the presidents of the respective courts and the prosecuting authorities as to whether this initiative can be sustained and improved because I do not want to suck out gardaí from Limerick to act as supporting witnesses in trials being held at some distance from that city.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Commissioner, to whom I spoke today, is emphatic that this challenge must and will be faced down and that every effort will be made to confront what has happened recently. I am not directing public prosecutions or seeking to encroach on anybody's territory but if there is a retrial in the case in question, it may well be that, with a different legal approach, the testimony that was unavailable might be ruled to be available. There may well be prosecutions, if there is evidence to support them, of persons who have suffered a loss of memory or an unwillingness to testify. Unless there is a reasonable excuse for this loss of memory, it amounts to contempt of court. Furthermore, if the unwillingness to testify occurs with improper intent, it amounts to an attempt <Col N="595" /> to pervert the course of justice. Moreover, wider conspiracy charges could be brought if it were shown to have been engaged in on a concerted basis. Members should note that this story is not over. The trial and the offence to which it is related is not just dead history. I have no doubt that the prosecuting authority will use every endeavour to ensure justice is not, and does not, appear to be cheated.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>On the Minister's point about Fine Gael having said something ridiculous before the last local elections, there is nothing more ridiculous than promising 2,000 extra gardaí while knowing that Templemore does not have the capacity to accommodate them.</P>
      <P>The Minster used the expression &ldquo;exaggerated outrage&rdquo;. I hope he is aware the only outrage that exists is over his comments about winning the war on crime. He should use this expression when speaking to Eric Leamy's parents.</P>
      <P>In the past five years, 50 people have been killed in gangland murders, 17 of whom were killed this year. Charges have been brought in only two cases. I agree with the Minister's statement that gardaí are being effective in many cases. However, the Garda is not working effectively with regard to organised criminal gangs. The Minister has done nothing to assure the House or the citizens of Limerick or Dublin that there will be any improvement. He has not explained how witnesses will be protected. He has not explained how gardaí will be bolstered on the ground when dealing with the many violent, well-armed criminal gangs. The only thing he has come up with is a sum of &euro;2 million, which works out at about &euro;400,000 per year over the past five years. Is this the sop for all those killed over the past five years in gangland murders?</P>
      <P>The Minister has done nothing. He contradicted the new Garda Commissioner, Noel Conroy, who attended the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Justice, Equality, Defence and Women's Rights and said he did not have the resources he needed. The Minister is frequently contradicting what the gardaí are saying on the ground in Limerick, and he is playing the hard man when it comes to this issue. He is saying he will give more money to the Commissioner if he needs it but that he will not do it yet.</P>
      <P>I have been raising the issue of the organised crime unit for the past 16 months. The Garda representatives and the Garda want this and realise it is the only effective method for dealing with well-armed criminals and organised gangs. The Minister needs to tell the House and the citizens in Limerick how he will protect the witnesses and potential jurors in the trials of members of such gangs. He has not done so.</P>

      <P>Circumstances have worsened. The Minister is right in suggesting that one cannot throw money at this problem and expect it to go away. However, he is not dealing with the issue of fear and intimidation on the ground in Limerick. The gardaí are not able to deal with this at present. The Minister has told the House nothing about what the Government will do to remedy the problem. He must do so. Throwing &euro;2 million at a problem that involves 50 or 60 organised criminal gangs is absurd.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. McDowell Mr. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>To say that &euro;2 million, to be spent over two months, is a derisory sum, as Deputy Deasy has implied, shows how little he knows about the funding of our policing system. It is a very substantial sum and will make a very substantial difference.</P>
      <P>I agree with Deputy Deasy that it is not simply a question of money or of making bigger and bigger cheques available to the Garda Síochána every year. Other issues pertaining to organisation and the deployment of resources are equally important in obtaining the best outcome in terms of the huge amount of resources being put into the fight against crime.</P>
      <P>Deputy Deasy asked what I proposed to do to protect jurors. Protection was, I understand, offered to one individual in the case in question but was not sought by any of the individuals involved. In the circumstances of the case, protection was not believed to be the issue. The Deputy's statement that this particular circumstance would have been changed by offering protection rests on a false assumption.</P>
      <P>I accept, however, the Deputy's point regarding the protection of jurors and the need for persons asked to serve on jury panels to have a sense of security. They must be offered a much greater sense of security if they are to serve in circumstances in which they feel unsafe or under greater pressure than is normal for service on a jury. I am examining ways in which to give jurors a new sense of protection. I believe in juror trial. The two main Opposition parties take different views on this issue, with one in favour of greater use of the Special Criminal Court while the other opposes such a response. There are differences of opinion in every party in the House on these kinds of issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The rule of law has survived for centuries and has values built into it. Jury trial, in particular, is of immense value. Rather than responding immediately to a particular case in a knee-jerk fashion by removing an entire category of case from juries, we should use our collective intelligence to strengthen jury trial and guarantee jurors the sense of security they have elsewhere. Jurors in the United States, for instance, are <Col N="597" /> treated much more carefully than here by the system of justice. We are a little casual in this respect in that jurors are told to go home at the end of a day's proceedings and are gathered together, for example in a hotel, only when they are retiring to consider their verdict. This is an odd way of going about our business. There may, therefore, be a good argument for providing some degree of anonymity to give people serving on juries an adequate sense of security.</P>
    <P>The Deputy asked what I will do for the ordinary people of Limerick who want a sense of protection. The Garda Commissioner is sending additional manpower to the city and also has more than adequate financial resources to deal with the circumstances which will pertain between now and the end of December. Incidentally, not all these resources will be expended in Limerick.</P>
    <P>The fundamental issue to which we must return is that our society cannot devour all of its values in order to make instant responses to particular challenges. Whatever we do must be thought out, balanced and proportionate. Now is not the time for a back of a beer mat kind of approach to change. Deputy Deasy's proposal over the weekend to arm more gardaí would have to be considered carefully because one of the factors that dictates the quality of life in this society is that the Garda Síochána remains an unarmed force. While gardaí obviously need firearms in certain circumstances, a decision to arm the force much more extensively than is currently the case should not be taken lightly. It would need to be clearly demonstrated that such a measure would have a major effect in preventing what happened in the Central Criminal Court yesterday. This would have to be cogently proved to me before I would go down that route.</P>

      <P>It is 6.05 p.m. and the Garda station in Mayorstone closed five minutes ago as it does on every week night. The station serves 40% of Limerick, which indicates that a lack of resources is the problem. Earlier I asked the Minister to reassure the House that sufficient technical, human and financial resources would be provided to address the disturbing incidence of gangland killings. While I appreciate the allocation of &euro;2 million, as a proportion of the annual budget of &euro;1 billion it is an insignificant 0.2%. Even if it provides an increase in the level of overtime in the coming months, it remains a drop in the ocean.</P>
      <P>I direct the Minister's attention to this month's issue of the <i>Garda Review</i> which addresses the issue of technical resources. Page 37 shows a photograph of gardaí reviewing video evidence in a converted, unheated garage in Henry Street in Limerick. These are the conditions under which members of the Garda Síochána are operating in the city. The same page states that there are not enough gardaí in Limerick to cope and that the fear gripping the local population has a direct impact on intelligence because people are afraid to talk to local gardaí. These are not the comments of an uninformed individual, but members of the Garda Síochána speaking through the pages of a magazine that serves them. They say they are overstretched, overcrowded and under-resourced, which are serious remarks.</P>
      <P>On a more serious level, on 28 February last, the Minister's colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy O'Dea, publicly described as a myth the claim that there is a direct correlation between crime levels and the resources provided by the Government. I ask the Minister to confer with his colleague and discuss whether resources can help &ndash; the Green Party believes they can. It is an insult to members of the Garda Síochána to suggest there is no link between Garda resources and crime. In some areas, for instance, the local gardaí are unable to supply the services the public requires.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Green Party calls on the Government to recruit additional gardaí and reform the force to ensure the necessary technical, financial and human resources are made available in order that <Col N="599" /> we can tackle crime and, on a fundamental level, ensure gardaí can work overtime, which they are currently unable to do. According to the <i>Garda Review,</i> members of the force may not work overtime within 48 hours of a murder being committed. This is an immediate difficulty faced by gardaí.</P>
    <P>While I appreciate the Minister's commitment to allocate an additional &euro;2 million funding this year, it is a drop in the ocean. I ask him to raise the issue of resources with his ministerial colleague and convince him that resources are part of the fight against crime.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. McDowell Mr. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister of State would not suggest that the question of resourcing of the Garda Síochána has no connection with the level of crime in a community. It is the case that, of themselves, resources without organisational focus are not the answer. We have seen that in the health system and in a number of other areas of Government expenditure. The mere application of resources without organisational focus is sometimes ineffectual and wasteful.</P>
      <P>The amount of resources the Garda Síochána receives, and will continue to receive while I am Minister, has been substantially increased each year. The Garda Síochána requires resourcing and my Cabinet colleagues, as distinct from the Minister of State, Deputy O'Dea, are well aware of the need for increased resources. It is not up to me to pre-empt the Estimates process but the Deputy can take it that it will be abundantly clear in a number of weeks that I have fought the battle he suggests for adequate resourcing of the Garda Síochána. Real resources for the Garda will climb to a record high.</P>
      <P>I accept the proposition that with a growing population, increasing urbanisation and a change in values, this country will need more gardaí. Even to maintain the present ratio of gardaí to the population will require annual expansion of the force. That must be borne in mind. However, there are many areas, due to one consideration or another, where the efforts of the Garda Síochána are less productive than they might otherwise be. Any static post which is manned 24 hours a day will require 5.2 gardaí to carry out that function when rest, leave and holidays are taken into account. There are also many activities carried out by the gardaí which could be carried out by others. These include the financial aspects of firearms licensing, the points system for motorists and setting up speeding cameras. One does not have to be a garda to put a camera on a road or to collect the film. Many functions could be carried out by others.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have impressed on the commissioner, and he fully agrees with me on this issue, that his task is to mobilise and refocus the resources of the Garda Síochána to get maximum effect from them in terms of both manpower and finance. Significant progress is being made on that. The new systems of financial control within the Garda <Col N="600" /> Síochána will oblige local and regional commanders, even down to the level of sergeant, to make rational choices about what they do with the resources committed to their command to produce the optimal result for the community. There was a time when the Garda Síochána was a static, stratified force in which change did not come easily and in which resources trickled down from the top more or less to where they fell. Now, different financial planning and controls are in place. When the Garda Commissioner becomes the Accounting Officer for the force there will be, for the first time, a degree of financial autonomy in the application of resources within the Garda, which will make it clear that the person with operational control can also direct the cash in the direction in which he or she wants to produce results.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gregory</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister quoted the judge as stating yesterday that he had never before encountered the likes of this. Does the Minister accept, however, that the intimidation of witnesses is not new? Indeed, this morning on RTE, a crime journalist listed a series of serious prosecutions against gang crime in Dublin that had to be dropped as a result of such intimidation. While yesterday's development was dramatic, this is a serious problem that has not been addressed and there does not appear to be any strategy in place to address it. That is one of the reasons organised crime is not being dealt with effectively.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Prior to the murder of Veronica Guerin there was a series of unsolved gangland murders and a <Col N="603" /> similar pattern seems to have emerged more recently. In recent months, efforts have been made to intimidate the crime reporter, Mr. Paul Williams of the <i>Sunday World,</i> whose property has been attacked and family intimidated. There is a real danger that when people get away with killing gangland figures at will, and there is no adequate response to deal with them, they will turn their guns on others, including journalists, politicians and gardaí. It is not a matter, therefore, of waiting to be lucky, it is a matter of having a strategy in place to deal with these people, although that does not appear to be the case.</P>
    <P>The primary response to the murder of Veronica Guerin was the establishment of the Criminal Assets Bureau. Although it could go after all criminal assets, the bureau's focus was supposed to be gangland criminals but it has long since lost that focus. It is the Minister's responsibility to refocus it. These gangs would not be operating if they could not accumulate assets. If the Criminal Assets Bureau was regionalised or, at least, refocused against gangland criminals we might begin to get to grips with such crime that really is spreading. I do not want to make any political points but there is no doubt that in Dublin alone the number of gangs involved in the drugs scene has quadrupled in recent years.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. McDowell Mr. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate the Deputy's point &ndash; it is true that the intimidation of witnesses did not start yesterday or last week in the Central Criminal Court. Many cases that could be brought are not because people are reluctant to testify and we do not need a radio station to remind us of some cases involving the intimidation of witnesses. It is not an entirely new phenomenon and the law is very strong regarding the intimidation of witnesses. Witnesses who are afraid to testify on the main issue are frequently afraid to testify against their intimidators as well, so there is a difficulty there.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy may know, under the 1984 Act statements in a book of evidence contain a solemn declaration that the person has made them in the knowledge that everything in them is true. If anything has been stated in them that is either untrue or that the person does not believe to be true, and it is used in evidence against any other person, the person who made the statement will be guilty of an offence. What is peculiar about what happened yesterday is that, having committed themselves to a particular account in statements included in a book of evidence, which were unambiguous in their meaning, such a number of people should, in respect of the same transaction, suddenly resile from their statements, effectively on the floor of a court. That is unusual. Mr. Justice Carney was correct in saying that, although there has been the odd, isolated incident involving a key witness being intimidated, the notion of mass resiling from statements is new and is a challenge to the public's perception of the administration of justice. There is no doubt about that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="604" />It seems to me that our judge-made law in respect of the value of the previous statement, is not necessarily the only approach to that issue. If we were to follow the Canadian route, somebody who had made a statement in solemn circumstances, such as the ones I have just outlined, would not be in a position to resile from that statement in the witness box and simply have it put in the court wastepaper basket, as if it meant nothing. The Canadian Supreme Court has stated that the law against hearsay evidence merely requires that the evidence itself should be capable of being tested in court and that the maker should be subject to cross-examination. I do not want to become too enthusiastic for this without looking at possible demerits to such a change but it seems to me that the Canadian system has a lot going for it. Under that system, people would not be able simply to junk a statement they had made and testify differently, or fail to testify, or effectively laugh at the procedure and disown their previous statement. If we changed the law along those lines, either by judicial decision or by legislation, we would go a long way towards making sure that what happened in the Central Criminal Court would not recur. There is no foolproof system but at the very least somebody who thought he or she could simply ask witnesses to become blank of memory, notwithstanding the fact that they had committed themselves to a serious written accusation, would no longer feel confident that those serious prior accusations would stand for nothing in the judicial process. That is something we will have to consider carefully to see whether in the courts or through legislation that principle should not be brought into law.</P>
    <P>I believe the Deputy's other point regarding the proliferation of gangs to be true. That proliferation may, in fact, stem as an ironic consequence of the decapitation of the major underworld figures in the past who were forces to be reckoned with. There was a fragmentation of gangs, which has had its own negative side-effect in that there has been a proliferation of gangs, which presents the Garda Síochána with more difficulty in keeping tabs on them. In nearly all of these cases there is a close relationship between the activities of such gangs and drug trading, although there are obviously organised crimes that have nothing to do with drugs.</P>
    <P>While this is outside my province and I am not in a position to lay down administrative practice on it, it seems that the practice of considering drug dealing as a summary offence, which means describing it in law as a minor offence, can only be confined to the most minimalist cases of supplying, say, cannabis in a social context. Deputy Deasy raised this point in weekend interviews. I believe that as a matter of prosecution policy &ndash; I will confer with the Commissioner on this because I cannot influence the Director of Public Prosecutions either directly or indirectly &ndash; the treatment of drug dealing as a minor offence, where it happens albeit on a small commercial scale, must be challenged or at least rethought. <Col N="605" /> Minor penalties for such activity send out all the wrong signals. Deputy Deasy suggested a minimum three-month sentence. That begs the question as to why such offences are described in the District Court as minor offences.</P>
    <P>Another point I want to make, although I do not want to trample on anyone else's domain because we must be mindful of the separation of powers, is that this Parliament has laid down that significant drug dealing on a commercial scale attracts a minimum ten-year sentence. That was the will of this Parliament and it is the law. Unless and until that law is declared to be unconstitutional, it binds everyone from the citizen to the policeman, the legislator and the judge. There is some reason to believe that the full effect of that provision is not being used in sentencing policy in the State. We must address that because it is either constitutional or it is not. It cannot be in a limbo state of being judicially disapproved, while being on the Statute Book. It is either right or wrong. However, it was the will of this Parliament when it was put in place and it should be implemented unless and until someone challenges it and says it should not be part of the statute law of this country and that it is inconsistent with the Constitution.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. McDowell Mr. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>Refocused. I do not accept the Deputy's assertion that it is not addressing its attention to the areas the Deputy mentioned. Without referring to individual cases, which I should not do, I had a recent example of a serious offence being committed where it was clear the Criminal Assets Bureau was active in a drug dealing context. The Deputy probably knows what I am talking about, but I do not want to say anything more definite. If the Deputy's point is that it is going after serious money, corruption cases and people who fail to pay taxes, while ignoring organised crime, that is not my impression. However, I will confer with the Commissioner and with the head of the Criminal Assets Bureau to see if there is substance in the Deputy's point. I will do whatever I can to remedy that if that is the case. However, I do not accept at face value the Deputy's suggestion that the Criminal Assets Bureau has lost its way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards gangland murders, the Deputy cited what happened to Veronica Guerin and the intimidation of other people who report criminal issues in our society. Nothing is more profoundly repugnant to democracy than the fact that those involved in crime not only turn their weapons on people within their trade, but that they also try to prevent people from knowing what they are <Col N="606" /> doing by trying to influence what is and is not printed in the newspapers. I take that threat seriously.</P>
    <P>As regards gangland murder victims, it is not a matter of getting lucky. One may have a clear picture of what happened in a particular case, but it can be difficult to amass admissible evidence. I will give the House an example. One can have a clear picture built up from intelligence that A was murdered by B in such a place with a firearm. Unfortunately, one cannot produce the firearm to link B to it. One cannot link B at that stage to any firearm by conventional forensic methods. What one needs in such circumstances is intelligence which is not simply reliable, but is also admissible when it is converted into testimony. That is where luck sometimes plays a part. One can have a clear picture of what happened, but no admissible evidence due to intimidation, secrecy or the destruction of evidence. Time goes by and sometimes people think progress is not being made on certain offences, but then suddenly a break comes. I ask the House not to form the conclusion that because the more recent murders have not resulted in immediate prosecutions, there is not an active ongoing investigation and campaign to put together admissible evidence to back up the picture the gardaí have already formed.</P>
    <P>The point the Commissioner made to a committee of this House is crucial; it is one thing to know who has committed a crime, but it is a different thing to prove it. As newspapers know in the context of the libel laws, it is one thing to know that something is the case, but it is a different thing to produce a witness in court with admissible evidence to prove the proposition beyond reasonable doubt. That is part of the battle the gardaí must constantly wage. It is not simply a case of gathering intelligence, penetrating the gangs or engaging in electronic and other surveillance to find out what is happening, but of producing clear evidence which will satisfy a jury that the person is guilty of the crime of which he or she is accused. I referred earlier to being lucky. Sometimes what appears to be a forlorn effort to amass admissible evidence suddenly comes up right. It is hard police work which normally results in that, but sometimes it is an unexpected bonus from someone.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. McDowell)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>As the House will be aware, the maximum number of ordinary judges of the High Court is prescribed by law. Currently, the Courts and Court Officers Act 2002 provides that the number shall not be more than 26. When I refer to ordinary judges of the High Court, I refer to the judges of the High Court other than the President of the High Court. The number of ordinary judges of the High Court can be increased by one when, as currently, the President of the Law Reform Commission is a judge of the High Court. The Bill before the House today provides that the maximum number of ordinary judges can be increased by two to 28.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am aware that the legislative cap on the maximum number of judges provides for little flexibility in judicial assignments and resources generally. If the Government of the day wishes to appoint an additional judge to any court, primary legislation must be enacted. This is a rather cumbersome way of proceeding and there is merit in examining whether there is a more expeditious way of making provision for additional judges while ensuring that the Executive is fully account<Col N="609" /> able to the Oireachtas in such matters. This matter is being examined in my Department.</P>
    <P>I appreciate that any reference to judicial resources raises in some minds the issue of delays in the courts. The establishment of the Courts Service as an independent agency in 1999 represented the most radical reorganisation of court services in Ireland since the foundation of the State. The mission statement of the agency is: &ldquo;To manage the courts, support the Judiciary and provide a high-quality and professional service to all the courts.&rdquo;  As Minister, I am responsible for ensuring that the service is adequately funded. In 2003, &euro;92.179 million has been provided for the Courts Service, which represents a 5.6% increase compared to 2002. This does not include judges' salaries, which are payable out of the Central Fund. This funding allows the Courts Service to advance the implementation of its strategic plans and policies, specifically in the areas of information technology and capital building programmes. I am confident that the level of funding provided to the Courts Service is adequate to maintain existing levels of service.</P>
    <P>The courts' strategic service plan is designed to provide a framework within which the courts can provide an efficient, speedy and user-friendly service for people seeking a legal remedy. The service places particular emphasis on the implementation of an IT strategy to meet the operational requirements of all offices and facilitate the provision of a high-quality service to all who use the courts. The service actively assists the Judiciary in all initiatives undertaken on judicial case management. The implementation of judicial practice directions aimed at reducing waiting times in the non-jury and judicial review list in the High Court, which enables parties who are ready and willing to go to trial to obtain a speedy hearing, is a good example. Major efforts have been made by the service in conjunction with the Judiciary to reduce waiting times in criminal and family law matters. Extra criminal courts have been held and waiting times reduced.</P>
    <P>The Government has provided significant additional resources for the Judiciary and the number of judges attached to the District Court, the Circuit Court, the High Court and the Supreme Court has been increased in recent years. Seven additional judges were appointed under the provisions of the Courts and Court Officers Act 2002 &ndash; two High Court judges, three Circuit Court judges and two District Court judges. The provision of these additional resources has assisted in the objective of reducing delays generally.</P>
    <P>There is nothing contentious in the Bill. It is simply to enable the number of judges to be increased by two. As I have indicated, the current legislative method of increasing the number of judges is cumbersome. There may be a more expeditious way of doing so without losing any accountability and I will consider the matter further. I commend this Bill to the House.</P>
    <Col N="610" />
    <Speaker pid="JohnDeasyFG" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the Minister that there is nothing terribly contentious in this Bill and for that reason we will not be opposing it. The purpose of the Bill is to make an amendment to the existing legislation to allow the Government to appoint two more High Court judges. However, the need for the legislation arises because of the Government's mishandling of the Laffoy commission. I remind the House that Ms Justice Laffoy was so badly treated that she felt she had no option but to resign. If this were an ordinary employment relationship I have no doubt that a case for constructive dismissal could be brought against the State. This created a crisis which was of the Government's own making.</P>
      <P>The Government has now engaged Seán Ryan, senior counsel, to do this job. This legislation will enable it to appoint him as a High Court judge. Why is an additional office being created here? There is clearly a need to appoint Mr. Ryan, but what does the Government have in mind for the second post? If the Minister will answer that question, Fine Gael will not oppose the legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>The Labour Party will not be opposing the legislation either. Normally we would not be expected to accede to the passage of Bill in two days without a battle, but we will not have a fight this time.</P>
      <P>This is a short Bill with a specific function. It is a strange amendment Bill because its only function is to cap further the number of High Court judges: there is to be a maximum not of 26 but of 28 judges. It is unusual for legislation not to contain a minimum and a maximum. Perhaps the flaw is that there is no flexibility. We will have to deal with this in the House again when it is found that 28 High Court judges are not sufficient because a few more inquiries or tribunals are taking place. It would have been better to make the amendment somewhat more generous in terms of the number of judges &ndash; rather than saying two, we could say five, for example. As Deputy Deasy pointed out, one of the two new judges has already been identified, but we do not know who the other one is. Perhaps the Minister could inform us whom he has in mind. A better approach could be found than to state that there is to be a maximum of 28 judges. The Minister for Finance probably believes that if he allows any flexibility, the vacuum created will be filled by the number of judges allowed, but we could take a more responsible approach.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The problem of the number of High Court judges has been aggravated by the number of tribunals, even though they are presided over largely by retired judges, as in the Barron tribunal, the Barr tribunal and the Morris tribunal. However, there is also the Moriarty tribunal, and there are High Court judges on the Law Reform Commission, the Constituency Commission and the Standards in Public Office Commission. Now we are to replace Ms Justice Laffoy on the Commission to Inquire into Child Abuse and a Circuit <Col N="611" /> Court judge, Judge Mahon, is to succeed Mr. Justice Flood. We can see that five or six judges already have designated functions outside the High Court and I presume that one or two judges are regularly unable to sit in court through illness or some other reason. I would be interested to know the number of judges sitting at any given time, in a similar statistic to that of the number of prisoners in our prison system on a certain day. We would then know whether we had three quarters or two thirds of the complement of judges sitting on the Bench. We may be faced with the need to make further appointments. The Barron committee investigating the Monaghan and Dublin bombings recommended that there would be an inquiry. The Nally committee investigating the Omagh bombing proposes an inquiry also. We are given to understand also that the Cory reports on collusion in various areas could be proposing inquiries. The situation could deteriorate, therefore, and this simple amendment to provide for two High Court judges may need to be amended again before too long if we continue down that road.</P>
    <P>We should consider the new development in recent years of tribunals and whether judges should sit on them. Can we consider the possibility of appointing senior counsel as chairpersons of tribunals which would mean that judges would not have to be taken off the Bench? The Minister spoke about alternative means and a commission of investigations into various matters dealt with by tribunals in the future. It appears that is the way forward. The Committee of Public Accounts did a tremendous job in a very short period &ndash; five weeks &ndash; in getting in approximately &euro;500 million for the Exchequer, making a recommendation that future work would be done along these lines, that there would be a parliamentary investigator and that much more work would be done either through the Dáil committees or a special Dáil committee of investigations, petitions and so on which would be established. I understand the Law Reform Commission, in its discussion document on inquiries, makes similar recommendations on a dedicated Dáil commission of inquiry.</P>
    <P>Much of the work we currently hive off to the chairmanship of High Court judges in tribunals could be done in-house much more cheaply, although many of the committees are going on for a long time, and it would have the added benefit of giving an extra relevance to the House. We have had much criticism about the House not being seen to be doing the work the public believes we have been elected to do. This would appear to be a relevant function of the House and no other activity of the House, certainly in my time as a Member, has ever received such public acclaim as the work of the Committee of Public Accounts. I advise the Minister to go down the road he has been proposing and perhaps consider some of the proposals the Labour Party has put forward in the Dáil reform, parliamentary oversight and Government accountability draft docu<Col N="612" /> ment it has published to see whether we can do something about dealing with the tribunals.</P>

      <P>Sinn Féin will not be opposing the Bill. Like the other Deputies, I find it strange that we are limiting the appointments to 28. Could we not provide for 36, 50 or whatever? That would mean that it would be no more than that number, not that it has to be the number included in the legislation.</P>
      <P>It is unfortunate that the Bill is so short because the opportunity exists, since we are dealing with the courts system, to extend it. The Minister is planning to introduce other legislation and as he has people in the Department examining aspects of the courts system, we would have had an opportunity today and tomorrow to deal with changes which are required in the courts. If we increase the number of High Court judges to 28, where will they sit in the Four Courts? I recently had to attend a trial, not a High Court trial, in which the jury could not hear what was being said by the witnesses. They had a small room in which to gather. If that is happening at that level, and bearing in mind the chaotic scenes in and around the courts where different courts are trying to operate, we need to accelerate the programme of modernisation which has taken place. Excellent work has taken place and some of the courts are a credit to the courts system but others are an absolute disgrace. If we are appointing judges we have to provide the facilities for them to make their judgments or at least hear the evidence being given in the courts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I hope to have an opportunity at some stage to deal with the many changes required in the courts system but on this issue I ask that the Minister accept an amendment tomorrow on Report Stage to expand the legislation so that we do not have to change it every year if additional judges are required, especially as we appear to be going down the route of more injunctions. We recently had the scandalous abuse of the High Court by the county councils and the city council in getting injunctions against peaceful protesters. The High Court should not be used in that fashion. I am not casting aspersions on the judges. They dealt with the cases before them but more big businesses, the rich in our society and in this case the <Col N="613" /> councils, are using the courts to injunct protests, whether they be trade union protests or, as in recent incidents, peaceful protests against a double tax. Regardless of whether we agree with that, the court is not the place to solve those issues. If we go down that road, we will need more than 28 High Court judges and many more buildings.</P>
    <P>Will the Minister give consideration to moving the High Court to the regions on occasion, similar to the other courts which have moved? That would be a welcome step and would make it easier for some of the court cases to be dealt with quickly rather than have everybody involved travel to Dublin.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. McDowell Mr. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the support from across the House on this issue. I fully accept the point that has been made that people would query why we are bringing a technical Bill of this nature before the House. There are a number of reasons. First, the number of judges has to be determined by law. Second, if we simply said there should be up to 100 judges, it would allow the Government of the day to appoint people to the High Court more or less at will and to be a drain on the central fund. I imagine the current practice of providing a cap, to put that term on it, is probably driven by the concerns of the Department of Finance to make sure it is not easy to simply hand out jobs in the High Court by a Government decision taken one afternoon at Cabinet or whatever and that there is a natural desire to preserve the central fund from excessive appointments. As I said in my earlier contribution, however, the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform is contemplating introducing a more flexible arrangement. I do not know whether we will get it past the Department of Finance, but that is our intention.</P>
      <P>It would not be appropriate for me to pre-empt what the Government intends to do by way of appointments.</P>

    <P>&ndash;&nbsp;aware that despite the publication in 2002 of the national health strategy and the Brennan and Prospectus reports in June of this year and the promise that hospital waiting lists would be eliminated by May 2004, no fundamental reform of the health service has taken place;</P>

      <P>On 6 May 2002, the Taoiseach promised the people that he would end hospital waiting lists within two years. There are now 184 days remaining for him to make good his promise but, of course, he will not do so. It was never anything other than an outlandish commitment made in bad faith and deliberately perpetrated on the people in the middle of an election.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The extent of that deception is revealed in today's published figures which show that 28,130 patients are still waiting for hospital treatment. These patients have already been forced to wait to see a specialist and they are denied necessary treatment. The only evident change is a slight reduction of a paltry 2% over the figures of the last quarter. By the end of 2002, according to the health strategy, the Government promised that no adult would wait over 12 months for treatment. We are coming to the end of 2003 and 4,252 <Col N="615" /> adults are still waiting over 12 months. The stark reality is that at the rate the Government is delivering, we will have to wait 30 years to abolish hospital waiting lists.</P>
    <P>It is worth remembering that the Minister for Health and Children colluded in what was a callous deception, and that deception continues in the health services. The truth is that this and the last Fianna Fáil-Progressive Democrats coalition have failed abjectly to provide a high quality health service despite unprecedented resources. That is why the Labour Party is proposing this motion. Ours is a challenge to the wasteful, wanton squandering of time and resources which could and should have gone into making patients better instead of making them wait. It is a challenge to the Minister for Health and Children to state clearly how he intends to fund the thousands of beds and hundreds of hospital consultants necessary to improve the health service and make it accessible to patients who are sick and in pain.</P>
    <P>Rather than making a difference, the Government has made itself busy with reports and working groups and with consultation and commissions. Management consultants have grown fat while the health service and those working in the front line struggle to overcome Government cutbacks that undermine their patients' care.</P>
    <P>Over 140 reports and commissions have been established since Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats took office six years ago. The publication rate of these reports is matched only by their attrition rate. In 2002 the health strategy was launched with great fanfare before the general election but even before its publication, the Minister for Finance informed the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Martin, that no money would be made available for its initiatives. The strategy was launched anyway as it was election year and again the people were made promises the Government knew it would not keep &ndash; 200,000 new medical cards, 3,000 new beds, shorter hospital waiting times and new legislation. Each one of these promises has since died a death.</P>
    <P>The primary care report was published soon after, but it has been strangulated because of a lack of funding. Recently, the Prospectus and Brennan reports were published and these have been beaten into unconsciousness under the weight of a myriad of committees that are stuffed with health board and Department officials who cannot even decide among themselves who is to chair the meetings.</P>
    <P>When it comes to health the Government has displayed an ongoing and long-standing pathological aversion to the truth. The reality with which the public is all too familiar is that Government cutbacks mean fewer home help services and the closure of hundreds of hospital beds. It also means crucial medical equipment cannot be <Col N="616" /> replaced &ndash; for example, the cardiac equipment in St. Vincent's Hospital which is so defective that it has failed at least 28 times this year &ndash; and hospital waiting lists are as high as ever.</P>
    <P>Today, we read in the newspapers that Our Lady's Hospital for Sick Children was promised an MRI scanner after years of prevarication, yet it is still waiting. In this case, the truth is that even desperately sick children are being betrayed by unfulfilled ministerial promises.</P>
    <P>As public cynicism grows, the Government is trumpeting the latest report, the Hanly report. It offers the promise of a high quality health service with consultant provided care, better training for junior hospital doctors and an end to their ridiculously high working levels resulting from the extension of the EU directive. However, this directive is like a train coming straight at the health care system, according to the president of the Irish Medical Organisation, and he is right. The Hanly report contains major implications that cannot be shredded or binned in the same way as other reports.</P>
    <P>The Labour Party and others have argued for a consultant provided service, significantly more hospital consultants, streamlined medical training and resourcing general practice, but they are under no illusions. That the Government is now in agreement with us means little. Unless the Government is committed to investing funds wisely and well, change will come, because it must, but it will be paid for in reduced patient services and greater limits on access rather than in an improved service. Frankly, the prognosis is not good. The Government has promised change but made no commitment on funding, timing and implementation. That is why we tabled this motion.</P>
    <P>It is important to note that like all the other reports the Government has published there is the token nod in this one in the direction of equality. We have a two-tier health service unique in Europe in that it discriminates against public patients who end up on waiting lists while private patients are fast-tracked to treatment. Equality is central to real reform. Creating a new basis of equality would bring about a more effective and efficient health service in itself. The Hanly report states that it is important to ensure that all patients, whether public or private, have equal access to services based on clinical need. The report does not mention how this aim might be achieved. As in all other Government reports, lip service is paid to the principle of equality but no action is taken and nothing real is ever done. It too is a form of deception, this kind of tokenism that refers to the great scandal of apartheid in our health service and then proceeds to ignore it.</P>
    <P>Hanly has made clear that his report was formulated without political, funding or industrial relations considerations. The rest of us live in a <Col N="617" /> world where these considerations are only too real and we know from bitter experience that Government promises are made to be broken. A weakness in the report is the lack of costings. No cost is given for infrastructural development and there is no mention of costs arising from industrial relations negotiations or from the great investment required in general practice. The only figure relates to increasing hospital consultant numbers. The Minister should spell out the total estimated costs for the implementation of the Hanly report in full. He should also inform us from where the money is to come because it is clear the Minister for Finance is yet again refusing to support his colleague's ambition.</P>
    <P>The silence of the Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, is notable. It is likely that the Department of Health and Children will only receive &euro;500 million extra funding for next year. The Revised Estimate for 2003 was &euro;7.9 billion. The additional amount would constitute a 6.3% increase. The Secretary General of the Department is on record as saying that it would take &euro;900 million to maintain the current level of service. Taking into account medical inflation and the cost of benchmarking, there is only one conclusion to be reached, namely, that services will be cut next year and not extended.</P>
    <P>The most likely outcome from the Hanly report is that the cost cutting elements of it will be implemented and the parts that cost money &ndash; the positive agenda &ndash; will be ditched. That is the fear people have and it is justified because the funding simply does not add up. What Hanly is proposing is change of seismic proportions. This requires good management and, in particular, skills in change management, but these are not the characteristics that define the Department of Health and Children. The sorry experience of the Brennan report should be a warning to us all.</P>
    <P>The Brennan report was published in July of this year. The Minister, the Taoiseach and the Tánaiste promised that its implementation would be swift; that it would include the abolition of health boards and bring about major efficiency in the health service; and that the implementation body would be set up in mid-October, as would the shadow HSE. Instead the process is bogged down in a total of 14 committees and there is still no independent person appointed to drive the reform for which Brennan argued so trenchantly. Health boards meanwhile are merrily adding numbers to their staffing complement, even though they are supposed to be cutting back. Since the July date when the Minister for Health and Children announced their abolition, health boards in the ERHA area alone have recruited 232 new temporary staff and ten new permanent staff. Is it any wonder that Niamh Brennan is scathing in her criticism?</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister for Health to state how he intends to meet the deadline of August 2004, as <Col N="618" /> defined in the EU directive. According to a rough estimate almost 1,000 new non-consultant hospital doctors would be required by that date to comply with the EU directive. Since Hanly rightly rejects that solution, we need to hear from the Minister how many new consultants will be in place on that date. The loss of 75,000 medical working hours cannot simply be made up by new rostering arrangements and cross-cover.</P>
    <P>We need to hear from him too the planned timetable for industrial relations negotiations in relation to both NCHDs' and the consultants' contracts. Already difficulties have arisen because the employers have not resolved the ongoing disagreement over rosters still in place in some hospitals. This is causing problems in setting up new negotiations.</P>
    <P>It is incredible that the Department of Health and Children refused to begin negotiations before now, considering the tight deadline which confronts it. I understand that in March of this year the IMO wrote to the Department to seek a meeting and was told that nothing would happen until Hanly was published, yet the Hanly report makes very clear that it would not deal with industrial relations issues at any stage.</P>
    <P>The Hanly report, it can be argued, presents a producer-driven, centralised model that ends up suiting consultants rather than patients. One major hospital to serve a population of 350,000 people may make sense in terms of multi-disciplinary teams and providing a range of specialties but there is a sacrifice involved and a cost that has not been counted. The sacrifice is that made by patients who will no longer be able to access accident and emergency services and acute services to which currently they have access. There will in all likelihood be no accident and emergency department between St. Vincent's Hospital in Dublin and Waterford in the ECHB region, for example. According to this proposal every emergency case will be funnelled into the major hospitals. All acute beds will be taken out of the local hospitals but there is not even the reassurance of a commitment to provide additional acute beds in the major hospital.</P>
    <P>In the East Coast Health Board region, which is one of the pilot areas, there are hundreds of acute beds in three locations. After Hanly there will be no accident and emergency department or any acute beds in St. Colmcille's or St. Michael's hospitals. The same will be true of Nenagh and Ennis hospitals.</P>
    <P>This will create major problems for my constituents in County Wicklow. The distance to St. Colmcille's is already significant for someone living in Shillelagh or Tinahely. I heard Dr. Peter Kelly state that it takes only seven minutes to travel on to St. Vincent's hospital from St. Colmcille's in Loughlinstown. His comment would be met with hilarity and disbelief in Wicklow. Anyone who travels the gridlock that is the <Col N="619" /> N11 would know better. There is a suspicion already that this report is about concentration of services to suit consultants rather than to serve patients, and comments like that only fuel that suspicion.</P>
    <P>At present an acute cardiac surgical or medical case can access treatment in these smaller hospitals and thousands of people do, particularly older acute patients for whom a local service is invaluable. This service is to be lost but we have yet to hear of a commitment to enlarge the capacity in the major hospitals. Already the big hospitals are overstretched and unable to cope with demand without going over their budgets</P>
    <P>Again let us look at the Government record on delivery. The Minister for Health and Children promised 709 new acute beds. Only 568 beds have been provided by 2002 and some of them have meant taking older beds out of the system. However, there was in that same year a daily average of 269 beds closed. According to the Minister's own figures 23,413 bed days were lost for the first quarter of this year alone because of bed closures. How is the Minister to give any guarantee of keeping these acute beds open let alone providing the significant increase in new acute beds that Hanly would require?</P>
    <P>I would also like the Minister for Health and Children to explain why he accepts the argument in this report that bigger is better, without hard scientific proof. Is he aware, for example, of recent research carried out by health economists in the University of York that proves otherwise? In Britain similar hospital rationalisation has been taking place as is proposed now in Hanly, but there is a danger that yet again Ireland is adopting a system just when it is coming under question in other countries.</P>
    <P>The empirical literature shows that the optimal size for acute hospitals is relatively small and ranges from 200 to 400 beds. Above that figure average costs increase. Hanly is ambitious on this point and recommends the end of single specialty hospitals and the combining of these with acute hospitals on single sites. The National Maternity Hospital in Holles Street, for example, would go to the St. Vincent's complex, yet we know there are additional costs when managing a larger organisation. The only clear way to reduce costs is to reduce capacity in merged hospitals but that is hardly what Hanly has in mind.</P>
    <P>Hanly argues that patient outcomes will be better in major hospitals and that is generally accepted to be the case. Again the York study challenges this presumption. The study states:</P>
    <P>There is no reason to believe that further concentration in the provision of hospitals will lead to any automatic gains in efficiency or patient outcomes. Maybe the research base is inadequate, but the onus is on those who advo<Col N="620" /> cate the benefits of concentration to prove their case.</P>
    <P>In withdrawing local services and downgrading local hospitals the least the Minister can do is prove the case for greater efficiency and outcome. He has not done so. Instead the public is being told that because junior hospital doctors will no longer be exploited the entire hospital service is to be reconfigured. No one doubts that change is inevitable but serious doubts are being expressed about the Government's judgment, its inability to manage change and its failure to target funding effectively. It is the patient who will pay the price of Government incompetence.</P>
    <P>We have had report after report after report. We are committeed out. After all the effort the picture is even more confused. There is no one road map forward for the health service. We have a number of maps and they need to be brought together. If the Minister for Health and Children intends to implement reforms he needs to create an overall template from all the different reports.</P>
    <P>He must be able to guarantee ring-fenced funding for his reforms and agree a timetable for implementation. On the basis of his record there is little public confidence that this Government is capable of meeting the challenge. Indeed today's published hospital waiting lists confirm that the Government has totally failed in its much vaunted claim to create the world class health service.</P>
    <P>The Hanly report was in its own terms formulated without any political, financial or industrial relations considerations. It described an ideal world in ideal conditions. The truth about our health service is the indignity of an elderly patient lying on a trolley for hours and even days in an accident and emergency department; the torment of waiting in pain for months and even years for treatment that a private patient can access in days or weeks; and an incompetent Government that was presented with a growing healthy economy and squandered a golden opportunity.</P>

      <P>In approximately 20 minutes' time, the Minister for Health and Children will respond to this motion. I can safely predict that he will list endless statistics, huge sums of money, percentage increases in expenditure and figures with lots of noughts, from which he will contend that he is doing a wonderful job and that all is well in Ireland's health services, but it is too late for this. We have all been there and the truth is that when there is an enormous budget, as in the case of health, hundreds of millions of additional euro have to be spent to stand still. While in the <Col N="621" /> past we could have been bamboozled with talk of millions and billions, there have always been huge increases in health expenditure. Save for the time when &ldquo;Mac the knife&rdquo; was wielding the cuts in the late 1980s, every Minister for Health and Children could stand up and boast of historically high levels of expenditure on health services.</P>
      <P>The House and, more importantly, the people have heard it all before. We have heard the promises of change and improvements, endless reports and analyses. Whatever the Minister says tonight, the first sentence of the Labour Party motion before the House is the truth: &ldquo;after more than six years in office at a time of unprecedented economic growth, the Fianna Fáil-Progressive Democrats Government has failed to deliver an acute hospital service that meets public need&rdquo;. Whatever the Minister or any Fianna Fáil backbencher says, the public, health professionals and even the Minister and his Department know the truth of this. That is why he is clutching at all those reports. He knows that six years of this Administration has failed to produce a health service that provides for the needs of the people and in which they have confidence.</P>
      <P>Like all real problems, the first step on the road to putting matters right is an acknowledgement of the scale and depth of the problem itself. The Minister would be well advised to bin the script that he has prepared. He should not give us the litany of millions and billions and noughts and percentages, rather he should face the truth. Labour's motion acknowledges all the work done in recent health studies. It is now time for a commitment to action. We urgently require 3,000 additional hospital beds. Will the Minister tell us that they are to be provided? We immediately require a commitment to the doubling of hospital consultant numbers to the 3,600 that the Hanly report says are required. We want a commitment in a measurable timeframe to the provision of an acute hospital service that is consultant-delivered. This has been the promise of the Department since the Shaping a Healthier Future document &ndash; I know something about that. When will we see it delivered? Will we be given the timeframe and commitment for this tonight?</P>
      <P>Will we see the establishment of regional speciality self-sufficiency that Hanly has promised and outlines? Will we have the upgrading and retraining of the emergency medical technicians so that people can get first class delivery of care at the point of an accident and, more importantly, the relief of pain rather than facing long journeys by ambulance in pain?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is one urgent and critical component of the motion that I wish to spend some time on, namely, the final clause of the motion which calls for &ldquo;the absolute recognition of the principle that all citizens in every part of the country must have access in reasonable time to world class accident and emergency services&rdquo;. That is not too much to <Col N="622" /> ask. This is something that is a basic right and one that we would want for our loved ones if they were ever faced with a critical medical condition.</P>
    <P>We know that phase two of Mr. Hanly's work is under way. He and his team are looking at other than the two regions they have already looked at. All the good work that has been done to date by his team will be fatally compromised if this essential principle is not recognised and accepted. Whatever mathematical formulation is used to decide on hospital services location &ndash; Deputy McManus talked in terms of a table top analysis &ndash; what cannot be missed is the issue of population distribution and geography. This must be at the centre of health care provision. Health care provision is about nothing if it is not about access for people who need it. People must have ready access to hospital care in a timely fashion in the event of an emergency.</P>
    <P>Bluntly put, it cannot be acceptable, or even contemplated, that there would be no accident and emergency unit between St. Vincent's Hospital in the centre of Dublin city and Ardkeen Hospital in Waterford. It simply will not be allowed to happen and people know that. It would defy logic. That such a concept seems to be anchored in the Hanly thinking has caused difficulties for the explanation of the full report. I have raised this directly with Mr. Hanly. I detect, in advance of the detailed examination he and his team have embarked on, that there will be flexibility on this critical issue. I believe that it will assist Mr. Hanly, and perversely will be of great assistance to the Minister if he seriously wishes to bring about structural reform and meaningful change in our acute hospital system, that it is expressly and specifically approved in a motion in Dáil Éireann tomorrow night. I ask him to seriously reflect on this matter between now and the vote on the motion.</P>
    <P>The figures on public expenditure for the first ten months of this year, released today, make interesting reading. They should strengthen the Minister's case when he goes to Cabinet regarding the needs I outlined, namely, specific commitments to beds, hospital consultants and the support team requirement, the development of services on a regional basis and the preservation of acute accident and emergency and maternity services in many of the hospitals that currently have them. All those will cost significant amounts of money. It is mind-numbing that the capital budget target of the Minister for Finance was underspent by 19% &ndash; almost &euro;750 million &ndash; in the first half of this year. I understand current expenditure is in the order of &euro;726 million below target. The money is there, even within the figures provided by the Minister for Finance.</P>
    <P>I want the Minister for once to abandon the doublespeak and gobbledegook, the smokescreen of figures, numbers and percentages, and to spell out clearly the reform programme on which he <Col N="623" /> will stake his reputation. I also want him to be clear on the matter of preservation of acute accident and emergency services in those hospitals that absolutely and clearly require them, so that the needed reform on which we can all agree is not long-fingered again. I ask the Minister and his Department for once to seek consensus on a way forward that will result in an acute hospital service that meets all the needs of every Irish citizen, regardless of where they reside.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Upton</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the publication of the Hanly report, though not necessarily its recommendations. I welcome it because it highlights so many of the deficiencies in the health system. The report fails to address or deliberately omits any reference to political or industrial relation issues or funding. It refers to a timeframe which is driven entirely by the need to meet an EU directive and nothing else. Without the political will to implement it and without the industrial relations issues being addressed, or the necessary funding being in place, I fail to see how the Hanly report can be in any way meaningful.</P>
      <P>One of the report's recommendations is that primary care services, including community care, should be an integral part of the proposed network. I welcome this recommendation because it implies an awareness of the particular needs of community care, but if it is to be successful, there is a crying need for a serious injection of funding into this vital area.</P>
      <P>Community care, particularly for the elderly, is considered to be very satisfactory if properly applied and suitably funded. The ideal situation is that elderly people would be able to stay in comfort in their own homes with an appropriate facility and back-up. This implies that the basics are in place. I draw the Minister's attention to the current situation of the home help service, for instance. Will this be adequately funded and guaranteed? It is certainly not funded or guaranteed adequately at the moment. The service is anything but satisfactory and as we speak it is being decimated, with the number of hours being reduced almost on a daily basis. Elderly people are becoming more and more isolated. Their communities are being more fragmented and they are more and more being left to fend for themselves, with no back-up facilities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The kind of services that are needed include, for example, chiropody for old age pensioners. There is a major problem emerging in my constituency involving a requirement or a request from a chiropodist for a top-up &euro;10 fee from an old age pensioner who already has a medical card. I have asked parliamentary questions on <Col N="624" /> this matter. I would like to know what the situation is and whether it is an acceptable state of affairs that people who already have a medical card are being invited or requested, or whatever conventional word one would like to use, to contribute an additional &euro;10 before the service is provided. This issue must be addressed.</P>
    <P>The situation with occupational therapists and elderly people is no better. The waiting list appears to be measured not in weeks or months but in years. This is totally unacceptable for elderly people. By their very nature they cannot afford to wait for years. They are either suffering on in pain, or tell the doctor that it scarcely matters since they will be dead before the occupational therapist visits to find out their needs. I accept that there is a shortage of occupational therapists but I do not believe there is any genuine effort being made to address that shortage in any significant way. There are ways in which it could be addressed. For example, student occupational therapists could be drafted in on work practice, and while they cannot have responsibility for delivery of the service, this is the kind of innovative step that must be considered to shorten the waiting time.</P>
    <P>The other issue related to the shortage of occupational therapists and other health care professionals is the lack of places for them in the medical schools. There will have to be more places opened up for speech therapists, occupational therapists and physiotherapists. There must be some fast-forwarding of the system.</P>
    <P>In recent weeks a number of respite beds were closed in the Cherry Orchard hospital. The victims again are the elderly and the carers, the people most in need of support and help. If the implementation of the Hanly report removes some of these obstacles to the well-being of the elderly, I welcome it, but as far as I can see there is no funding, no question of addressing the industrial relations aspect and no question of the political will being there to sort out these problems.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to address two aspects of the Hanly report. The first is the assumption it contains that as far as hospitals are concerned, big is better. Running right through the report is the assumption that the larger hospital will deliver a better outcome. In order to arrive at that conclusion the Hanly report relies on three studies, which I confess I have not read, but on which I have had a report from a constituent who has read them, and who makes the point, which I put to the Minister, that those studies do not bear out what Hanly has concluded.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The first study on which Hanly relies is the Batista study, which was confined to patients over 65. The authors of the study warned against generalising from that study to the rest of the population and in particular to younger patients. The <Col N="625" /> second study, the Chassen study, concluded, as I understand it, that a bigger hospital was better but only for five named procedures rather than a generalised situation. The third study, the Nuffield study, reviewed the literature and concluded that much of the research which gave rise to the conclusion that bigger hospitals were better was technically flawed, and that in any event, bigger hospitals tend to have a higher number of elective patients. If one has more people going into a bigger hospital who are healthier in the first place, they are likely to come out healthier, which does not support the argument that bigger hospitals are better.</P>
    <P>I make that point because Hanly's conclusions on the organisation of hospital services are based on the assumption that a bigger hospital is better. I put it to the Minister that the research on which Hanly relied in reaching that conclusion may not have suggested that conclusion in the first place.</P>
    <P>The pilot study in the East Coast Area Health Board has now produced for us the bizarre conclusion that there will be no general major hospital between St. Vincent's Hospital in Elm Park and Waterford, an area which has the fastest population growth in Ireland. It does not appear to me that any account was taken, for example, of the Dublin strategic planning guidelines, which refer to very significant population growth and development in the south Dublin/ Wicklow/Wexford area, or of the conclusions arrived at by the Department of Environment, Heritage and Local Government or by the Department of Transport. The latter is planning a motorway between Dublin and Waterford to accommodate 85,000 cars. If the level of population growth and activity in that triangle between Dublin and Waterford is such that it will require a motorway to service it, then it will certainly need more than one hospital located in St. Vincent's and another in Waterford, with nothing more than what the report calls nurse-led injury services, or glorified band aid stations, in place of the normal accident and emergency services.</P>
    <P>These pilot studies are likely to be the model for the hospital services in the rest of the country. The pilot study for the East Coast Area Health Board is reported in Hanly in one and a half pages. If a study has been done of that health board, I am assuming there is documentation summarising that study, detailing who was consulted, what options were examined and what matters were taken into account, such as population growth and future need. I ask the Minister to publish the background documents which led to that being included in the Hanly Report. I assume that when looking at this the Hanly team had before it a summary of the discussions engaged in with medical and health management personnel in the East Coast Area Health Board. I do not think there were any discussions with patients or the wider public interest. I assume a <Col N="626" /> larger summary exists than that contained in the Hanly report and it should be published. The public, who are being sold short by the conclusions in that report need to know what was examined and what options were considered.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="627" /> I welcome the opportunity to speak on the unprecedented developments in our health service in recent years and the fundamental reform programme upon which we have embarked. It is opportune at this time in the light of the recent publication of the report of the National Task Force on Medical Staffing, the Hanly report, to address the provision of acute hospital services against the background of impending change. It is important to point out that our primary focus remains on the provision of the most effective and efficient service for patients whose need to access acute services happens at a time when they are most vulnerable.</P>
    <P>No one can deny that the system is providing more and better services than ever before. Activity in our acute hospitals continues to rise. In 2002 alone there were some 958,000 in-patient discharges. The 2002 figure represents approximately 2,620 patients per day being discharged for each day of the year and is an overall increase of nearly 25% on the number of discharges in 1997. In addition, in 2002, there were some 1.2 million attendances at emergency medicine or accident and emergency departments and some 2.2 million attendances at acute hospital out-patient departments. Provisional figures for the first eight months of 2003 show activity to be up approximately 4% on the 2002 figure.</P>
    <P>Day activity is now a significant component of hospital-based care in Ireland. Evidence shows that much of the growth is the result of technological and medical innovations, such as less invasive surgery and advances in anaesthetics. There was an increase of 65% in the number of day cases between 1997 and 2002. That is a staggering increase in productivity by any yardstick.</P>

      <P>These additional services are now being provided by an increasing number of medical consultants. According to the Comhairle na nOspidéal report on consultant staffing, on l January 2003 there were 1,731 consultant posts in the public sector in Ireland. This represents an increase of 439 or 34% from January 1996 to January 2003. The recently published Hanly report deals with the future expansion of consultant posts which I will refer to later. It is interesting that we exceeded the recommendations of the Tierney report published ten years ago.</P>

      <P>The Hanly report deals with consultant posts. People ask if the recommendations will be achieved. The Tierney report published ten years ago was a similar exercise to that undertaken by the Hanly team though it was not as comprehensive. That report recommended we increase our numbers to 1,500 by 2003. We now have 1,731 consultant posts which shows such numbers are achievable. What we are doing is a slight change from what was recommended in the Tierney report in the context of a fundamental reform of how we staff our hospitals, changing the equilibrium between consultant numbers and junior doctors. That has to happen. I would appreciate if that fact were endorsed by the House. There has been a bit of dodging and fudging and sitting on the fence regarding the Hanly report. I would like to know if the Labour Party is in favour of or against the Hanly principles.</P>

      <P>One of the areas on which we have placed much emphasis in recent years is in the development of cancer services. Since 1997, there has been a cumulative additional investment of approximately &euro;400 million in the development of such services. This includes &euro;29 million allocated in 2003 for cancer services. This substantial investment has enabled the funding of 87 additional consultant posts in key areas such as medical oncology, radiology, palliative care, histopathology, and haematology. Additional oncology nurses have also been recruited throughout the country.</P>
      <P>The benefit of this investment is reflected in the significant increase in activity which has occurred. For example the number of new patients receiving radiotherapy treatment increased by 58 % from 1994 to 2000; the number of new patients receiving chemotherapy treatment increased by 30 % in the same period and in-patient breast cancer procedures increased by 37% in the period 1997 to 2001.</P>
      <P>This Government has maintained a particular focus on those waiting longest for hospital treatment. Despite pressures on the acute hospital system considerable progress has been made by health agencies in reducing waiting times for public patients. Hospital in-patient waiting list figures stood at 16,658 at the end of June 2003. This is a decrease of 4,916 or 23 % since June 2002. The waiting list data for the period ended 30 June 2003 showed that there were significant reductions in the number of adults and children waiting longest for in-patient treatment. The total number of adults waiting more than 12 months for in-patient treatment in the nine target specialties fell by approximately 43% from 7,402 to 4,252 from June 2002 to June 2003. The total number of children waiting more than six months for in-patient treatment in the same specialties and for the same period has decreased by approximately 57% from 1,576 to 676.</P>
      <P>Noteworthy decreases have been made in the various target specialties in the period June 2002 and June 2003. The number of adults waiting longer than 12 months for in-patient treatment in cardiac surgery, gynaecology and vascular surgery are down by 78%, 65% and 60% respectively. These are significant decreases which should be acknowledged. They are the result of increased investment and of a different way of doing things. Those children waiting longer than six months for in-patient treatment in plastic surgery, general surgery and orthopaedics have fallen by 71 %, 69% and 55% respectively.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="630" />Very significant progress has been made in many health board areas to achieve the target of no adult waiting longer than 12 months and no child waiting longer than six months. The following hospitals have reported no adults waiting more than 12 months for in-patient treatment: St. James's Hospital, Portlaoise General Hospital, Wexford General Hospital, Mayo General Hospital and Roscommon County Hospital. This has been achieved through active management of long waiting lists at a local level and the involvement of the national treatment purchase fund. This is in line with health strategies. It is now the case that all health boards outside of the eastern region are reporting that, in general, those adults currently reported to be waiting more than 12 months and those children reported to be waiting more than six months have been operated treatment under the national treatment purchase fund or have conditions that are complicated or outside the remit of the NTPF.</P>
    <P>While the rate of progress in achieving the targets set out in the health strategy has been slower than anticipated, the targets not only remain a goal to be achieved but are being substantially met outside the capital. We acknowledge that the eastern region is still an area of some difficulty. Funding through the waiting list initiative and the national treatment purchase fund will continue to keep the focus on reducing waiting lists and waiting times.</P>
    <P>The national treatment purchase fund, which was established in April 2002 to purchase operations for those public patients who have been waiting longest on hospital waiting lists, has been effective. Its functions include working in partnership with health boards, hospitals, GPs and consultants to ensure that waiting times for public patients are reduced as quickly as possible. The NTPF initiative is about the patient. It is about treating patients who have been left on waiting lists for years. That is not a new phenomenon in Ireland and is a problem that has faced successive Governments. However, what is new is the particular focus which the Government, through the NTPF, has cast on the waiting list problem. Since its establishment it has removed from waiting lists more than 8,000 of the people longest waiting. The fund referred 200 patients per month at the beginning of this year and that has now risen to 800 per month.</P>
    <P>The fact that public hospitals are carrying out work for the NTPF is in accordance with the NTPF's remit, provided it does not interfere with core funded activity levels or upset the workings of the public hospital system. That is the basis on which the NTPF work is performed in public hospitals. The single most important limiting factor for admission to hospital is bed availability. Therefore, increasing the bed capacity of the acute hospital system is an immediate priority for the Department of Health and Children. The <Col N="631" /> extent of the shortfall in acute capacity has been identified in a report by Dr. Mary Codd entitled Acute Hospital Bed Capacity &ndash; A National Review. That recommends an additional 3,000 acute beds in hospitals by 2011. I introduced the first phase of that process in January 2002 and provided ring-fenced funding of over &euro;117 million for an additional 709 acute beds for public patients. One must remember that the health strategy stated that there should be 450 public beds in the first year rather than 709, with 200 to be purchased from the private sector. We have got the private beds through the NTPF and we have commissioned 568 public beds to date.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>To deal with current pressures on acute services, both in the shorter term and the longer term, I would like to outline some of the key actions that I have taken. It has been widely documented that a number of patients in acute hospital beds have completed the acute phase of their treatment and are ready for discharge to a more appropriate setting. In addition to the very substantial base funding of up to &euro;130 million that has been put in place for nursing home subventions and so on over the past few years, we have made additional funding available this year to the eastern and southern regions to try to manage the issue of moving people from the acute phase to the continuing care phase of their treatment more effectively and efficiently. That money has been allocated to facilitate the discharge of patients from acute hospitals to a more appropriate setting. It allows for funding through the subvention system of additional beds and other ongoing support in the community. The Eastern Regional Health Authority has confirmed that in the region of 200 patients are expected to be discharged from acute hospitals as a direct result of that additional funding. To date, more than 140 people have been discharged to a variety of settings as a result of the initiative.</P>
      <P>There was much cynicism in the House about the winter initiative package of 2000-01. We provided &euro;40 million to alleviate service pressures and so on, and as a result 20 additional emergency medicine consultants have been recruited, the largest increase in consultants in any specialty apart from cancer. There were only 16 accident and emergency consultants in 2001. Deputy Howlin speaks about accident and emergency services across the country&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;but most hospitals did not have a notion or sense of an accident and emergency consultant being appointed up to the time I took that initiative. Then everybody put their hands up to say that they wanted one, but there was an obligation on the regions and health boards to do things strategically and in accordance with best medical practice &ndash; I will deal with that later.</P>
      <P>On primary care, we have taken very significant&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>Those who were under a statutory obligation to decide should do so, and that is currently the health boards, although they keep looking for guidance on it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the primary care issue, we have funded the substantial initiative of GP co-operatives, which <Col N="633" /> is making a difference across the country. We have put about &euro;46.5 million into this area. Deputy McManus might sniff at that, with the IMO. Depending on which way the wind is blowing, Deputy McManus can be the best articulator of the IMO's views on such issues, particularly when the industrial relations situation becomes hot. Then, when we have settled the industrial relations, she changes tack and says that we should not have given them so much money. I get a sense that she is doing the same tonight in her commentary regarding the most recent statement from the IMO.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not. The Deputy should look at a graph and he will see what has happened to funding and so forth. Emergency medical technicians are a very important issue regarding the Hanly report and first responses. There have been significant developments in the ambulance service in recent years, including a major upgrading in training and standards, the equipping of emergency ambulances with defibrillators and the training of ambulance personnel in their use. The introduction of two-person crewing has been implemented in nearly all regions. It is a relatively recent phenomenon. Progress has been made in upgrading the ambulance fleet and equipment, and there have been improvements in communication equipment and control facilities. We have more to do.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>In the context of the Hanly report, it is a key area. The report of the national task force on medical staffing will have a very significant impact on the organisation of our acute hospital services. It completes the package of reforms that we set out in the health service reform programme announced in June. It represents a radical greenfield approach to the development of acute services which will ensure better services and outcomes for patients. In the beginning we said that we did not want Mr. Hanly to become involved in industrial relations issues because he would never have completed the exer<Col N="634" /> cise, and everyone in this House knows that. A former Minister would know that. If we had said to the Hanly group that it should anticipate and resolve the industrial relations issues before publishing the report&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not just reading a script but responding to points made. I think Deputy Upton said the Hanly report was just about meeting the terms of the EU directive on NCHDs. It is not just about the directive, an important imperative coming down the tracks, particularly for 2009. The Hanly group had the very difficult challenge of determining how we could get to the 2009 position if there would be a 48 hour working week for junior doctors and consultants. The aims and terms of reference of the manpower forum related to a service provided by consultants, as opposed to the current service which is over-dependent on doctors in training for service provision. How can one achieve all of this without a fundamental reconfiguration of acute hospital services?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is easy to condemn the Hanly report. It is far too simplistic to say, as Deputy Gilmore did, that it is crudely saying a bigger hospital is better. That is not representative of the entirety of the <Col N="636" /> report which is interested in examining how we can move to a service provided by consultants. Such a service should provide cover every hour of every day but that is not the case at present.</P>

      <P>One could be talking about seven consultants per specialty on the basis of a 24 hour roster in the key specialties of anaesthesia and surgery. That, in itself, would have implications for what could be done in hospitals of a certain size and other hospitals of a larger size. It is not a case of big being better but of multidisciplinary teams of care being available. Expertise is built up when there are large volumes of cases. One achieves better survival rates in such circumstances.</P>

      <P>The Deputy and his predecessors said the exact same thing. The bottom line is what I said about emergency medical technicians as the first respondents, about which nobody is arguing. No member of the Hanly group said we should not stabilise patients or that we should not do everything we possibly could to save lives. Action can be taken where the accident takes place, in the ambulance or the nearest hospital. Somebody has to make a call about where the best place is to go.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government has supported the Hanly group which says that if we want to guarantee the best survival rates for patients, we have to take them to the place where that can be guaranteed.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>The Hanly group is also saying local hospitals can do much more than they are doing to provide for an increasing volume of elective procedures. We have said this. The Hanly process will involve an enhancement of the type of services that can be provided in local hospitals.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="640" />The Department has engaged in a major consultation process in respect of the reform of the health service, just as it said it would when it made a decision on the Prospectus and Brennan reports in June. It contacted all of the health boards. The consultation exercise involved over 20,000 staff from all aspects of the health service and, as a result, a report has been compiled by the Office of Health Management. It is important that we consult staff. I do not accept the argument that this should not have been done, or that it was a waste of time. We always said there would be a three month consultation phase. We are working to finalise the list of nominees to the Health Service Executive and implementation group.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>In the interests of ensuring fair access, the strategy identifies the need to ensure equitable access to services. This involves improving access to hospital services for public patients and recognising other barriers which affect people's ability to access services. The Government is committed to ensuring equity of access to services for all persons. This debate illustrates the Labour Party's cynical approach to the important issue of health reform.</P>

      <P>I support the motion tabled by my Labour Party colleagues and welcome the opportunity to discuss aspects of the Hanly report. As I understand we are to have a debate on the report next week, I will confine myself to two points that need to be made.</P>
      <P>In reply to Deputy McManus, the Minister stated the Hanly report did not require the appointment of additional consultants by next summer. He is wrong about this. The recommendations do require the appointment of additional consultants in the pilot areas. The Minister had better be very sure that they are in place by next summer or he will have no pilot areas, never mind a set of fully implemented recommendations. The initiatives apply to the other areas not included among the pilot areas. The initiatives the Minister suggests cannot be attained by next summer. If they could be, they would have been implemented long ago, certainly before he made the very expensive deal with non-consultant hospital doctors in 2000. He should put this idea to bed.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="OliviaMitchell" hpid="Ms O. Mitchell Ms O. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Ms O. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>It is absolutely outrageous that the Minister has ignored the crisis in Dublin. I disabuse him of his belief that simply because he has rolled out all of his reports, because he has run out of excuses for inaction and because he now has a neat little formula for reform, which may happen some day in the future, he has somehow absolved himself of all responsibility to do anything about the crisis. He is ignoring crises arising every day in the health service, particularly in the acute hospitals in Dublin. Those who are sick today need to be treated today and the Hanly report, the Brennan report or the Prospectus report are of no relevance to them. The Minister must deal with the problems of today.</P>
      <P>For the past six months the Minister has been wittering on about a smoking ban while people are dying on trolleys in hospitals or cannot gain admission to them. He was nowhere to be found when there was a crisis in the health service, yet every time an unknown pub owner from the back end of nowhere had anything to say about the smoking ban, he was present with a camera and script to speak on the issue. He must have made 100 statements on the ban, yet none about the crisis of people dying with indignity in hospitals or their not being able to get into hospitals.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms O. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>How could the Minister remain silent while an elderly woman was spending her fifth day on a hospital trolley in an accident and emergency department of a hospital in Dublin? This hospital had 100 beds closed due to a lack of funding and a so-called lack of staff.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="IvorCallely" hpid="Mr. Callely Mr. Callely">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Callely</NameTxt>
      <P>Out of how many thousand?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="OliviaMitchell" hpid="Ms O. Mitchell Ms O. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Ms O. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>However, the irony is that the staff could be found when public wards were being opened to treat people under the national treatment purchase fund. It was miraculous that they could be found for this, yet could not be <Col N="645" /> found for an elderly person spending her fifth day on a trolley. Thirty-one people were on trolleys in the Mater Hospital yesterday, of whom one woman was on a trolley for her fifth day.</P>
      <P>I am not criticising the national treatment purchase fund. It is a great idea if there is spare capacity and no demand to fill it. If this is the case, one can buy treatment from the private sector or abroad. However, none of the hospitals in Dublin falls into this category. They are all bursting at the seams and cancelling elective surgery. The Tallaght Hospital and the Mater Hospital have 32 and 31 people on trolleys, respectively. Day surgery in Tallaght Hospital has almost ceased completely. It has only 50% capacity whereas it was operating at 120% last year or the year before. This is because 12 beds are permanently used for the overflow from the accident and emergency department. What was supposed to have been an emergency provision has become permanent, resulting in the cancellation of elective surgery for an increasing number. One's surgery can be cancelled up to four times in Tallaght Hospital. Imagine what this means in human terms for those involved. It is an absolute outrage.</P>
      <P>The only way this problem can be dealt with in the short term is through the provision of funding which must be released. It is unacceptable that we continue to lurch from crisis to crisis, with our hospitals every day having to threaten to go off call or go off call. It is always on a knife-edge and will end in tears for somebody. We cannot continue as we are.</P>
      <P>We no longer believe in the 3,000 beds we have been promised. They are a little like the 2,000 extra gardaí. It is a mantra the Minister keeps repeating but nobody believes they will materialise. If the Minister cannot give us new beds, can he not at least open the hundreds of beds closed in Dublin? It is completely unacceptable that we continue like this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="IvorCallely" hpid="Mr. Callely Mr. Callely">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Callely</NameTxt>
      <P>What about the figure of &euro;117 million and the 709 new beds?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="OliviaMitchell" hpid="Ms O. Mitchell Ms O. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Ms O. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>What is the Minister of State wittering on about?</P>
      <P>The Minister referred to increased activity, including cancer services. Not only can people not get into hospitals to have cancers treated but they cannot even get in to have a diagnosis made. It is too late to treat them by the time they are admitted to hospital. This is an absolute outrage. The Minister must do something in order that those who eventually get into accident and emergency units can be treated and resuscitated or, in some cases, die with some dignity and privacy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another point I wish to raise is unrelated and has been completely cast aside. There has been no mention in any of the Minister's reports about the future of private health insurance or how the <Col N="646" /> health needs of the 45% with such insurance will be catered for. Will the Minister, tomorrow night or next week when addressing the Hanly report, articulate what role he envisages for private medicine? It seems from his utterances and the reports that have been published that fundamental change is envisaged or perhaps even the total erosion of private medicine. I do not know what he has in mind, if anything. The Brennan report, for instance, calls for all new consultant contracts to allow for public work only. The Hanly proposals for 24 hour rostering seem to preclude all private work. The ESRI regards the 20% of beds traditionally allocated to private patients as a way of solving the capacity problem in the public system. I am puzzled. With no consultants and virtually no beds, it is very difficult to see how private medicine will survive. Is this what the Minister intends or is there a plan? I want equity and no discrimination in the system but I see this happening through purchased insurance for everybody. Perhaps the Minister has another plan. If so, let us hear it.</P>
    <P>What role does the Minister envisage for all of the hospitals now under construction and incentivised through the tax system? Will it involve catering for a tiny elite? If what the Minister seems to be suggesting goes ahead, the vast majority of patients will cancel their insurance policies and be forced back into the public system because there will be simply no beds or consultants for them anywhere.</P>
    <P>As the Minister knows, our health system developed in an <i>ad hoc</i> and unstructured way. It is now complex and intricate with the result that the private and public systems are interlocking in such a way that one cannot pull a support from one system and not expect the whole structure to come crashing down. It cannot be dismantled by stealth or simply by default because nobody has addressed how it should proceed. If the Minister is considering fundamental change, he had better be sure the public sector is willing and able and has the funding to accommodate the 45% currently buying private health insurance. The reason such large numbers of people are placing themselves under considerable financial strain to pay for health insurance is that they do not have faith in the Government to provide a health service or manage change in it. Nobody believes in the reforms we hear about or that there is sufficient financial commitment or political will to make the changes needed in the health service. All the Government appears able to do is publish or commission reports.</P>
    <P>The financial demands of the Hanly report make it unrealisable, a view shared by almost every Member to have spoken, although I do not deny that elements of the report are welcome. The Minister has heard our reservations and will hear more next week. The health system will fall apart if he is not in a position, once the Hanly <Col N="647" /> report or elements of it are introduced, to cater for the people whose health care is currently provided through private insurance. In light of the Minister's faith in the report and other reforms, have he or members of the task force given up their private health insurance and does he recommend that others do so? He should come clean and inform the House what is envisaged for private health insurance.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanNeville" hpid="Mr. Neville Mr. Neville">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Neville</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to contribute to this debate and congratulate the Labour Party on taking the opportunity to table the motion. As Members will be aware, I am from the mid-west region. We have examined the Hanly report and while it has many positive features, concerns remain about whether the programme laid out in the report can be implemented. The suggestion that the number of consultants in the mid-west could increase from 109 to 304 does not appear realistic.</P>
      <P>The report also refers to the rationalisation of hospitals in County Limerick and envisages the closure of the orthopaedic hospital in Croom. The Minister has indicated this is not the case but I have just read it in the report.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy should read it again as there are a number of qualifications.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanNeville" hpid="Mr. Neville Mr. Neville">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Neville</NameTxt>
      <P>The report also envisages the closure of the St. John's Hospital, a private facility, and the reconstruction and extension of the regional hospital as the setting for the various closed facilities. The cost of these proposals alone would be prohibitive. At a meeting of the Joint Committee on Health and Children last week, Mr. Hanly stated that for the report to be effective, it would be necessary to implement its main parts by 2005. His statement is on the record. Will it be possible to implement the main elements of the report within two years?</P>
      <P>The Minister is aware that the Irish Hospital Consultants Association has stated it will not be feasible to implement the Hanly report in the mid-west. It points out that patients will be permanently on trolleys when the first hospital restructuring pilot scheme is implemented and the Mid-West Regional Hospital in Limerick becomes the main centre for all acute patients. The consultants warn that this will lead to a bed occupancy rate of 104% in the hospital unless the Department provides substantial capital funding for a large number of new beds there. Does the Minister propose to allocate substantial capital funding before 2005 to ensure implementation of the report can take place, or are the consultants not able to calculate the number of hospital beds needed to implement the proposals?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Research carried out by the Irish Hospital Consultants Association shows that patients will be permanently on trolleys if the bed capacity prob<Col N="648" /> lem is not addressed. The IHCA also states there is no point in introducing the plan if the bed capacity issue is not addressed and calls on the Department to start delivering on the 3,000 beds promised in the health strategy two years ago. It is not feasible, according to the consultants, to implement the report in the mid-west region due to current bed capacity, which is a vote of no confidence by the Irish Hospital Consultants Association in the implementation of the pilot project in the mid-west region.</P>
    <P>Furthermore, the Irish Hospital Consultants Association notes that the Mid-West Regional Hospital will not be able to cope with the extra capacity because already last year its accident and emergency department dealt with 55,000 people. I visited the department this week and, like other hospital accident and emergency units, it is chock-a-block. The report proposes to increase the level of activity in this department by changing the level of activity undertaken in Nenagh and Ennis and transferring services to the Mid-West Regional Hospital. The required capacity is not available. In addition, according to the Hanly report, this must happen before 2005, which is impossible.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatBreen" hpid="Mr. P. Breen Mr. P. Breen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Breen</NameTxt>
      <P>The public is sceptical of the Government's commitment to the health service, every sector of which is in crisis. In the Mid-Western Health Board region, for example, waiting lists for orthodontic treatment are growing alarmingly, with a 20% rise in the number of children in County Clare waiting for public dental treatment. Unless parents are fortunate enough to be able to afford private care, their child must continue to go untreated for years which often results in the problem worsening. In some cases, children never get to see an orthodontist. The Minister should put himself in the position of a parent whose child is told that his or her teeth are not sufficiently crooked to warrant immediate treatment. How does a parent tell a child that he or she cannot afford private treatment and must wait because this uncaring Government has failed to deliver real reform in the orthodontic service?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The recently published Hanly report will have severe consequences for the people of the Mid-Western Health Board region, particularly in Ennis and Nenagh where the general hospitals will be downgraded to local hospitals without accident and emergency departments. As the Minister is aware, accident and emergency departments are the backbone of hospitals which serve populations of more than 100,000 people. The people of County Clare believed the Minister and local Members of the Oireachtas, including Deputy Killeen, when they promised before the previous election that the upgrade of Ennis General Hospital would proceed. They believed the wards, the accident and emergency, radiology and out-patients departments and general infrastruc<Col N="649" /> ture would be upgraded. Last week, when I raised this matter on the Adjournment, it was noticeable that the Minister failed to mention it in his reply. Why was this the case?</P>
    <P>To make matters worse, the Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children, Deputy Tim O'Malley, who represents a neighbouring constituency, told a local radio station last week that he knew nothing about the upgrading of the hospital. He had to release a press statement later the same day confirming there was a development control plan in place for the hospital. Is this the type of communication that takes place between the Minister and his junior colleague? If it is, the health service is in poor hands.</P>
    <P>The Hanly report states that our ambulance service needs to be upgraded. Where is the money to fund this recommendation? In the early 1990s, the Mid-Western Health Board published an ambulance report in which new ambulance stations operating a 24 hour service were promised. We are still waiting for them in County Clare. A journey for any patient in an ambulance is a traumatic experience regardless of how short it is, as one feels every bump. The Minister should put himself in the position of a patient in the west Clare peninsula who has a coronary attack. If the Hanly report is implemented, the person in question will have to endure a journey of 80 miles to Limerick Regional Hospital bypassing Ennis General Hospital. This is not progress but a dangerous experiment. The Minister is playing with people's lives.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to mark the date of 15 November in his diary. This is the day on which the mother of all battles will commence. The people of County Clare will march through the streets of Ennis as they did in 1828 when they turned out to greet Daniel O'Connell. They will show this uncaring Government their opposition to the Hanly report's proposals to downgrade Ennis General Hospital. The Government's policy of shutting down vital accident and emergency departments in our small hospitals is not reform but a backward step. These departments are critical to patients' welfare and survival.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ArthurMorganSF" hpid="Mr. Morgan Mr. Morgan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morgan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to raise the case of Scoil Uí Mhuirí, Dunleer, County Louth, a school built in 1954 with four classrooms to cater for 60 students. A total of 49 years later there are 354 students and the four original classrooms are supplemented by two other classrooms, 14 prefabricated classrooms and one prefabricated staff room. There are now 26 teachers at the school.</P>
      <P>The 354 students still have only the toilets built for the 60 students in 1954. That is hardly progress. Could any Minister be proud of this situation, given the huge economic growth the State has experienced? In all weathers, including freezing wet winter days, students and teachers have to go outdoors to move between classes. The prefabricated classrooms are unsuitable. They are freezing in winter and stuffy and hot in summer. Two of the prefabricated classrooms have problems with rotting windows. There are electrical cables all over the place and they represent a great danger. Pupils have nowhere to put their bags and coats as there is no room for lockers.</P>
      <P>When I visited the school recently, the principal showed me a file three inches thick with correspondence with former Ministers for Education and Science, from former Deputy Gemma Hussey to Senator O'Rourke, promising a new building for the school. Those campaigning for a new school have met every Minister for Education and Science since 1983. How can the teachers of Scoil Uí Mhuirí explain to students the reason they are being denied equal access to education as a result of the deplorable conditions at the school? How can they instil confidence in their students in the functioning of the State when they hold innumerable letters from Ministers making promises that have long been broken? Is the practice of Ministers making promises that they will not keep honourable behaviour?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What has happened to the new school building promised to the people of Dunleer over 20 years ago? The plans have been with the Department since May 2002 and are just awaiting the go-ahead. The site has already been acquired. Have <Col N="651" /> I to tell parents that their children will have to face another winter with no idea when the school will be replaced? The Minister should not give an evasive answer but outline a time frame within which the construction of the new school will proceed. In a reply I received today from the Minister to a parliamentary question I submitted on this issue he stated budgetary provisions for 2004 and subsequent years would determine the rate of progression to tender and construction of these projects. This is not good enough.</P>
    <P>The Government must make a clear commitment to provide the funding for capital investment in education in order that all children of the State will be able to access education on an equal basis. Natural justice and basic rights require it. Teachers, children and their parents are entitled to nothing less. The Minister's reply to my question further illustrates the point made by the Comptroller and Auditor General in his report for 2002 that the absence of multi-annual funding is a significant obstacle to providing time frames for delivery of work under the schools building programme. The coalition Government's record on the programme is shameful. It has been suggested that it will take 40 years to complete it as it stands. Scoil Uí Mhuirí has waited 20 years. Am I to tell the people of the area that they must wait a further 20 years?</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children (Mr. T. O'Malley)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad that the Deputy has given me the opportunity to outline the current position on the allocation of funding for school building projects. The 2003 capital programme was published in January 2003 and full details of individual projects are available on the Department of Education and Science website at <i>www.education.ie</i>.</P>
      <P>The Department of Education and Science has already accepted that there is a need to provide additional accommodation for students of Scoil Uí Mhuirí in County Louth. The large-scale building project for the school is listed in section 6 of the 2003 schools building programme as being at stage 5 of architectural planning, pre-tender documents. It has been assigned a band 2 rating by the Department in accordance with the published criteria for prioritising large-scale projects. Projects listed in sections 6 and 7 will not be authorised to progress beyond their current stage of architectural planning at this time. Budgetary provisions in 2004 and subsequent years will determine the rate of progression to tender and construction of these projects in conjunction with the band rating individually assigned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Department has been in touch with the school regarding additional works required. The school has advised that there is a problem with the windows in one or two of the prefabricated <Col N="652" /> classrooms, on which a report has been requested.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGuinness</NameTxt>
      <P>Most road construction projects now attract a huge amount of opposition. They certainly attract a number of queries and create great concern in local communities. In fact, given their physical nature, they often divide local communities. As a result, there is serious tension during the planning process.</P>
      <P>That is the situation with the scheme being undertaken on the N9 at Maddoxtown in Kilree. Tension has crept into the debate because of the role of the Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources and the quarry located in the area. Local people are anxious to clarify the objections of the Department and the issue of the quarry. They want to know the argument being made by the Department to have the route removed and a new one established. The local community is also anxious to hear the Department's case about the compensation requested. It is unusual for the Department of Transport to undertake a road construction project only to have another Department object to the preferred route and demand a compensation package.</P>
      <P>It is particularly important that the Minister outline the Department's case. As is the case with all such projects, there is a compensation issue. If the Department is responsible for moving the preferred route and has a compensation argument, that same argument could be taken up and used by all land users. They would have a legitimate right to use that argument because the same mineral runs under much of the land outside the quarry site.</P>
      <P>The community has raised a number of questions with the Department. It is anxious that it state its case surrounding the Dunbell quarry; if it is likely that the quarry lease will be extended beyond 2008 and beyond the lands at the southern boundary of the site; if the lease will be renewed and if the Department has entered into negotiations about it. According to a note I received from the Department, the Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources entered into negotiations with Kilkenny County Council and that is where the objection to the preferred route emerged. The note states the Department's exploration and mining division in January 2002 was in discussions regarding the 15 million tonnes of dolomite in the land affected. On 29 August 2002 the Department was formally objecting to the scheme. What meetings took place after that date? Has the Department made any effort with the engineers involved to deal with the problems emerging? Were there meetings between the exploration and mining division of the Department and Kilkenny County Council this year?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="653" />I am anxious that the Minister put the information surrounding these queries into the public domain. Perhaps he will use the opportunity afforded to him in this Adjournment debate to explain in detail the stance being taken by his Department.</P>
    <P>Will the Minister of State attempt to allay the fears in that area regarding his objections to the preferred route in the first place? That information could perhaps be used by the landowners now affected on route number three to see if they have the appropriate minerals so that they can use the same argument. The issue should be dealt with in the context of compensation because what is sauce for the goose is sauce for the gander. If a sizeable compensation package is there for the Department, the same figures can be used to compensate farmers and other landowners for the land they will have to dispose of for the construction of this road project. The Minister of State should use this opportunity to give a comprehensive reply to deal with the issues that have been raised by the community in that area.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TimOMalleyPD" hpid="Mr. T. O'Malley Mr. T. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>The claim for compensation arose as a result of a section of a proposed roadway being routed through an existing dolomite mine and also through an area which included significant reserves of dolomite. Dolomite is a mineral for which a lease is required from the exploration and mining division of the Department before it can be extracted and the State receives royalties for each tonne of the mineral extracted. Dolomite is used as building stone and as a refractory for furnace linings. The claim for compensation is based on the loss of revenue from royalties as a result of the proposed road being routed through land which includes mineral deposits, thus sterilising exploitation and extraction of those minerals.</P>
      <P>It is Government policy to promote investment in mining and in minerals exploration that is compatible with sustainable development. That compatibility is pursued by taking adequate measures to protect the environment, creating jobs, producing raw materials essential to modern lifestyles and industry at economic cost, and using some of the wealth generated by the extraction of minerals to support regional development and infrastructure.</P>
      <P>County councils are requested to take account of Government policy in relation to mineral development in their county development plans. It is accepted that Kilkenny County Council's development plan complies entirely with Government policy on mining issues.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is no secret that the mining industry is going through a hard time at present and there is a significant downturn in global exploration and mining. It is, therefore, all the more urgent to encourage environmentally sound mineral extraction and maximise revenue so that we can continue to <Col N="654" /> market our services and attract inward investment in the industry.</P>
    <P>On the actual road proposals, the initial preferred design was routed through an existing mine site at Maddoxtown, leased by the Department to a private operator. This lease expires in December 2008 and the likelihood is that the operator will seek a new lease in respect of the additional significant unexploited mineral reserves south of the existing mine.</P>
    <P>The Department had notice of the proposals and was anxious to put its case to Kilkenny County Council for preservation of the valuable mineral deposits, which could exceed 30 million tonnes. To that end, a meeting took place in January 2002 at which the Department's statutory position and general Government policy on minerals extraction were outlined. Subsequently, the Department wrote to Kilkenny County Council in August 2002 formally objecting to any road proposals which would sterilise any present or future minerals development.</P>
    <P>This was followed by several other meetings at which the question of compensation in respect of future royalties lost as a result of sterilisation of minerals was discussed. Kilkenny County Council and its consultants produced revised designs showing the proposed road avoiding the existing working mine but still running through future mineral reserves.</P>
    <P>On this basis, the compensation claim would come to at least &euro;2 million in a best possible scenario for Kilkenny County Council and the National Roads Authority. The figure could be higher with different road configuration and associated corridors. Kilkenny County Council unveiled a number of options for the proposed route at a public meeting on 22 October last and I understand that one of the options included a proposed route which completely excluded the mineral reserves area.</P>
    <P>The overall goal for exploration and mining is to stimulate discovery of economic mineral deposits and to maximise the contribution of the mining sector to the national economy, with due regard to its impact on the environment. A claim for compensation for the loss of revenue as a result of sterilisation of minerals is well founded. Any sterilisation of minerals will result in a loss of future income to the Exchequer from its minerals estate and the loss should be reflected in the true cost of the road project.</P>

    <Title>Report of Inspector of Mental Hospitals.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="DanNeville" hpid="Mr. Neville Mr. Neville">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Neville</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to raise this important issue with regard to the findings of the inspector of mental hospitals for the year ending 31 December 2002. The inspector has been particularly disappointed at the failure of three psychiatric general hospitals to open as planned in 2002.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="655" />I ask the Minister of State to outline the reason an attempt was made to requisition the unit at St. Luke's Hospital, Kilkenny, designed and funded for acute in-patient psychiatric services for short-term usage for medical beds. The inspector has stated that he does not fully understand the reason this has not been opened and I ask the Minister of State to outline the position.</P>
    <P>Will the Minister of State also outline why, on completion of a unit in Portlaoise General Hospital for psychiatric patients mid-way through last year, it was taken over for other purposes for what was termed &ldquo;a limited period&rdquo; but which has run into 2003? Although ready and handed over, the unit in Castlebar Regional Hospital was likewise not opened in 2002. These are issues of serious neglect in the promised commitment to improve facilities for psychiatric patients.</P>
    <P>The inspector again raised inequalities in the delivery of mental health services. The report outlines that psychiatric resources, rather than being concentrated in areas of greatest need, have been developed in areas of greatest affluence. The absence of an up-to-date national mental health strategy for services development is one of the main causes of the current inequalities in resource distribution.</P>
    <P>There is no national strategy, which has led to a situation where there is very limited availability of specialist services. There is an urgent need for forward planning of mental health services to avoid <i>ad hoc</i> and inequitable resource distribution, as highlighted by the inspector of mental hospitals.</P>
    <P>The health service's neglect of long-stay psychiatric patients, in ensuring their rights and treatment, must be addressed as a matter of urgency. Why, for example, do long-stay patients not participate in the BreastCheck programme in areas where these services have already become available to the general public? Why do some medical consultants refuse to admit patients to beds unless a psychiatric nurse accompanies them from their parent hospital, even though, as the inspector has stated, this is completely unnecessary clinically?</P>
    <P>It is not acceptable that the intellectually disabled and others from mental institutions who have difficulties in feeding themselves, and who have been transferred to a general hospital, are subject to the food being delivered through the stomach wall by a tube because general hospital staff consider they do not have time to spoon feed such dependent and disabled patients. Some of these have returned to their psychiatric locations with the tube mechanism still in place. These examples of neglect of the psychiatric health services are an affront to the personal dignity of psychiatric patients and should not be tolerated in our society.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="656" />One of the central difficulties facing the mentally ill and those tasked with providing for them is the fact that many have become homeless. Homelessness leads to a rupture of contact with services, to petty criminality, contact with law enforcement agencies and, apart from damage to the patients themselves, it gives community care a bad name. With the increase of mobility of young persons and greater co-morbidity of major mental illness with substance abuse, the numbers of mentally ill people who are homeless has increased. It is of vital importance that this problem is tackled on two main fronts by providing housing and by outreach services from psychiatry working in concert and other relevant agencies.</P>
    <P>Reports of the inspector of mental hospitals over the years have highlighted the total unacceptability of placing intellectually disabled persons in psychiatric hospitals. It is a disgrace that this practice is still continuing. The practice of continued care of intellectually disabled patients in long-stay psychiatric facilities is inappropriate and the inspector's reports over the years have recommended their transfer to appropriate services to enable them to obtain the skilled and specialised care not generally available in psychiatric hospitals. It is still extremely disappointing that the most recent report continued to express concern about this situation.</P>
    <P>The inspectorate remains deeply unhappy with the general level of documentary recording in our mental health institutions. Case record structures are extremely poor. Records are disorganised and fundamental information is often missing. It is often impossible to ascertain the date of a patient's admission to or discharge from in-patient care or to determine from the case notes the patient's legal status.</P>
    <P>There were 13 suicides or suspected suicides during 2002, of which nine were in hospital grounds. Three were by patients who were on unauthorised leave and one by a person on patient leave. There is extreme concern about this issue in our area. One of those suicides was by hanging and it happened in September last year. It requires immediate investigation. A young man died by hanging in the same unit on 25 October this year.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Neville for raising this matter on the Adjournment. I welcome the publication of the 2002 report of the inspector of mental hospitals and acknowledge the important role the inspector plays in providing an accurate and detailed account of services in the mental health sector throughout the country. The inspector has had a remarkable influence on improving the standards of care in our mental health services.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In his report the inspector is complimentary of the developments in mental health care in all health boards and highlights the many improve<Col N="657" /> ments which have taken place in the care of the mentally ill in recent years. At the same time the inspector provides an indication of the nature of the problems still to be overcome. I met the inspector recently to discuss his report and to elicit his views about the areas of the mental health services that require improvement. The inspector informed me that steady progress is being made across the country in the move towards an integrated, community-based mental health service, but that much remains to be done.</P>
    <P>In his report the inspector refers to the ongoing replacement of old institutional mental hospitals with acute psychiatric units attached to general hospitals. He expresses disappointment at the failure of the newly constructed psychiatric units at Portlaoise General Hospital and Castlebar Regional Hospital to open as planned in 2002. However, I am pleased to inform the House that both of these units will open shortly. I also inform Deputy Neville that the unit in Kilkenny has already been opened this year. The construction of the new acute psychiatric units at James Connolly Memorial Hospital, Blanchardstown and at St. Vincent's Hospital is also nearing completion.</P>
    <P>I remind Deputy Neville that industrial relations problems play an important part in terms of opening such units. Industrial relations issues have also delayed the movement of patients from the old institutions into the community, as recommended by the inspector. Given that the Deputy is aware of such issues, I ask him to support the Department in trying to expedite the process.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>The health board was willing to accept the recommendations. Consequently, 37 patients in St. Joseph's Hospital in Limerick have been unable to move out into the community for the past two or three years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The inspector also welcomed the considerable reinforcement of various sub-specialties within psychiatry with the appointment of additional consultants in later life psychiatry, child and adolescent psychiatry, forensic psychiatry, rehabilitation psychiatry and liaison psychiatry in general hospitals. It is my intention to facilitate the service providers in bringing about the improvements and developments identified by the inspector as quickly as possible. Additional revenue <Col N="658" /> funding of &euro;7.6 million was provided this year for ongoing developments in mental health services.</P>
    <P>The inspector welcomed the establishment of the Mental Health Commission in April 2002. The commission will be the main vehicle for the implementation of the provisions of the new Mental Health Act 2001. It is an independent statutory body whose primary functions are to promote, foster and encourage the establishment and maintenance of high standards and good practices in the delivery of mental health services and to protect the interests of people who are detained for psychiatric care and treatment. The commission will arrange for an independent review by a mental health tribunal of all decisions to detain a patient on an involuntary basis and each decision to extend the duration of such detentions. The commission's independent status will be crucial in driving the agenda for change and modernisation in the mental health services in the coming years.</P>
    <P>In his 2002 report the inspector of mental hospitals notes the continuing decline in the number of patients in psychiatric in-patient facilities from 4,256 at the end of 2001 to 3,966 at the end of 2002. Approximately 11% of all admissions to psychiatric hospitals and units in 2002 were involuntary admissions. Ireland has a significantly higher rate of involuntary admission than other European countries. However, it is anticipated that the full implementation of the Mental Health Act 2001, with its more stringent procedures for involuntary detention, will significantly reduce the number of involuntary admissions, bringing practice in this country more into line with the rest of Europe.</P>
    <P>I assure the Deputy that while I am pleased with the scale of the progress being made in many of the services, I concur with the inspector's view that much remains to be done in providing a service which will enhance the quality of care of those suffering from mental illness. I am fully committed to endeavouring that the recommendations made in the inspector's report for 2002 are followed up as soon as possible.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB" hpid="Ms Burton Ms Burton">
      <NameTxt>Ms Burton</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform for coming into the House this evening. I challenge him to show some sense of ministerial responsibility for the crisis in policing which is engulfing communities in Dublin 15 and other parts of Dublin West.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to highlight three recent examples of criminal events in Dublin West. The first is the shooting dead of a man in a pub in Corduff in front of drinkers. The second is the vicious assault on a young teacher at his home in Castlecurragh in Dublin 15 during an attempted car robbery and the third is the armed hijacking of a car from the <Col N="659" /> front door of a female health worker as she returned to her home in Dublin 15.</P>
    <P>This is just an ordinary time in Dublin West. Many families are left devastated, while young thugs ride high with a sense of impunity as they believe themselves to be the untouchables. Despite repeated requests to the Minister for a dedicated community policing force in Dublin 15 and other similar neighbourhoods, nothing has happened. Every time we get community police, they are withdrawn a few months later &ndash; they have to check cattle or something like that. Given the huge population growth in the area and the fact that thousands of new homes are being built, crime is exploding and taxpaying citizens, who are trying to get on with their lives, feel under threat.</P>
    <P>During the summer I was advised by Fingal county manager, Mr. William Soffe, of the type of anti-social and criminal behaviour being experienced by residents of two new estates in Castlecurragh and Blanchardstown Heath. It included windows being broken by youths and children throwing stones, drinking in private rear gardens without the owners' permission, verbal abuse and harassment, urinating in apartment doorways and sitting on apartment window ledges, burning of wheelie bins, damaged cars and other property, theft and joyriding. The county manager said that the council and the residents had reported these complaints to local gardaí. It is interesting to note that some complainants who called the gardaí for assistance were advised that they were powerless to act and that it was a matter for the council to resolve, given the location in which anti-social element resides.</P>
    <P>The council, as part of its response, has arranged stone picking expeditions at regular intervals to remove potential ammunition from the area. If that is the only thing the people of Dublin 15 can rely on for protection, it is small wonder that many people now believe the Minister, who was once so vocal, should give some consideration to resigning his position.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform famously used to talk about the nurse married to the garda and how important it was that they could afford a home. By working all the hours God sends the couple can just about afford a home under the Government but what they cannot get from it is the type of policing service to which they are entitled as taxpayers. A dedicated local community police force, giving the thugs no breathing space, is the key to successful local policing worldwide and enabling people to reclaim the streets and estates for decent, law-abiding citizens. The Minister knows this but chooses to ignore it. As long ago as last February I asked him for complete details of community policing numbers in Dublin Garda stations and <Col N="660" /> total active policing numbers in these stations. I am still waiting for his reply.</P>
    <P>Other measures to combat violence and anti-social behaviour include investment in education and the community. Preventing young boys, especially, from dropping out of school early by providing community based education and alternatives to formal second level education is critical to reducing anti-social behaviour. Community employment schemes which provide local facilities in clubs and sports for children are also important. Needless to say, these are precisely the areas the Government has decided to damage with budgetary cutbacks.</P>
    <P>The drugs problem in Dublin 15 has significantly worsened in recent times, with cocaine use spiralling upwards rapidly. This is in contrast to the dinner parties in Ranelagh mentioned by one prominent television commentator. According to local gardaí, many young people are now taking a lethal combination of cocaine and alcohol which can lead to devastating consequences. It can result in feelings of paranoia and aggression and is a key contributory factor in late night street violence. The challenge to the Minister and his Government colleagues is to manage Garda resources in order that communities can rebuild some confidence in policing. So far the Minister has not lived up to this challenge.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. McDowell Mr. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. McDowell)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Deputy for raising this matter. As I made clear earlier today in response to private notice questions on a separate matter, the message that must go out from this House and all of the parties in it is that no one is beyond the reach of the law and that whatever must be done to bring offenders to justice will be done.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will be conscious that much of what she has said could not have been anticipated by reference to the issue of which she gave notice. Therefore, I can only deal with some of the issues she mentioned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB" hpid="Ms Burton Ms Burton">
      <NameTxt>Ms Burton</NameTxt>
      <P>The issues were listed in detail.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. McDowell Mr. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy's question was about three particular incidents which are deeply disturbing and each of which is very serious from the point of view of the community and also the victim. I am glad the Deputy has mentioned this form of criminal behaviour in the House. The shooting dead of a man in a pub is an example of an aspect of gang-related crime which is hugely threatening to our society. I also accept the Deputy's point that the armed hijacking of a car from a female householder is probably a manifestation of the same problem. Similarly, the outrageous attack on the young teacher who tried to protect his own property outside his house is something which cannot be countenanced in any circumstances.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="661" />The Deputy goes on to say these incidents require a new approach. I have been informed by the Garda authorities that the investigation of the murder mentioned by the Deputy is at an advanced stage. I must reiterate the point I made earlier today: the fact that somebody has not been arrested and charged does not mean the Garda is not doing anything. In order to sustain the case it is not sufficient to have a good idea of who was involved. There must be admissible evidence before one can charge a person with an offence such as this. Six people have been arrested and questioned about the assault case mentioned by the Deputy and a file is being prepared for the Director of Public Prosecutions. The Garda has done its job in this case. The hijacking incident to which the Deputy referred is also under keen investigation.</P>
    <P>I caution all Deputies that speculation in this House about any crime or the state of the Garda investigation thereof is somewhat risky in that it can prejudice the successful outcome of the prosecution of the case if it comes before a court. I cannot comment in detail about the three incidents mentioned by the Deputy in her request for an Adjournment debate. However, the suggestion that nothing is happening, that the Garda is doing nothing and has no idea what is going on&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is now talking about the absence of community police. It is wrong to suggest that because one has not read of a trial pending, the Garda is not doing its job. It is doing its job in the case of the three incidents the Deputy has raised.</P>
      <P>I announced last night that I intended, in the light of recent events, to review the adequacy of legislative provisions, resource allocations and administrative practice to find out what changes were required to deal with the emergence of gang-related crime and its interaction with the criminal justice system. I ask every Deputy to participate in this exercise and come forward with his or her ideas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy has constantly mentioned and tabled questions about community policing. However, it seems to mean different things at different times. Some think of community policing as the community garda but I do not think the Deputy holds that view. She is talking about policing of the community by a local police force. I do not know what distinctions she is drawing <Col N="662" /> between that form of policing and what is happening.</P>

      <P>I did not interrupt the Deputy. I am saying different forms of crime require different responses.

      <P>The Garda is doing a good job. It is doing its level best to combat all incidences of crime. Many of the matters to which the Deputy referred also involve the community. She should remember that stones are not being thrown through windows by organised criminals but by unsupervised children. Parents must respect their obligations to society. One cannot simply say to the Garda that it is its duty in every community to sort out every aspect of delinquency.</P>

I will quite happily arrange for a meeting between her and Garda management in order that she can explain <Col N="663" /> exactly what she wants and what she does not want, what she thinks community policing is and what it is not. We will then see whether it is a proper response to homicides in pubs, hijackings <Col N="664" /> of cars and beatings of people whose cars are being stolen.</P>

      <P>In his address to their annual delegate conference on Wednesday, 8 October, the president of PDFORRA made reference to the subject matter of this question. However, his remarks made no allegation of abuse of military law or regulations.</P>
      <P>Military disciplinary procedures are provided for in regulations made by the Minister for Defence. These regulations provide that an individual can be charged with a disciplinary offence and that this charge can be disposed of by the company commander. The individual has a right of appeal to higher authority or ultimately to have the issue referred to court martial. The system also provides for charges dealt with at local level by review by a legal officer.</P>
      <P>These procedures have been fully applied in this instance and have resulted in the findings by the company commander being cancelled and the entry in the records of the individual being expunged. I am advised by the military authorities that the individual concerned is satisfied with the outcome. This clearly illustrates the checks and balances that are contained in the disciplinary procedures which ensure a fair outcome and guards against any possibility of abuse.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Defence (Mr. M. Smith)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 129, 166, 170 and 171 together.</P>
      <P>On 24 September 2003, the Government authorised, subject to Dáil approval, the dispatch of a contingent of the Permanent Defence Force for service with the United Nations Mission in Liberia, UNMIL. I expect to move the necessary enabling resolution in the House tomorrow.</P>
      <P>UNMIL was established under UN Security Council Resolution 1509 of 19 September 2003. The resolution authorised the deployment, under Chapter VII of the UN Charter, of up to 15,000 military personnel, together with up to 250 military observers, 1,115 civilian police officers and a civilian component, for a period of 12 months.</P>
      <P>UNMIL's mandate is extremely comprehensive. It includes monitoring implementation of the ceasefire and the comprehensive peace agreement between the government and rebel forces. It also includes assisting the disarmament, demobilisation, reintegration, and repatriation, DDRR, of all armed parties, providing security at key government installations and at vital infrastructure, and protecting UN staff, facilities and civilians. UNMIL will assist in provision of humanitarian assistance and the promotion of human rights. Other tasks include assisting the transitional Government in developing a strategy to consolidate governmental institutions with a view to holding free and fair elections by October 2005.</P>
      <P>The proposed Irish contingent will comprise a motorised infantry battalion, of some 430 personnel and a small number of additional personnel who will be deployed at force headquarters and as military observers. It is also proposed to deploy personnel from the Army ranger wing, for a three month period, at the request of the UN. The final composition of a Defence Forces contingent to UNMIL is currently being determined following a recent detailed reconnaissance by a Defence Forces team to the mission area, which took place from 16 to 21 October 2003.</P>
      <P>The <i>LE Niamh</i> was tasked with providing support to the reconnaissance party. This support entailed sealift for vehicles and necessary logistical support required by the reconnaissance group. The <i>LE Niamh</i> also provided security, accommodation and communications support to the group.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="667" />UNMIL will operate under Chapter VII of the UN Charter, which means that the force will have authorisation to take all necessary measures to fulfil its mandate. It is envisaged that the Irish contingent will operate as the force commander's rapid reaction reserve. The role of the Irish personnel will be the provision of an immediate response capability which could deploy without delay in the mission area in sufficient strength and with the required level of force to provide a swift and decisive military reaction to any crisis situation.</P>
    <P>Deployment to UNMIL would take place in November-December 2003. It would be the largest deployment of Irish troops on a UN mission since UNIFIL. Initial deployment would be for one year, with a possible extension thereafter, subject to renewal of the UN mandate and a satisfactory review of the mission.</P>
    <P>The Irish contingent is expected to be fully operational in theatre by mid December 2003. At the request of the UN, a small number of Irish personnel were deployed to the force headquarters last month.</P>
    <P>The safety of Irish personnel serving overseas is always of paramount concern. While no absolute guarantees can be given with regard to the safety of troops serving in missions it is the policy and practice to ensure that Defence Forces personnel are adequately trained and equipped to carry out their mission. Troops selected for overseas service undergo a rigorous programme of training and this will be the case in respect of personnel selected for service with UNMIL.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Defence (Mr. M. Smith)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government has committed to an ambitious scale of delivery of affordable housing coming through the new affordable housing initiative under Sustaining Progress and through existing affordable housing schemes. The announcement in July this year of the proposed release of Department of Defence lands at Magee Barracks, Kildare and Gormanston, County Meath, as well as a number of sites in the administration of the Office of Public Works, was a critical first step in ensuring early delivery of affordable housing under this initiative which is a matter for my colleague, the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Officials in the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government have met officials from my Department and the relevant local authorities in relation to the two sites as it is envisaged that the local authorities will <Col N="668" /> have an important role in ensuring delivery of affordable housing at these sites. Work on implementing this initiative is progressing as a priority and this is firm evidence of the Government's determination to making measurable progress in the implementation of this initiative by the mid-term review of Sustaining Progress, in mid-2004.</P>
    <P>The Government is now working with the parties to the pay agreement to define the precise terms of the initiative, including the eligibility criteria. As the Taoiseach has indicated, the Government is looking at the potential to release further State land for this initiative and a series of meetings have been held with other Government Departments in this regard.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Defence (Mr. M. Smith)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 131, 152 and 162 together.</P>
      <P>A contract has been signed with Bombardier Aerospace for the purchase of a Bombardier Learjet 45 light business jet for the ministerial air transport service. The Learjet will replace a 23 year old Beech Super King Air aircraft. The cost of the aircraft, including training and spares, is &euro;8.4 million, excluding VAT. The cost of the aircraft is being funded from savings achieved from the 2003 Defence Vote provision for personal injury compensation. The acceptance and delivery of the aircraft will take place in December 2003. No other aircraft is being leased in the interim. The maintenance package for the aircraft is expected to cost in the region of &euro;250,000 per annum.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="669" />The Learjet 45 will operate in tandem with the Gulfstream IV in providing a ministerial air transport Service for members of the Government. The use of the service requires the prior approval of the Taoiseach. The question of leasing other aircraft for the duration of the Irish Presidency of the EU is not being considered by my Department.</P>
    <P>The Learjet 45 is built to the highest standards. All aspects of the design, build and instrumentation of the aircraft are fully certified by the Federal Aviation Administration, FAA, in America. The aircraft is also fully certified by the European Joint Aviation Authorities and the Irish Aviation Authority.</P>
    <P>I am advised that there was a requirement for Bombardier to replace a part in the tail of the Learjet 45 aircraft which led to their grounding for a number of weeks. The matter has been dealt with to the satisfaction of the FAA and all aircraft are back flying. My Department was kept informed by Bombardier of the situation at all times. This issue has not had any bearing on the delivery schedule of the Learjet for the Air Corps which, as I have already mentioned, is due for acceptance and delivery in December 2003.</P>

      <Quest>if the two CASA aircraft are no longer available for ministerial transport as a result of objections raised by the EU; the number of occasions in each year since 1998 on which the aircraft was used for ministerial transport; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Defence (Mr. M. Smith)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am happy to say that no objections were raised by the EU in relation to the usage of the CASA aircraft. However, the Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources did receive a letter seeking clarification in relation to the CASA aircraft operations. A reply was issued to the EU setting out details regarding the usage of the CASA. There has been no further correspondence since then.</P>
      <P>The CASA aircraft is tasked primarily with fisheries protection. However, this aircraft is also deployed, from time-to-time, on search and rescue, pollution control, air ambulance, security and transport duties. In the search and rescue role, the CASA radar system provides a long-range search capability and top cover at the request of the coast guard. In the air ambulance role, it provides emergency transport of injured persons, transplants teams and donor organs, where time is of the essence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Usage of the CASA as a transport aircraft is very limited, representing on average approximately 2% of the total hours flown by the aircraft annually over the past five years. In 2002, usage of the CASA on transport duties accounted for less than 1% of its total flying hours. The number of occasions in each year since 1998 that the aircraft was used for ministerial transport is as fol<Col N="670" /> lows: 1998, two; 1999, 13; 2000, 12; 2001, 13; 2002, eight; and 2003, five &ndash; year to date.</P>
    <P>The Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources, as the Department with primary responsibility for fisheries protection, reports annually to the EU Commission on the relevant CASA outputs, e.g. the number of fisheries patrols, flying hours and vessel sightings etc. Service delivery is based on specified outputs and overall fisheries protection priorities, agreed each year with the Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 133 and 148 together.</P>
      <P>The Sikorsky S61 helicopter has been leased by the Irish Coast Guard from Canadian Helicopter Corporation Ireland, CHCI, pursuant to existing SAR contracts and has been tasked by the Irish Coast Guard to the Air Corps. CHCI provides and maintains the aircraft, while it is flown and operated by Air Corps personnel.</P>
      <P>The total cost of the S61 operation will amount to approximately &euro;16 million over three years. This includes a monthly leasing cost of &euro;86,056 &ndash; payment of which commenced on 18 October 2002 &ndash; and a monthly maintenance cost of &euro;165, 526 &ndash; payment of which commenced in mid-April, 2003.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The decision to cancel the tender competition for the acquisition of medium lift helicopters for the Air Corps in July 2002, was taken due to budgetary constraints which meant that the level of Defence expenditure had to be reduced. The programme was a very significant one, including as it did, the proposed purchase of three medium range helicopters for SAR, with the option for a further two helicopters for general purpose military transport. The Deputy will appreciate that I am not in a position to outline the actual cost of any particular helicopter as the tender compe<Col N="671" /> tition was cancelled and the acquisition of the helicopters did not take place.</P>
    <P>The decision to cancel the tender competition was an extremely difficult one for me. I am also aware of the acute disappointment felt by Air Corps personnel when the decision was announced. The lease of the S61, however, ensured that the Air Corps could retain its role in providing SAR services in the north-west upon the withdrawal of the Dauphin helicopter from that service.</P>
    <P>When the decision to cancel the tender competition was made, I asked my officials to initiate a review of the provision of helicopter services, in conjunction with the Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources, to determine how best to meet the State's obligations in search and rescue, while taking account of the current financial position.</P>
    <P>An interdepartmental working group was established to examine and consider alternative solutions to the funding issue, such as public private partnerships, with a view to providing medium lift helicopters for the Air Corps by other means. The PPP unit in the Department of Finance was also involved in assisting the working group in identifying and assessing possible solutions.</P>
    <P>In parallel with this, a joint military-civil board was established to review the overall rotary wing requirements for the Air Corps, in particular, the possible procurement of modern light utility helicopters for the Air Corps, to replace its current fleet of Alouettes and Gazelles. Obviously the procurement of light utility helicopters raises similar issues regarding funding options. Having regard to the need to prioritise asset requirements in the context of available resources, the advice of the working group on funding has been incorporated into the report of the joint civil-military board on rotary wing requirements which deals with both search and rescue and light utility helicopters. This report has been completed by the board and is currently the subject of detailed consideration by senior civil and military management in my Department. I expect the report to be submitted to me in due course.</P>
    <P>As the Deputy will appreciate, the costs of replacing the rotary aircraft of the Air Corps with modern aircraft would involve significant cost and can only be considered on the basis of prioritised requirements set down by the military authorities and agreed by my Department, having regard to available resources.</P>

      <P>As I indicated to the House on 15 May 2003 and 2 July 2003, investigations were conducted by the military police and the Garda into the circumstances surrounding the discovery on 15 April 2003 of an improvised explosive device &ndash; IED &ndash; on a grassy area inside the perimeter of Gormanstown camp. The IED, which was discovered by a member of the Defence Forces based in the camp, was disarmed by a Defence Forces explosives ordnance disposal, EOD, team. Sections of the IED were taken away for forensic examination by the Garda. The remainder was destroyed <i>in situ</i> by controlled explosion by the EOD team. I am advised that the investigation by the Garda is ongoing. The military police investigation cannot be finalised until the Garda investigation is completed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Defence (Mr. M. Smith)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 135, 144 and 154 together.</P>
      <P>I wish to address the issue of recent media reports of a proposed cut in 400 in the size of the Defence Forces. The reduction in Defence Forces' authorised numbers will be 250 and not 400, which will leave the strength of the Defence Forces at 10,500. The reduction will be phased over three years. On 30 September 2003, the most recent date for which figures are available, the actual total strength of the Permanent Defence Force was 10,456. Therefore, the question of any reduction in the numbers serving does not arise at this time. The figure of 250 is an element of the Government's response to changing financial circumstances. In last year's budget, my colleague, the Minister for Finance, announced a reduction of 5,000 in the overall size of the public service, to be achieved by the end of 2005.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="673" />In future, recruits in training will be provided for within the overall strength of 10,500. The current special provision for up to an additional 250 recruits in training will no longer apply. The Government remains fully committed to the policy of ongoing recruitment to ensure that an overall strength of 10,500 is achieved and maintained. I am not aware of any threatened action by PDFORRA over this matter. The taking of any form of industrial action is irreconcilable with military service and I am satisfied that the mechanisms available to the representative association through the Defence Forces' conciliation and arbitration scheme provide a framework within which issues of concern can be addressed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Defence (Mr. M. Smith)</NameTxt>
      <P>Since the launch of the most recent recruitment campaign, 1,066 personnel have been recruited into the Permanent Defence Force. Some 822 of these have been general service recruits, 142 officer cadets, 36 apprentices for the Air Corps and 66 from other direct entry competitions. Some 163 of the general service recruits have subsequently been discharged. An examination of an exit questionnaire completed in respect of each recruit prior to discharge from 2002 indicates that personnel left for varying reasons, including to take up civilian employment, to return to further education, unsuited to military life, domestic or family reasons.</P>
      <P>In 2002 a total of 4,234 applications were received for consideration for positions in the Permanent Defence Force. Of this figure, 2,750 were applications for general service recruitment. As a result, 500 general service recruits were enlisted, of whom 93 were subsequently discharged. In 2003 to date 3,708 applications have been received for positions in the Permanent Defence Force, of which 2,021 were for general service recruitment. As a result, to date this year, 322 general service recruits have been enlisted, of whom 70 were subsequently discharged. At present there are 151 recruits in training and it is hoped to enlist an additional 110 recruits before the end of the year.</P>
      <P>The number of applications received for cadetships in 2002 and 2003 was 1,047 and 1,111, respectively. As a result of the 2002 cadetship competition, 71 cadets were enlisted and from the 2003 cadetship competition 71 cadets commenced cadet training in the Curragh on 29 September 2003. Some 143 applications were received for apprenticeships in the Air Corps and, as a result, 17 Air Corps apprentices were enlisted on 23 September 2002. A total of 250 applications were received for the 2003 Air Corps apprenticeship competition which was advertised on 23 March 2003 and from this competition 19 Air Corps apprentices were enlisted on 1 September 2003.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In 2002 a total of 294 applications were received for direct entry competitions for appointments for medical officers, engineers, ordnance corps officers, watchkeeping officers, engine room officers, electrical and engine room artificers in the Naval Service and instrumentalists in the Army School of Music. As a result, 27 direct entry officers, 15 electrical and engine room artificers and eight instrumental<Col N="675" /> ists were appointed. Direct entry competitions for appointments for medical officers, engineers, watchkeeping officers, electrical officers, marine engineer officers and engine room artificers in the Naval Service along with instrumentalists in the Army School of Music and dental surgery assistants are currently being held. To date in 2003, a total of 326 applications have been received for direct entry competitions. As a result, 11 direct entry officers, along with two dental surgery assistants and three instrumentalists, have been appointed. It is expected that there will be further direct entry appointments throughout the year.</P>

To date 40 of these vehicles have been received and a further 25 vehicles are scheduled for delivery in 2004. The total cost of the programme is in the region of &euro;84 million. In addition to this programme, the Defence Forces has a requirement for a smaller light armoured vehicle, designated as a light tactical vehicle which can be used to protect troops engaged in peace support operations in areas where the larger Mowag APC would be inappropriate. For instance, the movement of one to three personnel in high risk confined areas and general surveillance work are among the key roles of the vehicle. Funding for this programme must be considered in the context of the larger APC pro<Col N="679" /> gramme and the changed financial situation and it has been agreed with the military authorities that the programme for the acquisition of the vehicles will not proceed for the present. In the meantime, the Defence Forces will continue to conduct further studies in relation to the type and specification of vehicle required.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 142, 145, 153 and 207 together.</P>
      <P>On 8 October 2003, as Minister for Defence, I addressed my seventh annual delegate conference of the Permanent Defence Forces Other Ranks Representative Association, PDFORRA which, on this occasion, was held in Waterford. I sought to make my address relevant, positive and informative and discussed topics of interest to the military delegates, their colleagues and to the wider community. I believe that my address was well received by the assembled delegates. I am grateful to the Deputies for their interest in my address. I have arranged for copies of it to be forwarded to them for their information. The speech can also be assessed from the Department of Defence website &ndash;<i>www.defence.ie.</i> The Defence Forces' conciliation and arbitration scheme provides a forum for PDFORRA to formally raise, if it so wishes, any issues of concern raised by its members at the conference.</P>

      <P>My Department has accepted an offer from Florence Properties Limited for the sale of Clancy Barracks in Dublin. The legal formalities attendant on the sale have proven to be protracted, but it is hoped that progress will be achieved at an early date and the contract of sale signed. Pending the signing of the contract of sale, it would not be appropriate to comment on details of the sale.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 149 and 160 together.</P>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to report to the House on the discussions which took place at the informal meeting of Defence Ministers held in Rome on 3 and 4 October last. A number of such informal meetings have been held in recent years. The meetings have been a useful forum for discussions among Defence Ministers in the context of the development of the European security and defence policy, in particular the development of EU capabilities to carry out Petersberg Task operations. Discussions at the October meeting related to advancing the work done by successive EU Presidencies since the Helsinki headline goal was agreed in 1999. Key aspects discussed were ongoing efforts to improve the relationship between the EU and NATO; progress on the establishment of an agency in the field of defence capabilities as agreed at the Thessaloniki European Council in June 2003; and EU operations such as a prospective EU takeover of the UN-mandated NATO-led stabilisation operation in Bosnia Herzegovina.</P>
      <P>In addition, I attended a meeting with the Italian Presidency and the non-EU European countries, Iceland, Norway, Turkey, Romania and Bulgaria, during which representatives of those countries were briefed on our plenary discussions.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>The Garda Siochána has primary responsibility for law and order, including the protection of the internal security of the State. Among the roles <Col N="682" /> assigned to the Defence Forces is the provision of aid to the civil power, meaning in practice to assist the Garda Siochána when requested, which duties include the protection and guarding of vital installations, the provision of certain security escorts and so on. Consultation on roles and requirements for the EU Presidency is currently ongoing between the Garda Siochána and the Defence Forces, which will render such assistance as may be appropriate. Due to the importance of security for key EU Presidency meetings it would be inappropriate for me to indicate the nature and extent of any roles which the Defence Forces may undertake. As such, I do not propose to comment on equipment which has been or may be acquired by the Defence Forces in respect of the Presidency.</P>
    <P>As consultations between the Garda Siochána and the Defence Forces are at a very early stage, it is not possible to calculate the additional costs which may arise in respect of security duties pertaining to the Presidency.</P>

      <P>The Government is committed to a policy of equal opportunity for men and women in the Defence Forces, including the Reserve Defence Force, and to the full participation by women in all aspects of Defence Forces activities. Women are eligible for service in the Army, the Air Corps, the Naval Service and the Reserve Defence Force and to compete for promotion on an equal basis and under the same general conditions as those which apply to men. Female officers are generally being promoted at the same stage in their careers as male officers. All female personnel undergo the same training and receive the same military education as their male counterparts.</P>

      <P>The White Paper on Defence of February 2000 sets out a figure of 10,500 personnel for the Permanent Defence Force, comprising 930 for the Air Corps, 1,144 for the Naval Service and 8,426 for the Army. The strength of the Army, the Air Corps and the Naval Service as advised by the military authorities is provided in the form of a <Col N="684" /> tabular statement. The figures provided are as at 30 September 2003.</P>
      <P>The acquisition of new equipment, including transport, for the Defence Forces has been a key focus for me since my appointment to the Defence portfolio. Significant investment has taken place and I am satisfied that the Defence Forces are now well equipped for their day-to-day roles at home and overseas. However, while much has been done and a great deal has been achieved with regard to both equipment and infrastructure, I am aware that more needs to be done. Although expenditure programmes will now have to be more prioritised due to the changed financial situation, I will ensure that a substantial re-equipment programme will still go ahead to enhance the efficiency, professionalism and safety of the Defence Forces.</P>

      <P>There are four personal injury claims from relatives of the deceased arising out of this accident. In disposing of these claims I have always been mindful of the pain and suffering already endured by those involved. Three cases have been settled with the payment of damages, two of which were the subject of High Court orders. In view of the findings of a court of inquiry that no single factor in itself caused the crash of the Dauphin helicopter and that a chain of events resulted in the crash and unfortunate deaths of the crew, the State negotiated a settlement in each case. It would not be appropriate for me to comment on the outstanding case which remains <i>sub judice.</i></P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>On being discharged from the Permanent Defence Force, personnel are obliged to vacate married quarters within a short period of the dates of their discharge. The provision of housing is primarily a matter for the local authorities and <Col N="685" /> married military personnel have a claim on such housing which is equal to those of other members of the community in the same income category.</P>
    <P>The individuals overholding 51 married quarters at the Curragh camp were written to in August 2002 and requested to vacate the properties. To date, four of the quarters have been vacated and one other has been purchased by the occupant. A further eight of the properties, which are located at Orchard Park, have been offered for sale and four of those sales are being actively pursued by the occupants at present.</P>
    <P>Meetings have been held between officials of the Department and the overholders as well as with officials of Kildare County Council. In cases where houses have been offered for sale to overholders, the Department has requested the co-operation of Kildare County Council in ensuring that mortgages are made available to eligible applicants and some progress has been made in this regard. My Department is continuing to examine all options, including affordable housing and voluntary and co-operative housing schemes, for the rehousing of those overholders, who would in the normal way be eligible for local authority housing. Co-operative schemes are financed under the terms of the capital loan and subsidy scheme operated by the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government and the local authorities. Three quarters continue to be overheld at McKee Park and Arbour Hill in Dublin. The Department will remain in contact with the overholders pending resolution of the issue.</P>

      <P>The north-west search and rescue service was limited to inland and coastal rescue for a period of six hours on Wednesday, 2 July due to life jackets being beyond their service date. Standard procedures had not been complied with and action has been taken in this regard. The Air Corps has undertaken a quality audit of safety equipment, as a result of which further revised procedures for the storage, tracking, maintenance and use of such equipment have been put in place.</P>

      <P>I am aware that there has been a call for the reopening of the inquiry into the crash and death of the four airmen who died in the 1999 Dauphin crash. Two inquiries have been conducted: a military court of inquiry and an independent inquiry carried out by the air accident investigation unit of the Department of Transport immediately after the accident. The court of inquiry examined all the circumstances surrounding the establishment of the operation at Tramore, including the lead-in period. The findings of this court of inquiry have been made available to the families of the crew. As I have previously explained to the House, a small number of sections were deleted from the findings before they were released to the families, on foot of legal advice received.</P>
      <P>The purpose of the air accident investigation unit inquiry was to determine the circumstances and cause or causes of the accident in order to prevent future accidents. This investigation commenced immediately after the accident took place and a comprehensive report was published in September 2000. Urgent action was taken by my Department in the implementation of the 25 recommendations contained in the report. All these recommendations have now been implemented and a final report has been sent by my Department to the air accident investigation unit.</P>
      <P>The matter has been fully investigated and no information or evidence has been presented to me which would suggest that there was any substantive deficiency in the inquiries or investigations conducted into this tragic accident.</P>

      <P>Drug abuse has long been recognised as a serious and escalating problem in our society and while there have been relatively few instances of drug-related problems within the Defence Forces, it is recognised that the Defence Forces, as a component of the wider community, mirrors the community at large. The implications of drug abuse in an organ<Col N="687" /> isation in which personnel have access to firearms are too obvious to require elaboration.</P>
      <P>A compulsory substance testing programme was introduced on 1 February 2002 as part of a Defence Forces substance abuse programme, following a long consultative process involving the Office of the Attorney General, the Deputy Judge Advocate General and the Defence Forces representative associations. Prior to the launch of the programme, an education programme and awareness briefings were conducted throughout the Defence Forces. All personnel were issued with a booklet devised to inform them of the purpose of the new compulsory random drug testing programme, the administrative procedures involved and the sanctions for those who test positive. All necessary measures, including pre-enlistment screening, education, compulsory random drug testing, monitoring and sanctions, will be taken to maintain a drug-free environment within the Defence Forces.</P>
      <P>The primary objective of compulsory random drugs testing is deterrence. In order to provide a credible level of deterrent, the testing programme has been devised to maximise the possibility of random selection for testing. A trained drugs testing team is responsible for taking urine samples for compulsory random testing throughout the Defence Forces. Testing commenced on 14 November 2002 and the programme completed its first year of operation on 31 October 2003. The target of testing 10% of the Permanent Defence Force has been achieved. A member, randomly selected, may be required at any time to provide a urine sample which will be tested for evidence of use of controlled drugs or the abuse or misuse of other substances or for the detection of the metabolites thereof. A member who refuses to provide a urine sample or who provides a urine sample which tests positive shall be liable to retirement, discharge, relinquishment of commission or withdrawal of cadetship as appropriate under the provisions of Defence Forces regulations.</P>
      <P>A total of 1,086 members of all ranks have been tested to date. There have been four positive tests. As absolute confidentiality is an essential and integral component of the protocols surrounding the programme of compulsory random drugs testing, I do not propose to provide any further information on the four individuals who gave positive test results, other than that they are no longer members of the Defence Forces.</P>

      <P>On 15 January 2003 I approved, in principle, the report of the Reserve Defence Forces Review Implementation Board for the implementation of the recommendations of the special steering group on the Reserve, which had reported to me in September 1999.</P>
      <P>The Permanent Defence Force is now organised in a three-brigade structure and a Defence Forces training centre. The Reserve Defence Force will be similarly reorganised and restructured and it is envisaged that the implementation of these changes in the Reserve Defence Force will take place over a period of approximately six years.</P>
      <P>The White Paper on Defence recognised that a notable and important feature of the existing FCA organisation is its countrywide, geographical spread. This particular aspect will, in general terms, be retained in the future. The full organisational and establishment details of the new Reserve will be determined in the course of the ongoing detailed implementation process. Plans are currently being prepared within each brigade for the amalgamation of FCA units in line with the proposals outlined in the steering group report. The objective of this process is to ensure that better training and other facilities will be provided for members of the Reserve Defence Force. No decisions have yet been taken on the location of proposed newly amalgamated units but the military authorities have advised me that all proposed amalgamations will provide an optimal environment for personnel in the relevant areas to partake in the new enhanced Reserve Defence Force.</P>
      <P>Members of the FCA are already seeing the benefits of the reorganisation process in terms of better clothing and improved equipment and more and better quality training. As the process develops we will see additional benefits in terms of a clearer role for the Reserve, a better overall organisation structure and opportunities for suitably qualified Reserve personnel to serve overseas. We will also see benefits from the closer integration of the Reserve with the Army.</P>
      <P>I must emphasise I am mindful of the need to preserve and to retain the many traditional and well established strengths of the current Reserve system, not least the admirable spirit of individual voluntary commitment, close social links with local communities and a good depth and scope as regards nationwide geographical spread. No final decision on the amalgamation of FCA units will be taken until I have had the opportunity to examine and approve the final amalgamation proposals.</P>

      <P>The matter to which the Deputy refers is currently under investigation by the military police. This investigation is at an advanced stage and is expected to be concluded shortly. My understanding is that the device to which the Deputy refers was discovered following the use of the range, on a courtesy basis, by military personnel from the US Embassy. Military personnel are required to use their personal arms at least once a year and US Embassy personnel have used the army range on five occasions over the past five years in this regard.</P>
      <P>The arrangements for the use of the range are agreed in advance following a request from the US Embassy. The use of the range on the day is monitored and controlled by a range supervisor from the Defence Forces, in accordance with standing Defence Forces practices.</P>
      <P>Once the current investigation is completed, I will consider whatever recommendations may be made to me in relation to the ongoing management and control of military ranges.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Defence (Mr. M. Smith)</NameTxt>
      <P>The reorganisation of the medical corps, which was effected as part of the Defence Forces review implementation plan in November 1998, was embraced as an opportunity to redirect the focus of military medical care in the Defence Forces from a predominantly hospital based service to one in which primary, occupational and field support would continue to be further developed.</P>
      <P>At present, in addition to St. Bricin's Military Hospital, Dublin, three military medical facilities, MMFs, are located at the headquarters of each of the field medical companies in Cork and Athlone and at the medical detachment supply and services unit in the Curragh. They have associated infirmaries for the care of &ldquo;living-in&rdquo; personnel &ndash; largely recruits and other training course students &ndash; who may become injured or ill. There are appointments for a physician at each MMF.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are currently X-ray, pharmacy and screening audiometry facilities at each MMF and physiotherapy facilities at MMF Cork and Curragh. Nurses of the Army nursing service have <Col N="690" /> taken up new appointments as members of occupational care teams in the Air Corps and Naval Service and it is planned that more nurses will be offered similar appointments in the larger barracks throughout the country.</P>
    <P>Over the past number of years the medical corps has been unable to attract more than one or two medical officers per year into the service. Most of those who have joined have left after one or two years and the overall pattern is one of reducing rather than expanding numbers. Part of the difficulty in attracting applicants may be due to the unique nature of military medical officer appointments. Service in the medical corps is not a professional training employment similar to non-consultant hospital doctor appointments or vocational training schemes in general practice.</P>
    <P>The range of services provided by the medical corps is as follows: a military occupational medical service; a primary medical care service; a secondary medical care service; a preventive medical service; provision of medicines and dressings; dental services; a field medical service; training; maintenance of medical records; and medico-legal services. Where no military medical or dental officer is available arrangements are made for the provision of services by local civilian practitioners.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 169, 200, 201 and 205 together.</P>
      <P>On 15 July 1998, the Government approved a programme of evacuation and sale of six barracks considered surplus to military requirements. The barracks in question are located at Ballincollig, Fermoy, Castleblayney, Naas, Kildare and Clancy Barracks, Dublin.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="691" />The sale of approximately 91 acres comprising lot 1, Murphy Barracks, Ballincollig, to O'Flynn Construction for &euro;41 million has now been completed. In addition, the sale of lot 2 to the sitting tenant for &euro;1.05 million &ndash; my Department's reversionary interest in approximately 6.2 acres of the barrack lands &ndash; has now been completed. A further area comprising more than 27 acres at Murphy Barracks will be handed over to Cork County Council for community use.</P>
    <P>A total of 19.218 acres at the former Fitzgerald Camp, Fermoy, were sold to Cork County Council in 2001 for &euro;973,889 for development in conjunction with the IDA. Castleblayney Military Post, Monaghan, comprising approximately ten acres, was sold to the North Eastern Health Board for &euro;761,843. Seven acres at Devoy Barracks, Naas, County Kildare were ceded free of charge to Naas Urban District Council, while a further 14 acres were sold to that authority for &euro;8,888,167. The balance of the barracks lands &ndash; one acre &ndash; was sold to Kildare County Council for &euro;380,921.</P>
    <P>Magee Barracks, Kildare, comprises an area of 65 acres. At present approximately 15 acres of the property are being used by the Reception and Integration Agency of the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform to accommodate asylum seekers and a further site comprising approximately one acre is being used by Kildare County Council as a temporary halting site for 20 persons. On 1 July 2003, the Government decided to release this property to the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government for inclusion in a new affordable housing initiative agreed under the national partnership agreement, Sustaining Progress.</P>
    <P>My Department has accepted an offer from Florence Properties Limited for the sale of Clancy Barracks, Dublin, comprising approximately 13.65 acres. It is hoped to have a contract of sale completed shortly. Pending the signing of the contract of sale, it would not be appropriate to comment on details of the sale.</P>
    <P>The security, maintenance, consultancy and other costs to date in respect of those barracks identified for closure in 1998 are as follows:</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="692" /> On military security duty allowances alone, it is estimated that savings to date amount to over &euro;2.2 million in respect of the six barracks closed.

    <P>The sale of a site comprising approximately 0.931 acres adjacent to my Department's FCA premises in Kanturk, County Cork, to the Southern Health Board for a consideration of &euro;178,000 was completed earlier this year.

One hundred married quarters at Orchard Park, Curragh, County Kildare and 12 quarters at Cathal Brugha Barracks, Dublin are being sold to residents. Sales to date have realised &euro;3.02 million. Total sales are expected to realise approximately &euro;4 million approximately.</P>
    <P>Approximately ten acres of land at Renmore, Galway are being sold to Galway City Council for &euro; 250,316. Approximately 1.07 acres at Arbour Hill are being transferred to the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform for a consideration of &euro;3.174 million. Disposal of a number of other minor surplus properties owned by my Department has also been completed. I have no plans to close any further barracks.</P>

      <P>The household budget survey, HBS, which is carried out every five years by the Central Statistics Office, provides information on the average income and expenditure of all private households in the State. According to the most recent HBS in 1999-2000, households spent, on average, &euro;55.41 per week on housing costs. This expenditure accounted for 10% of disposable income. The following table provides information on expenditure by private households in Ireland and the United Kingdom.

My Department also works closely with the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government in the implementation of the national spatial strategy, both through bilateral contacts and through the interdepartmental committee on the national spatial strategy. We also liaise with other offices and agencies, notably the Central Statistics Office and the National Economic and Social Development Office in the context of monitoring and implementation of the national spatial strategy.</P>

      <P>I received Mr. Justice Barron's report into the Dublin and Monaghan bombings of 1974 on Wednesday 29 October. Mr. Justice Barron also included in his report his consideration of the case of John Francis Green.</P>
      <P>The bombings which took place in Dublin and Monaghan on 17 May 1974 were among the most appalling outrages in the history of this island. Three car bombs which had been placed in Parnell Street, Talbot Street and South Leinster Street exploded without warning within minutes of each other at around 5.30 p.m. As a result, 26 people and an unborn child were killed. Later, at almost 7 p.m., a fourth no-warning bomb exploded in Monaghan town, resulting in seven more people being killed. More than 240 people required hospital treatment as a result of the bombings. Not only were 34 innocent lives lost on that terrible day but the injured, relatives and friends were left a terrible legacy of pain and suffering.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When I met Justice for the Forgotten on 26 April 1999, I gave it my commitment to ensure that the truth was established in relation to the bombings and their aftermath. The former Chief Justice, the late Liam Hamilton, began that work in January 2000 and the former Supreme Court judge Henry Barron carried it on from October <Col N="696" /> of that year. I would like to take this opportunity to again thank the judge and his team for all their work in preparing the report and for their commitment and dedication to this difficult task. I would also like to pay tribute to the earlier work of the former Chief Justice, the late Liam Hamilton.</P>
    <P>I will bring Mr. Justice Barron's report to Government as soon as possible, following necessary consideration by relevant Departments and the Attorney General with a view to the report being referred to the Oireachtas for consideration by the Joint Committee on Justice, Equality and Women's Rights when it is intended the report would be published and considered in public session.</P>

      <P>The European Union, including Ireland, operates a common commercial policy. In line with this policy, the EU is committed to promote the international dialogue on the interaction between trade and social issues. While at the international level there is no consensus for a discussion on these matters in the WTO, nor in the ILO, the EU continues to pursue its strategy of promoting the respect of social rights via the dialogue and an incentive based approach.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The EU, therefore, welcomed the creation of the world commission on the social dimension of globalisation, under the aegis of the ILO. This commission, which is due to report at the end of this year, has the clear aim of investigating and making recommendations on how to address the possible social shortcomings of globalisation. At <Col N="698" /> the same time, the EU would welcome the reinforcement of the ILO role here.</P>
    <P>In bilateral relations with third countries, the EU has sought to advance further the promotion of social rights. In all the most recent EU trade agreements, like the one signed with Chile and the partnership agreement with the ACP &ndash; Africa, Caribbean and Pacific &ndash; countries, the recognition and promotion of social rights are an integral part of the agreements.</P>
    <P>The EU also pursues the promotion of social rights in the trade context in an autonomous way. An example of this is the possibility to grant further trade preferences under the generalised system of preferences, GSP, to those countries that assure the respect of the core labour rights as defined by the ILO.</P>

      <P>IDA Ireland is the agency with statutory responsibility for the attraction of foreign direct investment to Ireland. The agency, through its project divisions and network of overseas offices, is actively marketing County Kerry to overseas investors as a potential location for foreign direct investment.</P>
      <P>There have been two site visits to Kerry so far this year &ndash; one in July from an international services company which visited Tralee and one in September from a health care company which visited Listowel. Ultimately, it is the overseas investors themselves who decide where they want to locate, including what areas they wish to visit as potential locations.</P>

      <P>I am aware that approximately 75% of the staff at the factory concerned conducted a one day strike recently. For the previous four months, a ban on overtime had been in operation. I understand that a two-day strike to be held next week has been notified to the company, with the possibility of a subsequent escalation of the dispute. The dispute centres on the introduction of changes in <Col N="699" /> work practices, notably overtime pay and shift-swapping.</P>
      <P>It would not be appropriate for me to intervene in this dispute. Instead, the parties should utilise the expert services of the State's dispute settling machinery. The experience and expertise of these services are available free of charge to disputing parties and offer them the best avenue for resolving their differences. Where the parties make full use of these procedures the evidence shows that a very high percentage of disputes are resolved through the conciliation process. However, it is ultimately the responsibility of the parties concerned to ensure that agreement is reached.</P>

      <P>The Minimum Notice and Terms of Employment Acts 1973 to 2001 lay down minimum periods of notice to be given by an employer when terminating an employee's contract of employment. In general, the Acts apply in most employments and to employees who have at least 13 weeks' continuous service with the same employer. An employee with between 13 weeks and two years service is entitled to one week's notice; between two and five years service to two weeks; between five and ten years service to four weeks; between ten and 15 years service to six weeks and employees with over 15 years service are entitled to eight weeks notice of termination.</P>
      <P>Disputes about such matters as the right to notice, length of notice, calculation of continuous service or dismissal due to misconduct may be referred to the Employment Appeals Tribunal. The tribunal, which includes representatives of employers' and workers' bodies, may investigate a dispute and give a decision on it. The tribunal may award compensation to an employee whose employer has not given the employee proper notice or who has not paid the employee during his or her period of notice. A party to proceedings before the tribunal may appeal to the High Court from a decision of the tribunal on a point of law. The Minister, at the request of the tribunal, may refer a question of law to the High Court for determination.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under the Minimum Notice and Terms of Employment Acts, an employer must carry out a decision of the tribunal within six weeks, unless the decision is under appeal to the High Court on a question of law. If an employer fails to <Col N="700" /> implement such a decision, the employee's trade union or the Minister may institute proceedings on behalf of the employee seeking payment of the award made by the tribunal.</P>
    <P>More detailed information on the minimum notice legislation and copies of the relevant application form for bringing a claim to the Employment Appeals Tribunal may be obtained by contacting the employment rights information unit of my Department at 65a Adelaide Road, Dublin 2, or by telephoning the unit at 01 631 3131 or lo-call 1890 220222 where staff will be happy to assist.</P>
    <P>On 23 September 2003, the Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Harney, was notified in a letter by the employers in question of the proposed redundancies in accordance with section 12 of the Protection of Employment Act 1977. Some 14 employees were involved.</P>
    <P>Section 6 of the European Communities (Protection of Employment) Regulations 2000, S.I. No. 488 of 2000, provides that an employee or trade union may present a complaint to a rights commissioner that an employer has contravened section 9 of the Protection of Employment Act 1977 in relation to consultations with employees concerning proposed collective redundancies. A complaint may also be made under section 10 of the regulations in relation to the obligation on employers to provide information to the employees on this matter.</P>
    <P>If an employee or his or her representative believe that the quality of consultations with him or her and their union was inadequate, it is therefore open to them to bring such a complaint to a rights commissioner. The headquarters of the Labour Relations Commission is at Tom Johnson House, Haddington Road, Dublin 4. Its telephone number is 01 6136700 or lo-call 1890 220 227. There is a time limit of six months from the occurrence of the alleged contravention of the 1977 Act within which to bring a complaint to a rights commissioner.</P>
    <P>Under the Redundancy Payments Acts 1967 to 2003, eligible employees must be given a minimum of two weeks individual notice of redundancy. To date, 14 such notifications &ndash; statutory form RP1 &ndash; have been received by my Department in respect of the companies concerned. Depending on length of service, employees may be entitled to longer notice under the Minimum Notice and Terms of Employment Acts 1973 to 2001.</P>

    <P>A significant number of the personnel in question are accounted for by one employer, a Turkish civil engineering concern.</P>
    <P>Where overseas contractors have been successful in winning significant infrastructure contracts such as those at the power stations in Lanesboro, Shannonbridge, the Ballincollig bypass and social housing in Dublin, the Department has been, and still is, prepared to issue work permits to allow in a specified number of foreign employees to deliver on foot of such contracts, on the following basis: the number of permits issued is limited in respect of each contract; employees are tied to the contractor while in Ireland; permits are of specified duration; permits allow the employment of an employee only on a specified contract site; and Irish employment law applies in each case &ndash; for example, the relevant registered employment <Col N="702" /> agreement, REA, must be must be observed in each case.</P>
    <P>The contractors in question, to date mainly Turkish and Polish companies, are, in effect, contract service suppliers. This refers to a situation where a company based outside the State wins a contract with a client company based in Ireland and wishes to bring in non-EEA personnel to work here on the client site as part of that contract. It is normal international practice to provide for the limited entry of employees in such circumstances. This also features in mode four of the emerging WTO-GATS framework. Indeed, the Department would be happy to see further interest from overseas contractors in the area of infrastructure.</P>
    <P>The number of employees allowed into the State, even for contract service suppliers, will continue to depend on conditions in the labour market here and the relevant construction unions in Ireland are familiar with this approach. The construction sector in Ireland is still enjoying very buoyant conditions. All employees in Ireland enjoy the protection of employment rights legislation and, where specific complaints are made, my Department is prepared to investigate.</P>

      <P>The national spatial strategy, NSS, is a framework designed to re-orientate the balance of development across the country. Redirecting the established force of development and investment preferences is not a straightforward issue nor one that can be achieved simply by Government edict. The NSS is a 20 year strategy designed to enable every place in the country to achieve its potential. My Department and the development agencies are actively working with the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government on the implementation of the NSS. The Dublin region received about 30% of grant support from IDA Ireland and Enterprise Ireland in respect of 2002.</P>
      <P>As regards individual agencies under my Department, the following is a summary of their strategic initiatives to promote the objectives of the NSS. The key roles of Forfás relating to the NSS include encouraging the distribution of enterprise investment consistent with the NSS through the policies and investment strategies of the development agencies &ndash; IDA Ireland and Enterprise Ireland. Forfás provides policy advice regarding national development investments that contribute to making regional centres more competitive locations in which to invest and build enterprises. This advice includes recommending the prioritisation of infrastructure developments &ndash; road, energy, waste and telecommunications networks &ndash; and social infrastructure &ndash; educational and community facilities etc. &ndash; ensuring a continued focus on the development of critical mass at regional gateways and hubs.</P>
      <P>The developing strategies and policies of IDA Ireland, which support the implementation of the NSS are outlined in IDA Ireland's Beyond 2000+ strategy approved by the IDA Ireland board in early 2001. This strategy initiated a regional economic development process whereby IDA Ireland strengthened its network of regional offices by establishing sector development responsibilities in key regional locations such as Waterford, Athlone and Sligo. Of 295 staff posts in June 2003, about 100 are based in ten offices with dedicated regional responsibilities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the context of the NSS, IDA Ireland believes that there is a need to create strong locational incentives and attractions for mobile investment within the regions. Consequently, IDA Ireland is working to identify and develop magnets of attraction such as clusters of high-technology, knowledge intensive firms, centres for research or of technical specialisation that will <Col N="704" /> help attract international investment to the regions.</P>
    <P>In recognition of the inter-dependency between regional development and infrastructure provision, IDA Ireland established a regions and property division, headquartered in the BMW region in Athlone, to integrate the agency's regional development and industrial property programme. The gateways and hubs of the NSS figure prominently in the IDA Ireland locational strategy for foreign direct investment.</P>
    <P>IDA Ireland is continuing to work on developing a network of regionally distributed, flagship business parks and strategic sites to provide high quality, fully serviced sites for business enterprises capable of accommodating high value, large-scale projects similar to Intel and Wyeth Medica.</P>
    <P>IDA Ireland, in conjunction with Forfás and the development agencies, has prepared a number of regional strategic agendas, RSAs, for each of the NUTS III planning regions. The RSAs set out the medium-term intentions of the agencies with respect to enterprise development in each region and take account of the central approach of the NSS. IDA Ireland is represented on the steering committees overseeing the preparation of the regional planning guidelines for the NSS.</P>
    <P>IDA Ireland is reviewing its strategy for the period post 2003. Regional development and the NSS figure prominently in the planning work undertaken to date. Locations in Ireland are now competing for technology intensive foreign direct investment with highly developed city regions internationally. The NSS provides an opportunity to construct similar regions in Ireland and IDA Ireland is exploring this approach.</P>
    <P>In May 2003, following a review undertaken in partnership with my Department, Enterprise Ireland launched new funding guidelines for companies. These have been developed to align financial incentives with the national aim of balanced regional development. Location is now a key determinant of the level of aid now available to Enterprise Ireland's clients. All categories of financial support provided by Enterprise Ireland now reflect a preferential bias for companies located outside the Dublin and mid-east regions.</P>
    <P>As part of these guidelines, Enterprise Ireland launched the competitiveness fund this year. This is a new &euro;10 million fund established to build SME competitiveness. It is specifically targeted at SMEs that have not undertaken a major development project within the last three years. This new policy initiative is designed to have an impact in regions of comparatively lower growth thereby further contributing to NSS objectives.</P>
    <P>Enterprise Ireland is currently revising its regional strategy priorities to build on its present approach contained in Driving Growth in Regional Enterprise 2001-2003. New strategic policies will focus on three main areas &ndash; the existing client base, new start-up activity and regional development business infrastructure. <Col N="705" /> Each of these themes will take into account the NSS and its roll-out.</P>
    <P>The Shannon region 2020 strategy informed by NSS objectives takes a 15 to 20 year view to developing the critical mass of Limerick-Ennis-Shannon, while networking the major gateways of Limerick, Galway and Cork through the Atlantic alliance initiative. This regional vision aims to stimulate investment in key county towns and use regional natural resources for rural development. Shannon Development's approach to Shannon region 2020 is to concentrate on these four strategic areas.</P>
    <P>Science Foundation Ireland does not make decisions based on the location of proposed research activity, rather it aims to capitalise on the best research potential that exists within the third level network. Nevertheless, Science Foundation Ireland's aim is to encourage the broad national use of facilities in receipt of Science Foundation Ireland funds, and to date its investments are spread throughout all regions.</P>

      <Quest>the implications for the Defence Forces of the recently agreed EU military harmonisation deadline of 2010; the anticipated cost of such harmonisation; the details of the revenue generated from property divestment to date; and the amount of these revenues which will be used to underwrite improved interoperability with the EU and NATO.</Quest>

      <P>The year 2003 is an important one for the development of the European security and defence policy, as it is the target date for the realisation of the Helsinki headline goal, that is, the development of a capability to deploy within 60 days, and sustain for at least one year, up to 60,000 persons capable of carrying out Petersberg task operations, namely, crisis management operations, peace support operations and humanitarian tasks.</P>
      <P>At the European Council meeting of 19 and 20 June 2003 held at Thessaloniki, the Council noted the progress which had been made in the field of military capabilities since the inception of the headline goal. Significantly, the Council also noted that the EU now has an operational capability across the full range of Petersberg tasks, limited and constrained by certain shortfalls.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="707" />In the relatively short period since 1999, the EU has therefore made significant progress in developing its capabilities to carry out crisis management operations. In 2003, the operational capability of the European Union was demonstrated through the launching of three ESDP operations: the EU police mission, EUPM, in Bosnia-Herzegovina; Operation CONCORDIA in the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia; and Operation ARTEMIS in the Democratic Republic of Congo. The EU-led operations EUPM and ARTEMIS demonstrate the level of co-operation between the EU and the UN which continues to be developed and enhanced at EU level. Operation CONCORDIA represented the commencement of the implementation of EU-NATO permanent arrangements, in particular Berlin Plus, which will enhance the operational capability of the Union and provide the framework for a strategic partnership between the two organisations in the field of crisis management.</P>
    <P>I believe that it will be important that this momentum in further developing both civil and military capabilities is maintained beyond 2003. Discussions relating to the modalities as to how this might be achieved have been taking place at EU level under the Italian Presidency. While a prospective new headline goal of 2010 has been suggested in the discussions, no agreement in this regard has yet been reached. I welcome the fact that in these discussions creative ways of improving capabilities continue to be examined. In particular, I welcome measures which may improve efficiencies, including appropriate qualitative aspects of member states contributions to the headline goal. It will be important also that lessons learned from the first EU operations, mentioned above, are included in this process.</P>
    <P>One method of improving the qualitative aspects of the EUs ability to carry out Petersberg task operations is to improve the level of interoperability. In this regard, Ireland also participates in the Partnership for Peace planning and review process and, in common with the other EU neutrals, Ireland is using the PARP process in connection with planning for the Petersberg tasks. The scope of our involvement in PARP is focused on enhancing interoperability and familiarity with operating procedures in a multinational environment and improving the capabilities Ireland has offered in the context of the EU headline goal.</P>
    <P>The Government, on 15 July 1998, approved a programme of evacuation and sale of six barracks which were considered surplus to military requirements. To date the sale of surplus property has generated some &euro;58 million, with another &euro;2 million expected by the end of the year. The money generated from these sales is being reinvested in the Defence Forces in terms of equipment and infrastructure, consistent with the policy as laid out in the White Paper on defence published in February 2000. The White Paper process has illustrated how efficiencies can be <Col N="708" /> achieved from within existing resources. I do not plan on advocating any increases in military expenditure.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Defence (Mr. M. Smith)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 198 and 199 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I can assure the Deputy that there is a statutory basis for Government emergency planning. Government Departments take the lead role in planning for emergencies in areas for which each has statutory responsibility and must ensure that they have the necessary legislation and adequate resources available, in terms of personnel and equipment, and the planning arrangements in <Col N="709" /> place to respond to emergencies, including the responses of bodies under their aegis. All public authorities support these Departments, as required.</P>
    <P>This approach has always informed Government emergency planning and was not changed by the introduction of the major emergency planning framework which was drawn up in 1984. The framework and the associated planning efforts of the Garda Síochána, the local authorities and the health boards, have served this country well for almost 20 years.</P>
    <P>I chair a Government task force on emergency planning which co-ordinates Government emergency planning and responses across the State sector. An interdepartmental working group on emergency planning supports the work of this task force and carries out studies and oversight of emergency structures and processes. These mechanisms have been very important to integrate the emergency planning efforts of Government Departments and other public authorities to provide for co-ordinated emergency responses.</P>
    <P>The approach to emergency planning which continues to be adopted by Government is very effective. I was pleased to report on recent progress in the confidential second annual report to Government on emergency planning, which I presented to Government last week. I can assure the Deputy that the good work and progress will continue.</P>

    <P>Following a tender competition carried out in accordance with EU tendering procedures, a contract has been signed with Bombardier Aerospace for the purchase of a Bombardier Learjet 45 light business jet, seven to nine-seater, for the ministerial air transport service. The cost of the aircraft, including training and spares, is &euro;8.4 million, excluding VAT. The cost of the aircraft is being funded from savings achieved from the 2003 Defence Estimates provision for personal injury compensation. Acceptance and delivery of the aircraft will take place in December 2003.

      <P>Tactical and procedural developments in the area of military field operations necessitate the conduct of new training techniques and the development of appropriate instructions. Such tactical and procedural developments occur when the Defence Forces procure new equipment and when they prepare to participate in new or anticipated peace support operations.</P>
      <P>Collective training at infantry battalion level has featured as the prime focus of Defence Forces collective training during the past number of years. The Air Corps and the Naval Service may participate in this training in support of Army troops. Such training support is generally of a reconnaissance or troop carrying nature for the Air Corps while the Naval Service supports the Army logistically. The Air Corps and the Naval Service develop appropriate techniques and supporting instructions to meet such training requirements.</P>
      <P>In 2003 my Department purchased a command and staff simulator trainer for use in the Defence Forces training centre in the Curragh. Simulation training is now a regular and routine part of many forms of military training. The growth of simulation by electronic means to replace near real operating conditions in the appropriate environment has enabled many of these training requirements to be achieved at much lower cost and without disruption to other services. The development of battlefield simulations has provided for a revolutionary enhancement of the conduct of military training exercises.</P>

      <P>From the information available to me through Enterprise Ireland, I am optimistic that the global cost-cutting measures in the company to which the Deputy refers will not impact significantly on the Irish subsidiary or workforce. I am aware that the company in question is considering plans to rationalise its business on a global scale. The company involved has 133 factories and 55,000 employees worldwide and possible reductions of up to 20% and 10% respectively have recently been the subject of reports. As a private concern the group is of course, responsible for deciding its own future.</P>
      <P>The Irish company has been supported by Enterprise Ireland in 2002-03 in an investment programme targeted at reducing its manufacturing cost base by 40% through increased automation and employee training. This will assist in securing the existing facility in Ireland and also position it to compete for further investment downstream. Enterprise Ireland has a pro-active business relationship with the Irish company and will continue to monitor the situation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture and Food (Mr. Walsh)</NameTxt>
      <P>The recently agreed outcome of the mid-term review of the Common Agricultural Policy contained a number of elements of direct relevance to the dairy sector. These include: the con<Col N="712" /> tinuation of the milk quota regime until 2014-15; further reduction in support prices of 4% over and above that agreed in 1999 under Agenda 2000, with compensation at the rate of 80% for that additional reduction; payment of aid directly to producers by way of compensation for the support price cuts agreed under Agenda 2000 and the mid-term review &ndash; the reduction in support prices and the payment of compensation to begin in 2004.</P>
      <P>Following agreement at EU level on this, I subsequently announced my decision to decouple the dairy direct payment in 2005, the earliest date on which that could be done. This will provide dairy farmers with the necessary certainty they require to allow them to take informed decisions on their futures in the industry. I made this decision having taken careful account of the views of representatives of the industry.</P>
      <P>Overall the outcome of this mid-term review in the milk sector provides producers and processors with a more certain framework for the period ahead. The continuation of the milk quota regime to 2014-15 will provide a stable environment within which they can plan for the future. The future of individual companies and entities operating in the dairy sector depends on a range of factors relating to their performance in the commercial environment in which they operate. There is no evidence to suggest that the outcome of the mid-term review negotiations will undermine the ability of the co-operatives mentioned to continue their operations into the future or indeed to further develop their enterprises.</P>

      <P>The person named submitted an application for an allocation of quota from the 2004 suckler cow national reserve under category D, which caters for farmers who regularly apply for the suckler cow premium and need additional quota to ensure the future viability of their holdings. The position is that all applications to the 2004 national reserve are being processed at present and it is hoped to have allocations of quota made by late November 2003 to all qualifying applicants under the priority categories A &ndash; first time applicants under 35 years of age; B farmers with holdings on off-shore islands; and C organic farmers who are registered with the Department. At that stage if there are quota rights still available in the reserve, allocations will be made to eligible applicants under category D commencing with those with the lowest livestock units and continuing in increasing steps of one livestock unit until all the available quota is used. It is hoped to have those allocations, if any, completed by early December 2003.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="714" />In the circumstances, it is not possible at this stage to indicate whether or not the person named will be allocated additional suckler cow quota from the 2004 national reserve.</P>

      <Quest>the position in relation to a suckler cow quota which was used by a person (details supplied) in County Cork in 2000 and who is now retired and has leased their quota; and if this person will be able to retain this quota in 2005.</Quest>
      <QRef>[25192/03]</QRef>
    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture and Food (Mr. Walsh)</NameTxt>
      <P>The person named is not the registered herdowner of the herd number quoted. The registered herdowner joined the early retirement scheme on 21 December 2001. He had already leased out his suckler cow quota in 2001 and has continued to do so in 2002 and 2003. He may lease or sell his quota in 2004.</P>
      <P>Following the Agenda 2000 mid-term review agreement, I have decided that all direct payments will be fully decoupled from production as and from 1 January 2005. Consequently, the quota regime as we now know it, will be abolished on 31 December 2004 and the registered herdowner will not therefore retain suckler cow quota in 2005. With effect from 2005, the decoupled payment, to be known as the single payment scheme, will be based on the average amount paid to the farmer under the various premia schemes for the years 2000-02 inclusive. The average amount is determined by taking the three yearly average number of animals per arable hectares which attracted payment, multiplying by the premium rate for 2002 &ndash; the highest rate under Agenda 2000 &ndash; and dividing by the average number of hectares over the three year period. The result is that a certain number of &ldquo;payment entitlements&rdquo; are established. The total number of entitlements will be equal to the average number of hectares in the reference period while the value of each entitlement will be the figure obtained by dividing the average amount determined for the reference period by the average number of hectares. Farmers for whom entitlements have been established must activate those entitlements in 2005 by continuing to farm and submitting an area aid declaration in that year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Since the registered herdowner has retired from farming under the early retirement scheme and because of his obligations under that scheme, he will not be in a position in 2005 to activate any <Col N="717" /> entitlements to be established for him based on payments made to him under the 2000 premia schemes. Under the EU regulation, any entitlements established will therefore go to the national reserve.</P>

      <P>I have made no changes to the criteria for the issue of herd numbers. The herd number system is an administrative arrangement under the disease eradication schemes and is designed primarily for the purposes of disease <Col N="721" /> control and is also used for recording cattle movements through the CMMS. The criteria used in assessing applications for herd numbers include independent management of the holding, separate housing and fodder, the availability of adequate testing facilities without the possibility of intermixing with cattle from any other herd. In effect a herd number is issued in respect of an epidemiological unit. My Department, as a matter of policy, issues a herd number in the name of one person only, either spouse, which is consistent with Irish and EU legal provisions. If there are two or more persons with an interest in the herd number this fact should be notified to the local district veterinary office where their interest will be noted.</P>

      <P>The person named submitted an application for an allocation of quota from the 2004 suckler cow national reserve under category D, which caters for farmers who regularly apply for the suckler cow premium and need additional quota to ensure the future viability of their holdings. The position is that all applications to the 2004 national reserve are being processed at present and it is hoped to have allocations of quota made by late November 2003 to all qualifying applicants under the priority categories A first time applicants under 35 years of age, B farmers with holdings on off-shore islands and C organic farmers who are registered with the Department. At that stage if there are quota rights still available in the reserve, allocations will be made to eligible applicants under category D commencing to those with the lowest livestock units and continuing in increasing steps of one livestock unit until all the available quota is used. It is hoped to have those allocations, if any, completed by early December 2003. In the circumstances, it is not possible at this stage to indicate whether or not the person named will be allocated additional suckler cow quota from the 2004 national Reserve.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture and Food (Mr. Walsh)</NameTxt>
      <P>The ban in the UK on the consumption of beef from cattle over 30 months of age &ndash; the OTM scheme &ndash; is primarily a national measure in that country. In this regard, earlier this year the UK Food Standards Agency, FS, in conjunction with a joint SEAC-FSA risk assessment group, and a core stakeholder group, reviewed the OTM scheme. In July 2003 the FSA agreed to recommend to UK Ministers that it would be acceptable on public health grounds to replace, in two stages, the over 30 months scheme with BSE testing of cattle older than 30 months. The recommendation was that cattle born after August 1996 could be allowed into the food chain, after being tested for BSE, at the earliest from January, 2004, with the possibility of a complete replacement of the rule from July, 2005.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, the FSA also indicated that Ministers should not change the over 30 months rule until <Col N="723" /> they were satisfied that all of the necessary operational and other preparations had been made by the relevant Government parties, industry and other agencies. I understand at this stage that the earliest date likely for a change in the over 30 months scheme is June 2004.</P>
    <P>With an EU beef market in deficit at present, healthy third country exports and intervention beef having been removed from stores, I expect that markets for Irish beef will be sufficiently robust to withstand the pressure of additional UK over 30 month beef coming on the market in 2004.</P>
    <P>The Deputy also enquires about the impact of this decision on Irish consumers. I assume that he is referring, in this context, to the quite separate issue of the removal of the current EU ban on the export of beef from the UK. The position in relation to this aspect is that on the basis of dramatically reduced numbers of BSE cases in recent years, and on the basis of its continued application of a robust BSE control and eradication programme, the UK has applied to the European Commission for a change in its BSE status from high risk to moderate risk. The European Commission has referred the UK case to the relevant scientific committee for evaluation.</P>
    <P>From Ireland's perspective, it will be necessary to await the results of the scientific evaluation and any Commission proposals arising from this before making any definitive comments on the UK's application for a change of BSE categorisation. Our reaction to any Commission proposals arising will be science based and we will in particular be seeking whatever assurances are necessary in relation to the protection of the health of consumers in Ireland and elsewhere.</P>

      <P>As the Deputy is aware, the reported animal disease problems in the Limerick area were the subject of a multi-agency, multi-euro investigation under the auspices of the Environmental Protection Agency, EPA, that was conducted over a number of years. It spanned a range of areas requiring particular specialist expertise, monitoring and analysis, from human health through environmental quality, soil, herbage, feed and water to animal health. Within the context of the overall investigations, each of these areas was addressed by the agency with the competence and expertise relevant to it. For example, the human health issues were addressed by the <Col N="724" /> Mid-Western Health Board and animal health issues by my Department.</P>
      <P>The report of this investigation was published in August 2001 and it concluded that <i>inter alia, </i>although a small number of farms experienced notable difficulties, there was no evidence of serious or unusual problems in the wider Askeaton area. In the light of the outcome of this most comprehensive investigation and on the basis of current information available on the animal health situation in the area, I see no basis for revisiting the matter at this stage. In so far as farm animals in any area of the country may fall ill from time to time, there are well-established procedures, involving private veterinary practitioners and, if necessary, the veterinary laboratory service of my Department, for dealing with individual cases.</P>
      <P>The farm referred to in the Alloway report was selected as a &lsquo;control' for the 1995 Teagasc investigations of soils, herbage and fodder. This farm was selected on the basis that it was a particularly pure example of the Patrickswell soil series and was also used as a reference to provide information on soil and herbage types and composition on a farm that had not reported multiple animal deaths similar to those occurring on other farms.</P>
      <P>The combined agencies' response to the Alloway report did not cast doubt on the use of this farm, rather they simply stated that it was a mistake to use the term &ldquo;control&rdquo; as the actual control values used for evaluating the results of the analysis from these farms were based on the national database at the Johnstown Castle analytical services laboratory.</P>
      <P>It should be noted that this farm had no role as a &ldquo;control&rdquo; in the main animal health studies that extended from 1996 to 1998. The control farm for these studies was the DAF farm at Abbotstown. This farm proved suitable for the purposes of the study.</P>

      <P>As the Deputy may be aware, the Protection of Employees (Part Time Work) Act 2001 and the Protection of Employees (Fixed-Term Work) Act 2003 sponsored by my colleague the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment set out the conditions under which part-time and fixed term contract employees are entitled to conditions of employment, including pension, no less favourable than comparable full time or permanent employees. These entitlements are conferred regardless of whether pension schemes and-or employment contracts have been formally amended to cover such entitlements. All employers, including public sector employers, have a direct responsibility to ensure that they comply with the provisions of these Acts. The 2001 Act is effective from 20 December 2001 and the 2003 Act from 14 July 2003.</P>
      <P>Prior to the introduction of the aforementioned legislation, the Commission on Public Service Pensions had recommended that public servants in temporary and part-time work should be granted access to public service pension schemes, provided that they are in regular or quasi-permanent employment and, in the case of part-time employees, that they work a certain minimum number of hours per week. In September 2001, the Government announced its decision to accept the thrust of the reforms suggested by the commission and to establish a working group, as provided for in the PPF, to advise on the implementation of its recommendations. The implementation working group, which comprised representatives from the public service unions and relevant Departments, recently concluded its deliberations. Its report has now been finalised and is under consideration. However, as indicated above, the part time and fixed term legislation have been effective from December 2001 and July 2003. The Deputy may wish to note that employees who are not members of pension schemes or do not currently have pension rights and who will not have such entitlements or rights as a result of the foregoing, for example, employees who do not comply with the minimum service requirements, have an entitlement to access to personal retirement savings accounts, PRSAs, under the terms of the Pensions Act 1990, as amended by the Pensions (Amendment) Act 2002, sponsored by the Minister for Social and Family Affairs.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 251 to 258, inclusive, together, all of which deal with financial institutions and bogus non-resident accounts.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy is aware, there has been an intensive effort, initiated by a committee of this House, in recent years to tighten up on the payment of tax on deposit income. In 1999 and 2000 Revenue conducted on-site DIRT look back audits on 37 financial institutions. This exercise, which was reported on to the Dáil Committee of Public Accounts, resulted in the payment by the financial institutions of &euro;220 million in respect of tax, interest and penalties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The focus of these audits was the extent to which the financial institutions had or had not complied with the DIRT legislation and it is clear from the outcome of the Revenue audit programme that there was a significant non compliance position on the part of the financial institutions. However, the audit also revealed that <Col N="730" /> many Irish-resident taxpayers held bogus non-resident deposit accounts.</P>
    <P>In the case of bogus non-resident account holders, Revenue provided an opportunity for those who had underpaid their taxes to make voluntary disclosures of the undeclared income, together with payment of the resulting tax liability and an amount of interest and penalties, capped at 100% of the tax liabilities, before 15 November 2001. This voluntary disclosure scheme, with its favourable settlement arrangements, was very widely publicised, and led to 3,675 account holders choosing to avail of the scheme and paying &euro;227 million in total.</P>
    <P>It is important to note that a PAYE taxpayer who held a bogus non-resident account and who otherwise paid his or her tax liabilities would, in such a case, have had the relevant DIRT liability paid by the financial institutions as part of the settlement made with Revenue. If the money on deposit originated only from income that had been taxed under PAYE, or a source on which appropriate taxes had otherwise been paid, there would be no further liability for a standard rate taxpayer; for interest accrued before 1993, a higher rate taxpayer would have a liability additional to the DIRT charged. This would be the position also in all other cases where appropriate tax, other than DIRT tax, had been paid on the money in the deposit account.</P>
    <P>I have no particular evidence or knowledge in regard to arrangements between the financial institutions and their individual clients and it would not be appropriate for me to comment on the question raised about redress. If Revenue has sufficient evidence that any financial institution or member of staff conspired with customers to evade tax, Revenue will consider if a prosecution under tax legislation would be possible.</P>
    <P>As part of the process of tightening up arrangements, I have introduced legislation to ensure that those responsible for financial services regulation will pass on to the Revenue Commissioners any information or suspicion relating to tax evasion that they may obtain in performing their regulatory functions. It is important, when assessing the role of the banking supervisory authorities in these matters, to bear in mind what was the legislative position at the time of the events in question and not to draw any conclusions based on later statutory reforms.</P>
    <P>Prior to the establishment of the Irish Financial Services Regulatory Authority, IFSRA, banking supervision was carried out by the Central Bank of Ireland. The rules on confidentiality which applied to the bank would not have permitted the transmission of information from the Central Bank to the Revenue Commissioners. Thus, even if the bank suspected that some activity of a supervised entity merited the attention of the Revenue Commissioners, the statutory requirement of confidentiality placed on the bank gave no clear way of passing its suspicions on to the appropriate authority.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="731" />The Central Bank and Financial Services Authority of Ireland, CBFSAI, Act 2003 fundamentally changes this situation. Any suspicion of criminal activity, such as tax evasion, must, in future, be passed on to the appropriate authorities. Specifically, this legislation changed the law regarding laundering of illegal funds &ndash; including the proceeds of tax evasion &ndash; in order that where cases come to the attention of the regulatory authorities, these must now be reported to the Revenue Commissioners, as well as to the Garda. The only limits placed on disclosure of information by this Act are those contained in EU law. I am satisfied that these arrangements provide an excellent legislative framework for co-operation between the Revenue Commissioners and the Irish Financial Services Regulatory Authority.</P>
    <P>The Deputy's idea that the State should bear a portion of the blame for people avoiding paying their due tax is, in my view, wrong. As the Deputy is aware there is a statutory obligation on taxpayers to make correct returns of their tax liabilities and pay the correct taxes due for all years of assessment.</P>

That consists of excise duty of &euro;3.58 and VAT of &euro;1.02. The provisional excise yield from cigarettes in 2003 to the end of September, covering production from the start of the year up to July, is &euro;578 million. The VAT yield from cigarettes in 2003 to the end of September, covering sales at retail outlets between 1 November 2002 and 31 August 2003, is estimated at &euro;224 million.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 260 to 262, inclusive, together.</P>
      <P>Where compensation is received after land is compulsorily acquired, any gains arising from the one indivisible sum paid for the acquisition of land are chargeable for tax. In other words, if a sum is paid by an authority for the compulsory acquisition of land, irrespective of its components, for example, disturbance, injurious affection and so on, that total sum will be the amount to be assessed for tax.</P>
      <P>The capital gains tax due on a disposal of land under a compulsory purchase order is calculated in the same way as for any other disposal of land. The consideration for the disposal will be the sum received for the land. From that consideration, the following may be deducted: any costs of disposal, for example, legal fees; the cost, including any incidental costs, of acquisition of the land, which may be indexed either from 6 April 1974, or, if later, the date of acquisition of the land, up to 31 December 2002; any enhancement expenditure of a capital nature on the land during the period of ownership, which may also be indexed either from 6 April 1974, or, if later, the date of acquisition of the land, up to 31 December 2002; and the vendor's annual personal exemption of &euro;1,270, if not already used in full on a previous disposal of an asset or assets in that year of assessment. The amount remaining after those deductions is then taxable at 20%.</P>
      <P>However, depending on the sum paid by the authority, a disposal of land under a compulsory purchase order may constitute a disposal of development land. Development land is land disposed of for a higher sum than its &ldquo;current use value&rdquo;, that being the value that the land would have if no development other than development of a minor nature could be carried out in relation to it. If the disposal is of development land and the total consideration receivable by an individual for disposals of development land in any year of assessment exceeds &euro;19,050, certain restrictions apply. Those are that: indexation relief for the cost of acquisition of the land only applies to the &ldquo;current use value&rdquo; of the land on 6 April 1974, or, if later, the date of acquisition of the land; indexation relief is not available for enhancement expenditure on the land during the period of ownership; and the only losses which may be offset against gains on development land are losses which have been incurred on disposals of other development land.</P>
      <P>There are no plans to change the methods by which capital gains tax is calculated on land that has been compulsorily purchased.</P>

      <P>I should explain that charities and non-profit groups are exempt from VAT under the EU Sixth VAT Directive. That means that they do not charge VAT on their services and cannot recover VAT incurred on goods and services that they purchase. Essentially, only VAT-registered businesses which charge VAT are able to recover VAT. I am nevertheless aware of the campaign being run by the Irish charities tax reform group seeking a VAT refund in respect of goods and services purchased by registered charities. I have no plans to provide any such refund. The cost of such a refund would be expensive and could not be justified in view of the considerable and generous tax reliefs provided to the charitable sector.</P>

      <P>Under Circular 16/97, Departments and offices are required to supply annual statements on IT-related expenditure to the IT control section in the Department of Finance. The following tables contain the breakdown of expenditure given in those statements and show the actual amounts expended by each Department and office for the years 2000-02, and the projected expenditure for the year 2003 as supplied to IT control by each Department and office on 30 April 2003.</P>
      <P>Expenditure is broken down under the following headings: consultancy, outsourcing, hardware, including office machinery, software, IT training and maintenance. Irish Governments have over many years adopted a procurement policy that facilitates open competition, best value for money and best fit to requirements. Within that approach, different products are evaluated on their merits, including openness regarding future procurement and, where possible, avoiding being locked in to a particular supplier. Accordingly, an open view is taken which, in practice, tends to follow standards emerging from the market. Open source software is used quite widely in Departments and offices, in areas such as middleware, content management software, mail relays, web servers, server operating systems, embedded systems such as secure gateways and network attached storage, and interoperability software between Departments to allow system-to-system communication. However, separate figures for expenditure on different types of software are not collected.</P>

      <Quest>the tax relief available for a parent who paid for psychological assessments for his or her child; and if similar tax relief is available for professional fees accrued arising from the recommendations of that assessment.</Quest>
      <QRef>[25163/03]</QRef>
    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy)</NameTxt>
      <P>Tax relief under section 469 of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 &ndash; relief for health expenses &ndash; is available to parents for expenditure incurred in respect of qualifying dependants, that is, children, for the services of an educational psychologist. For the purposes of the relief, &ldquo;educational psychologist&rdquo; means a person who is entered on a register maintained by the Minister for Education and Science in accordance with guidelines set <Col N="738" /> down by that Minister with the consent of the Minister for Finance.</P>
      <P>A taxpayer can claim the relief by completing form MED 1 at the end of the year and sending it to his or her tax office. The relief is given at the highest rate of tax at which the taxpayer is chargeable for the year of the claim. The first &euro;125 of health expenses incurred in any year must be borne by the taxpayer. If the taxpayer is claiming relief for two or more persons, he or she must bear the first &euro;250. The question of whether the cost of further professional fees arising from the recommendations of an assessment by an educational psychologist can be claimed as a health expense depends on the nature of those professional services, and specifically whether they come within the definition of health expenses in section 469. For example, speech and language therapy would qualify, as would the services of a medical practitioner or diagnostic procedures carried out on the advice of a practitioner.</P>

      <P>Regulation 20(2) of the Income Tax (Employments) (Consolidated) Regulations 2001 requires an employer to deliver a P45 to an employee on the date that the employment ceases.

      <Quest>if a person (details supplied) in County Cork is entitled to a tax rebate in view of the fact that his working week has been reduced by two days since August 2003.</Quest>
      <QRef>[25195/03]</QRef>
    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that it is not possible to say at this stage whether the taxpayer may be due a rebate. The tax office has been informed that the taxpayer is claiming unemployment benefit for the two days per week that he is not working. His tax credits have been reduced accordingly. The taxpayer's liability for the year will be reviewed as soon as his P60 is available after 31 December 2003, and at that stage any overpayment will be refunded. I am, however, informed that the inspector of taxes is of the opinion, following consultation with the taxpayer's employer, that he is unlikely to be due a rebate. I also understand from the Revenue Commissioners that systematic short-time relief under section 126 of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997, which would relieve the taxpayer's unemployment benefit of taxation, does not apply in this case.</P>

The achievement of balanced and sustainable regional development, which is the cornerstone of the strategy, is also a priority for my Department. The Department is represented on the interdepartmental committee on the implementation of the national spatial strategy under the aegis of the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government. Investment in infrastructure is an important element in the implementation of the strategy. My Department and I have accorded considerable priority to such investment notably through the national development plan. This investment is supporting the spatial strategy, in particular by enhancing the economic and social infrastructure in the strategy's gateway centres and by improving transport links between them. Finally, as indicated in the strategy, the Government will take full account of the strategy in moving forward the progressive decentralisation of Government offices and agencies.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy)</NameTxt>
      <P>I presume the Deputy is referring to benefit-in-kind on employer provided cars and to certain changes which I have announced will come into effect on 1 January 2004, which were provided for in the Finance Act 2003. The current system of taxation in relation to company cars will be altered principally in two respects with effect from that date. First, employers will be obliged to deduct through the PAYE system the tax due on certain benefits-in-kind, including company cars. The amount of the tax due on the company car will be determined by reference to the cash equivalent of the private use of such car.</P>
      <P>Previously, where a company car was available for private use, the income tax liability was collected either during the course of the tax year, by reducing the employee's tax credits and standard rate cut-off point by the taxable amount in respect of the company car thereby increasing the PAYE deducted to collect the liability arising, or where it was not possible to collect the tax due on the benefits by restriction of tax credits, by way of an end of year tax review. Second, employee PRSI including the health contribution levy and employer PRSI will also be due on the cash equivalent of the private use of the company car. Benefits-in-kind provided prior to 31 December 2003, including company cars, were not liable to PRSI.</P>
      <P>In order to facilitate the introduction of the new system, the existing system of valuing the benefits of car usage was changed and simplified in the Finance Act 2003. The cash equivalent will be determined by applying a fixed percentage, based on the annual business mileage, to the original market value of the vehicle supplied, less any amount required to be made good and actually made good by the employee directly to the employer in respect of any part of the cost of providing or running the company car. The cash equivalent will be taken to be a &ldquo;notional payment&rdquo; and added to the actual cash remuneration. The PAYE due will be calculated by reference to the total sum. The effect of the changes to be introduced from 1 January 2004 in respect of those in receipt of a company car will be that they will pay the tax and PRSI due on such benefit by way of deduction from salary through the PAYE system. This will bring greater equity as regards taxation between remuneration packages that include certain benefits and those that do not.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Revenue Commissioners have published an employers' guide to operating PAYE and PRSI for certain benefits to assist employers in calculating the cash equivalent or the notional payment in respect of the private use of a company car. Prior to finalising the guide, my Department and the Revenue Commissioners had consulted the social partners and representatives of tax practitioners. Providers of payroll systems have also been briefed by the Revenue Commissioners on the changes required and the Rev<Col N="743" /> enue Commissioners are providing nationwide seminars for employers.</P>

The pay of secretarial assistants has been increased on this basis in line with the recommendation for clerical officers in the Civil Service. Personnel employed for any period since 1 December 2001 are entitled to an adjustment to their pay in respect of that period, regardless of whether their employment has now ceased. Lump sum payments for secretarial assistants who ceased employment since 1 December 2001 and which are calculated by reference to basic pay should also be increased on this basis. I understand that the Office of the Houses of the Oireachtas is processing such payments.</P>

      <P>Proposals for structured co-operation are being examined as part of the consideration of security and defence issues at the Intergovernmental Conference. The Government believes that all member states should have the same rights and opportunities to contribute to the carrying out of EU-led crisis management tasks, or Petersberg Tasks. In the Intergovernmental Conference context, Ireland has conveyed its belief that the accepted principles of openness, transparency and inclusiveness should remain at the heart of any new arrangements to be elaborated in the security and defence area. In the context of the implementation of the Petersberg Tasks, the modalities for EU-NATO co-operation have worked well thus far, as evidenced in the context of Operation <Col N="744" /> Concordia, the EU-led military monitoring and stabilisation operation being conducted, with recourse to certain NATO assets and capabilities, in the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia.</P>
      <P>As the holder of the EU Presidency in the first half of next year, Ireland will seek to consolidate and build on practical co-operation in accordance with the established arrangements for co-operation between the two organisations. We consider that future developments in ESDP should be based on such arrangements, which take into account the autonomy of decision making of each organisation and the principle of non-discrimination against a member state.</P>

      <P>At the EU ministerial meeting with the US on 25 September 2003, the EU high representative, Mr. Javier Solana, outlined the state of play on the development of an EU security strategy. Proposals for a draft strategy were initially presented by Mr. Solana in June at the Thessaloniki European Council, where they were welcomed. He was asked by the Council to bring work forward with a view to submitting a text for approval by the European Council in Brussels in December. The finalised security strategy is due for adoption then, following detailed discussion of the proposals in a series of seminars. The US Secretary of State, Mr. Colin Powell, indicated his full support for the EU initiative as part of a mature transatlantic relationship.</P>
      <P>Mr. Solana's proposals are broadly consistent with Ireland's perspective on security and defence issues, particularly in their emphasis on a holistic approach to security, going beyond purely military considerations. By helping to place the EU Common Foreign and Security Policy in a wider perspective and through assisting with the necessary prioritisation and further elaboration of EU foreign policy activities, the security strategy holds the potential to be a very important and worthwhile exercise for the Union. It is encouraging that the centrality of the UN and conflict prevention have been highlighted in Mr. Solana's proposals. Ireland participated in the series of seminars, held during the course of September and October, to discuss the draft strategy. As the holder of EU Presidency next year, the Government stands ready to carry forward work on implementation of the strategy, as appropriate.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 282 and 284 together.</P>
      <P>The EU-UN joint declaration on co-operation in crisis management was signed at the conclusion of the EU Troika meeting with the UN Secretary General on 24 September 2003. Building on the successful co-operation established between the two organisations, the declaration calls for the creation of a joint EU-UN consultative mechanism. This will allow for further co-operation in the areas of planning, training, communication and the exchange of information on best practices. In advance of signature, the Italian Presidency noted that the declaration is an important step in strengthening co-operation between the two organisations. The Presidency confirmed that it would undertake follow-up work with a view to its implementation on a practical level. The UN Secretary General also welcomed the declaration and noted that he looked forward to pursuing the agenda set out therein.</P>
      <P>Ireland has welcomed the progress achieved in the EU-UN relationship in recent years. There has been close co-operation between the organisations, particularly in the crisis management area. This is clear in the context of the EU police mission in Bosnia-Herzegovina and also in the more recent case of Operation Artemis in the Democratic Republic of Congo. We have been consistently among the strongest supporters in the Union for the signing of a joint EU-UN declaration. The signature of the joint declaration was a positive step in reinforcing the EU-UN partnership. I look forward to taking forward work on its practical implementation during Ireland's EU Presidency.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The EU Presidency and the UN Secretary General agreed that Operation Artemis had been a success, both in terms of its positive impact on the political process in the Democratic Republic of Congo and in its demonstration of effective EU-UN co-operation on a practical level. The UN Secretary General further noted that the operation had sent a powerful message of solidarity from the EU, which has had considerable resonance in the region. It will be recalled that the operation was mounted by the EU in response to a request made by the UN Secretary <Col N="747" /> General and on foot of UN Security Council Resolution 1484 of 30 May 2003. Ireland was fully supportive of the operation, which formally concluded on 7 September, handing over to a reinforced UN force. Five Irish military officers participated in Operation Artemis, three in the operation's headquarters in Paris and two in the force's headquarters in Entebbe, Uganda. I consider the operation to have worked well, contributing significantly to the stabilisation of the situation around Bunia and demonstrating the EU's ability to respond rapidly to a crisis management situation.</P>

I participated in the meeting as part of the EU delegation, along with the Italian Foreign Minister, Franco Frattini, the High Representative for Common Foreign and Security Policy, Javier Solana, and the Commissioner for External Relations, Chris Patten. The non-aligned movement was represented by the Foreign Ministers of Malaysia, South Africa and Cuba. The meeting provided an opportunity for constructive and frank engagement between the EU and the movement on a number of issues, including the UN and multilateralism, the Middle East peace process, human rights issues and the fight against terrorism. Both parties agreed on the need to promote effective multilateralism. Both sides reaffirmed their commitment to Middle East peace process road map, the role of the quartet and a lasting settlement based on two states living side by side in peace and security. There was an exchange between the EU and the movement on how to prevent against human rights abuses. The EU emphasised its commitment to upholding international human rights and reaffirmed its determination to highlight and condemn human rights abuses wherever they occur. The EU and movement agreed on the need to co-operate closely to counter the threat from international terrorism. Overall, the meeting was conducted in a cordial and businesslike manner and both parties found it to be constructive and fruitful.</P>

      <P>The President led her first state visit of Ireland to China from 6 to 16 October 2003. The purpose of state and official visits abroad is to promote Ireland's image in a positive way internationally and to further develop political, economic and cultural links with the countries concerned. It is standard international practice between friendly states to engage in exchanges of visits in order to strengthen relations, to further consolidate ties and to reinforce existing connections.</P>
      <P>A state visit is the highest level of official visit between two states, and takes place at the invitation of the Head of State of the host country. The programme for a state visit by a Head of State contains internationally agreed common elements, including a ceremonial welcome, a meeting with the Head of State, a meeting with the Head of Government, state dinner hosted by the Head of State, and a cultural element. Economic elements and a community reception hosted by the resident ambassador are often also included in the programme.</P>
      <P>The President was accompanied throughout the state visit to China by the Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Noel Dempsey, and a business delegation, organised by Enterprise Ireland, consisting of 150 people from 82 companies and institutions. This was the largest official trade mission of its kind to leave Ireland. The President addressed business breakfasts in both Beijing and Shanghai, as well as a forum of educational leaders. She also officiated at the openings of several new business ventures, and other business functions, and met individually with representatives of a significant number of Chinese companies. The visit was extremely successful in the promotion and strengthening of Irish economic links with China, whose economy has been growing very rapidly in the past decade.</P>
      <P>At the political level, the President had meetings with both President Hu and Premier Wen. In the course of these wide-ranging discussions, the President conveyed Ireland's general commitment to the protection and promotion of human rights and fundamental freedoms. Our more specific concerns in these areas, including individual cases, are the subject of regular and ongoing official meetings and contacts between the two Governments, which are the most appropriate fora for addressing such specific concerns. Ireland, along with our EU partners, also addresses human rights concerns with China through the formal framework of the EU-China Human Rights Dialogue, which was established in 1996.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="749" />Human rights are a constant and important issue of dialogue and discussion with the Chinese authorities, at both national and European Union level. In this regard, I welcome the confirmation of continued commitment to the Human Rights Dialogue in China's first ever policy paper on the EU, which was published last month, and the reiteration by both sides, at the EU-China summit in Beijing on 30 October, of its continued commitment to work towards achieving more meaningful and positive results on the ground.</P>

These concerns are shared by our partners in the EU. The Government recognises the threat posed by terrorist networks such as al-Qaeda, but stresses the importance that the highest international standards of human rights and humanitarian law be maintained in combating international terrorism.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The United States is well aware of the Government's view that those detained at Guantanamo Bay should be treated in accordance with the provisions of international human rights and humanitarian law. These concerns, which are voiced as a <Col N="750" /> friend of the United States, have been conveyed most recently to the United States Embassy in Dublin by my Department in September.</P>
    <P>On the Deputy's question on whether individuals detained at Guantanamo Bay have passed through Shannon Airport, the Government has no information to suggest that this is the case.</P>

      <P>The Irish Embassy in Buenos Aires has been monitoring developments in the case to which the Deputy refers since it was notified of the person's arrest in December 2001. The person is currently serving a sentence of four years and 11 months in Argentina. Having been held at a high security prison close to the city of Buenos Aires for the first year and a half of this sentence, he has now been transferred to a lower security unit in the province of Chaco in northern Argentina. I understand that he has expressed satisfaction with this arrangement, particularly because it facilitates family contact, as telephone calls may be received on a daily basis.</P>
      <P>A diplomatic officer at the Embassy has visited the person on a number of occasions and has delivered food, cigarettes, clothing, phone cards and other essential items to him, together with letters, parcels and money deposited with my Department by his family. He has also brought various medical problems experienced by this person to the attention of prison medical staff and has facilitated visits to him by an Irish Christian Brother and other visits on a weekly basis. The Embassy has also ensured that the person has had access to adequate legal representation since his arrest.</P>
      <P>I assure the Deputy that my Department maintains regular contact with members of this person's family and endeavours to keep them informed of developments in relation to the case. The Embassy in Buenos Aires is also in contact with the person's legal adviser and with the relevant Argentine authorities. I assure the Deputy that both the Embassy and the consular section in Dublin will continue to provide all possible consular assistance for the individual and his family.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Mr. N. Dempsey)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 292, 349 and 383 together.</P>
      <P>In 1998 my Department, in consultation with the Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland, RPII, took a proactive approach to identifying and eradicating radon in schools. This commenced with my Department commissioning the RPII to conduct a survey of radon levels in all primary and post-primary schools. This survey predated legislation on the issue of radon in the workplace by over two years and the action taken exceeds any legislative requirement in that all schools, regardless of whether they were situated in areas of high radon, were invited to be tested. In addition, in June 2001, Circular 46/01 was issued to all boards of management informing them of my Department's initiative and advising schools on the course of action necessary for radon mitigation.</P>
      <P>During the course of the survey, 4,072 schools were invited to participate, of which 3,798 responded and were sent detectors. Radon surveys were subsequently completed in 3,444 schools. Approximately 300 schools had radon concentrations above the workplace reference level of 400 Bq/m. These schools were advised to secure the services of suitably qualified personnel to carry out all remedial works specified by a consultant architect. These remediation works have not been stopped by my Department and are ongoing in 2003 and are fully funded by my Department. Where radon levels in classrooms are between 200 Bq/m and 400 Bq/m, my Department issues a grant of &euro;191 per classroom, advising schools to install suitable vents in these classrooms. Over 800 schools qualified for grant aid under this category.</P>
      <P>Initially, following completion of remediation works, post-remediation measurements were carried out by the RPII within a three to nine month period after remediation had taken place. This process is ongoing and the RPII continues to carry out post-remediation testing in schools. Consultations are ongoing between my Department and the RPII on the issue of the long-term efficiency of radon mitigation systems, which have been installed in schools and also to ensure that radon levels remain below the accepted reference levels.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To date, approximately 500 schools have not responded to the invitation to have radon <Col N="753" /> measurements carried out. Following consultations with my Department's building unit, the RPII has been instructed to address this matter on behalf of my Department.</P>
    <P>I would also like to assure the Deputies that my Department's building unit ensures that radon barriers are included in the designs of all new school buildings. A list of schools with radon levels above 200 Bq/m will be forwarded to Deputy Allen shortly.</P>

      <P>In 1999 the board of management of St. Brendan's national school applied to my Department for a new school. Following examination of the application it was agreed that accommodation should be provided for a six teacher school.</P>
      <P>A subsequent technical inspection of the existing school and site was carried out and a recommendation was made that a new school on a greenfield site should be provided. The Office of Public Works, which acts on behalf of my Department regarding procurement of sites, was asked to investigate and report on suitable sites for the proposed new school. While a number of sites have been identified, investigations in this regard have yet to be completed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The purchase of a site and advancement of the school's building project to architectural planning will depend on the budgetary provision for 2004 and subsequent years, the rate of progress of existing projects in architectural planning and the <Col N="754" /> priority afforded to each project by reference to the published criteria for prioritising large-scale building projects.</P>
    <P>Funding of &euro;48,000 towards temporary accommodation was provided for St Brendan's national school under the 2003 capital programme and in 2002 my Department grant-aided the purchase of two portable structures which had been rented at the school.</P>

      <P>School caretakers are not employed by my Department. They may be employed directly by schools or vocational education committees or may be employed by private contractors who provide a caretaking service for schools. Caretakers in vocational schools are employed and paid by the appropriate VEC. Those employed on a wholetime basis are pensionable under the education sector superannuation scheme &ndash; formerly included in the local government superannuation scheme. Caretakers employed on a wholetime basis by community and comprehensive schools are pensionable under the terms of the contributory pension scheme for full-time non-teaching staff of comprehensive and community schools.</P>
      <P>In the case of secondary schools, the position is that each school receives a grant from my Department for the provision of caretaking and other ancillary services. It is a matter for the school to determine how best to meet its caretaking requirements. No public service pension scheme exists for caretakers employed in such schools.</P>
      <P>In primary schools there are two separate arrangements for the provision of caretaking services. Under a limited scheme introduced in 1979, caretakers are employed on a wholetime basis by 204 schools. In all other primary schools these provisions have been superseded by an arrangement under which each school receives a grant from my Department for the provision of caretaking and other ancillary services. As in the case of the grant provided for secondary schools, it is a matter for the school to determine how best to meet its caretaking requirements. No public service pension scheme exists for caretakers in primary schools, whether employed directly by the school or otherwise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The question of pension cover for caretakers employed directly by primary and secondary schools and for part-time caretakers employed by <Col N="755" /> vocational education committees and by community and comprehensive schools is currently under consideration in the context of the implementation of the Protection of Employees (Fixed-term Work) Act 2003 and the Protection of Employees (Part-time Work) Act 2001. Discussions with the education partners are ongoing regarding the implementation of these Acts. My Department's approach will be informed by the outcome of these discussions and developments in the wider public service.</P>
    <P>With regard to persons with long service, the position is that public service pension schemes make provision for the reckoning of prior pensionable service, subject to payment of the appropriate contributions, in the case of any person who has been admitted to membership on an ongoing basis. Contributions in respect of prior service may be paid by deduction from the member's retirement gratuity.</P>

      <P>The staffing of a primary school is determined by reference to the enrolment of the school on 30 September of the previous school year. This is in accordance with guidelines agreed between my Department and the education partners. The staff of the school in question comprises a principal, 11 mainstream class teachers, one learning support teacher and one resource teacher. The enrolment of the school on 30 September 2002 was 324.</P>
      <P>An independent appeals board was established to adjudicate on appeals from boards of management on mainstream staffing allocations in primary schools. The board operates independently of the Minister and my Department. The staffing at Belgrove senior boys' school for the 2003-04 school year was considered by the appeals board. It was satisfied that a departure from the staffing schedule is not warranted in this case. The board of management of the school was notified of the decision of the appeals board on 10 April 2003. The decision of the appeals board is final. I am sure the Deputy will appreciate that it would not be appropriate for me to intervene in the operation of the independent appeals board.</P>

      <P>All applications for special educational needs supports received between 14 February 2003 and 31 August 2003 will be examined on the basis of the supporting professional report or reports and in the context of resources already available at the school. The process involves an examination of each application and supporting documentation by a dedicated team of inspectors and psychologists. The schools concerned will be informed of the outcome as early as possible in <Col N="757" /> the current school year. An application for special educational needs resources for the pupil in question will be considered in this context. Meanwhile, on 22 October 2003, as an interim measure, my Department approved a special needs assistant to support the pupil. This resource will be subject to review by the dedicated team of inspectors and psychologists.</P>

    <P>**A total of 27,087 students were enrolled in science courses in 1999-2000. A further breakdown of this figure is not available for this academic year.</P>
    <P>
    </P>
    <P>A number of important steps have been taken to arrest the decline in interest in science which is a problem not just in Ireland but in most developed countries. In particular, important progress has been made in regard to curricular reform and inservice support, with new syllabi already implemented in leaving certificate biology and physics and chemistry; revised syllabi in primary science and junior certificate science beginning in schools in 2003-04; and work is under way on a new leaving certificate physical sciences syllabus to replace the physics and chemistry combined syllabus. All of these developments are being or have been supported by national inservice programmes for teachers. Three days inservice was provided for all primary teachers to support the implementation of the primary science programme, supported by a national team of 24 trainers. Some 1,700 second level biology teachers, 900 chemistry teachers and 1,000 physics teachers received inservice training for the leaving certificate revised syllabi and a national programme is now being implemented for the revised junior certificate science syllabus.</P>
    <P>With regard to resourcing, substantial grants issued to primary schools in 1999, 2001 and 2002 at a cost of &euro;10.376 million over three years, an additional <i>per capita</i> grant for physics and chemistry was made at leaving certificate level and a capital grants programme is available for senior cycle science ICT and science equipment. Allied to this is the recent announcement of a once-off grant scheme, likely to cost in the order of &euro;12 million to support the implementation of the new junior certificate science syllabus.</P>
    <P>ICT integration projects are under way in teaching and learning under the schools IT initiative and a new Scope initiative has been launched <Col N="759" /> in partnership with RTE, the NCCA and the National Centre for Technology in Education. Other advances include: the provision of materials and publications to schools to promote the attractiveness and relevance of science for students as a subject option and career path; reviews on mathematics, grading of subjects in the leaving certificate, gender equality issues in science and initial reports on teacher training; awareness measures supported by industry and third level colleges linking with schools; foundation, bridging and progression measures to promote access to third level education; quality assurance initiatives in third level, including the sciences; and the development of a national framework of qualifications by the National Qualifications Authority as an important step in developments to improve access, promote flexible assessment and the accreditation processes and enhance mobility across the further and higher education and training sectors.</P>
    <P>This work continues to be progressed and enhanced as resources permit in collaboration and consultation with the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, FORFAS and industry. My Department is fully committed to strengthening the quality of science teaching and learning, promoting increased scientific literacy and encouraging more students to choose science subjects at senior cycle and progress to third level options in this critical area as a vitally important part of the national strategy to support competitiveness and employment.</P>
    <P>While the effect of these measures may only be felt in the longer term there are already some signs of improvement. At leaving certificate level there are three main science subjects, biology, chemistry and physics. Biology remains a popular subject with 40.3% of the cohort sitting the examination in June 2003, an increase from 39.8% in 2002. The uptake of physics and chemistry has been a cause of concern for some time. The decline in uptake of these subjects started in the 1980s and continued until recently. There has been a reversal of the trend in 2002. In the leaving certificate examination in June 2002, 15.6% of the cohort took physics, up from 14.1% in 2000, and 11.7% took chemistry, up from 11.1% in 1999. In 2003, 15.7% took physics and 11.9% took chemistry. At junior certificate level there is one science subject and the uptake of this subject has been consistently high with 85.7% of the cohort taking it in 2003.</P>

      <P>The Qualifications (Education and Training) Act 1999 provided for the establishment of the National Qualifications Authority of Ireland and the further and higher education and training awards councils for the accreditation of non-university education and training awards at further and higher levels. The role of the Higher Education and Training Awards Council is to establish policies and criteria for the making of higher education and training awards and the validation of programmes, to determine the standards of knowledge skills and competences to be acquired by learners for an award, to make or recognise awards and to monitor the quality of programmes, ensuring that providers have procedures for assessment of learners which are fair and consistent. The National Qualifications Authority of Ireland is responsible for establishing the overall policies and criteria for the framework of qualifications, and the procedures for the performance of the functions of the awards councils</P>
      <P>Hibernia College made an application to HETAC for validation of its graduate diploma in primary education in the format prescribed, setting out the programme objectives and outcomes, structure and outline content, assessment arrangements for learners, and facilities and staff expertise available. A panel of assessors examined the documentation and visited the college. The programme accreditation committee of HETAC considered their report and accredited the programme. A certificate of course approval was issued in July 2003.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As the Minister for Education and Science is the designated authority for recognition of qualifications for purposes of employment for the regulated profession of primary teacher, Hibernia College contacted the Department as to whether its qualification would be recognised for the purpose of employment as a primary teacher. The decision of the Minister was that he would recog<Col N="763" /> nise the qualification of graduate diploma in primary education of Hibernia College for the purpose of employment as a primary teacher provided all of the conditions set by HETAC were met, including those relating to quality assurance.</P>

      <P>The Minister for Education and Science is the designated authority for the recognition of qualifications for purposes of employment for the regulated profession of primary teaching. Applications for recognition of qualifications are received from time to time, either from individual graduates or from institutions. In the case of the graduate diploma in primary education, my Department received an application from Hibernia College seeking to have the course, which is validated by the Higher Education and Training Awards Council, HETAC, recognised for primary teaching. It is open to other providers to make an application for recognition if they so wish and any such application will be considered by my Department in the normal way.</P>

      <P>My Department does not allocate additional resource teaching hours or learning support to schools on the basis of disadvantaged status. Resource teaching hours/posts are granted based on the assessed special educational needs of individual pupils in a school under Circular Sp Ed 08/02. Learning support provision is based on the enrolment of schools. The school in question currently has a full-time learning support teacher post, which is an above average allocation based on its current enrolment. My Department has no plans at present to allocate additional learning support posts to schools.</P>
      <P>Under the disadvantaged areas scheme, the school is benefiting from the services of a disadvantaged concessionary teacher and a shared home/school/community liaison teacher. The school also qualifies for special supplementary capitation funding at the rate of &euro;38.09 per pupil and a refund of the television licence fee. The school in question is included in the urban dimension of Giving Children an Even Break, which was launched in January 2001 to tackle educational disadvantage at primary level, and is benefiting from the allocation of supplementary grant aid towards providing additional educational supports for the children concerned over the three year period of the programme. For the 2002-03 school year, the school received in the region of &euro;2,620 funding in addition to allocations that the school receives under the disadvantaged areas scheme.</P>

      <P>In recent years many improvements have been made to enable principal teachers in primary schools to perform their administrative duties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Up until the 1999/2000 school year, principals were released from teaching duties to become an administrative principal where the school had a staffing of eight or more mainstream class teachers. From the commencement of the <Col N="767" /> 2000/2001 school year, administrative principals were appointed to ordinary schools with seven mainstream class teachers and in schools with a principal plus 11 or more teachers, including ex quota posts. Since the 2002/2003 school year, administrative principals may be appointed to schools where there is a principal plus nine or more teachers, including ex quota posts.</P>
    <P>The scheme of release time for principals was also introduced for the 2000/2001 school year. This scheme enables teaching principals of primary schools to be released from their teaching duties for a specified number of days annually to undertake administrative leadership and management functions. The number of days release time granted is determined by the number of mainstream class teachers in the school as outlined in primary circular 25/02. Paid substitution is approved by my Department for the days that principals are on release time. Arising from the implementation of the PCW agreement, significant improvements were introduced to the management structure of primary schools through the allocation of additional posts of responsibility. It is a matter for the boards of management of schools to delegate functions to post of responsibility holders.</P>
    <P>My Department is currently engaged in the development of a computerised on-line system for the submission of claims for the payment of certain categories of teachers. It is expected that a pilot project will commence shortly on the implementation of this system. The system is expected to further assist principal teachers in the performance of their administrative duties.</P>

      <P>The report of the action group on access to third level education makes detailed recommendations concerning the introduction of special rates of maintenance grants for disadvantaged students, usually referred to as &ldquo;top-up grants&rdquo;. The target group of those most in need has been defined in terms of the dependants of people receiving long-term welfare payments, where the necessary conditions are fulfilled. The special rates of grant are also available to mature students who meet the prescribed conditions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In order to qualify for the special rate of maintenance grant a candidate must meet a number of conditions, including the following: s/he must already qualify for one of my Department's ordinary maintenance grants; total reckonable income must not exceed the specified limit for the academic year in question; and on the operative <Col N="770" /> date the income into the household must include one of the specified long-term social welfare payments. In order to satisfy the requirement of long-term welfare payment, the special rates of maintenance grant specifies that unemployment assistance and unemployment benefit must be payable for a specified period &ndash; 391 days and 12 months respectively &ndash; on the operative date. Disability benefit is considered to be a short-term payment and, therefore, it is not included as an eligible payment for the purposes of the special rates of maintenance grant.</P>

This proposed project is at an early stage of architectural planning and has been assigned a band 1 rating by my Department in accordance with the published criteria for prioritising large-scale projects.</P>
      <P>Projects listed in section 7 are not being authorised to progress beyond their current stage of architectural planning for the time being. The timing of when projects listed in these sections can progress to tender and construction will depend on the budgetary allocation for 2004 and subsequent years and the priority afforded to each project by reference to the band rating.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 332 to 336, inclusive, together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The National Educational Psychological Service, NEPS, is organised on a regional basis. Schools in the greater Dublin area are shared between three regions. The south-west area <Col N="773" /> serves schools in south-west Dublin, west County Dublin, County Kildare and west Wicklow. The east coast area serves schools in south-east Dublin, south County Dublin and east Wicklow. The northern area serves schools in the city and county of Dublin north of the Liffey.</P>
    <P>As a number of psychologists have recently joined NEPS, changes are being made in the allocation of schools and some additional schools will shortly have access to the psychological service. The lists will be completed by the middle of November and full details for the three regions will then be forwarded to the Deputy. Due to general staffing constraints, it is unlikely that there will be any further expansion of the NEPS service during the current school year.</P>
    <P>At present, schools that do not have access to the service may avail of the scheme for commissioning psychological assessments. Details of this scheme have been circulated to all schools and also appear on my Department's website.</P>

    <P>My Department is currently completing analysis work on the development of a primary pupils database. A project team, overseen by a steering <Col N="777" /> group, has been assigned to work on the development of this key resource, which will facilitate the collation of comprehensive data on transfer rates in the future.</P>
    <P>A number of programmes operate at both primary and post-primary level that are designed to tackle educational disadvantage and the problem of early school leaving.</P>
    <P>The Giving Children an Even Break programme provides additional financial and teaching supports for children in primary schools from disadvantaged backgrounds who are most at risk of educational disadvantage and early school leaving. Expenditure on this programme in 2003 will be in excess of &euro;17 million.</P>
    <P>A key role in this regard is also played by the home-school-community liaison scheme, which has been extended to each of the 311 designated disadvantaged primary schools in the country. This scheme helps parents to develop their skills as the primary educators of their children and also operates transfer programmes to help primary school pupils to make the transition to post primary level. Expenditure on this scheme will be in the region of &euro;7 million in 2003.</P>
    <P>The main programme within my Department for tackling the issue of early school leaving is the school completion programme, which was launched in 2002. The school completion programme is based on an integrated cross-community approach to tackling educational disadvantage, involving 82 projects, 288 primary and 112 post primary schools, parents, communities and relevant statutory and voluntary agencies. It entails targeting individual young people of school going age, both in and out of school, and arranging supports to address inequalities in education access, participation and outcomes. Total funding of &euro;23 million has been provided for the programme in 2003.</P>
    <P>The Education Welfare Act 2000, and the establishment of the National Educational Welfare Board provides a comprehensive framework for promoting regular school attendance and tackling the problems of absenteeism and early school leaving. The Act requires schools to draw up school attendance strategies in order to promote regular attendance and tackle the problems of absenteeism and early school leaving. The strategies will focus on arrangements for the identification of children who are at risk of dropping out of school at an early stage so that appropriate interventions may be put in place. To discharge its responsibilities, the board is developing a nationwide service to provide welfare-focused services to children, families and schools.</P>
    <P>A budget of &euro;5.4 million has been allocated to the board for the current year. Such concentrated and focused deployment of funds should effectively assist in redressing the problem of early school leaving.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Mr. N. Dempsey)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 347 and 348 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For the purposes of my Department's maintenance grants schemes reckonable income means all amounts, with the exception of defined social welfare and health board payments, received or receivable by an individual without reference to his-her residence or domicile, from both Irish and foreign sources, which are liable to Irish income <Col N="779" /> tax, Irish capital gains tax or Irish capital acquisitions tax, or which would be so liable but for exemptions and reliefs contained in Irish legislation. The intent of this definition is to ensure that all types of income will be included in determining a person's income for grant purposes. Tax refunds are excluded in calculating reckonable income for grant purposes.</P>
    <P>For the purposes of determining grant eligibility, all investments must be declared, including deposit accounts, savings certificates, life assurance bonds and other financial instruments where the interest-profit is accumulated and paid out as a lump sum at the end of the investment period. It is understood that there is nothing new in the recent statement by officials of the Revenue Commissioners to the public accounts committee. The press release on the Finance Bill 2001, dated 15 February 2001, described how the new savings scheme &ldquo;will be assisted by a top-up to net savings of 25% out of tax revenue by the State, equivalent to tax credit of 20%,&rdquo; and the Minister for Finance stated on Committee Stage of the Finance Bill 2001 that the top-up was &ldquo;equivalent to giving a tax credit at the standard rate of income tax for the year of assessment 2001 in respect of the amount saved.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Where income is paid out annually, as happens with a bank deposit account, the amount so paid is required to be included in reckonable income. Where income is not paid out annually but is &ldquo;rolled-up&rdquo; and paid out with the original investment at the end of a defined term, the annual amount required to be included in reckonable income is the &ldquo;rolled-up&rdquo; income divided by the number of years in the term of the investment. This procedure has been in place for the past ten years.</P>
    <P>Given its similarity with &ldquo;roll-up&rdquo; savings products it was deemed appropriate to include, as reckonable income, income from SSIAs, including the top-up, on an annual basis. The treatment of the SSIAs in this regard is consistent with the treatment of similar financial products such as post office savings certificates.</P>

      <Col N="781" />My Department strives to operate the school transport schemes in a fair and reasonable manner. When special transport cannot be provided, a transport grant may be paid to the parents-guardian of a child to assist with the cost of making private transport arrangements. The rates payable are being kept under review. However, any decision to increase the grant-aid or further improve the level of service provided will ultimately depend on the annual budgetary allocation for school transport.</P>

      <P>The course referred to by the Deputy was among a wide range of courses approved by my Department under the PLC programme for 2003-04. City of Dublin VEC decided subsequently to designate the course as a core programme under the vocational training opportunities scheme, VTOS.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The vocational training opportunities scheme, VTOS, is a second chance education and training programme which provides courses of up to two years duration for unemployed people. To be eligible for the scheme one must be over 21 years of age, unemployed for at least six months and in receipt of specific social welfare payments. A participant on a VTOS programme receives free <Col N="784" /> tuition and is entitled to a training allowance in lieu of an unemployment payment, equivalent to the maximum rate of unemployment benefit. VTOS students with other eligible social welfare entitlements, such as one-parent family payment, continue to receive their payment from the Department of Social and Family Affairs.</P>
    <P>VTOS students receive books and materials free of charge, and may be entitled to a travel allowance if they reside more than three miles from a centre. A training bonus of &euro;31.80 per week is also paid to students who have been in receipt of their social welfare payment for at least 12 months directly before joining VTOS. Limited child care support is also available. Students on designated PLC courses receive free tuition but they may be required to pay for books, uniforms-clothing and equipment where the items purchased become their personal property, student services, registration charges by professional bodies, examination fees and certification fees. PLC students may apply for a means tested maintenance grant. The student in question should contact the adult education organiser in City of Dublin VEC for advice regarding course options available to her.</P>

      <P>The funding arrangements made by my Department for second level schools reflect the different management and ownership arrangements for vocational schools and community colleges, comprehensive and community schools and voluntary secondary schools.</P>
      <P>At the core of funding arrangements at second level is reliance upon capitation as the principal determinant of funding. Voluntary secondary schools are funded on a <i>per capita</i> grant basis. The financial allocations for vocational schools and community colleges are made to the vocational education committees as part of a block grant, which also covers the VEC head office overheads and other activities apart from the second level programme. The Department does not earmark allocations for individual schools or for the various activities of vocational education committees. The way in which the grant is distributed among schools is a matter for each committee in line with their priorities and perceptions of need.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Significant improvements have also been made in the level of funding to secondary schools. The standard <i>per capita </i>grant from &euro;224.74 that applied in 1997, was increased to &euro;266.49 in September 2002. An additional <i>per capita </i>grant of &euro;38.09 is paid to disadvantaged schools bringing <Col N="785" /> the total <i>per capita </i>grant in the case of such schools to over &euro;300.</P>
    <P>In addition, under the school services support fund initiative, secondary schools have benefited from further significant increases in the support grant from &euro;25.40 per pupil in 2000 to &euro;88.88 from September 2002 and to &euro;99 per pupil from 1 January 2003.</P>
    <P>Funding for voluntary secondary schools has been further enhanced by the introduction of a range of equalisation measures that are designed to reduce the historic anomalies in the funding arrangements for the different school types at second level. Under the terms of recent equalisation measures, the support services grant was increased by &euro;28 per pupil with effect from September 2002. This brings the support services grant in the case of voluntary secondary schools to &euro;116.88 per pupil from September 2002 and to &euro;127 per pupil from 1 January 2003. This increase is in addition to the range of equalisation grants of up to &euro;15,554 per school, &euro;44.44 per pupil, per annum that was approved for secondary schools in December 2001.</P>
    <P>For a voluntary secondary school with 500 pupils, this amounts to extra funding of up to &euro;100,000 per annum, and annual grants of up to &euro;236,761, &euro;255,811 in the case of disadvantaged schools, towards general expenses and support services.</P>
    <P>Schools have welcomed these improvements. It is my intention to further improve the financial position of secondary schools to the extent that the availability of resources permits.</P>

      <P>The way in which my Department provides secretarial services to second level schools reflects the different management and ownership arrangements for vocational schools, community colleges and voluntary secondary schools.</P>
      <P>In the case of secondary schools, my Department provides funding towards the cost of secretarial services under two separate schemes. One scheme is the 1978-79 scheme for the employment of school secretaries under which my Department meets the full cost of salary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The 1978-79 scheme is being phased out as posts become vacant and no new posts are being created. It has been superseded by the PESP grant scheme which was introduced in 1992. The PESP scheme provides grants to secondary schools towards the cost of secretarial services. These grants are paid in addition to the standard <i>per capita </i>grant. The grant for secretarial services <Col N="786" /> is at the rate of &euro;38.10 per pupil, subject to a maximum of &euro;13,335 per annum. An additional equalisation grant of &euro;25.39 per pupil subject to a maximum to &euro;8,887 per school was introduced towards secretarial services. The scheme, by its nature, is flexible and gives schools discretion as to the manner in which these services are provided. Secretaries employed by schools are employees of the individual schools and my Department does not have any role regarding how they are employed. In the case of vocational schools and colleges, caretaking and secretarial staff are allocated to vocational education committees on a scheme wide basis. The way in which staffing is allocated to schools is a matter for each VEC in line with their priorities and perceptions of need. My Department has made provision for secretarial services for all VEC schools with enrolments in excess of 200 pupils. All second level schools also benefit from the schools services support fund which is set at &euro;99 per pupil, subject to a minimum of &euro;19,800 per annum. Under the school services support fund secondary schools are entitled to an additional &euro;28 per pupil bringing the total grant to &euro;127 per pupil from 1 January 2003 subject to a minimum of &euro;25,400 and which may be used towards the provision of additional secretarial services. The manner of the provision of these services is a matter for each school.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. N. Dempsey Mr. N. Dempsey">

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 362, 380, 386, 388 and 389 together.</P>
      <P>Responsibility for arranging insurance cover on school property and against public liability is a matter for the managerial authorities of voluntary secondary schools, which are privately owned. <i>Per capita</i> grants towards the operating costs of voluntary secondary schools may be used for this purpose. <i>Per capita </i>grants have been increased significantly in recent years.</P>
      <P>In the case of voluntary secondary schools, the standard <i>per capita </i>grant now amounts to &euro;266.49 as against the rate of &euro;224.74 that applied in 1997. For disadvantaged schools the increase has brought the <i>per capita</i> grant to over &euro;300. In addition, secondary schools have benefited under the school services support initiative. The initial grant of &euro;25 per pupil that was introduced for schools in September 2000 was increased to &euro;63 per pupil in November 2001. It was further increased to &euro;116.88 per pupil from September 2002 and was further increased by &euro;10 per pupil from January last bringing the support services grant in the case of voluntary secondary schools to &euro;127 per pupil.</P>
      <P>This increase is in addition to the range of equalisation grants of up to &euro;15,554 per school, &euro;44.44 per pupil per annum that has been approved for voluntary secondary schools. Schools are afforded considerable flexibility in the use of these resources to cater for the needs of their pupils. This is in my view, in general, a preferable approach to putting in place grants for specific initiatives. For example, in a school with 500 pupils, this amounts to extra funding of up to &euro;100,000 per annum and annual grants of &euro;236,761, &euro;255,811 in the case of disadvantaged schools towards general expenses and support services, including insurance costs.</P>
      <P>Tackling the difficulties that are being caused by high insurance premiums is a clear priority for the Government and for my colleague, the Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment. A key concern to which the Tánaiste is giving priority is the cost and availability of liability insurance. In this context, the Tánaiste has announced a comprehensive programme for the fundamental reform of the Irish insurance market. The Government considers that these measures, taken as a package, constitute a programme that is capable of delivering very real reform and that reductions in insurance costs will translate into significant reductions in premiums.</P>

      <P>Significant improvements have been made in the level of funding to secondary schools. The standard <i>per capita</i> grant from &euro;224.74 that applied in 1997, was increased to &euro;266.49 in September 2002. An additional <i>per capita</i> grant of &euro;38.09 is paid to disadvantaged schools bringing the total <i>per capita</i> grant in the case of such schools to over &euro;300.</P>
      <P>In addition, under the school services support fund initiative, secondary schools have benefited from further significant increases in the support grant from &euro;25.40 per pupil in 2000 to &euro;88.88 from September 2002 and to &euro;99 per pupil from 1 January 2003.</P>
      <P>Funding for voluntary secondary schools has been further enhanced by the introduction of a range of equalisation measures that are designed to reduce the historic anomalies in the funding arrangements for the different school types at second level. Under the terms of recent equalisation measures, the support services grant was increased by &euro;28 per pupil with effect from September 2002. This brings the support services grant in the case of voluntary secondary schools to &euro;116.88 per pupil from September 2002 and to &euro;127 per pupil from 1 January 2003. This increase is in addition to the range of equalisation grants of up to &euro;15,554 per school, &euro;44.44 per pupil, per annum that was approved for secondary schools in December 2001.</P>
      <P>For a voluntary secondary school with 500 pupils, this amounts to extra funding of up to &euro;100,000 per annum, and annual grants of up to &euro;236,761, &euro;255,811 in the case of disadvantaged schools, towards general expenses and support services.</P>

      <P>The third level student support schemes operated under the aegis of my Department provide a means tested grant to students who are pursuing their first undergraduate or postgraduate course and who comply with the terms and conditions of the scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The higher education grants scheme operates under the Local Authorities (Higher Education Grants) Acts 1968 to 1992. These Acts define a mature student to mean a person &ldquo;of not less than 23 years of age, or such other age as may stand specified for the time being in regulations made by the Minister with the consent of the Minister for Finance, who have secured places in <Col N="789" /> approved institutions and have reached that age on the 1st day of January, or such other date as may be prescribed from time to time by the Minister with the consent of the Minister for Finance, in the year of entry to such institutions&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Under the terms and conditions of the student support schemes, mature students are categorised as either independent mature students or mature students dependent on parents. An independent mature student is defined to mean a mature student who was not ordinarily resident at home with his or her parents-guardians from 1 October preceding their entry to an approved course. Independent mature students are assessed without reference to either their parents-guardians income or address.</P>
    <P>When assessing the means of students other than independent mature students, the schemes specify that the students' means and those of their parents-guardians must be below a prescribed limit. This provision requires that the parents' income be taken into account, irrespective of the individual circumstances in any case where the student is not an independent mature student.</P>
    <P>It is not possible to depart from the terms of the schemes in individual cases, such as that referred to by the Deputy.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 373 to 375, inclusive, 377 and 379 together.</P>
      <P>Teachers in national schools are generalists rather than subject specialists and must be qualified to teach the range of primary school subjects to children aged four to 12 years. Accordingly, applicants must satisfy the Department of Education and Science that they are competent to teach the Irish language and to teach the range of primary school curricular subjects through the medium of Irish before being granted full recognition to teach in mainstream classes in national schools.</P>
      <P>Teachers trained outside the jurisdiction of the State, whose qualifications have been assessed and accepted by my Department, but who do not possess an appropriate Irish language qualification, are granted a five year period of provisional recognition to teach in mainstream classes in national schools.</P>
      <P>During this period these teachers are expected to obtain their Irish language qualification in order to become fully recognised. These teachers are remunerated in the same manner as fully qualified teachers during this period.</P>
      <P>Holders of provisional recognition are given five years in which they must pass the written, aural and oral parts of an examination in the Irish language An Scrudú le hAghaidh Cáilíochta sa Ghaeilge, SCG. This examination is held twice each year in four centres, Athlone, Dublin, Cork and Sligo.</P>
      <P>Applications for the examination are processed by primary administration section 1 of my Department in Athlone. Applicants must be holders of provisional recognition.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Correspondence and proposals have been received in relation to the examinations from a considerable number of sources. Much of the correspondence relates to individual cases. In the main, correspondence from individuals related to the demands of the examinations and their stated difficulty in achieving a pass. By way of response <Col N="793" /> to the wide range of correspondence I established a working group to review all aspects of the syllabus and examination for the Scrúdú le hAghaidh Cáilíochta sa Ghaeilge in 2001. Institúid Teangeolaíochta Éireann, the colleges of education, primary school management organisations, the INTO, the National Parents Council &ndash; Primary &ndash; and the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment were represented on this working group. Organisations were invited to submit proposals as part of the review of the SCG and all such proposals were given full consideration by the working group in preparing its report.</P>
    <P>The report of the working group has now been finalised and is on the point of being presented to my Department. To date the review group has drafted an interim syllabus. The redrafted syllabus was circulated to all schools in December 2002 and the SCG examinations held on 29, 30 and 31 October 2003 were the first series of SCG examinations to be based on this syllabus.</P>
    <P>The review group has also drafted a handbook for the examination. The handbook will contain detailed information on the SCG and will provide answers to a wide range of questions raised by candidates. The review committee is also recommending changes to the content and format of the examination modules to take effect possibly from autumn of 2004. It is also planned to produce a textbook of relevant prose and poetry for future examinations.</P>
    <P>Until such time as a teacher passes the SCG, they are not considered fully qualified as a teacher in a mainstream national school. Candidates are expected to have knowledge of the teaching methods of Irish as a mother tongue and as a second language to primary school children, and of strategies to promote the use of Irish as a language of communication and as a teaching medium. The standard required to obtain a pass in the SCG is the standard of Irish that would enable teachers to teach the language to sixth class in a national school. Candidates must therefore demonstrate that they have attained the level of language competence described in the syllabus and reflected in the examination papers, and that they understand the methodology of teaching Irish as a second language. It must be borne in mind that many primary schools not only teach Irish but have Irish as the principal language of instruction and communication generally. The number of such schools has in fact grown significantly in recent years. A primary teacher may have to teach pupils whose mother tongue is Irish, or who are competent users of the language. Even when teaching Irish to pupils whose mother tongue is English or another language, it is widely accepted by language teachers that, in order to be effective, the teacher needs to have a very good command of the language.</P>
    <P>It should be noted that the Minister of the day and his or her Department have the right, as established by the European Court in the Groener case, to insist on teacher competence in Irish.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="794" />In addition, the review group have given full consideration to the standard of Irish required in the examinations in producing its report.</P>
    <P>In relation to resources available to teachers wishing to sit for the SCG courses of study aimed specifically at candidates for the SCG are run by a number of education centres throughout the country. Copies of past examination papers, including tapes of the aural examinations are available on request from primary administration section 1 of my Department in Athlone. In addition the interim syllabus for the SCG examinations which was circulated to all schools in December 2002 included a reading list of prose and poetry to be studied for the examinations.</P>
    <P>The primary sector has experienced a shortage of trained teachers in recent years, mainly as a result of the large number of posts created to reduce class sizes, to cater for pupils in disadvantaged areas and to provide for those with special educational needs. The difficulties being experienced are aggravated by the number of teachers availing of career break and job-sharing schemes.</P>
    <P>My Department has introduced a range of measures to address the current shortage of qualified teachers and is also examining further options for addressing the teacher supply issue in consultation with relevant interests.</P>
    <P>Since 1999, over 1,000 students have been admitted annually to the B.Ed. programme in the colleges of education. This represents a doubling of the number admitted to the programme in 1996.</P>
    <P>The total intake in the 2002-03 academic year is approximately 1,350 students. This compares with an intake of 500 in 1996-97. There are currently some 3,500 students enrolled and pursuing various stages of primary teacher training programmes in the colleges of education.</P>
    <P>I have recently announced that I will be prepared to recognise graduates of a new primary teacher training course for the purposes of primary teaching. The new course is being accredited by HETAC and it will be delivered by Hibernia college.</P>
    <P>It is important also to acknowledge that the colleges of education have done much to increase the output of primary teachers to meet the needs of schools arising from significant additional teacher allocations in recent years.</P>
    <P>In addition to increasing the output of graduates, other initiatives have been introduced to increase the number of trained personnel. B.Ed. graduates of St. Mary's College, Belfast, who have studied Irish to honours level as an academic subject as part of their teaching qualifications are now recognised as fully qualified.</P>
    <P>Montessori trained teachers who have successfully completed the full-time course of three years duration at St. Nicholas, Dún Laoghaire, which is recognised by HETAC, or the Montessori qualification which is awarded on completion of the three year full-time course in the AMI College, are recognised as being fully qualified substitute teachers and are <Col N="795" /> recognised to teach in certain categories of special schools, special classes and as resource teachers in primary schools.</P>
    <P>The decision to recognise fully qualified teachers who trained outside the State to teach in certain categories of schools and classes without the necessity to hold an Irish language qualification is also contributing to an improvement in the supply of trained primary teachers.</P>
    <P>I am committed to ensuring that the existing shortage of qualified teachers will be eliminated within the next two to three years and in this context my Department will continue to consider new initiatives and keep existing initiatives under review.</P>

Prior to that candidates were required to pass all four sections of the examination in one sitting.

      <P>The function of the learning support &ndash; remedial &ndash; teacher service is to address the needs of students who have identified weaknesses in the areas of literacy or numeracy. Such students would generally be those who score below the tenth percentile in standardised tests of literacy or numeracy.</P>
      <P>The resource teacher service addresses the needs of students who have been professionally assessed as having special educational needs arising from an intellectual, sensory or physical disability. The resource teacher service can be made available to support the placement of such students in ordinary classes on an integrated basis. In some cases the level of disability involved can be such as to require placement in a dedicated special class attached to a second level school or in a special school dedicated to a particular disability group.</P>
      <P>Decisions on the model of response adopted in individual cases are based on the professionally assessed needs of the individual student and have regard to the wishes of the student and his or her parents.</P>

A standard application form is available to schools wishing to apply for support for students special needs. School authorities have been advised that all such applications must be supported by a professional assessment report on each student identifying the <Col N="797" /> special needs involved and the nature and level of the support required.</P>
      <P>Each application for special education services is considered on the basis of the professionally assessed needs of the individual student(s) involved and having regard to the resources already available to the school to address its students special needs.</P>
      <P>The number of whole-time equivalent teacher posts being allocated to address special educational needs in the second level system for the current school year has been increased by approximately 300 over the 2002/03 level.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Mr. N. Dempsey)</NameTxt>
      <P>There are no cutbacks in the provision of resources for children with special educational needs within the areas identified by him. My Department's commitment to supporting children with special educational needs is reflected in the very significant growth in investment in special needs provision in recent years, as follows.</P>
      <P>The number of learning support teachers in the primary school system has increased from 1,302 in 1998 to 1,531 at present. The annual salary cost of these teachers is approximately &euro;54 million. The number of resource teachers has increased from 104 in 1998 to more than 2,300 currently. The annual salary cost of these teachers is estimated at over &euro;70 million. The number of special needs assistants has grown from 300 in 1998 to 4,239 full-time and a further 1,264 part-time posts. The annual salary cost of this service is estimated at &euro;100 million for 2003. The allocation for part-time tuition services for children with special needs has been increased from &euro;12 million in 2002 to &euro;19 million in 2003.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The allocation for school transport in 2003 is &euro;97.5 million, which is an increase of 18.5% on last year's allocation. Almost 30% of the budget for school transport is being expended to facilitate the transport requirements of between 9,000 and 10,000 children with special needs at an average cost of &euro;3,300 per pupil. Approximately &euro;4.4 <Col N="800" /> million is spent annually on the school transport escort service.</P>
    <P>Funding towards special equipment has increased from &euro;635,000 in 1998 to &euro;3.26 million in 2003.</P>
    <P>There are approximately 500 special classes attached to mainstream primary schools. These classes cater for an estimated 4,000 pupils. There are 108 special schools catering for approximately 6,000 pupils. These schools employ an estimated 1,090 teachers at an annual salary cost of &euro;43.6 million.</P>
    <P>The significant gains in recent years will be underpinned by structural and legislative provision. Towards that end, the National Council for Special Education has been established and the Education for Persons with Disabilities Bill 2003 has been published.</P>
    <P>Circular SP ED 24/03 issued to all national schools in September 2003. The basic purpose of the circular is twofold: to ensure that applications for resource teacher and special needs assistant support are processed as efficiently as possible; and that such resources are targeted to best effect on an ongoing basis.</P>
    <P>The circular is not proposing any cut in resources. Rather, it requires schools to take full account of the resources they already have before applying for more. Any other approach would be neither appropriate nor sustainable.</P>
    <P>The resources that have been, and that continue to be, sanctioned by my Department represent real and substantial improvements in special education services. They provide concrete evidence of the Government's commitment to build on the unprecedented development of special education services.</P>

      <P>On the enactment and commencement of the Bill children with special educational needs arising from an educational disability will have a right to an assessment, a right to an individual education plan and a right to have the plan implemented with all the services that requires. Their parents will have a right to be involved and consulted at every stage of their child's development.</P>
      <P>The rights of the child and parents to services are safeguarded by the right of appeal to the Special Education Appeals Board against any incorrect or inadequate statement or description contained in his or her education plan and against any failure by a school or health board to implement any part of the plan.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 8(7) of the Bill requires that the funds necessary for the implementation of education plans will be made available to schools by the <Col N="801" /> Minister for Education and Science and the Minister for Health and Children with the consent of the Minister for Finance. The availability of services and health and education professionals to provide them will depend on a range of factors and it is anticipated that full implementation will require a number of years, in this regard it will be a function of the National Council for Special Education to advise me on the pace of implementation. In any event implementation cannot take more than five years.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources (Mr. D. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 8 of the Gas Act 1976 requires Bord Gáis Éireann, BGE, which was established under that Act, to have regard for such safety requirements as are necessary in the transmission and distribution of natural gas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="804" />Further functions were conferred on BGE in ensuring the safety of the public under Statutory Instrument No. 238 of 1987, which was made under section 2(1)(<i>c</i>) of the Gas (Amendment) Act 1987. Article 8 of that order requires that BGE shall refuse to supply gas or refuse to continue to supply gas if it is of the opinion that it would give rise to an abnormal risk affecting safety. The order also obliges BGE to exercise at all times the practices and standards of a prudent gas undertaking and to have regard to relevant international standards and practices.</P>
    <P>In 1987 BGE established its current safety assurance programme, which enables the company to meet its obligations under this legislation. Gas is supplied without mandatory inspection only to installations that meet the requirements of this programme, one of which is that the installer has demonstrated the necessary competence in safe installations by completing the relevant FÁS course or holding an equivalent qualification. A random selection of installations is inspected after natural gas has been supplied. This system is regularly audited.</P>
    <P>The Gas Technical Standards Committee, GTSC, was formed in 1981 with the objective of advising the National Standards Authority of Ireland on what Irish standards and codes of practice are necessary for products and processes used in the gas industry, with particular regard to safety. The GTSC comprises the representatives of: the Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources; the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment; the Health and Safety Authority; the National Standards Authority of Ireland; Bord Gáis Éireann; and the Irish Liquid Petroleum Gas Association. The standards cover all aspects of the supply and usage of both natural gas and liquefied petroleum gas, LPG. The relevant areas of coverage are: transmission of gas, distribution of gas through urban networks, services to installations in all kinds of buildings, and gas appliances for domestic and commercial use. Another important focus of the committee's work is the continued harmonisation of Irish standards with European standards, in co-operation with CEN, the European Standards Organisation.</P>
    <P>Investigations are ongoing into recent incidents involving gas safety. The GTSC will review these incidents and take on board, as appropriate, any recommendations arising from these investigations in the context of strengthening future standards for the industry.</P>
    <P>Under the Gas (Interim) Regulation Act 2002 both the Commission for Energy Regulation, CER, and the Minister are required to have regard to the need to promote safety on the part of natural gas undertakings. In accordance with this responsibility, and in advance of the introduction of full competition into the natural gas market, I intend to place the responsibility for safety of domestic installation with a body independent of Bord Gáis Éireann and other gas companies. The details of the proposed arrangements <Col N="805" /> are currently being worked out by my Department in consultation with the CER and will form part of the forthcoming Gas Regulation Bill. It is my intention to bring this Bill before the Oireachtas during 2004.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources (Mr. D. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>Aquaculture is regulated through the licensing system established by the Fisheries (Amendment) Act 1997, and fish farmers must conduct their operations in <Col N="806" /> accordance with the terms and conditions of their licences.</P>
      <P>My Department operates, with the advice and assistance of the Marine Institute, a system of monitoring and control to ensure that aquaculture operations are carried on in accordance with licence terms and conditions.</P>
      <P>I regard strict compliance with the obligations and requirements specified in licences as a matter of the highest importance. I was, therefore, very concerned by recent reports of instances of alleged departures from the high standards required of aquaculture operations. Any such case will be fully and rigorously investigated and appropriate action, up to and including prosecution or licence revocation, will be taken where justified in the light of the results of the investigation. The Deputy will appreciate that it would not be appropriate, however, to comment on particular cases or the action that may be taken in respect of them.</P>
      <P>In addition to the investigation of specific cases, my Department has been instructed to initiate a comprehensive review of the procedures currently in place for monitoring and control of aquaculture. The objective of this review, which will be carried out as a priority, is to ensure that appropriate monitoring, control and enforcement processes are in place for the ongoing effective regulation of the industry.</P>
      <P>The salmon farming industry had a production in 2002 of over 22,00 tonnes, valued at over &euro;71 million and provided full or part time employment for over 900 people. I reject the Deputy's suggestion that the salmon farming industry has been developed at the expense of wild fisheries. The Government is committed to ensuring that any development of salmon farming takes place on a sustainable basis and in accordance with high standards of environmental and ecological protection. It is committed also to conserving wild fisheries resources in their own right and their viability and economic and social contribution at national and local community levels. To those ends, the aquaculture licensing system ensures that a fish farm development is permitted only after full consideration of all relevant issues, including likely effects on wild fisheries. Moreover, conditions and requirements are specified in any licence granted in order that a fish farm will operate in accordance with appropriate standards, having regard to factors such as the nature of its business and its location.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will be aware that the issue of alleged effects of salmon farming on sea trout stocks has been a matter of debate and disagreement for a considerable period. Action has been taken on a precautionary basis through the establishment of a comprehensive programme for monitoring and control of sea lice levels at fish farms. While this system is well developed and allows remedial action to be taken at an early stage, it will be examined as part of the wider review of enforcement and control that I have initiated.</P>

      <P>Government policy for the sector remains as set out in the 1996 strategy Growing for the Future and was most recently reaffirmed in the new partnership agreement Sustaining Progress. Implementation of the strategy over the period to 2030 was costed at &euro;3.96 billion at 1996 values. The funding allocation for forestry for 2004 will be determined in the context of the Estimates process for that year. In the latter context, I can assure the Deputy that the Government will make fully informed decisions on all allocations of public moneys, including in relation to forestry, in the context of the Estimates process. However, it is not appropriate at this point to speculate, in advance of Government consideration, on matters relating to the funding allocations for particular programmes in 2004.</P>
      <P>As it is seven years since the launch of the strategy, Growing for the Future, I have directed that it should now be reviewed. This review will reflect the significant changes in the sector as a whole since 1996 and will involve wide stakeholder consultation. It will address, <i>inter alia,</i> the cost and benefits of forestry together with the interaction between forestry and more traditional agricultural land-use supports and policies.</P>
      <P>The House should be made aware of the historic and future cost of forestry. Some &euro;613 million has been invested by the Government and the EU in forestry since 1997 representing an annual average of about &euro;88 million and, if existing policies were to continue, annual average costs, assuming respectively planting of 10,000 hectares and 20,000 hectares per annum, would be &euro;100 million or &euro;130 million over the next three years. Under the Rural Development Programme 2000-2006 the EU funds 50% of these costs. By 2020 the gross annual cost of meeting the targets outlined in the Government strategy for the sector could be over &euro;210 million.</P>

      <P>As previously stated to this House, my overriding objective is to preserve the salmon resource in its own right and <Col N="808" /> for the coastal and rural communities that it helps to support. The economic goals for a sustainable commercial salmon fishery based on quality and value rather than volume, and also the development of salmon angling as an important tourism product, are both fully compatible with the primary objective.</P>
      <P>I have no plans to introduce a national set-aside scheme for commercial salmon fishermen. There is already a regime of measures, including quotas and bag limits which are being implemented through the central and regional fisheries boards, the aim of which is to first and foremost allow adequate spawning stock into our rivers through the establishment of and adherence to conservation limits leading to restoration of salmon stocks and a sustainable salmon fishery.</P>
      <P>Should a regional fisheries board bring forward developed proposals for a local catchment based set-aside scheme, however, I would be prepared to consider such a proposal provided that any matching funds required would come from within the existing allocations to the fisheries boards.</P>

      <P>I am acutely aware of the problems that resulted from the necessary decisions taken by the Arts Council as a consequence of reduced funding this year. These problems have been highlighted by various arts organisations, including by Theatre Forum. However, while I always regret having to accept reduced funding for any area within my remit, and particularly for the arts, the reality is that the sort of year-on-year growth that had been possible in boom times simply cannot be maintained when the economic tide turns, and in the prevailing circumstances, I believe that I got the best deal for the arts that could be achieved in 2003.</P>
      <P>Our Estimates system is based on an annual cycle, which is not obviously compatible with the multi-annual approach to funding. I cannot therefore respond positively to Theatre Forum's suggestions in this context. The forthcoming Estimates process will determine the funding provided for 2004. In that context I will be pressing the case for increased arts funding to the maximum extent possible.</P>

National tourism policy is already firmly aligned with the tourism strategy set out in the national spatial strategy. My Department's policy on arts and sport contains a strong commitment to developing the national arts and sports infrastructure.

I am delighted that the national spatial strategy has recognised the importance of the provision of a quality leisure infrastructure for dispersed development.

      <P>The funding of voluntary organisations is a matter for the health boards. Health boards provide funding to voluntary organisations based on the board's priorities and their requirements for the services which the organisation provides. The Health Boards Executive, HeBE, also considers applications for funding where the work or service of the voluntary body is national or cross-board.</P>
      <P>I understand that an application for funding from CARI was considered recently by both the Northern Area Health Board and the health boards executive. Given financial constraints and a review of services for children who have been sexually abused which is ongoing in the Eastern Regional Health Authority area at present, the Northern Area Health Board or the Health Boards Executive are not in a position to provide additional funding for CARI.</P>

      <P>The information requested by the Deputy on the occupancy levels at the eight hospitals mentioned is being provided separately. In-patient bed occupancy is the most widely used measure of hospital activity. The level of bed occupancy is a key factor in determining the ability of hospitals to admit patients, particularly those requiring elective admission. The percentage bed occupancy levels presented in the information being provided to the Deputy are consistent with the recorded levels in major hospitals in Ireland over recent years. The internationally accepted level of bed occupancy for acute hospitals with emergency medicine departments is 85%. This level has been established as being essential to cater for the demands imposed by around-the-clock availability of emergency services and fluctuations in demand for acute admission to hospital.</P>
      <P>The report Acute Hospital Bed Capacity &ndash; A National Review, which I published in January 2002, examined bed occupancy levels nationally and helped to inform the Government in its decision to provide a total of 3,000 acute beds for public patients over the next ten years. This represents the largest ever concentrated expansion of acute hospital capacity in Ireland. As part of this initiative 568 new beds have already been provided in hospitals throughout the country.</P>

      <P>The policy of the Department of Health and Children on services for older people is to maintain them in dignity and independence at home in accordance with their wishes, as expressed in many research studies; to restore to independence at home those older people who become ill or dependent; to encourage and support the care of older people in their own community by family, neighbours and voluntary bodies; and to provide a high quality of hospital and residential care for older people when they can no longer be maintained in dignity and independence at home. The role of the home help service is vital to this policy.</P>
      <P>Following the publication, in 1998, of the report entitled The Future Organisation of the Home Help service in Ireland by the National Council on Ageing and Older People, I am pleased to say that there has been a major step forward in the implementation of the home help scheme from 1999 onwards, both in terms of the amount of service delivered and treatment of the home helps themselves. On the latter point, the days when home helps worked for a pittance are, I am happy to say, long gone. Upwards of &euro;30 million has been injected into the system to ensure that home helps receive a decent level of pay and other entitlements such as holidays and sick-leave. On the service side, an additional &euro;7 million has been made available to the health boards to increase the level of home help service availability through the employment of more home helps, or by increasing the number of hours worked by existing home helps.</P>
      <P>There are a number of reasons there is an increased demand on the home help service, which include the demographic fact that approximately 6,000 people are coming into the over-65 bracket every year and also there is, proportionately, a bigger percentage increase in the more dependant over-80 category. These factors may necessitate some minor adjustments in the provision of the home help service. I have been assured by all the health boards that the provision of the home help service is organised on the basis that the more vulnerable clients are given priority.</P>
      <P>The increased expenditure on the home help service is set out precisely in the following table:</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 442 and 506 together.</P>
      <P>Each health board is obliged to ensure that an equitable, accessible and comprehensive family planning service is provided in its area. The Department issued guidelines to the health boards in 1995 on the provision of family planning services to all persons in their area who need such services. These services are provided primarily through general practitioners, non-governmental organisations and, to some extent, maternity hospitals/units. Significant additional funding &ndash;&euro;5.73 million &ndash; was provided for the development of family planning and pregnancy counselling services between 1999 and 2002.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I understand that in August 2000, the Northern Area Health Board, in partnership with the Irish <Col N="823" /> Family Planning Association, initiated a family planning-women's health service at the Irish Family Planning Association's premises in Cathal Brugha Street. The services provided are complementary to those available to medical card holders through their own general practitioner and they are intended to provide an element of choice for medical card holders in the area of reproductive health.</P>
    <P>In 2003, a budget of &euro;140,000 was made available to the Irish Family Planning Association for the provision of services to medical cardholders. This represented an increase of 10% on the previous years allocation. The Irish Family Planning Association were asked to take appropriate steps to manage the delivery of services within their allocation, but failed to do so, and have suspended services to medical cardholders with effect from 13 October 2003.</P>
    <P>I am advised that officials from the Northern Area Health Board will shortly be meeting with the management of the IFPA to review the situation. Medical cardholders in the area are, of course, still entitled to access reproductive health services through their general practitioners.</P>
    <P>With regard to the provision of funding to the IFPA from other sources, I should point out that the Crisis Pregnancy Agency has allocated substantial amounts to the IFPA for crisis pregnancy counselling services and post-crisis pregnancy supports. In 2002, a total of &euro;94,356 was provided for (i) crisis pregnancy counselling services in Sligo, Waterford, Donegal and Dundalk, (ii) post-abortion support groups in eight IFPA centres and (iii) for the development of the association's web page. To the end of 2003, a sum of &euro;74,977, out of a total allocation of &euro;222,164, will be paid to the IFPA for similar crisis pregnancy counselling services and post-abortion supports. I understand that the Crisis Pregnancy Agency has made a commitment to provide continued funding for these services from 2004 onwards. The exact level of funding for these services is to be agreed with the IFPA before the end of 2003.</P>

      <P>The Irish Medicines Board, IMB, which has statutory responsibility for licensing all pharmaceutical products for use in Ireland, has provided the following information in relation to thiomersal.</P>
      <P>Thiomersal is a mercury-containing preservative used in vaccines to prevent bacterial contamination. There has been no thiomersal in the vaccines used in the national primary childhood immunisation programme &ndash; that is, newborn to two years &ndash; since 1996. This includes BCG, DTaP*-Oral Polio-Hib and MMR.</P>
      <P>The IMB has advised that thiomersal is present in the newer four in one and five in one vaccines &ndash; Tetravac and Pentavac &ndash; in trace amounts. The trace amounts are equivalent to values below the limit of detection corresponding to less than 18 nanograms per vaccine dose. According to the IMB, these trace amounts of mercury have no biological effect and such products should be considered equivalent to thiomersal-free products. The IMB has further clarified that, as with any agent, hypersensitivity reactions can occur in sensitised individuals despite this very low concentration. However, previous experience with Pentavac and Tetravac in other countries has shown no evidence of any such reactions having occurred due to thiomersal.</P>
      <P>The <i>Lancet</i> recently published an article which suggests that the level of thiomersal in vaccines given in infancy does not appear to elevate blood concentrations of mercury above safe levels in infants. The IMB has published articles on the subject of thiomersal in its drug safety newsletter. These articles are available at <i>www.imb.ie</i>.</P>

      <P>Since my appointment as Minister of State I have encouraged all service providers to develop all services in order to provide personal care packages. The home care grant project referred to by the Deputy is currently being piloted in the East Coast and Northern Area Health Boards and is being evaluated by Trinity College Dublin on behalf of the Eastern Regional Health Authority. The Deputy might be interested to note that I am formally launching Slán Abhaile in the East Coast Area Health Board today. This service is the board's version of the home first scheme, which is already in operation in the Northern Area Health Board. This service is being targeted at older people to help support them in making the transition from acute hospital care to living at home and provide high level support for a particular period when such support is critical.</P>
      <P>These pilot projects have been developed by the Eastern Regional Health Authority in consultation with the area health boards to deal with the particular circumstances which prevail in the authority's area where the discharge of older people from the acute hospital sector has been delayed. The pilot projects are designed to support older people in the transition from acute hospital care back to independent living.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>Responsibility for human resource planning, including the monitoring and filling of vacant occupational therapist and speech and language therapist posts in each health board region, rests with the chief executive officer, chief executive officer, of each board. Each chief executive officer, in managing the workforce in his-her region, is responsible for determining the appropriate staffing mix and the precise grades of staff to be employed in line with service plan priorities, subject to overall employment levels remaining within the approved regional employment ceiling. My Department does not, therefore, routinely collect information on vacant occupational therapist or speech therapist posts within each health board. However, as the Deputy may be aware, <Col N="829" /> intensive efforts have been undertaken to improve staffing levels in occupational therapy and speech and language therapy, both at local and national level. The success of these measures is reflected in the increase of 77 speech and language therapists &ndash; an increase of 20% &ndash; and 208 occupational therapists &ndash; an increase of 47% &ndash; employed in the public health service during the past two years. Relevant developments include the continued implementation of the recommendations of the report of the expert group on various health professions, which included new pay scales and career structures, the undertaking of a concerted overseas recruitment drive on behalf of all health boards, the introduction of a fast track working visa scheme for health and social care professionals and the streamlining of procedures for the validation of overseas qualifications.</P>
    <P>In addition, significant increases in training places in speech and language therapy and occupational therapy have now also taken place through the establishment of new courses in University College Cork, the National University of Ireland, Galway, and the University of Limerick to meet the health service's long-term human resource requirements in speech and language therapy and occupational therapy as estimated in the report Current and Future Demand Conditions in the Labour Market for Certain Professional Therapists prepared by Peter Bacon and Associates and published in July 2001.</P>

      <QRef>[25165/03]</QRef>
    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>The aim of my Department is to develop the <Col N="830" /> treatment capacity of orthodontics in a sustainable way over the longer term. Given the potential level of demand for orthodontic services, the provision of those services will continue to be based on prioritisation of cases based on treatment need, as happens under the existing guidelines.</P>
      <P>I understand that the Deputy is referring to the 1996 Moran report on orthodontics, which referred to an index of treatment need. This is an alternative means of assessing children's need for orthodontic treatment. Following the 2002 joint Oireachtas committee report on orthodontics, the Health Boards Executive adopted the report of the review group set up by the chief executive officers with the following terms of reference: to review and report on progress to date on the recommendations set out in the Moran report; to consider the recommendations in the February 2002 report of the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Health and Children; and to make revised recommendations and prepare and cost an action plan in the context of the approach set out in the national health strategy, Quality and Fairness &ndash; a Health System for You. Its report confirms that the shortage of trained orthodontists restricts the use of this index by health boards at present.</P>
      <P>I am pleased to advise the Deputy that I have taken a number of measures to improve orthodontic services on a national basis. The grade of specialist in orthodontics has been created in the health board orthodontic service. This year, my Department and the health boards are funding 13 dentists from various health boards for specialist in orthodontics qualifications at training programmes in Ireland and at three separate universities in the United Kingdom. These 13 trainees for the public orthodontic service are additional to the six dentists who commenced their training in 2001. There is, therefore, an aggregate of 19 dentists in specialist training for orthodontics. These measures will complement the other structural changes being introduced into the orthodontic service, including the creation of an auxiliary grade of orthodontic therapist to work in the orthodontic area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Furthermore, the commitment of the Department to training development is manifested in the funding provided to both the training of specialist clinical staff and the recruitment of a professor in orthodontics for the Cork dental school. This appointment at the school will facilitate the development of an approved training programme leading to specialist qualification in orthodontics. The chief executive officer of the Southern Health Board has reported that the professor will take up duty in December next. In recognition of the importance of this post at Cork dental school, my Department has given approval, in principle, to a proposal from the school to further substantially improve the training facilities there for orthodontics. This project should see the construction of a large orthodontic unit and support facilities. It will ultimately support an enhanced teaching and treatment service to the wider <Col N="831" /> region under the leadership of the professor of orthodontics.</P>
    <P>The chief executive officers of the health boards-authority have informed me that at the end of the September 2003 quarter, there were 20,784 children receiving treatment in the public orthodontic service. This means that there are over twice as many children getting orthodontic treatment as there are children waiting to be treated and almost 3,500 extra children are getting treatment from health boards since the end of 2001.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 462, 463, 468 and 469 together.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy is aware, I recently launched the report of the expert working group on the development of radiation oncology services in Ireland. The report provides a detailed plan for the further development of radiation oncology services in this country. The Government has accepted the recommendations of this report.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government agrees that a major programme is now required to rapidly develop clinical radiation oncology treatment services to modern standards. Furthermore, the Government has agreed that the first step of such a new programme should be the development of a clinical network of large centres in Dublin, Cork and Galway. These centres will collectively have the staff and treatment infrastructure to permit a rapid increase in patient access to appropriate radiation therapy and will form the backbone of <Col N="832" /> the future service expansion. This is the best model to provide a radiation oncology service to the highest standards. The development of radiation oncology services along the lines recommended in this report is the single most important priority of my Department in cancer services in the acute setting.</P>
    <P>In the short term, I have issued approval for the purchase of two additional linear accelerators for the Cork centre and the necessary capital investment amounting to &euro;4 million to commission this service as rapidly as possible. I have now approved the appointment of a project team to prepare a brief for the rapid expansion of current capacity from four to eight linear accelerators. I also intend to prioritise the necessary resources to ensure that the radiation oncology centre in Galway, which is currently being commissioned, is in a position to treat patients, commencing in spring 2005. I have further requested the Western Health Board to prepare a development control plan to facilitate the expansion from three to six linear accelerators in the medium term. I will also give early approval to the establishment of a project team to plan this expansion. These developments in Cork and Galway will provide an additional five linear accelerators. This is a significant increase that will ensure when fully developed that an additional 2,000 patients are treated per year. Five additional consultant radiation oncologists will be employed in the provision of these services.</P>
    <P>I will require radiation oncology centres to provide services on an equitable basis which will ensure that patients of equal need will have equal access. Geography will not be a barrier to equal access. I will also require radiation oncology centres to provide outreach services to hospitals in adjoining regions. This is currently the case and as more consultant radiation oncologists are appointed, it will be necessary to ensure that there is an equitable spread of outreach services. This will improve access for patients in the south-east, mid-west and north-west. In addition, the Government has also decided that in the future development of services, consideration should be given to developing satellite centres at Waterford, Limerick and the north-west. Such consideration will take into account the international evaluation of satellite centres, the efficacy of providing this model and the need to ensure quality standards of care.</P>
    <P>It is my intention to develop a national integrated network of radiation oncology. The twin objectives of equitable access regardless of location and an effective national quality assurance programme need to be supported by a co-ordinating mechanism, as recommended in the report. I have established a national radiation oncology co-ordinating group. The group will, <i>inter alia,</i> facilitate improved access to existing and planned services. It will comprise clinical, technical, managerial, academic and nursing expertise from different geographic regions.</P>

      <P>My Department has not received a freedom of information request on behalf of the person named by the Deputy. I understand that the <Col N="836" /> Deputy is referring to an application submitted to the South-Eastern Health Board. Where an applicant is dissatisfied with a decision made by a public body under the Freedom of Information Act, provision is made under the Act for the right of review of that decision to the public body concerned and, therefore, this is a matter for the board, in the first instance.</P>
      <P>A request for a review of a decision is carried out by someone senior to the person who made the original decision. The review may have the original decision affirmed, varied or annulled and, if appropriate, an alternative decision made. The Act also provides for a further review mechanism with the Information Commissioner. I have been advised that the applicant has submitted a request for an internal review of the health board's decision and that this is under consideration in the normal way, as provided for by the freedom of information legislation.</P>

      <P>The proper administration of the GMS scheme requires health boards to carry out periodic reviews of all medical card holders in order to satisfy themselves that the card holders continue to be eligible for services under the scheme. Such reviews are conducted in a manner that takes due account of the personal circumstances of the card holder. Decisions on the method and interval between such reviews are matters for the chief executive officer of the area health board to decide. I do not intend to change the existing protocol which I consider prudent in light of the necessity for accountability and appropriate use of public funds.</P>

      <P>The home birth pilot projects, to which the Deputy refers, have their origin in the report of <Col N="841" /> the maternity and infant care scheme review group which was published in 1994. Following the publication of this report, the chief executive officers of the health boards established an expert group to consider approaches to providing a home birth service as suggested by the review group.</P>
      <P>The expert group recommended the following three pilot projects which were subsequently established and funded by my Department: a community midwifery service, conducted in Cork by the Southern Health Board; a hospital outreach approach conducted by the Western Health Board and based at University College Hospital, Galway; a DOMINO-outreach project, domiciliary care in and out of hospital, based at the National Maternity Hospital, Holles Street.</P>
      <P>The information sought by the Deputy regarding the comparative costs of facilitating births under these schemes, in hospitals and at home is not readily available.

      <P>My Department is fully committed to implementing the terms of the national spatial strategy and will ensure that future plans for health services adhere to the policies of the strategy.</P>

    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand from the National Disease Surveillance Centre, NDSC, that MMR uptake is calculated on a quarterly basis among children of 24 months of age. The data are collected by health board region, rather than on specific areas. Therefore data specifically in relation to Tallaght are not readily available. However, the Eastern Regional Health Authority, ERHA, has indicated that the MMR uptake rate for community care area 4, which encompasses Tallaght, for quarter two of 2003 is in the region of 70% which <Col N="844" /> is a sizeable improvement on the same quarter in 2002 when it was approximately 55%, both percentages not verified by the NDSC. According to figures supplied by the NDSC, the MMR uptake rate for quarter one of 2003, which is the most recent period for which statistics are available from the NDSC, in the ERHA region was 71%. This is a marked improvement on quarter one of 2002 for which an uptake rate of 60% was recorded by the NDSC.</P>
      <P>The ERHA has conveyed that the following measures are being undertaken in order to improve uptake in their region: information sessions for professionals, for example, doctors and nurses in the area, information sessions for parents, distribution of information to the public, for example, leaflets on MMR available in public areas such as Tallaght Shopping Centre and Liffey Valley Shopping Centre, advertisements taken out in local newspapers for six months, January &ndash; June 2003, advertisements on local radio stations, advice regarding immunisation, including MMR, forms part of every public health nurse consultation with parents, information leaflets displayed prominently in all health centres, information given to schools regarding the booster MMR, follow up of parents by letter and telephone where children have not been vaccinated, follow-up with GPs and nurses regarding children in their area who have not been vaccinated and two information sessions were held in Tallaght for staff working in the voluntary sector and social inclusion managers.</P>
      <P>Uptake of MMR nationally falls short of the target of 95%. I am concerned about the unsatisfactory immunisation uptake rates in childhood immunisations because of the risk of unimmunised children contracting the potentially serious diseases concerned. The outbreak of measles in 2000, which resulted in three deaths and approximately 2,000 cases, is evidence of the consequences of insufficient immunisation uptake.</P>
      <P>Based on information available from the NDSC there has been a significant increase this year in the number of reported measles cases. Up to 31 October 2003, 568 cases were reported compared with 187 cases in the same period in 2002. This underlines the importance of raising the immunisation uptake level to the optimal level of 95% against measles and the other potentially serious infections. Earlier this year, chief executive officers in all health boards and the ERHA were asked to ensure that specific immunisation measures were prioritised in all regions in order to prevent a serious outbreak. However, I am encouraged by the most recent statistics from the NDSC which show that for the first quarter of 2003 there was an increase in the uptake level for most vaccines in the primary childhood immunisation programme, including that of MMR which rose by 2% in that period.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The health board chief executive officers established a national immunisation steering committee to address a wide range of issues relating to the childhood and other immunisation pro<Col N="845" /> grammes, including the identification of issues that are hampering the achievement of uptake targets. The steering committee was assisted by four working groups which examined the following areas in relation to immunisation: communication, material management, IT systems and planning and organisation. I launched the report of the steering committee in April 2002 and a national implementation group was subsequently established to draw up a phased national implementation plan based on the report's recommendations and to identify the costs involved.</P>
    <P>Following consideration of proposals submitted by HeBE on behalf of the health boards in relation to childhood immunisation, &euro;2.116 million was allocated by my Department to HeBE in 2003 in order to fund the following initiatives in relation to childhood immunisation: communications &ndash; that is, information and awareness initiatives, information systems and material management systems.</P>
    <P>There is concern among some parents in relation to the measles, mumps and rubella or MMR vaccine. Negative coverage on this issue has added to the confusion of parents in deciding whether to vaccinate their children. In April 2002, I launched the MMR Vaccine Discussion Pack &ndash; an information guide for health professionals and parents. The pack was produced by the NDSC and the department of public health, Southern Health Board, and was published by HeBE on behalf of the health boards. The pack sets out the facts in relation to the most common concerns about the MMR in a way that will help health professionals and parents to explore these concerns together, review the evidence in relation to MMR and provide the basis for making an informed decision. The information is presented in such a way as to allow full discussion between health professionals and parents on each issue. The pack also contains an information leaflet for parents. The layout of the pack is in Q and A format and addresses such issues as the alleged link between MMR and autism and Crohn's disease, the safety and side effects of the vaccine, the purpose of a second dose of vaccine, combined vaccine versus single doses and contraindications to the vaccine. The pack will be of great assistance to health professionals and will enable them to respond to the very real concerns of parents.</P>
    <P>In this regard, I am pleased to note the letter from Dr. Simon Murch of the Centre for Paediatric Gastroenterology, Royal Free and University College Medical School, London, who had originally questioned the safety of the MMR vaccine, in this month's edition of <i>The Lancet</i> which categorically supports use of the MMR vaccine. He says:</P>
    <P>. . . by any rational standards of risk/benefit calculation, it is an illogical and potentially dangerous mistake for parents to be prepared to take their children in a car on the motorway or in an aeroplane on holiday, but not to protect them with the MMR vaccine. An unprotected child is not only at personal danger, but <Col N="846" /> represents a potential hazard to others, including unborn children.</P>
    <P>I take this opportunity to again urge all parents to have their children immunised against the diseases covered by the childhood immunisation programme in order to ensure that both their children and the population generally have maximum protection against the diseases concerned. This is particularly important at present in the light of the increase in reported measles cases.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 500 and 501 together.</P>
      <P>The provision of health centres to meet the needs of local communities and the maintenance and upgrading of such centres within its functional area is a matter for the relevant health board or the Eastern Regional Health Authority, ERHA. In the case of Millbrook Lawns Health Centre, Tallaght, Dublin 24, this responsibility rests with the ERHA.</P>
      <P>I have been in contact with the ERHA which has informed me that Millbrook Lawns Health Centre currently provides a comprehensive range of services, including public health nursing, development clinics, dental, speech and language therapy, community welfare, home help, social work and addiction services. Pre-school services are also provided from this centre.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A number of improvements have been made to the health centre since 1999, including the internal and external painting of the premises. Additional offices have been provided for use by community welfare and Barnados. The fire alarm system has been upgraded and the ceiling has been substantially improved. The speech and language therapy service has been relocated to a different area within the centre. Essential health and safety improvements have been made in the last year. Improvements to the electrical system have also been carried out. A health and safety audit, conducted in November 2002, noted significant improvements since the previous inspection and further recommendations from this recent <Col N="847" /> audit are being actively addressed. It is planned to relocate the addiction services before the end of 2003. The authority has informed me that it will continue to ensure that the conditions in the existing heath centre are maintained to the highest standard possible for the effective delivery of services.</P>
    <P>Further redevelopment of the centre is a priority capital project for the ERHA. My Department fully appreciates the importance of progressing such developments and will continue to work closely with the authority in relation to prioritising its overall capital needs in line with the funding resources available to my Department.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>Following the launch of the policy document, Primary Care &ndash; A New Direction, I established a small multidisciplinary primary care task force. The task force is based in my Department, and is comprised of officials from my Department and representatives of the health boards.</P>
      <P>The task force has a remit to drive the implementation of the necessary changes and developments in primary care in accordance with the 20 point implementation plan contained in the strategy. This implementation plan sets out an incremental approach to implementation that recognises the breadth of the change that is required in order to support the roll out of the new model of primary care over the next decade.</P>
      <P>Since its establishment, the task force has taken a number of significant steps towards the implementation of the strategy.</P>
      <P>In October 2002 I gave approval to the establishment of ten primary care implementation projects &ndash; one in each health board area. These projects are building on the services and resources already in place in the locations involved so as to develop a primary care team in line with the multidisciplinary model described in the strategy. To date I have committed a total of &euro;8.4 million to these projects over 2002 and 2003.</P>
      <P>Projects are currently at different stages of development, with a number already providing new or enhanced primary care services to their target populations. Even at this early stage, some of the benefits which were anticipated for both service users and providers are, I understand, becoming evident in these cases.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In November 2002 I provided funding of &euro;360,000 for the Health Research Board for the establishment of three research fellowships in primary care. The fellowships, which will be available to the professions who will work in the new primary care teams, will enable the researchers to work on topics relevant to the implementation of the primary care strategy. In addition, my Department has also agreed to make funding of &euro;750,000 available over a three year period to the university departments of general practice to support specific activity in support of the implementation of the primary care strategy. Funding is also being provided to enable a research development officer to be appointed in the Irish College <Col N="849" /> of General Practitioners, ICGP, for a three year period.</P>
    <P>The primary care strategy also identified that a significant component of the development of primary care teams, in the short to medium term, would involve the reorientation of existing staff and resources. To this end, my Department has asked the health boards to examine how the existing primary-community care resources can best be reorganised, to develop practical ways of giving effect to the multidisciplinary teamworking concept, as described in the strategy, on a wider basis and to map out the geographical areas to be served by primary care teams in the future. Resources totalling &euro;1.7 million have been provided for these purposes in the current year.</P>
    <P>One of the principal objectives of the plans for the modernisation of our health service structures which I have recently announced is that the system should be structured to enable the health strategy, including the primary care strategy, to be delivered. As part of the reform plans, therefore, the system for the planning and delivery of primary care services, at national, regional and local level, will be reorganised in line with the vision contained in the primary care strategy. The primary care task force will contribute to the work of developing the new structures, in partnership with the wide range of stakeholders concerned with primary care services.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>Each health board is obliged to ensure that an equitable, accessible and comprehensive family planning service is provided in its area. The Department issued guidelines to the health boards in 1995 on the provision of family planning services for all persons in their area who need such services. These services are provided primarily through general practitioners, non-governmental organisations and, to some extent, maternity hospitals-units. Significant additional funding, &euro;5.73 million, was provided for the development of family planning and pregnancy counselling services between 1999 and 2002.</P>
      <P>I understand that in August 2000, the Northern Area Health Board, in partnership with the Irish Family Planning Association, initiated a family planning-women's health service at the Irish Family Planning Association's premises in Cathal Brugha Street. The services provided are complementary to those available to medical card holders through their own general practitioner and they are intended to provide an element of choice for medical card holders in the area of reproductive health.</P>
      <P>In 2003, a budget of &euro;140,000 was made available to the Irish Family Planning Association for the provision of services for medical card holders. This represented an increase of 10% on the previous years' allocation. The Irish Family Planning Association was asked to take appropriate steps to manage the delivery of services within its allocation but failed to do so, and has suspended services to medical card holders with effect from 13 October 2003.</P>
      <P>I am advised that officials from the Northern Area Health Board will shortly be meeting with the management of the IFPA to review the situation. Medical card holders in the area are still entitled to access reproductive health services through their general practitioners.</P>
      <P>Regarding the provision of funding for the IFPA from other sources, the Crisis Pregnancy Agency has allocated substantial amounts to the IFPA for crisis pregnancy counselling services and post-crisis pregnancy supports. In 2002, a total of &euro;94,356 was provided for crisis pregnancy counselling services in Sligo, Waterford, Donegal and Dundalk, post-abortion support groups in eight IFPA centres and the development of the association's web page. To the end of 2003, a sum of &euro;74,977, out of a total allocation of &euro;222,164, will be paid to the IFPA for similar crisis pregnancy counselling services and post-abortion supports. I understand that the Crisis Pregnancy Agency has made a commitment to provide continued funding for these services from 2004 onwards. The exact level of funding for these services is to be agreed with the IFPA before the end of 2003.</P>

      <P>As the Deputy will be aware, the provision of services at Mallow General Hospital is a matter for the Southern Health Board in the first instance. The board has submitted an application to my Department for the approval of a consultant geriatrician post at the hospital. The post, which will be subject to approval by Comhairle na nOspidéal, is being considered in the context of available resources available to my Department and the priority accorded to it by the board.</P>
      <P>The overall economic position in 2003 has had implications for all aspects of public investment, and this is reflected in the Estimates and budget adopted by the Government for 2003. Within this overall framework, however, some two thirds of all additional funding available for non-capital investment in services has been allocated to the health services. This funding is being applied largely to maintaining existing levels of service across all service programmes including services for older people.</P>

      <P>In autumn 2002 pre-registration nursing education was transferred from the health sector to the higher education sector and went from a three-year diploma to a four-year degree. The new undergraduate degree programme is provided in partnership between higher education institutes and health agencies. In the case of the Southern Health Board, the partnership is with University College Cork and the Institute of Technology Tralee. The pre-registration nursing degree requires clinical placements as an integral part of the programme. In the case of the Cork area, the clinical placement of the students is arranged by University College Cork in hospitals and other health care centres within the Southern Health Board, the voluntary hospitals and other services in the region. While it has never had a school of nursing, Mallow General Hospital is approved by An Bord Altranais as a placement site for nursing students. It has been providing such placements since 2000.</P>
      <P>To facilitate the placement and training of nursing students generally, my Department has put in place a range of supports including nurse practice development co-ordinators, clinical placement co-ordinators, allocations officers and project managers. These posts have been allocated to each of the health-higher education partnerships, and it is a matter for these agencies to determine the optimal deployment of such staff. In addition, a position of clinical development co-ordinator was approved specifically for Mallow General Hospital in 2000. Clinical development co-ordinators have lead responsibility for supporting the nursing students in the clinical areas as well as developing nursing practice in their respective hospitals.</P>
      <P>I am satisfied that the level of support provided to Mallow General Hospital to facilitate the placement of pre-registration nursing students in its clinical areas is satisfactory.</P>

Service plan progress reports are submitted to the Department by <Col N="853" /> the boards in advance of these review meetings. The health boards have all supplied service plan progress reports in the context of the most recent review meetings which were held on 21 and 22 October. These reports covered the major elements of each board's original service plan. Some of the more detailed elements of the service plans were not covered as they were not essential for the purpose of the review. The purpose of the progress reports are to provide the Department with the necessary level of detail required to monitor the overall delivery of the service plans by the boards and the reports submitted by the boards for the recent review meetings fulfilled that requirement.</P>

      <P>The format, dimensions and technical specifications of registration plates for display on motor vehicles are currently provided for in the Vehicle Registration and Taxation (Amendment) Regulations 1999, which were made by the Revenue Commissioners. The regulations provide, <i>inter alia,</i> that a registration plate shall exhibit the index mark &ndash; for example, G &ndash; and placename &ndash; for example, Gallimh &ndash; of the relevant licensing authority. The regulations specify the placename to be used for each of the 29 licensing authorities, which is the Irish version of the county concerned. The requirements in relation to the index marks and placenames are longstanding going back to the Road Vehicles (Registration and Licensing) (Amendment) Regulations 1990.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A check on the registration plate to establish whether it complies with statutory requirements has been part of the NCT since it was introduced <Col N="854" /> in 2000. Until 14 September 2003 registration plates were a &ldquo;fail advisory&rdquo; item and failure to comply with the requirements was not a reason for refusal of a test certificate. However, following the full implementation of the NCT with effect from 15 September 2003 failure on any test item, including the registration plate, has been a reason for refusal of a test certificate. No charge is made by the National Car Testing Service for a retest where a vehicle failed because of an inadequate registration plate. I have no plans to ask the Revenue Commissioners to change the Vehicle Registration and Taxation (Amendment) Regulations 1999.</P>

      <P>I understand that vehicles hired under a hire agreement are not generally insured for the purpose of undertaking a driving test.

This requirement was notified to the person concerned in the leaflet Final Checks for your Driving Test which issued with his appointment letter on 8 September 2003. Unfortunately, as he did not comply with the conditions required in order for a driving test to be conducted there is no case for allowing a free retest.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 518 to 520, inclusive, 530 and 531 together.</P>
      <P>The requirements in relation to the use of seatbelts on buses under EU law and national regulations apply to the driver and a passenger in a forward facing front seat of a bus up to 3,500 kg maximum weight where seatbelts are fitted. The requirements do not distinguish between school buses and any other buses. Buses and coaches are not at present required to be equipped with seatbelts either under EU or Irish law.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Directive 2003/20/EC provides, <i>inter alia,</i> for <Col N="856" /> the compulsory wearing of seatbelts by all occupants aged three years or over of buses, whether the bus is under or over 3,500kg maximum weight, where seat belts are provided. Member states are required to transpose the directive into their national law by 9 May 2006. It is my intention to make the necessary regulations to provide for the compulsory wearing of seatbelts where fitted in vehicles as soon as the necessary type approval standards for related safety systems, including standards related to the mandatory fitting of seatbelts, have been agreed at European level.</P>
    <P>In June 2003 the European Commission published proposals to amend a number of directives relating to the type approval requirements for safety belts and restraint systems, anchorages for safety belts, and seats, their anchorages and head restraints. These proposals provide, <i>inter alia,</i> for the mandatory fitting of seatbelts in all buses and coaches, other than those used on staged-stop urban services, at manufacturing stage for the purposes of obtaining motor vehicle type approval. Under the proposals it would be a requirement for the registration, sale or entry into service of buses and coaches, from 1 January 2006, that their safety belts and restraint systems, anchorages for safety belts and seats, their anchorages and head restraints would conform with the technical requirements specified in the proposed amending directives.</P>
    <P>The question of requiring the fitment of seatbelts in existing vehicles does not arise through the coming into force of Directive 2003/20/EC nor in the event of agreement on the proposals on amending the type approval standards for safety systems in motor vehicles. In relation to school bus safety a discussion paper on the matter was published by my Department last year. Following an extended consultation period a large number of responses were received. These are now being reviewed with a view to identifying a cost effective approach to enhancing road safety for school transport.</P>

      <P>In 2002, the PSO air service between Dublin and Carrickfinn County Donegal was operated by Aer Arann up to 21 July and by Euroceltic Airways from 22 <Col N="858" /> July to the end of the year. According to information supplied by Aer Arann, operational performance on the route from 1 January to 21 July 2002 was as follows: there were 198 flights from Carrickfinn to Dublin, of which 92% departed on time, or within 15 minutes of scheduled departure time. There were 199 flights from Dublin to Carrickfinn, of which 95% departed on time, or within 15 minutes of scheduled departure time.</P>
      <P>Regarding the period from 22 July 2002 to the end of 2002, Euroceltic Airways, now in liquidation, failed to submit reliable information relating to operational performance on the route during 2002. The Department subsequently terminated the PSO contract with Euroceltic in January 2003, following the suspension of the airline's air operators certificate by the UK Civil Aviation Authority.</P>

      <P>Approximately one third of requests for exemption are received from cargo carriers. The cargo contained on these flights includes items such as helicopter parts, rockets, grenades and cartridges. The items are described using their United Nations classification codes, UN identification numbers, and ICAO technical packing codes rather than by brand names or mark types.</P>
      <P>All applications for exemptions received, including details of the cargo, are submitted to the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform and the Department of Foreign Affairs for their observations, and to the Department of Defence for information. The application is also submitted to the Irish Aviation Authority for its observations, as the day-to-day oversight of aviation safety falls within its remit. Should any of these bodies express an objection to the operation of these flights, I would refuse to grant an exemption under the 1973 order.</P>

      <P>The taxi hardship scheme is open to taxi licence holders at 21 November 2000 who can demonstrate that they have suffered extreme personal financial hardship arising from loss of income following the liberalisation of the taxi licensing regime, and who fall into one of the categories for which payment was recommended in the report of the taxi hardship panel.</P>
      <P>All applicants must show evidence of a reduction in their income since 21 November 2000. In this regard, they are requested to submit either annual notices of assessment from the Revenue Commissioners or other verifiable documentary evidence of reduced income. Since reduced income is one of the key criteria for payment under the scheme some independent evidence to prove loss of income is necessary. The annual notices of assessment from the Revenue Commissioners are clearly one means of providing such evidence, but it is open to applicants to submit any other verifiable documentary evidence available to them.</P>

      <P>In March 2002, the Railway Procurement Agency was given statutory responsibility for the delivery of an integrated ticketing system which will enable a passenger to use a single ticket on one or more public transport services by road or rail, irrespective of the operators involved. This is pending the establishment of a public transport regulator. The RPA has set a target date of 2005 for completion of this project. It is, however, examining all options to expedite the delivery of integrated ticketing with a view to bringing forward the proposed launch date.</P>
      <P>The delivery costs of the full integrating ticketing project are currently estimated to amount to &euro;26.9 million for the total project, excluding a 10% contingency cost. This compares favourably with the &euro;45 million estimate for the capital costs from the integrated ticketing committee report of November 2000. As part of the current design work of the RPA, costs are being reviewed on an ongoing basis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The RPA is currently in discussions with Bus Atha Cliath, Bus Éireann and Iarnród Éireann, <Col N="862" /> Luas and private bus operators regarding the development of the system on all their services in the greater Dublin area. Public consultation will take place at a later stage. At present the agency is in the process of completing its design of the project and will shortly move to procure the system on an open and competitive tender basis.</P>
    <P>When the system is operational, it is envisaged that the RPA will have responsibility for managing the overall system but it has not yet decided the extent to which certain aspects will be outsourced. The contractual arrangements between the RPA and the various transport operators who will be involved in the system are currently being formulated by the RPA. Separately, the Department is currently designing a fares regime to apply. This study is being undertaken by Atkins consultants at an estimated cost of &euro;124,625, of which &euro;62,762.71 has been paid to date. The RPA has engaged consultants to assist with the project. The cost of contracts let by the RPA is &euro;2,459,742, of which &euro;450, 587 has been paid to date.</P>

Dublin City Council has now provided signs based on that direction for the purpose of designating two separate orbital routes around the city. The determination of the location and content of each of the signs provided, as part of that signage programme, is a matter for the determination of the city council.</P>

      <P>The use of bus lanes in this country is provided for in the Road Traffic (Traffic &amp; Parking) Regulations 1997, the primary purpose of which is to facilitate and promote bus based public transport. These regulations generally limit the use of bus lanes to buses and, in the case of with-flow bus lanes, to cyclists. Having regard to the role of taxis in providing on-street immediate hire services, an exemption to that limitation is allowed in respect of taxis when they are being used in the course of business.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>An overriding concern is the carrying capacity of bus lanes and the potential that their primary role to provide bus priority could be undermined if other vehicles are allowed access. While I have not received any correspondence from funeral director interests seeking that funeral cortèges be permitted to use bus lanes, representations seeking to extend access to bus lanes have been received in relation to a wide range of other road users, including hackney and limousine operators <Col N="864" /> and motorcyclists. I do not have any immediate proposals to review the question of extending access to bus lanes to other road users. However, as I have already indicated on a previous occasion in this House, I will review the question when the number of bus lanes has doubled.</P>

      <P>Matters concerning the terms and conditions of employment of workers in Aer Rianta, including pension arrangements, are a day-to-day matter for the company.</P>
      <P>I understand from the company that in the early 1980s a number of Aer Rianta staff at Dublin Airport transferred to a catering company at the airport in accordance with the terms of an agreement between the ICTU and Aer Rianta The company informs me that the agreement included provision for a new pension scheme to be established for transferring staff which would be at least equal with the scheme applying in Aer Rianta. Staff transferring to the new scheme were also given full credit for all their previous pensionable service in the Aer Rianta pension scheme.</P>
      <P>With regard to the Government's decision of July last to restructure Aer Rianta and establish the three State airports as fully independent and autonomous authorities under State ownership, I have already stated publicly on several occasions that there will not be any diminution in the terms and conditions of employment of Aer Rianta workers, including pension arrangements, arising from this decision.</P>

      <P>The national spatial strategy supports the development of a high quality network of roads and public transport services, to facilitate more balanced regional development. My Department has a special focus on the provision of support for the development of integrated land use and transport planning and related measures generally throughout the country and particularly now in the context of the roll-out of the national spatial strategy. <Col N="866" /> It is represented on an interdepartmental committee established to oversee the implementation of the NSS and has submitted an issues paper for the committee's consideration.</P>
      <P>It is also represented on the steering groups developing regional planning guidelines in each of the eight regional authorities. In addition, my Department has established an internal NSS cross-cutting team to progress the transport elements of the NSS. This team includes officials of the national spatial strategy unit of the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government.</P>
      <P>The next five-year railway safety investment programme to commence in 2004 is currently being finalised by the Railway Safety Task Force, taking due account of current Government policy, including the national spatial strategy. The main strategic road infrastructure upgrade proposals identified in the national spatial strategy, that is, upgrading of the main inter-urban links and upgrade works on the N2, N3, N4, N11, etc., are reflected in the NRA's current national roads development programme for the next four to five years.</P>
      <P>The national spatial strategy has a longer time perspective than the roads programme currently in construction and active planning. As the national roads programme is rolled forward and the major inter-urban links upgraded, provision will be made for additional strategic radial and linking corridors identified as priorities in the national spatial strategy such as linkages to Letterkenny-Derry, Castlebar-Ballina and enhanced routes between Cork, Galway, Limerick and Waterford and better North-South linkages through the midlands. Much of this work will extend beyond the current NDP. However, the national spatial strategy will be taken into account in the forward planning of the roads programme by the NRA.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. McDowell)</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy has noted, I focused in my answer to Question No. 192 of 9 October 2003 on the particular measures which I am already actively pursuing to bring about the application of more efficient staffing arrangements in the Prison Service, particularly those which involve eliminating overtime.</P>
      <P>The Irish Prison Service is committed to the cost efficient use of resources to achieve its strategic objectives. The service has adopted many cost saving initiatives to reduce its cost base, including the introduction of new technologies to reduce manning levels in newer prisons and the establishment of a central purchasing unit to ensure that the Prison Service maximises its purchasing potential through achieving economies of scale.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards rehabilitation and education, the service is committed to helping prisoners to develop their sense of responsibility and encouraging those attitudes and skills which will assist them to return to society with the best chance of leading law abiding and self-supporting lives after release. The service employs a number of means to encourage prisoners to bring about positive development within themselves, including: individual and group counselling on offending issues; programmes in the areas of education, vocational training and life-skills; drug treatment; specific programmes to address criminogenic factors &ndash; thinking skills, anger management and sex offenders treatment programmes; one-to-one counselling and support; and facilitating the <Col N="870" /> involvement of voluntary organisations in providing appropriate prisoner support services.</P>
    <P>As previously mentioned, the Prison Service has for some time been in negotiation with the Prison Officers Association on a new deal to enhance significantly the operational efficiency of our prisons and to reduce costs. Once resolution of these negotiations has been successfully achieved, the more stable financial baseline which will ensue as regards funding allocations to the various prison services, will enable the continuation and enhancement of education and rehabilitative programmes building on what has already been achieved. In the future development of these programmes, the Prison Service will continue to work in partnership with other relevant Departments and agencies as well as organisations in the community and voluntary sector with due regard to an effective financial management framework. The aim will be to maximise Prison Service efforts and investment in the educational and rehabilitative spheres within a sound financial structure where funding for these areas would not have to be curtailed or redirected to meet the payment of prison officers' overtime.</P>
    <P>The point is also worth making that the proposed changes are expected to have a positive impact on prisoner programmes particularly as regards the provision of time to enhance staff skills to make a greater contribution to prisoner programmes through multi-disciplinary involvement. At present, the opportunity to train staff in such areas is curtailed by the high overtime costs arising while staff being trained are replaced on an overtime basis. The proposed new system will not require such staff to be replaced on such a basis.</P>

      <P>The Deputy will appreciate that this matter is one for the courts which are, subject only to the Constitution and the law, independent in the exercise of their judicial functions. It is not open to me to comment on or intervene in any way with the conduct or decision of any individual court case which is a matter entirely for the presiding judge. This is a long-standing principle of our system of justice and it would not be appropriate for me to comment on the type of sanctions being imposed by the courts. While it is much less costly to apply a non-custodial sanction, involving supervision of the offender in a community setting, it has to be borne in mind that non-custodial sanctions are simply not a suitable or adequate way of dealing with many offenders who come before the courts.</P>
      <P>Supervision in the community is also used by me as Minister, albeit only in a small number of cases, to have persons released from prison in special circumstances supervised by the probation and welfare service rather than serve out the full term of their sentence. In these cases, the person's motivation to remain crime free and the level of risk he or she poses to the community can enable me to consider him or her suitable for integration into the community under the supervision of the probation and welfare service and strictly on condition that he or she will be returned to prison in the event of non-compliance with the terms of his or her release.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As Minister, within the resources available to me, I have strengthened the probation and welfare service, especially in the area of youth justice, in order to attempt to reduce the need to send young offenders into custodial settings. I would also like to advise the Deputy that the Children Act 2001 introduces a wide range of innovative measures that will provide a statutory framework for the future development of the juvenile justice system in accordance with modern <Col N="872" /> thinking and best international practice. It is the underlying concept of the Children Act to expand the options a court will have at its disposal when deciding on how to deal with a young offender. These options are an essential feature of the Act as they will allow effect to be given to the principle that detention for young offenders will be a last resort. Thus, the Act envisages committals to custody of young offenders being availed of only in situations when other alternative diversions and community based options have been resorted to and have failed. The Act is being implemented on a phased basis. It is expected that the first of the new community sanctions will come on stream in 2004, subject to the availability of resources.</P>

      <P>The position is that discussions took place earlier this year between the European Commission and the US Administration with a view to finding a solution to the problems arising for airlines operating flights to and from the US as a result of the passenger name record, PNR, requirements set out in the US Aviation and Transportation Security Act 2001. The main objective was to reconcile the US requirements with the requirements of EU data protection law.</P>
      <P>The outcome of these discussions was an interim arrangement which enabled US Customs to have access to passenger name record, PNR, data held by airlines in their computerised reservations systems for passengers travelling to, from or through the US with effect from 5 March 2003.</P>
      <P>Discussions are ongoing between the European Commission and the US Administration with a view to finding a longer-term solution. Concern has been expressed in the European Parliament about the lack of progress and a resolution adopted by the European Parliament on 9 October calls on the Commission to reach a solution within two months. The European Commission has consulted the member states and has received broad support for its negotiating position. Moreover, the member states are informed of developments on a regular basis.</P>

      <Quest>the average time it takes to process an application for compensation following injury to a member of the Garda Síochána in the course of his or her duties; the full procedures that must be followed in each application for compensation; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. McDowell Mr. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. McDowell)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Garda Síochána (Compensation) Acts 1941 and 1945 provide for a scheme of compensation for members of the Garda Síochána who are maliciously injured in the course of their duty or in relation to the performance of their duties as members of the Garda Síochána and for the dependants of members who have died from injuries maliciously inflicted on them.</P>
      <P>In accordance with the provisions of section 6 of the 1941 Act, a member of the Garda Síochána who has been maliciously injured may sue the State only by an authorisation issued by the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform. The processing of an entitlement to compensation under the Acts commences upon receipt of an application signed by the member. Under section 5(b) of the 1941 Act, the statutory time allowable for receipt of the application is three months.</P>
      <P>Upon receipt of a correctly completed application, correspondence issues immediately to the member or to the member's solicitor requesting that all medical reports relating to the injury are forwarded to the compensation section of Garda headquarters. At the same time, a written request is made to the Garda Commissioner for a report on the circumstances under which the injury suffered by the member was sustained and for a medical report from the Garda chief medical officer regarding his examination of the member.</P>
      <P>I have been informed by the Garda Commissioner that before the chief medical officer prepares his report, consideration is first given to all medical reports relating to the treatment received by the applicant member. Upon receipt of all medical reports, including a final prognosis in relation to the injury, an appointment is arranged for the applicant member to be medically examined by the chief medical officer in order that a comprehensive report can be formulated. Before deciding if an applicant should be authorised to apply to the High Court for compensation in respect of the injury, the practice has been for the Minister to consider all medical reports submitted by the applicant, together with a report on the incident by the Garda Commissioner and a report on the injury by the Garda chief medical officer.</P>
      <P>The whole process of progressing an application for compensation from the date of its receipt to the date it is authorised may take a considerable period of time. Information on an average time is not readily available, and indeed it would be difficult to calculate a meaningful average, given the variations in the processing of each case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I already mentioned in my answer to Parliamentary Question No. 63 on 15 October 2003, I am taking steps to establish a Garda Síochána compensation tribunal, along the lines recom<Col N="874" /> mended by the committee set up in 1997 to review and make recommendations on the efficiency and effectiveness of the Garda Síochána (Compensation) Acts 1941 and 1945. I am confident that the Garda staff associations will co-operate with this legislative change.</P>
    <P>The background to this initiative is that the committee set up in 1997 consisted of representatives from the Departments of Finance and Justice, the Chief State Solicitor's office, the Attorney General's office, Garda management and two Garda associations, the Association of Garda Sergeants and Inspectors and the Garda Representative Association. A medical practitioner who had experience of life assurance work was also on the committee which was chaired by an independent chairman. The committee presented its report to the then Minister on 28 August 1997.</P>
    <P>The committee made 14 recommendations which included the repeal of the existing Acts and the setting up of a new Garda Síochána compensation tribunal on a statutory basis. The tribunal would operate along the same lines as the Criminal Injuries Compensation Tribunal, the main difference being that gardaí would be compensated for pain and suffering. It is envisaged that trainee gardaí who suffer malicious injuries prior to attestation would be covered under the new scheme and that claims already refused under the existing Acts as being minor would be allowed go before the tribunal.</P>

      <P>I am informed by the Garda authorities that the competitive tendering process to award contracts for the supply, installation and commissioning of Garda Síochána CCTV systems, which are awarded through my Department, requires that a detailed technical specification be prepared. This specification sets out the technical specifications of the cameras to be used and also takes into account technological developments in this area. The specification then forms part of the request for tender document which is published by my Department once a decision has been taken to initiate a tendering process.</P>
      <P>The request for tender documents used in the tendering process for the provision of Garda CCTV systems in Bray, Dundalk, Dún Laoghaire, Finglas, Galway and Limerick contains the most recently published technical specifications for Garda CCTV systems. I have arranged for a copy to be forwarded to the Deputy under separate cover.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is understandably not possible for the Garda <Col N="875" /> Síochána to install CCTV systems in all areas that have sought them. Some applications for Garda CCTV systems relate to relatively small schemes which, while of importance to the local community, cannot be regarded as a national Garda priority.</P>
    <P>To this end, a grant-aid scheme was launched to facilitate community based groups who wish to press ahead with their own local CCTV system. Grant assistance of up to &euro;100,000, subject to the availability of funds, will be obtainable from my Department towards the cost of such systems.</P>
    <P>A prospectus has been prepared by my Department which provides information on how to apply for grant-aid funding, outlines the application process and identifies the main issues that applicants will need to consider. A code of practice, drawn up in co-operation with the Office of the Data Protection Commissioner, and detailed technical specifications, drawn up by the Garda Síochána, are almost complete. When both of these documents have been finalised, copies of same will issue to all communities and organisations who expressed an interest in the scheme. Any applications subsequently received will be evaluated and processed.</P>

Under section 8(5)(<i>b</i>) of the 1996 Act, where it appears to the health board concerned, on the basis of information available to it, that an application for a declaration should be made by or on behalf of the child concerned, the health board shall arrange for the appointment of one of its officers or such other person as it may determine to make an application on behalf of the child.</P>
      <P>The number of unaccompanied minors in respect of whom an asylum application was made was 600 in 2001, 288 in 2002 and 228 in 2003 &ndash; up to 30 September 2003. I am informed by the Garda authorities that a small number of cases have been reported to the Gardaí where concern arose on the part of the health board in relation to possible exploitation. A number of these cases are currently being investigated. Other cases have been dealt with by the relevant health boards under the provisions of the Child Care Act 1991. I am informed that many of the cases related to attempted family reunification wherein the minor, although claiming to be unaccompanied, had in fact relatives in this State. The general practice in such cases is to reunite the minor with his or her relatives.</P>
      <P>One of the core functions of gardaí employed on immigration duties is to take adequate measures aimed at preventing trafficking in general, and, in particular, the trafficking of minors. The gardaí have regular contacts with other statutory agencies concerned with the welfare of children and there is nothing to suggest any particular cause for concern at this time.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. McDowell Mr. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. McDowell)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 565, 618, 620 and 621 together.</P>
      <P>The position is that section 14 of the Intoxicating Liquor Act 2003 prohibits persons under the age of 18 years from the bar of licensed premises after 9 p.m. This restriction does not, however, apply on the occasion of a private function at which a substantial meal is served to persons attending the function. &ldquo;Bar&rdquo; in this context is defined as any open bar or any part of licensed premises exclusively or mainly used for the sale and consumption of intoxicating liquor and includes any counter or barrier across which drink is or can be served to the public. The restriction does not apply to other parts of the licensed premises.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Moreover, where a part of licensed premises contains a bar counter which is physically closed and is not used for the supply of intoxicating <Col N="880" /> liquor, such a part of the premises does not constitute a &ldquo;bar&rdquo; within the meaning of the 2003 Act. I would, however, recommend that any person organising an alcohol-free event in such premises for persons under the age of 18 should notify the superintendent of the Garda Síochána for the Garda district in which the premises is situated in advance of the proposed event.</P>
    <P>While the restrictions set out in the 2003 Act are in line with the recommendations of both the Commission on Liquor Licensing and the Strategic Task Force on Alcohol, I am willing to consider the possibility of alternative arrangements for functions where the bar remains open but the sale of intoxicating liquor to persons attending the function is not permitted on condition that such events are properly supervised and controlled. This is a matter which I will examine in the context of the forthcoming codification of the licensing laws. My intention is that an outline of the codification Bill will be available by mid-2004.</P>

      <askee>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform</askee>
      <Quest>if his attention has been drawn to the criticism of the Refugee Appeals Tribunal contained in the recent report of the Irish Refugee Council, Asylum in Ireland: the Appeal Stage; if he will implement the recommendations of the report; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>
      <QRef>[24867/03]</QRef>
    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. McDowell Mr. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. McDowell)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is referring to the report entitled Asylum in Ireland: The Appeal Stage &ndash; A Report on the Fairness and Sustainability of Refugee Determination at Appeal Stage commissioned by the Irish Refugee Council.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy is aware the Refugee Appeals Tribunal is an independent body established by the Refugee Act 1996 to determine an appeal from a recommendation of the Refugee Applications Commissioner in respect of an application for a declaration of refugee status. I have been assured by the chairperson of the tribunal that in so far as the recommendations of the report are the responsibility of the tribunal, these will be given detailed consideration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The tribunal was established in November 2000 and has made a significant contribution within its statutory framework to the Government's asylum processing strategy and to ensuring that the State meets its obligations under the 1951 Geneva Convention relating to the status of refugees. Significant additional resources have been allocated to the tribunal since its establishment both in terms of members and support staff. This has resulted in a significant increase in the number of appeals being completed with some 5,551 appeals completed in 2002 as compared to 3,428 in 2001. As at 30 September 2003, some 3,761 appeals have been dealt with so far this year. Of the total of 2,800 appeals case load on hand in the tribunal at <Col N="881" /> the present time, only some 857 appeals are over six months old and these are at an advanced stage of processing.</P>
    <P>All of this is a significant achievement and I wish to pay tribute to the chairperson of the tribunal, to its members and all its staff for the important work they are doing. Their task is especially difficult given the many challenges which our asylum process is facing at the present time due, in particular, to the high number of unfounded applications which are being made.</P>
    <P>While I can assure the Deputy that the recommendations in the report will be given consideration as part of the normal policy development process, I would point out that a number of the recommendations either do not correctly reflect the law as it stands at present or are already addressed in one way or another at the present time.</P>
    <P>The statutory independence of the tribunal is clearly enshrined in the Refugee Act 1996 and has been further enhanced by additional powers given to the chairperson to manage the business of the tribunal which were contained in the Immigration Act 2003. The Immigration Act 2003 has also amended the 1996 Act to: clarify the jurisdiction of the tribunal in relation to the publication of decisions and, in particular, provides that the chairperson may, at his or her discretion, decide not to publish a decision which in his or her opinion is not of legal importance; provide the chairperson with additional powers in relation to the management of the business of the tribunal and, in particular, specifies that he or she may from time to time issue guidelines or guidance notes generally on the practical application and operation of the provisions, or any particular provisions, of the 1996 Act and on developments in the law relating to refugees; and require the tribunal in assessing the credibility of an applicant for the purposes, <i>inter alia,</i> of the determination of an appeal, to have regard to a number of factors such as whether the applicant has provided a full and true explanation of how he or she travelled to and arrived in the State, whether an applicant has provided a reasonable explanation for the absence of identity documents or where an applicant has forged, destroyed or disposed of any identity or other documents relevant to his or her application and whether he or she has provided a reasonable explanation for so doing. It is only reasonable that both the Refugee Applications Commissioner and the Refugee Appeals Tribunal in assessing a persons credibility should have to have regard to factors such as this which could call into question the genuineness of an asylum seeker.</P>
    <P>All appeals have suspensive effect except, as a result of another amendment in the 2003 Act, those covered by section 22(1) of the Refugee Act 1996. These cover, <i>inter alia,</i> asylum applications covered by EU Regulation (EC) No 343/2003 of 18 February 2003 establishing the criteria and mechanisms for determining the member state responsible for examining an asylum <Col N="882" /> application lodged in one of the member states by a third country national and those from designated safe third countries.</P>
    <P>In relation to other recommendations in the report, I can tell the Deputy that comprehensive legal advice is already provided to asylum applicants at all stages in the asylum process including in preparing applicants for appeals hearings. In respect of those applicants who are clients of the Refugee Legal Service, the RLS also provides a legal presence &ndash; a barrister or a solicitor &ndash; at those hearings. The budget for the RLS has been increased from &euro;1.3 million in 1999 to some &euro;9 million in 2003. I have already addressed the resources issue in relation the tribunal itself with a major investment both in terms of additional members and staff having been made over the past three years in particular.</P>
    <P>The quality of interpretation services for asylum seekers is kept under constant review by my Department and the asylum agencies. There are over 100 nationalities in the asylum process and my Department has recently completed an EU wide tendering process which has resulted in new contracts being signed with service providers for the provision of more comprehensive interpretation and translation services for, <i>inter alia,</i> applicants and agencies in the asylum process.</P>
    <P>In relation to the recommendation in the report on sensitivity to gender, I am informed that tribunal members have attended UNHCR training courses which address this issue.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. McDowell Mr. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. McDowell)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy will be aware that there have been very significant developments in <Col N="883" /> relation to the provision of child care over the last number of years. Child care was identified as a priority area for investment in the National Development Plan 2000 to 2006 and the Equal Opportunities Childcare Programme 2000 &ndash; 2006, EOCP, was launched by my Department in April 2000. The EOCP is a seven-year programme with the principal aims of increasing the number of child care facilities and places, enhancing the quality of child care services and to introduce a co-ordinated approach to the delivery of child care services. The total funding allocated to my Department for these purposes during the seven year period of the programme is &euro;437 million.</P>
      <P>The EOCP is working to address the child care needs of parents who are working or who are engaged in training and education activities. The programme provides capital grant assistance to community not-for-profit organisations and to private child care providers to increase the supply of child care places or enhance the quality of existing places. The EOCP offers staffing grants to community-based not-for-profit organisations which have a focus on meeting the child care needs of disadvantaged families and it also offers supports to the national voluntary child-care organisations and to other groups working to improve the quality of child care in Ireland.</P>
      <P>It is estimated that the 1,802 grants to child care providers and community groups approved to date will create 25,660 new child care places and will also support over 25,033 existing places on completion of the projects. In addition, almost &euro;27 million has been allocated towards quality improvement measures which includes supports for the national voluntary child-care organisations and the city and county child care committees. City and county child care committees have been established in 33 city and county areas to develop and implement co-ordinated strategic plans for child care provision within their local area over the period 2000-2006.</P>
      <P>I am not considering any proposal to introduce legislation to require employers to provide on site child care facilities, nor has any such proposal been presented to me. The child care requirements of parents can vary significantly depending on their personal circumstances and work patterns and it is unlikely that work-based child care facilities alone would, in all cases, fully meet child care needs. The subject of child care for working parents is being considered by a partnership sub-committee which has been established under Sustaining Progress. Officials of my Department have already had meetings with IBEC and ICTU to consider issues relating to the availability of quality child care for working parents, with a particular emphasis on the feasibility of establishing workplace child care arrangements.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The programme for Government and the progress of my Department's equal opportunities child-care programme are confirmation of the Government's commitment to developing and <Col N="884" /> reviewing child care services and to keeping child care at the forefront of its social agenda.</P>

In September 2003, my Department received two visa applications relating to their two children who wished to join them in the State. One of the applications was refused because a copy of the child's birth certificate was not submitted.

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. McDowell)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 577 and 578 together.</P>
      <P>The Criminal Assets Bureau enforces the Proceeds of Crime Act 1996 which provides statutory procedures of restraint. The effect of restraint orders made by the High Court is to freeze property deemed to be the proceeds of crime for at least seven years. After that period, a disposal order may be sought from the court to vest the property in the Minister for Finance. It is only where the court directs that such property be transferred that funds accrue to the Exchequer. Having regard to the seven year safeguard period, the issue of such disposal orders has not arisen to date.</P>
      <P>The proposal that assets, which are determined by law to be the proceeds of crime, be committed directly towards anti-drugs and other related programmes would involve a significant departure from Government accounting principles which provide that it is a matter for the Government, with the approval of the Oireachtas, to determine the optimum allocation of Exchequer receipts in accordance with agreed priorities. Any departure from such principles could set a precedent which would be difficult to resist in those circumstances and which, no doubt, would reactivate long-standing demands for ring-fencing receipts in other sectoral areas. While the idea has been examined within my Department, I have no proposals at present to pursue the matter.</P>
      <P>I would add that the majority of assets frozen to date under the Act did not derive from the activities of drug dealers and there is no logical link between those assets and drug prevention and treatment programmes. To channel all of those funds to drug initiatives could deprive other areas such as hospitals and schools of resources.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy will be aware that local drugs task forces have been established by the Government in the areas most affected by the drugs problem <Col N="888" /> and an extension of this model is being delivered to other parts of the country through the establishment of regional drugs task forces. The Government continues to commit significant resources to these task forces to assist in developing a comprehensive and co-ordinated response to the drugs problem at a local level. Investment in this range of projects is many multiples of the amount for which the Criminal Assets Bureau has obtained interim and final restraint orders in relation to cases where the assets involved were linked to drug dealing.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 581 and 583 together.</P>
      <P>The missing persons helpline has been operating since October 2002. It is a dedicated helpline operated by Victim Support as a counselling and referral service and as a primary point of contact for the families of missing persons. The helpline provides advice and psychological support for families of missing persons as well as structured liaison with the Garda Síochána. A total of &euro;65,000 (including start-up costs) was made available for the helpline by my Department in 2002 and funding of a further &euro;45,000 has been provided in 2003. A condition of funding was that an independent evaluation would be carried out after the helpline had been in operation for one year. That evaluation is currently under way and will consider, <i>inter alia,</i> some of the issues raised in the question. When the report of the evaluation is available, my Department will be consulting with Victim Support and the Garda Síochána with a view to deciding how best to proceed.</P>
      <P>The equivalent helpline in the UK is the national missing persons helpline, which was established to advise and support missing people and their families and friends. I understand that it operates as a charity dependent on voluntary donations.</P>

      <P>The Deputy will be aware that over half of the board's staff are, of necessity, based in Dublin. This includes over 100 members of staff, including 19 solicitors, employed in the Refugee Legal Service and staff employed throughout the Dublin law centre network, of whom 26 are solicitors. I am sure the Deputy will appreciate that management staff located at the board's offices in Montague Street have a management function in relation to these staff, including some personnel, recruitment and IT functions as well as providing a co-ordination function with the staff unions and such bodies as the Bar Council and the Law Society, which are also Dublin based.

One member retired on 20/06/03 and has not been replaced to date. A suitable replacement has been identified and it is expected that the vacancy will be filled within the next few weeks. I have also been informed that there is one patrol car based at Robertstown Garda station and that Robertstown Garda station is open to the public from 10 a.m. to 12 p.m, and from 4 p.m. to 6 p.m. When the station is not manned the member on duty patrols the sub-district using the official vehicle allocated. This vehicle is also used by the member on duty at Carbury Garda station. These members assist each other and both sub-districts are patrolled with the patrol car. As a result the Robertstown sub-district is patrolled daily and on a regular basis. In addition to the patrolling carried out by the Robertstown patrol car, the detective branch cars attached to Kildare and Newbridge also regularly patrol the Robertstown sub-district. The traffic unit at Naas also patrol the sub-district regularly and the members attached to same perform speed checks and high visibility checks in the Robertstown sub-district on a regular basis.</P>

      <P>I have been informed by the Garda authorities that in the event of a Garda vehicle being involved in an accident, the Garda driver forwards a completed MT15 form to fleet management section immediately. The MT15 is a preliminary report of the accident, which notifies fleet management section of the occurrence of the accident and the circumstances surrounding that accident. The public service vehicle inspector will then assess the damage to determine the viability of repairing or replacing the vehicle. Should the vehicle be deemed repairable, three competitive tenders must be obtained before final approval for the repair to be carried out will be given. The decision on sanction for &ldquo;repair or replace&rdquo; will normally rest with the technical inspector. If the damage is relatively minor, and the vehicle repair can be completed in a short space of time, then local management may be able to cope from within their existing resources. Where this is not possible, every effort is then made to provide a temporary replacement from feet management section whilst the repair is being carried out. The timeframe for having the car returned to service after minor repairs is normally no longer than two to three weeks. In most instances, for minor accidents, this time is considerably less.</P>
      <P>For major repairs and where it is not possible for local management to manage from within existing resources, a replacement car will be provided, depending on availability, as soon as possible. Should the vehicle be deemed a write off, then a new vehicle will be issued as soon as possible, again subject to availability. If a new vehicle is not available immediately, a temporary replacement may be issued, pending the availability of new vehicles. This process should normally take no longer than two to three weeks, and in most instances will be less. In dealing with the replacement of vehicles each case is dealt with on its merits and the urgency of the situation.</P>

I am further informed that one of the vehicles attached to the Waterford drug unit was returned to the transport section, Garda headquarters on 30 September 2003 for repairs. In the intervening period, the Waterford drug unit had access to a second vehicle permanently assigned to the unit as well as access to four other unmarked vehicles attached to Waterford Garda station. I am also informed that a multiagency committee has been established under the auspices of the national drug strategy in the south-eastern region. I am advised that a number of gardaí are actively involved with this committee.</P>

      <P>I am satisfied that mandatory drug testing can play an important role in the overall strategy for tackling the scourge of heroin use among prisoners. Mandatory drug testing provides information on trends in drug misuse, enables the identification and referral of drug abusers to treatment programmes, and acts as a deterrent to drug misuse.</P>

      <P>Since the construction of Wheatfield Prison in the late 1980s, the Irish Prison Service has successfully undertaken several major prison developments. The most recent of these is the new Midlands Prison which opened in November 2000, and which is generally recognised as an excellent development in line with the best international standards. The contract to build this prison was awarded on a part design, build and finance basis, in which the contractor undertook to develop the design and deliver the buildings in accordance with a brief furnished by the Office of Public Works. Other major projects completed since the construction of Wheatfield Prison include Cloverhill and Castlerea prisons and the Dochas centre.</P>

      <P>The Deputy will appreciate that under section 5 of the Civil Legal Aid Act 1995, it is a matter for the Legal Aid Board to provide, within it's resources and subject to the other provisions of the Act, legal aid and advice to persons who satisfy the requirements of the Act. The Deputy will therefore appreciate that, in certain circumstances, section 5 of the Civil Legal Aid Act 1995 imposes an obligation on the board to prioritise certain categories of cases in order to provide legal services from within its resources. The Deputy will be aware that the grant-in-aid to the Legal Aid Board for this year is &euro;17.539 million. While this figure represents a slight decrease from the grant-in-aid for last year &ndash;&euro;17.636 million &ndash; it still represents a significant increase in funding for the board in recent years, up from &euro;10.656 million in 1997 to &euro;17.539 million in 2003, an increase of almost 65%. During this period also, sanction to employ additional staff was conveyed to the board. Since 1997 sanctioned posts in the board's law centre network increased from 191 to 215, of which 89 are solicitor posts, an increase of eight solicitor posts. These combined additional resources have contributed to a significant improvement in waiting times throughout the board's law centre network during this period. I can inform the Deputy that the board operates a procedure whereby priority is accorded for certain categories of cases, for example, domestic violence, child care, child abduction and other cases where there are time limits. These cases are dealt with immediately and such applicants are not placed on a waiting list. Such a system for priorities is necessary to ensure that, for example, persons who are subjected to domestic violence and cases involving the care of children are provided with speedy service. It is important to note that in 2001, priority appointments offered by law centres were approximately 22% of the total number of appointments offered to new clients during the year. In addition, managing solicitors at law centres have authority to give priority to any case on the waiting list at their centre. For example, if an applicant is gravely ill or in cases where an applicant is in danger of losing assets or <Col N="899" /> of losing title to a legal remedy if legal services are delayed, the managing solicitor can accord such cases priority status. In addition, I can assure the Deputy that in order to maximise the use of its resources and to provide legal services to the greatest number of people possible, the board continuously monitors the operation of its law centre network, particularly the throughput of cases at each centre. Where waiting times, for whatever reason, become excessive the position is examined by the board with a view to taking remedial action. In this regard, the additional management posts which were made available in recent years are enabling the board to develop a more structured change-management approach to the provision of civil legal aid throughout the State.</P>

      <P>A grant application for capital grant assistance from the 2000-2006 equal opportunities childcare programme was received from this community-based group in March 2002.</P>
      <P>All applications for grant assistance undergo a thorough assessment and appraisal process against the programme criteria by Area Development Management Limited. Large scale projects, such as this capital development, undergo an intensive appraisal by an external building consultant. As in this case, the external appraisal can lead to recommendations to restructure proposed developments and this leads to dialogue with the group.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On completion of the assessment process, applications are considered by the programme appraisal committee, chaired by my Department, for a recommendation before I make a final decision. There has been considerable demand from community-based groups for capital grant assistance under the programme and every county has benefited from significant grant commitments to provide new and enhanced community-based childcare facilities. The equal opportunities childcare programme 2000-2006 is currently undergoing an independent mid-term review as part of the review of the National Development Plan 2000-2006. My Department is also currently carrying out an extensive review of the programme's capital commitments to date to ensure that those grant commitments previously entered into will in fact be realised by groups on the ground. At the same time, it is also reviewing the different budget lines under the capital programme to ensure that the most effective use is <Col N="900" /> made of all remaining capital funding in accordance with the objectives of the programme. All applications for capital grant assistance are appraised in accordance with the programme criteria in order to ensure that those projects which best meet the aims and objectives of the programme receive capital grant assistance which will enable them to provide quality childcare in areas where there are service deficits. It would be premature of me to comment further on specific applications for capital grant assistance until these review processes have been completed.</P>

      <P>Work on the preparation of the disability Bill is on-going in my Department, following completion of the formal consultation process on future proposals for disability legislation in February 2003. The disability legislation consultation group, DLCG, is a group representative of people with disabilities, their families, carers and service providers, which was brought together by the National Disability Authority to contribute to the consultation process initiated by Government in April 2002 in respect of the disability Bill. The DLCG presented the document, <i>Equal Citizens &ndash; Proposals for Core Elements of Disability Legislation</i> to the expert consultation team in early February 2003. The document includes recommendations for an independent complaints system for people with disabilities under the Office of the Ombudsman. Given the complex and cross-cutting issues involved, the process of overseeing the preparation of the disability Bill has been referred to a Cabinet sub-committee. The Cabinet sub-committee is taking a key role in facilitating cross-departmental co-operation in the development of both the legislative proposals and service planning. I can confirm that present thinking as to the content of the Bill includes provisions for complaints and appeals mechanisms. Pending the completion of the work of the sub-committee and Government deliberations it would be inappropriate to comment in detail on the likely content of the Bill.</P>

      <P>Following a survey of prisons in 2001 by specialist engineers, a number of areas requiring removal of asbestos were identified. In February and March 2002, asbestos material was removed by professional contractors, advised by specialist engineers, from the areas identified in Portlaoise Prison. The removal was carried out in accordance with the health and safety regulations, Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government regulations and approved codes of practice for the removal of asbestos.</P>
      <P>The areas identified in Portlaoise Prison neither housed prisoners nor were accessible by them or their visitors. It should also be noted that the contractors employed for the removal of the material did not come into contact with prisoners. The specialists have previously confirmed that there was no danger to prison staff, prisoners, or visitors during the removal of the material. The areas from which the asbestos was removed were monitored and tested and all test results showed that the areas are now free of asbestos.</P>

      <P>The persons concerned applied for asylum in the State on 2 August 2001. They withdrew their asylum applications on 13 May 2002 and made an application for leave to remain in the State based on parentage of a child born in Ireland on 7 March 2002. No application for naturalisation has been received from the persons in question. Following the decision of the Supreme Court in the cases of L &amp; O, the separate procedure which then existed to enable persons to apply to reside in the State on the sole basis of parentage of an Irish born child ended on 19 February 2003.</P>
      <P>The Government decided that the separate procedure would not apply to cases which were outstanding on that date, of which there are a large number, including the case of the persons concerned. They will not be receiving a letter granting permission to remain solely on the basis of parentage of an Irish born child. Since the persons in question do not have an alternative legal basis for remaining in this jurisdiction, the issue of their application for permission to remain on the basis of the Irish born child will be considered in the context of the proposal to deport them. If, in the light of their representations and the range of factors set out in section 3(6) of the Immigration Act 1999, it is decided not to make a deportation order they will be given leave to remain on a humanitarian basis. Because of the large number of such cases in hand I am unable to say at this stage when the file will be examined.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government (Mr. N. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 628 and 641 together.</P>
      <P>Two tax incentive based schemes currently operate to support development in the five cities. An urban renewal scheme commenced in March 1999 and operates in the cities and 38 large towns. Significant progress has been made under this scheme. Relevant data submitted to my Department indicates that investment in completed projects amounts to some &euro;400 million, while projects under way are valued at about &euro;1 billion. Taking account of projects in planning, total investment over the life of the schemes is projected to be in excess of &euro;3.5 billion. The positive impact of this scheme can readily be seen in our cities and towns. However, a detailed assessment of the schemes' contribution to urban regeneration in the five cities may more appropriately be sought from the local authorities concerned, which have statutory responsibility for monitoring its implementation.</P>
      <P>The living-over-the-shop, LOTS, scheme, which commenced in April 2001, aims primarily to promote the conversion of vacant space over commercial premises in designated city streets into residential accommodation. While the LOTS scheme was extensively marketed by the city councils, the uptake by property holders is slower than anticipated. Statistical returns submitted to my Department for the period ending 30 June 2003 indicate that there are 64 LOTS scheme projects, either completed, in progress or being planned. Almost 100 residential units have been completed or are nearing completion, while projects in planning would be expected to deliver a further 200 units.</P>
      <P>My Department has agreed to provide &euro;100,000 to Dublin City Council to fund a new initiative in relation to the LOTS scheme. This involves the establishment of multidisciplinary property advisory teams, to advise and support property owners who potentially could avail of this scheme. If successful, this initiative could also be applied in the other cities. Overall, I am confident that a focused and proactive approach by local authorities will ensure a more significant uptake of the LOTS scheme. I intend that my Department will shortly initiate an overall review of the impact and effectiveness of the urban and town renewal and LOTS schemes, and that the outcome of this review will be published.</P>

    <P>The provision of accommodation for homeless persons is the responsibility of local housing authorities and one in which my Department has no direct function. It is, therefore, a matter for individual authorities to determine the level of bed and breakfast accommodation to be provided, having regard to the need for such accommodation within their areas. As the nature of the use of this type of accommodation is demand led and can vary from day to day, information on the <Col N="909" /> number of persons so housed nationwide at any point in time is not readily available in my Department.</P>
    <P>The monitoring of the standard of bed and breakfast accommodation is also a matter for the local authorities and it is their responsibility to ensure that premises are inspected regularly to ensure, <i>inter alia,</i> that they comply with the relevant health and safety and environmental standards. I understand that the standards of such accommodation have improved significantly in recent years, particularly in the larger urban areas with most now involving unrestricted access to residents, 24 hour security and a limit on the number of bed spaces. I am not aware of complaints in connection with the conduct of those charged with the management and organisation or the owners of these units of accommodation. It is a matter for individual housing authorities to ensure that there are appropriate and adequate procedures in place in order that both resident and owner are aware of their respective rights and duties in this regard.</P>
    <P>While the use of bed and breakfast accommodation is seen, at present, as essential for the provision of emergency accommodation, it is recognised that it is not suitable as a long-term solution to homeless accommodation and that its use should be phased out, particularly for families. I am concerned to ensure that high standards prevail in the operation of the sector and that it is used only as a short &ndash; term response to homelessness. At the request of my Department, Dublin City Council, which is a major user of bed and breakfast accommodation, and the Homeless Agency are conducting an ongoing review of this type of accommodation. This has led to increased monitoring, improved co-ordination and better management practice within the Dublin area. Further rationalisation is needed and the council is continuing to address the issue in order that continuous improvement of services will be offered to those whose needs dictate that it is the most suitable type of accommodation for them at a particular point in time.</P>
    <P>Under section 10 of the Housing Act 1988 my Department recoups to local authorities 90% of their expenditure on the provision of accommodation and related services for homeless persons. The breakdown of expenditure sought is not readily available except in the case of Dublin City Council, which normally contracts with a number of landlords for the supply of bed and breakfast information. The information available from 2001 onwards shows that recoupment in this area to the city council was &euro;13.4 million in 2001, &euro;15.1 million in 2002 and, to date in 2003, &euro;11.6 million. Systems are, however, being put in place to ensure, with effect from the beginning of 2004, a more comprehensive breakdown of recoupment related information for the country as a whole.</P>

      <P>Local authorities provide accommodation for homeless persons as part of their social housing programmes, which are funded from their annual capital allocations from my Department. In addition, the voluntary housing sector also provides accommodation specifically for homeless persons. In this context available and suitable units of accommodation are provided for persons who have been assessed as homeless. Separate figures are not yet available to my Department on capital expenditure in providing dwellings for the homeless. However, I anticipate that my Department will be able to meet all capital funding requirements for local authority homeless projects in 2003.</P>
      <P>Current funding to assist towards the provision of accommodation for homeless persons, generally by voluntary housing bodies, was increased from &euro;4.4 million in 1997 to &euro;43 million in 2002. Hostel and other accommodation is also provided by voluntary bodies with capital funding provided under the capital assistance and loan subsidy schemes operated by my Department. In the period 1997 to date, some 1,340 units of accommodation for homeless persons have been approved under the capital assistance scheme. Additional funding is also being made available by the Department of Health and Children to fund the provision of in-house care in hostels providing accommodation for homeless persons.</P>

The amount spent by the Government and local authorities on the main local authority housing construction programme in each of the past six years is set out in the table below. In addition, funding has been provided on other aspects of housing, including regeneration schemes, voluntary housing programmes, affordable housing and shared ownership schemes. The total capital funding for housing in the period since 1998 has increased from &euro;484 million to &euro;1.7 billion in 2003. It is anticipated that the range of social and affordable housing measures will deliver accommodation for about 13,000 households in 2003.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 636 and 677 together.</P>
      <P>The Government is committed to addressing the issue of homelessness on a sustained basis, with the aim of eliminating the need for rough sleeping by the end of 2004 and providing adequate emergency and move-on accommodation and support services to enable homeless persons to achieve independent living as soon as possible within the resources available for the purpose. There has been substantial progress in achieving this aim since the publication of the Government's integrated and preventative strategies on homelessness. As part of the integrated strategy, local authorities, together with health boards and other statutory and voluntary bodies, are required to draw up local action plans to tackle homelessness. Virtually all of these plans have now been adopted by local authorities and health boards and work is well under way on implementing the measures contained in them.</P>
      <P>A wide range of additional accommodation, ranging from emergency accommodation to long-term sheltered accommodation, has been provided to enable homeless persons to move out of emergency accommodation and into accommodation more suitable to their needs. Increased levels of day care facilities as well as specific provisions to meet the needs of people with addiction problems or who are sleeping rough, as well as homeless offenders, have been put in place. Further facilities will be provided as part of the full implementation of the homeless action plans with particular emphasis on the provision of move on accommodation to minimise the long-term use of both emergency and bed and breakfast accommodation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Substantial additional funding has been made <Col N="912" /> available to support the implementation of the homeless strategies. Capital funding for the direct provision by local authorities of accommodation for homeless persons is being doubled from &euro;25.4 million to &euro;50.8 million over the period 2001-05. Current funding for accommodation-related homeless services by local authorities has increased substantially from &euro;12.6 million in 2000 to &euro;50 million this year. Funding continues to be made available to the voluntary sector for the provision of accommodation for homeless persons under the Department's capital assistance scheme. With a view to ensuring that progress is made, the cross-Department team on homelessness continues to monitor the implementation of the homeless strategies and a review of the strategies will be initiated by the end of 2003.</P>

      <P>The Government has been conscious of the increased level of social housing need and has been responding actively to this situation by expanding on our social and affordable housing output. For example, the total capital funding for housing this year, at &euro;1.7 billion, is up 7% on the amount provided in 2002. The substantial increases in the level of funding for social and affordable housing is reflected in the total Exchequer capital provision for this sector in 2003 of &euro;932 million which is more than double the amount spent in 2000 of &euro;452 million.</P>
      <P>The assessments of need undertaken by local authorities reflect changing needs in society and increasing demands for social housing. Within the overall envelope of resources available, the Government will maintain a strong social housing programme. It is anticipated that the total social and affordable housing output under the local authority housing programme taken with housing outputs from the voluntary housing sector and other social housing measures, as well as vacancies arising during the course of the year, will impact positively on waiting lists and meet the needs of some 13,000 households this year.</P>

      <P>Single people who are unable to provide housing for themselves from their own resources are entitled to apply for social housing which is provided by either a local authority or a voluntary housing body. While it is a matter for individual local authorities to decide on the allocation of houses to single persons and other categories on their waiting lists in accordance with their schemes of letting priorities, my Department advised local authorities in the social housing design guidelines of the need to provide a reasonable mix of dwellings suited to the different kinds of households already on waiting lists and to plan their future programmes taking account of the estimated size and type of households likely to be seeking housing in the future.</P>
      <P>Local authorities have been reminded by my Department of the need to ensure that the profile of house types in proposed new housing schemes should take greater account of the actual housing needs position of households on waiting lists having regard to the dwelling mix in the existing local authority rented housing sector. My Department continues to monitor the matching of local authority housing building programmes to the range of household needs on waiting lists. In recent years local authorities have provided a wider range of house types, including an increasing number of one and two bedroom dwellings which are more suitable to single people.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government (Mr. N. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government's view is that it would be inappropriate to include a legal right to housing in the Constitution, on the basis that the funding commitment to the various housing programmes is leading to increased outputs and that decisions in relation to the allocation of financial resources is a matter for the democratically accountable Government, not the courts. This is in line with the 1996 report of the constitutional review group which concluded that the Constitution should not confer personal rights to freedom from poverty or to other economic or social entitlements. The group regarded these as being essentially political matters which should be the responsibility of the elected members to address and determine in a democracy.</P>
      <P>The body of legislation governing social housing in Ireland is the Housing Acts 1966 to 2002. While the legislation does not confer any statutory right to housing, the range and extent of measures implemented under the Housing Acts demonstrate the State's long-standing commitment to ensuring that housing needs, especially social housing needs, are adequately addressed.</P>
      <P>The National Economic and Social Council examined the broad issue of social and economic rights in its November 2002 report, An Investment in Quality: Services, Inclusion and Enterprise. It emphasised the complex philosophical, political, legal and practical issues involved in the identification, creation, legislation and vindication of rights, especially social and economic rights. Accordingly, in the new national agreement, Sustaining Progress, particular emphasis is placed on ensuring that standards of public services are identified, monitored and achieved. This requires further substantive improvements in the delivery of quality public services, including housing, and also requires a renewed focus on setting and achieving standards for the delivery of such services and monitoring progress.</P>
      <P>The Government considers that the most appropriate way of addressing needs in relation to housing is to continue the various programmes and fiscal incentives currently in place, to secure the necessary level of funding to support them, to review their operation on an ongoing basis to ensure that they are meeting their objectives and to put in place new programmes or measures as required.</P>

      <P>The provision of green space, public parks and playgrounds within the urban environments in its functional area is a matter for each planning authority to progress in accordance with its development plan, which must include objectives for the preservation, improvement and extension of amenities and recreational amenities. When deciding on planning applications, a planning authority must have regard to the policies set out in the plan and may attach conditions to permissions requiring the provision of appropriate facilities.</P>
      <P>The planning guidelines on residential density published by my Department in September 1999 indicate that public open space is one of the key elements in defining the quality of the urban environment. The guidelines recommend that the achievement of higher densities must be coupled with a higher standard of residential environment. The provision of higher quality communal and public open spaces is therefore highly important. The guidelines recommend that any acceptance of lower quantitative standards of open space must be accompanied by a parallel increase in qualitative standards of open space. The guidelines recommend, in respect of higher density developments, that in greenfield sites public open space should be a minimum of 15% of the total site area and, in all other cases, it should be a minimum of 10%.</P>
      <P>With regard to social housing provision local authorities have been advised in the social housing design guidelines issued by the Department in September 1999 that they should consider ways to facilitate and encourage the provision of services and amenities, including parks, playing fields and recreational and leisure facilities. Appropriate facilities of this kind are, on an agreed basis, funded as part of the cost of a new housing scheme from the Department's capital allocations.</P>
      <P>Funding is also available under the Department's remedial works scheme to assist housing authorities to carry out major essential works of a structural nature to dwellings in designated rundown housing estates. The objective is not only to upgrade the fabric of the dwellings but to improve the living conditions of the tenants. For this reason, works of an environmental nature, including certain amenity and recreational facilities, may be included as part of a project where they are considered necessary to support the work undertaken to the dwellings.</P>

      <Quest>the measures he intends to take to reduce the amount of packaging on products which are sold here; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government (Mr. Cullen)</NameTxt>
      <P>Article 18 of European Parliament and Council Directive 1994/62/EC on packaging and packaging waste prohibits member states from impeding the placing on the market of packaging which satisfies the provisions of the directive &ndash; that is, which is in accordance with the essential requirements specified in annex II of the directive as to the composition and the reusable and recoverable nature of packaging. Notwithstanding this, I share the Deputy's concerns with regard to the over-packaging of certain goods. Excessive packaging is generated through a combination of poor packaging design, inefficient production or manufacturing processes, and unsustainable consumption patterns &ndash; for example, by purchasing excessively packaged products. Taking action to prevent waste being generated in the first place is fundamental to the overriding objective of decoupling economic growth from growth in waste arisings.</P>
      <P>The principle of producer responsibility requires waste producers to contribute to the waste management costs of products which they have placed on the market at end-of-life. In support of this approach, a producer responsibility initiative already operates in Ireland in relation to packaging waste, underpinned by the Waste Management (Packaging) Regulations 2003, which replaced earlier regulations introduced in 1997. Under the regulations, producers are required to take steps to recover packaging waste or alternatively to contribute to, and participate in, compliance schemes set up to recover packaging waste.</P>
      <P>Repak Limited &ndash; established by Irish industry in 1997 to promote, co-ordinate and finance the collection and recovery of packaging waste with a view to achieving Ireland's packaging waste recovery and recycling targets under European Parliament and Council Directive 1994/62/EC on packaging and packaging waste &ndash; is the only such approved compliance scheme. While Repak's primary role is to support the recycling of packaging waste rather than packaging minimisation, the fees structure applicable to its members, which is related to the type and amount of packaging placed on the market, reflects the polluter pays principle and directly incentivises the minimisation and reuse of packaging by producers.</P>
      <P>As undertaken in An Agreed Programme for Government and in my Department's policy document, Delivering Change, an ambitious national waste prevention programme is being developed. This programme aims to deliver significant improvements in waste prevention and minimisation across all waste streams, including packaging. Work is now at an advanced stage in establishing a core prevention team in the Environmental Protection Agency, which will have the task of developing the programme in consultation with other stakeholders. It is intended to complete the establishment of the team later this year. Funding of &euro;2 million from the environment fund has been provided for the national waste prevention programme in 2003.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 645 and 646 together.</P>
      <P>Since November 2002, I have allocated over &euro;22 million towards 71 local authority recycling projects, details of which are set out in the table which follows. To date, local authorities have drawn down approximately &euro;4.896 million. I intend to announce further capital allocations as projects are developed. Taking account of the substantial operating costs incurred by local authorities in operating such facilities, I have announced that, for the first time, &euro;5 million is being provided from the environment fund to assist local authorities in meeting such costs. Some &euro;2.5 million of this has already been allocated and a second tranche of allocations, which will take into account more recent data on additional recycling facilities provided by the local authorities, will be made shortly.</P>

      <P>Local authorities fund their expenditure, including expenditure on pay, from a variety of sources, including specific State grants, commercial rates, rents, fees and charges for services and general-purpose grants from the Local Government Fund. The issue of benchmarking costs, as with all other current expenditure demands, will fall to be dealt with by local authorities in the context of their annual budgetary process. The amount available from the Local Government Fund will be settled in the context of my Department's Estimates of expenditure for 2004, and I will advise local authorities of their general-purpose allocations for 2004 as soon as possible.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government (Mr. Cullen)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 649, 651 and 652 together.</P>
      <P>Overall Government policy on rural housing is set out in the national spatial strategy, NSS, which was published in November 2002. The rural settlement policy framework contained in the NSS aims to sustain and renew established rural communities, while strengthening the structure of villages and smaller settlements to support local economies, ensuring that key assets in rural areas are protected to support quality of life and ensuring also that rural settlement policies are responsive to the differing local circumstances in different areas.</P>
      <P>It is vitally important that there is certainty and consistency in the implementation by planning authorities of Government policy in this matter through their own development plans and in the operation of the development control system under planning legislation. This is the purpose of the guidelines under the Planning and Development Act, which I intend to bring forward to deal with this issue. These are at an advanced stage of preparation and I hope to issue them to planning authorities before the end of the year.</P>
      <P>With regard to the question of alternative siting of developments, this is a matter which can and should be resolved with the relevant planning authority, with the help of pre-planning consultations where appropriate and would not appear to require amendment of legislation. I will consider further whether it would be appropriate to deal with this matter in the context of the proposed guidelines.</P>

      <P>Affordable housing is housing provided by local authorities at a discounted price from market value and which is targeted at low income groups or those for whom increasing house prices have created an affordability gap. Such housing is made available under a number of Government initiatives such as, affordable housing schemes, shared ownership schemes, tenant purchase schemes, Part V of the Planning and Development Acts 2000 &ndash; 2002 and affordable housing initiatives under Sustaining Progress which are still being finalised. Each scheme has its own eligibility criteria against which potential purchasers must be assessed and, where necessary, local authorities may draw up a scheme of allocation priorities to determine ranking.</P>

      <P>As Minister, I am responsible for the development of a modern and sustainable waste management policy, centred around reducing our current over-reliance on landfill disposal and minimising impact on the environment. My Department has issued two policy documents, Changing Our Ways and Preventing and Recycling Waste &ndash; Delivering Change.</P>
      <P>I am also responsible for ensuring that a comprehensive and effective modern legislative code is in place to regulate the waste sector, taking particular account of the significant body of European law in this area. Such a code is in place through the Waste Management Acts 1996 to 2003, amended earlier this year through the Protection of the Environment Act 2003, and related regulations.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government (Mr. N. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>The overall aim of the Government's housing policy is to enable every household to have available an affordable dwelling of good quality, suited to its needs, in a good environment and, as far as possible, at the tenure of its choice. The Government's strategy is to increase housing supply to meet demand and to improve affordability, particularly for first-time buyers, and in this way, to seek to bring moderation to house price increases.</P>
      <P>There is clear evidence that the measures to boost supply, such as the Government's investment in infrastructure, removing planning constraints, and the increased residential densities now being achieved as a result of the residential guidelines produced by my Department have been successful in addressing the strong demand for housing. Last year was the eighth successive year of record house completions, with 57,695 units completed, an increase in output of 9.7% on 2001, and an over 30% increase in the housing output in the Dublin area. This positive trend in supply has continued into this year, with statistics showing that overall house completions for the first six months were up 16.5% on the same period last year.</P>
      <P>The effects of this increased output are being reflected in moderating house price trends. Average yearly house price increases have been reduced from a peak of around 40% per annum in 1998 to more moderate levels currently. Affordability has also been assisted by a range of factors, including high levels of economic growth, which have facilitated lower tax levels and increased disposable income, increased employment, lower mortgage interest rates and low inflation.</P>
      <P>The Government is committed to continuing with measures to boost the supply of housing and ensuring that the demand for housing is met in a sustainable manner. It is also concerned to ensure that the broad spectrum of housing needs is met, and remains committed to continuing with measures to assist low income groups and those with social housing needs by means of a range of targeted social and affordable housing programmes. Overall capital spending in 2003 on social and affordable housing programmes will be about &euro;1.7 billion, a near 7% increase on the amount provided in 2002, which should enable the housing needs of about 13,000 households to be met this year.   </P>

      <P>In July my Department invited applications from local authorities for funding under the EU co-financed specific improvement grants scheme in 2004.

There has been informal contact between the local authority and my Department regarding the need for such a road. The council may designate this scheme as a priority for EU co-financing in 2004.</P>

      <P>I assume that the question relates to rented residential accommodation. At present, tenancies in the private rented sector are subject to the landlord and tenant code, which is the responsibility of the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform.

      <P>The Residential Tenancies Bill 2003 is currently before the House. It provides for significantly improved security of tenure in the private rented sector while respecting the rights of accommodation providers to regain possession where there are valid grounds for this. The Bill also provides for an effective means of redress through a statutory private residential tenancies board in the event of illegal evictions. The board will compile data on such cases brought to it as well as on its determinations in other cases referred to it relating to the validity of tenancy terminations.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government (Mr. Cullen)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Litter Pollution Acts 1997 to 2003 provide local authorities with a wide range of powers to tackle litter pollution. Under the Acts, the primary management and enforcement responses must come from local authorities. They can investigate instances of littering and take appropriate clean-up and enforcement actions. Local authorities have significantly stepped up enforcement of the litter laws in recent years.</P>
      <P>In March 2002 the environmental levy on plastic bags was introduced. It has resulted in a reduction in the dispensing of plastic shopping bags at retail outlets by over 90%. An Agreed Programme for Government contained a commitment to consider the extension of the levy on plastic bags to other materials which may be problematic from a waste management and/or litter perspective.</P>
      <P>The litter monitoring body is co-ordinated by my Department. In July it published a report that identified ATM receipts as significant elements of paper litter. Chewing gum and fast food take-away bags and wrappers were also identified as being problematic litter items.</P>
      <P>As I announced last July, I am anxious to support strengthened local authority anti-litter action by tackling these problem areas. I recently commissioned a consultancy study to carry out an analysis of, and to make recommendations on: the implementation of economic instruments, including environmental levies, on these materials; to address the design issues associated with the implementation of recommended economic instruments; and the efficient administrative collection mechanisms to be applied. The consultants' report is due to be completed by the end of this month. It is anticipated that all relevant issues, including those raised by the Deputy, will be considered by the consultants during the course of their deliberations.</P>
      <P>I intend to make detailed proposals to Cabinet on the three targeted items at the earliest opportunity following a limited public consultation process, as well as consultation with other Departments.</P>

      <P>Clawback provisions provide that if a house purchased under the affordable housing schemes at a discount is resold before the expiration of 20 years from the date of the purchase, the person selling the property shall pay the housing authority a percentage of the proceeds of the sale. This percentage is equal to the percentage discount allowed by the local authority on the original sale of the house where the house is resold within the first ten years. The amount payable is reduced by 10% in respect of each complete year after the tenth year during which the person who purchased the property has been in occupation as his or her normal place of residence.</P>
      <P>The provision for a clawback is necessary to ensure that there is no short-term profiteering on the resale of a house provided by a local authority at discount from market value and it is not proposed to alter this.</P>

      <P>The initial application to my Department from the council for assistance towards the provision of a civic amenity centre in Drogheda could not be supported due to issues associated with it proposed procurement process. On 14 October, my Department's officials met the local authority to discuss these difficulties and it now proposes a revised procedure.</P>
      <P>Recently the local authority submitted a draft brief for the appointment of consulting engineers to support the revised procedure and it is being examined. My Department will revert to the council on the matter very shortly.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 671, 681 and 707 together.</P>
      <P>The Government took the difficult decision to terminate the new house grant scheme to ensure a sustainable match between its resources and expenditure. One of the stipulations clearly outlined to applicants in correspondence and through media advertisements was that people must occupy their new houses by 13 November. This deadline was adopted to achieve closure of the scheme, to allow re-prioritisation of this budget provision to other housing and social programmes and to prevent speculative applications on houses that may not be built for years to come.</P>
      <P>Some applicants will have difficulties meeting the deadline. After serious consideration we decided to extend the deadline for completion, occupation and receipt of a request for payment of the grant in my Department to Friday, 2 April 2004. Applicants must produce evidence of occupation. Over the coming weeks my Department will write to all of the applicants to outline the new requirements.</P>
      <P>This extension applies only to those who submitted valid applications received prior to the application deadline of 4 December 2002. Where all other conditions of the scheme are met, these applicants will now have until Friday, 2 April 2004 to complete and occupy their house and return a request for payment to my Department.</P>
      <P>In signing the necessary regulations to extend the deadline, the Government is happy to bring certainty to those applicants who were concerned about their position.</P>

      <P>I explained that Ireland will give priority to EU policy and legislative proposals in the areas of air and water quality, climate change, waste management, chemicals and nature conservation, as well as preparing for participation in major international fora such as the seventh Conference of the Parties to the Convention on Biological Diversity in Malaysia next February. I also outlined the importance I attach to the environmental aspects of the Lisbon agenda, to be reviewed at the spring 2004 European Council, and the need to pursue growth and social progress decoupled from environmental damage.</P>
      <P>The implementation of EU environmental legislation was not discussed. The Commissioner mentioned the establishment of the new office of environmental enforcement that I announced on 22 October.</P>

      <P>The review of the disabled person's grant scheme is being finalised in my Department. On completion of the review, I will determine the changes, if any, required to the regulations governing the scheme.</P>
      <P>The disabled person's grant scheme is an important measure that facilitates disabled persons, who could not otherwise afford to do so, to adapt their dwelling to meet their specific housing needs and to remain in their own homes for as long as possible. The significant improvements which have been made in recent years to the level of both grant and recoupment available has resulted in a substantial increase in demand for assistance under the scheme. The maximum grant has doubled from &euro;10,158 in 1997 to &euro;20,320 currently. The grant now covers 90% of the approved cost of the works compared to two-thirds in 1997. The recoupment rate from the Department to local authorities in respect of grants paid has also increased, from 50% to two thirds. Expenditure on the scheme has increased from &euro;13 million for 2,455 grants in 1998 to &euro;52.6 million for 5,932 grants in 2002. In line with this significant increase in the Department's capital provision for the scheme, recoupment costs have also increased from &euro;6.3 million for 2,512 grants in 1998 to almost &euro;31.5 million for 5,070 grants in 2002.</P>
      <P>These significant increases in funding provided are a clear indication of the Government's commitment to the disabled persons grant scheme.</P>

      <P>Final decisions on planning applications are a matter for the relevant local planning authority, or for An Bord Pleanála in the case of planning appeals. As Minister I am a statutory consultee on any proposed developments which may have an impact on built or natural heritage and I am accountable to the Houses of the Oireachtas and the public as regards the exercise of this function.</P>
      <P>On receipt of the original planning application my Department made an observation to Trim Town Council that the scale of the proposed development could have a negative visual impact on the castle. My Department also suggested that further information should be sought by the planning authority prior to any decision on the application being made.</P>
      <P>This further information was sought and received by the planning authority. In commenting on it, my Department reiterated its view that the development should not be permitted to impact negatively or detract from the visual appreciation of Trim Castle and that the proposal should be further scaled back.</P>
      <P>On 27 August Trim Town Council granted planning permission for the development subject to a number of conditions, including a reduced size for the development with fewer rooms and revised elevations. Conditions were also attached that the developers should undertake archaeological monitoring of all sub-surface works carried out within the development site. In addition, the developers were required to submit revised site layouts setting the building back from where it was originally proposed.</P>
      <P>I am satisfied that the developer and the council have made reasonable efforts to take the concerns expressed by my Department into consideration. As the decision to grant permission is now the subject of an appeal to An Bord Pleanála it would not be appropriate to comment further.</P>

      <Quest>if his Department's attention has been drawn to the methods to reduce the risks to human health from radon; if so, the nature of same; if his Department has a list of competent contractors who can carry out such measures to existing homes; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <P>I refer to the detailed statement made by my Minister of State, Deputy Noel Ahern, during a Dáil Adjournment debate of 22 October regarding radon gas. I also refer to my reply to Parliamentary Question No. 176 of 23 October in which I outlined a number of initiatives aimed at heightening public awareness of radon.</P>
      <P>In his statement, the Minister of State described a number of measures introduced by my Department over recent years in regard to radon remediation measures and techniques in relation to buildings, including the booklet published by my Department in February 2002, Radon in Existing Buildings &ndash; Corrective Options.</P>
      <P>The Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland maintains a list of known contractors and issues it to all householders with indoor radon levels above the reference level of 200 becquerels per cubic metre. The work of such contractors is not supervised or endorsed by RPII. It is a matter for householders, following radon remediation works, to satisfy themselves that radon concentrations have been reduced to below the reference level. This can be confirmed by post-remediation radon measurements.</P>
      <P>It is not practicable in the current budgetary circumstances to provide for Exchequer funding of a radon remediation grant scheme in respect of domestic dwellings.</P>

      <P>The authorised staff complement of my Department, excluding industrial staff, is 1,431 posts. At the end of September my Department employed the whole-time equivalent of 1,365.61 staff. This leaves a total of 65.39 vacant posts. At any one time a proportion of posts may be vacant due to the normal turnover of staff and other human resources planning considerations, such as the consolidation and restructuring of work in the Department.</P>
      <P>Having regard to a Government decision of late 2002 on the reduction in public service numbers, my Department must reduce its non-industrial staffing complement by 43 no later than the end of 2005. This requirement, along with overall administrative budget considerations, will be factors in HR planning decisions relating to the filling of all posts within my Department.</P>

      <P>The RPII did not claim that radon cannot be removed from drinking water. It advises that when water is found to contain high levels of radon there are remediation options available. At their most simple these options include boiling the water prior to use. This results in the release of the dissolved radon and, consequently, such water does not pose a radiological health risk if used to make tea or coffee or as part of cooking.</P>
      <P>In February the RPII published a report entitled Radon in Drinking Water in County Wicklow &ndash; a Pilot Study. It summarised the state of knowledge concerning the removal of radon from drinking water and the efficiency of the two different systems commercially available in other countries. Filtration systems are prone to the accumulation of radioactivity and for that reason aeration is recognised internationally as the preferred option for removing radon from domestic water supplies. The RPII is working closely with Wicklow County Council on the implementation of internationally recognised techniques for the remediation of drinking water supplies containing high radon concentrations.</P>

      <P>I assume that the Deputy's question refers to Commission Recommendation 90/143/EURATOM of 21 February 1990 on the protection of the public against indoor exposure to radon. Commission recommendations are not binding on member states. In 1990, arising from the recommendation, the Government, acting on the advice of the RPII, adopted a national reference level of 200 bqm³ for buildings above which remedial action to reduce the indoor radon gas level in a dwelling should be considered. No other member state has adopted a lower reference level.</P>
      <P>A national reference level of 400 bqm³ for workplaces was enshrined in Irish law in the Radiological Protection Act 1991 (Ionising Radiation) Order 2000. It gave effect in Ireland to Council Directive 96/29/EURATOM of 13 May 1996. It laid down basic safety standards for the protection of the health of workers and the general public against the dangers arising from ionising radiation.</P>
      <P>In 1997 Ireland was among the first European countries to introduce specific building regulations and related technical guidance on radon prevention in new buildings. The national Building Regulations 1997 and the 1997 Technical Guidance Document C (Site Preparation and Moisture Resistance) require radon prevention measures in new buildings. They use the national reference level of 200 bqm³ as the target for new houses. In July my Department published a draft amended technical guide for comment. It also uses the NRL of 400 bqm³ for workplaces. Definitive amended guidance, taking account of comments received, will be published in early 2004.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government (Mr. Cullen)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 696 to 699, inclusive, together.</P>
      <P>Lissadell House remains a property under private ownership. Any estimates provided earlier this year to my Department of indicative costs likely to be required for its purchase and development for presentation to the public were in the context of its possible State ownership and management. Such estimates should not be assumed to have relevance to any plans for the house which may be developed by its current owners and are not intended to infringe on the privacy of these owners.</P>
      <P>Subject to the above, the cost of purchasing Lissadell House, estate and significant contents was estimated at &euro;4.75 million. My Department was further advised that in the period 2003 to 2009, inclusive, additional expenditure in the region of &euro;26.42 million would be required to carry out conservation works to the main buildings, development works to the demesne and other necessary works to facilitate public access and to allow its development as a major visitor attraction. This figure of &euro;26.42 million was comprised of the following: &euro;9.66 million for immediate priority works to address health and safety, fire and security and accessibility issues in relation to the demesne, the features within it and, in particular, the house, together with essential conservation works to its fabric; &euro;8.3 million as a contingency provision for a programme of building fabric conservation works would have to be put in place based on detailed investigation and historical research, together with works within the demesne would be considered necessary to improve vehicular access and car parking, drainage and sewerage treatment, fire fighting provision and site lighting and possible conservation works to the farm building complex and the walled gardens to facilitate the development of the historic landscape setting; and &euro;8.46 million for long-term works to facilitate the opening to the public of most of the basement level, the private apartments at first floor level in the main house and the entire stable block.</P>
      <P>My Department was approached, on a confidential basis, by two separate potential partners with a view to entering into an agreement for the acquisition and future management of the estate. Before significant progress could be made it was announced that an agreement had been reached with another party for the sale of the property.</P>
      <P>Due to a busy schedule in the last sitting weeks of the last Dáil session, I did not have an opportunity to meet a deputation from Sligo County Council. I had been kept informed, through correspondence and orally, of its views relating to the proposed acquisition. The council was kept advised of all my actions in the matter.</P>
      <P>Details of the relevant correspondence between my Department and the council are set out in the following table:</P>

      <Quest>if the Government can assure the European Investment Bank that new infrastructural projects here that consume or encourage significant increases in the use of fossil fuels will comply with Ireland's commitments under the Kyoto Protocol.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">

      <P>The Government's national climate change strategy, published in November 2000, comprises a systematic programme for achieving the necessary greenhouse gas emissions reductions to ensure that Ireland complies with the Kyoto Protocol by the 2008-12 period, while continuing to support economic growth and to prepare Ireland for the more ambitious commitments that will be required after this period.</P>
      <P>The strategy identifies a range of measures, balanced across all sectors and including cross-sectoral measures to achieve the necessary reductions equitably, and with economic and environmental efficiency. In this regard, all Departments, including my own, have responsibility for integrating the strategy objectives into relevant business and therefore ensuring full account is taken of any likely negative impacts on greenhouse gas emission levels. New infrastructural projects that may be funded through the European Investment Bank fall to be dealt with in this manner.</P>
      <P>Meeting our target is an important Government commitment, and I initiated a review of the strategy to ensure more focused and intensive implementation. I intend to publish the outcome of this review by the end of the year. I am satisfied that full implementation over the remainder of the decade, together with any additional measures which may be identified in the review, will ensure that our Kyoto obligations are fully met, and allow us to position ourselves for future international climate policy negotiations.</P>

      <P>Goodbody Economic Consultants were commissioned to examine the position regarding availability and control of building land in certain development areas, particularly Dublin, to determine whether current practices are retarding the overall delivery of building land or impeding long-term stability in the housing market, and to explore the feasibility of a possible intervention. While the terms of reference do not explicitly refer to the holding of options on development land, the study is required to consider all relevant factors potentially impeding the supply of such land.</P>

      <P>The report entitled, Inventory of Dioxin &amp; Furan Emissions to Air, Land and Water in Ireland for 2000 and 2010, published by the EPA in December 2002 provides a useful indication of the relative significance of various emission sources for dioxins. In relation to the existing nine hazardous waste incinerators, the report estimated these to have contributed a fraction of 1% of national dioxin emissions to air in 2000 &ndash; tables 1 and 4.2 of the report refer. By comparison, estimated emissions from Hallowe'en bonfires, as set out in table 4.26 of the report, were over 130 times higher.</P>
      <P>It is evident from the report that the biggest source of dioxin emissions is, and is expected to remain, uncontrolled combustion processes, in particular, the home burning of domestic waste, house and vehicle fires, and Hallowe'en bonfires.</P>

      <P>A wide range of measures have been put in place at national, regional and local level to implement the national spatial strategy, which is a 20 year planning framework designed to enable every part of the country to achieve its potential.</P>
      <P>In adopting the NSS, the Government decided that the strategy will be an important factor in the prioritisation of capital investment, and in the allocation of sectoral investment, which in the case of my Department includes investment in water services, non-national roads and social housing provision. My Department's expenditure programmes will support the implementation of the strategy over its 20-year life. More specifically under a circular letter issued recently, local authorities were advised that in addition to compliance with previous eligibility requirements, projects being proposed for funding in 2004 out of the EU co-financed scheme of grants for improvement works on non-national roads had also to facilitate the implementation of the national spatial strategy and, in particular, had to contribute to improved accessibility to the gateways, hubs and other centres identified in the strategy. Similarly, local authorities have also been asked in their assessment of needs under the water services investment programme to identify any outstanding water services requirements necessary to give effect to the objectives of the NSS.</P>

      <P>Houses sold under the affordable housing scheme may be purchased by way of shared ownership. This facilitates home ownership in a number of steps to purchasers who cannot afford full ownership in the traditional way and is aimed at lower income house purchasers, especially first-time buyers. A person may purchase the local authority's share of the property outright and acquire full ownership, or, alternatively, this may be done by purchasing from time to time, additional shares of the authority's equity.</P>
      <P>Implementation and management of sales of affordable houses by way of shared ownership, including determination of the amount and frequency of equity purchases, is a matter for arrangement by individual local authorities.</P>

      <P>A range of legislative changes called for in the FGS review report were addressed in the Licensing of Indoor Events Act 2003. This Act introduced a new licensing system to be operated by fire authorities for certain indoor events as well as significantly amending the fire protection, fire safety and enforcement provisions of the Fire Services Act 1981. Provisions relating to the Fire Services Act have come into effect from 14 July 2003, while the remaining parts of the Licensing of Indoor Events Act 2003 will be commenced later this year.</P>
      <P>The review report's recommendations in relation to inter-agency major emergency planning had been overtaken by the creation of the Office of Emergency Planning at the Department of Defence in late 2001 which supports a Government task force on emergency planning chaired by the Minister for Defence. In addition, my Department and the City and County Managers Association, CCMA, recently formed a sub-committee under existing Department-CCMA structures to act as an interface and forum on local authority emergency planning issues and provide a vital link between the local and national structures.</P>

      <P>The objective of the CLÁR group water scheme top-up measure is to ensure that water is made available to householders in areas where unit costs are high because of sparse population and difficult ground conditions. The projects are selected by the relevant county councils. Householders pay a contribution of up to &euro;1,143 per house and the county council in question pays the group water scheme capital grant of &euro; 6,476 per house. CLÁR contributes a top-up grant of up to &euro;4,382. Thus, the maximum cost per house is &euro;12,000.  </P>
      <P>In the case of the Islandbawn-Lackamore group water scheme, the costings are in excess of these provisions arising from the difficult ground conditions.</P>
      <P>My Department has consulted the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government in relation to this issue and has been advised of potential savings to reduce the overall cost of the scheme. My Department is pursuing the options with Clare County Council.</P>

      <P>The assistance provided under CLÁR is funding the cost of the customer contribution to the ESB for conversion from single phase to three-phase electricity supply for small businesses or enterprises. To qualify for assistance under the scheme, a business must be located in a CLÁR area and employ not more than ten people. The applicant must also have received assistance since 1 January 1997 in respect of the business from the county enterprise board, the local Leader group or Údarás na Gaeltachta.

      <P>I refer the Deputy to the farm electrification grant scheme, FEGS, which is operated by the Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources.

Disadvantage in this case means the areas designated by the Department of Agriculture and Food as having a specific handicap and where conditions are particularly severe for farming.</P>

      <P>The Dormant Accounts Fund Disbursements Board is an independent statutory body under the aegis of my Department. The remit of the board is to prepare a plan for the disbursement of moneys from the dormant accounts fund for the purposes of programmes or projects that are designed to assist the personal, educational and social development of persons who are economically, educationally or socially disadvantaged or persons with a disability.</P>
      <P>The board presented its disbursement plan to the Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs for approval this summer and following detailed consideration of the plan, including consultation at Cabinet level, the plan was approved on 30 September subject to a number of amendments. The board is now making arrangements for the publication of the plan which is scheduled for mid-November.</P>
      <P>In addition, the board is advancing its consideration of the practical arrangements necessary to enable commencement of the implementation of the plan. In this regard, it is anticipated that arrangements for the board to engage a service provider to administer a funding programme on its behalf will be finalised shortly.</P>
      <P>The first transfer of moneys from credit institutions to the dormant accounts fund, managed by the National Treasury Management Agency, took place at the end April 2003. The total involved was approximately &euro;196 million. Since then &euro;19 million has been reclaimed and approximately &euro;2 million earned from investing the fund, leaving a current total of &euro;179 million in the fund. This figure includes a reserve, which must be maintained to meet claims for repayment and various costs associated with administering the scheme.</P>
      <P>Consistent with advice received from the Department of Finance, the board has agreed that not more than &euro;30 million should be disbursed annually.</P>

      <P>The Deputy will be aware that my Department is represented on the interdepartmental committee, led by the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, supporting the implementation of the national spatial strategy.</P>
      <P>In common with other Departments, my Department has submitted an &lsquo;issues paper' to the interdepartmental committee identifying the activities to which implementation of the national spatial strategy is linked, the degree to which those activities currently support the implementation of the national spatial strategy, and the potential for better alignment between these and implementation of the strategy. As the Deputy will appreciate, this is an ongoing process. The Deputy will also be aware that the CLÁR programme, which I initiated in October 2001 and to which a number of new measures have been added in the last year, is targeted at particularly disadvantaged rural areas and thus supports the objectives of the national spatial strategy.</P>
      <P>The Western Development Commission is, at my request, developing a strategy for towns on radial routes in the west. This is being undertaken in consultation with the regional and local authorities for the seven western counties of Donegal, Sligo, Leitrim, Roscommon, Mayo, Galway and Clare. The purpose of this strategy is to maximise the benefit to the west of the national spatial strategy, major roads investment, the strategic rail review and decentralisation.</P>
      <P>In September last I announced that I have, with the agreement of the Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment and the Minister for Arts, Sport and Tourism, commissioned a review of support for enterprise, including tourism in rural areas. In making this announcement, I acknowledged that rural area enterprise and job creation do not currently meet the national spatial strategy's objectives of balanced regional development or of rural regeneration. The review, which will be completed in mid-December, will identify weaknesses or gaps in supports and their structures of delivery. I have also asked the consultants to examine the effects of designating areas as the only ones where official assistance will be provided for establishing certain services and industries.</P>
      <P>The national spatial strategy also addresses many of my concerns relating to issues such as rural housing. The Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government is at an advanced stage in preparing rural housing guidelines. I expect to be consulted on the draft of these guidelines in advance of their being issued as a public consultation document before the end of the year.</P>
      <P>I can also confirm to the Deputy that I am satisfied that the expenditure programmes operated by Údarás na Gaeltachta, the regional development agency charged with working to promote the economic, social and cultural development of Gaeltacht regions are consistent with the objectives of the national spatial strategy in so far as they impact on the Gaeltacht.</P>

      <P>The supplementary welfare allowance scheme is administered on behalf of my Department by the health boards. The scheme allows for the payment of a weekly or monthly supplement in respect of mortgage interest to eligible people in respect of a house which is their sole place of residence.</P>
      <P>Mortgage interest supplements are subject to a means test. The amount payable is normally calculated to ensure that a person, after the payment of mortgage interest, has an income equal to the rate of supplementary welfare allowance appropriate to his or her family circumstances, less a minimum contribution of &euro;12 which recipients are required to pay from their own resources.</P>
      <P>The person concerned receives the full maximum rate of unemployment benefit and in addition, has a private income of just over &euro;50 per week. As her mortgage interest amounts to just under &euro;20, she has a net income of more than &euro;30 over and above the maximum rate of supplementary welfare allowance after she has paid her mortgage interest. Accordingly she does not qualify for a mortgage interest supplement under the terms of the supplementary welfare allowance scheme.</P>
      <P>I am satisfied that the assessment of the individual's application has been carried out correctly in accordance with the regulations governing the payment of mortgage interest supplements.</P>

      <P>More recently I have set up the Office of the Pensions Ombudsman which investigates and determines complaints made by or on behalf of beneficiaries of occupational pension schemes or PRSAs who allege that they have suffered financial loss as a result of maladministration by those charged with managing these arrangements.

      <P>The back to education allowance is a second chance educational opportunities programme designed to encourage and facilitate certain groups, particularly people who have been unemployed for a time and are having difficulty getting back into employment, to improve their skills and qualifications and, therefore, their prospects of returning to the active work force.</P>
      <P>To qualify for participation in the scheme an applicant must, <i>inter alia,</i> be in receipt of a relevant social welfare payment for at least six months or 156 days, immediately prior to commencing an approved course of study. The person concerned had been in receipt of unemployment benefit for only 135 days and did not, therefore, satisfy the eligibility criteria for participation in the scheme.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 727, 728 and 729 together.</P>
      <P>Continued entitlement to disability allowance is subject to the person concerned satisfying both the means test and medical eligibility criteria which apply. The medical eligibility conditions require that a person continues to have a disability as a result of which their employment capacity is substantially restricted.</P>
      <P>In common with all social welfare schemes there is a review process in place for disability allowance to ensure that the conditions of entitlement relating to means, medical conditions etc., continue to be fulfilled. The criteria for referral of cases for review are considered periodically having regard to the outcome of previous activity, and to ensure that resources for this purpose are used in a targeted and cost effective way. In recent times review activity in relation to disability allowance has been concentrated to a greater degree on the areas of means reviews, concurrent working and claiming, and financial circumstances generally.</P>
      <P>During the past five years, medical reviews of entitlement have resulted in disallowance of disability allowance in the following number of cases: 250 in 1999; 230 in 2000; 19 in 2001; seven in 2002 and ten in 2003 to date.</P>
      <P>In all cases where a person is disallowed on medical grounds they are informed of the decision, the reason for it and their right of appeal to the social welfare appeals office. The number of persons in receipt of disability allowance whose appeals in relation to medical eligibility were allowed by the social welfare appeals office over the past five years is as follows: four in 1999; nine in 2000; three in 2001; 16 in 2002 and six in 2003 to date.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 730 and 731 together.</P>
      <P>Disability allowance is a personal allowance payable to the claimant concerned. However, under social welfare legislation, payment may be made to a person other than the claimant in certain circumstances. Such persons are appointed and act as agents to collect payments on behalf of a claimant.</P>
      <P>There are some 19,312 persons who have appointed agents to collect their disability allowance payments for them. Agents are normally appointed where a person is unable to cash their payment due to serious illness or loss of mobility. They may also be appointed in cases where a person is permanently unable to act for themselves or discharge responsibility generally due to severe mental incapacity. In many cases parents, guardians or other family members are appointed as agents.</P>
      <P>Disability allowance is not generally payable to persons in residential homes, where their care and maintenance is being funded in part or in whole by the relevant health board. In instances where the allowance is payable, agents may be appointed to cash payments for the claimant. The number who act as agents in these circumstances is not known.</P>
      <P>In all cases where agents are appointed, including residential home cases, a formal application is required and the consent of the claimant is needed. The agent is responsible for ensuring that the payment is used for the benefit of the claimant. Such arrangements may be withdrawn at any time by the Department where it has reason to believe that the payment is not being used for the benefit of the claimant.</P>
      <P>My Department formally consults on a quarterly basis with organisations and service providers for persons with disabilities. No specific cases have been brought to my Department's attention where disability allowance is not used for the benefit of the claimant.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social and Family Affairs (Mary Coughlan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 732 and 733 together.</P>
      <P>Child benefit, CB, is paid monthly at present, while child dependant allowance, CDA, increases, in weekly social welfare payments, are paid weekly with the personal payment. There are no plans at present to pay child benefit on a fortnightly or weekly basis. As the payment is made monthly in advance, a change along the lines proposed would lead to a later payment than is currently available. In addition, significant additional administration costs would be involved.</P>
      <P>Since 1994, rates of child dependant allowances has been maintained at the same levels. This was done in the context of significant increases in child benefit, thereby concentrating additional resources for child income support on the child benefit scheme. The combined CB-CDA payment has increased by more than double the rate of inflation over that period. In 1994 where 70% of child income support for a family claiming social welfare payments was in the form of child dependant allowances, whereas the current position is that child dependant allowances account for less than 33%.</P>
      <P>The approach adopted has had considerable advantages in the overall aim to reduce poverty. Child benefit is neutral <i>vis-à-vis</i> the employment status of the child's parents and does not contribute to poverty traps, whereas the loss of child dependant allowances by social welfare recipients on taking up employment can act as a disincentive to availing of work opportunities. As a universal payment, which is not taxable and is not assessed as means for other benefits, child benefit is more effective than child dependant allowance as a child income support mechanism when account is taken of these incentive issues.</P>
      <P>In the partnership agreement Sustaining Progress, the importance of child income support arrangements is recognised, and the agreement includes a commitment to examine the current arrangements. This is being advanced in the context of implementing the agreement.</P>

      <Quest>if a contributory old age pension will be introduced which takes into consideration gaps in contribution records for those who had to emigrate to get work in the 1950s and 1960s, yet had reached the age of 66 prior to 6 April 1992, and do not have sufficient pre-1953 contributions to qualify for a full pre-1953 pension.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan" hpid="Mary Coughlan Mary Coughlan">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Social and Family Affairs (Mary Coughlan)</NameTxt>
      <P>In order to qualify for an old age contributory pension a person must have, amongst other things, an average of at least ten contributions, paid or credited from 1953, or the date they entered insurance, whichever is the later, up to the end of the last complete contribution year before they reach pension age. The alternative yearly average test, introduced in 1992, provides that persons who reached pension age on or after 6 April of that year, can qualify for a maximum rate pension if they achieve a yearly average of 48 contributions from 1979 up to pension age.</P>
      <P>In recent years, the Government has introduced a number of measures designed to make qualification for pensions easier for people with reduced or broken insurance records.</P>
      <P>In 1997, the average yearly number of contributions required for a minimum pension was reduced from 20 contributions to ten. <i>Pro rata</i> pensions are also available for people with insurance contributions at different rates or from other EU countries or countries with whom Ireland has signed a bilateral agreement. In addition, special pensions were introduced for those with pre-53 contributions and for self employed who were already over 56 years of age in 1988 when compulsory insurance was introduced for that.</P>
      <P>The measures introduced in recent years are designed to ensure that adequate recognition is given to all contributions while at the same time ensuring that payments are only made to those who have had a reasonable attachment to the social insurance fund throughout their working career. In the circumstances, there are no immediate plans at present for further easing of the qualifying conditions.</P>
      <P>I am, however, reviewing the qualifying conditions generally for contributory pensions to see whether changes could be made in the system of determining eligibility which would relate the level of pension more closely in all cases to contributions paid. I hope to have this review completed by the end of the year.</P>

      <Quest>the reason the agreement with the Irish Dental Association provides no cap on prices for fillings, particularly in view of the fact that dental charges here are far higher than those in Northern Ireland; if she will be monitoring prices; and if she will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <P>Under the dental benefit scheme administered by my Department treatment is provided to insured workers and their dependent spouses by general practitioners who enter into contracts with me for this purpose. This contract is negotiated, on dentists' behalf, by the Irish Dental Association. Under the existing contract, certain items of treatment are at fixed cost with the Department being responsible for meeting all or some of that cost while in other cases treatment costs are fixed by dentists themselves and the Department makes a contribution towards the cost.</P>
      <P>The fixed fee approach applies in relation to routine treatments involving examination, cleaning and extractions. In the case of fillings, patients receiving fillings under the scheme receive a 15% discount on the normal private fee. The charge to them for fillings under the scheme is the discounted fee less the contribution my Department pays directly to the dentist, namely &euro;29.20.</P>
      <P>I might add that the agreement with dentists requires them to display their normal fee for fillings and also the discounted fee applicable to patients under this scheme. This was designed to ensure that beneficiaries under the scheme were aware of the charges being applied by individual practitioners and to enable them to make informed decisions on where to secure the most advantageous service.</P>
      <P>I am satisfied that the current arrangements strike a reasonable balance between the needs of insured persons and the demands of dentists who operate the scheme.</P>

      <P>The back to education allowance is a second chance educational opportunities programme designed to encourage and facilitate unemployed people and others to improve their skills and qualifications and, therefore, their prospects of returning to the active work force.</P>
      <P>The programme is intended to assist social welfare recipients who may be at risk of becoming dependent on social welfare on a long-term basis because they lack educational qualifications.</P>
      <P>To qualify for participation in the scheme an applicant must, <i>inter alia,</i> be in receipt of a relevant social welfare payment for at least six months or 156 days immediately prior to commencing an approved course of study. Periods of unemployment or illness in respect of which social security payments were claimed in other countries do not qualify towards meeting this condition.</P>
      <P>The person concerned, had been in receipt of unemployment assistance for only 144 days and did not, therefore, satisfy the eligibility criteria for participation in the scheme.</P>
      <P>The existing eligibility criteria of the scheme are designed to ensure that access is afforded to people with at least a minimum six months of unemployment and there are no grounds for changing the criteria in the circumstances of this case.</P>

      <P>The person concerned applied to her local community welfare officer for and has been paid, supplementary welfare allowance at the weekly rate of &euro;116.00. She is entitled to payment from my Department at the rate applicable to her late husband for the six weeks after his death. A payment of &euro;1,564.80 was, accordingly, made to her recently. This covers her entitlements to 26 November next. Her application for widow's non-contributory pension is under examination at present and she will be advised of the outcome as soon as possible. Her entitlement will apply from 27 November 2003.</P>
      <P>Under social welfare legislation, decisions in relation to claims are made by deciding officers and appeals officers. These officers are statutorily appointed and I have no role in regard to making such decisions.</P>

      <P>My Department tries to ensure that, as far as possible, good environmental practice is integrated into all aspects of its operations, including the use of paper products. In this context, it is committed to using recycled paper where quality, suitability and cost considerations allow.</P>
      <P>For example in 2002, my Department spent a total of &euro;4,317,863 on stationery. The total spent on recycled paper, weekly envelopes, was &euro;302,290.</P>
      <P>Confidential waste, that is paper which holds sensitive material, continues to be recycled. My Department is currently in consultation with several companies with a view to establishing a comprehensive waste management system which will also cater for the recycling of non-confidential material.</P>
