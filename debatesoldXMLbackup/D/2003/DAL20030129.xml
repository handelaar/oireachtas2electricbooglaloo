      <P>We will try again. When I announced last December that the Government had agreed to increase the price of the television licence fee by &euro;43, I also announced a wide range of measures that will be implemented to strengthen the accountability and transparency of RTE in relation to the use of the substantial public funding being provided to it.</P>
      <P>These measures include the following: RTE will operate on the basis of a public charter &ndash; I will shortly initiate a public consultation on a draft charter; future funding of RTE will be linked to multi-annual business plans with outputs that can be independently verified; RTE will publish an agreed statement of programme commitments that can be measured; RTE will establish an audience council in the first half of this year to act as an advisory body to the authority; RTE will publish a code of fair trading practice in the first quarter of this year; and RTE is implementing a change management programme supported by a new financial management system that will bring greater transparency and accountability in relation to the cost of each RTE service. My officials will continue to meet RTE management over the coming months to ensure compliance with the commitments given.</P>
      <P>RTE will not receive the full increase of &euro;43 as it was an integral part of the Government decision that 5% of the net proceeds of the television licence fee &ndash; approximately &euro;7 to &euro;7.50 &ndash;  is to be ring-fenced as a special broadcasting fund to encourage new, innovative and additional public service broadcasting. The remaining &euro;36, approximately, will go to RTE. This is still a very significant increase and, accordingly, I am committed to ensuring that the licence fee paying public get good value for money. The package of reforms announced and the associated accountability and transparency measures are designed to ensure that this objective is realised.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kehoe</NameTxt>
      <P>I was very disappointed to see the large hike in the licence fee and the manner in which it was brought in. Like many other increases introduced by the Government since the election and sneaked in after the budget, hit<Col N="4" /> ting the ordinary man on the street and the ordinary consumer&mdash;</P>

      <P>The Deputy should ask a question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaulKehoeFG" hpid="Mr. Kehoe Mr. Kehoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kehoe</NameTxt>
      <P>I am coming to my question. There are many questions I would like to ask. What percentage of the licence fee increase will go towards programme making? Has the Minister made any provisions to increase the level of programme making? Every time one turns on the television one notices that Irish-made programmes are fewer and fewer. One could almost count on one hand the number of Irish-made programmes.</P>
      <P>I know the Minister said he will continue to meet RTE to ensure the licence fee increase is justified. However, has anybody from the Department been appointed to RTE to ensure that is the case?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DermotAhern" hpid="Mr. D. Ahern Mr. D. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not at all surprised that the Deputy and his party are disappointed by the increase in the RTE licence fee. When we increased the fee previously we were castigated by the Opposition for not making the increase greater.</P>
      <P>A policy adviser and a number of public servants work full time in my Department on the issue of RTE. There were more meetings with RTE personnel in the six months before Christmas than were held with them since the formation of the Government. RTE personnel said they never had as many meetings with a Department as took place over those six months. The purpose of those meetings was to examine the general and financial management of RTE and the result has been certain understandings predicated on a licence fee increase. My Department will continue to work day-to-day with RTE to ensure that the commitments it made are fulfilled.</P>
      <P>Commitments regarding home-produced programmes are set out in documents available on the websites of RTE and my Department, although those were predicated on a full &euro;43 licence fee increase which was not approved. On RTE 1, RTE has undertaken to increase home-produced drama at peak time by 15%, home-produced news and current affairs by 10%, home-produced music by over 12%, home-produced factual and historic programming by 8% and home-produced entertainment by 14%. The issue is not as acute in radio because most of the programming on that medium is home-produced. On Network 2, increases in home-produced programmes will be in the order of 7% in news and current affairs, 6% in music and 8% in entertainment. RTE has committed to increase dramatically the extent of home-produced programmes which is the main reason the licence fee was increased.</P>

      <askee>Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources</askee>
      <Quest> the matters discussed and conclusions reached at his meeting in Athens on 20 January 2003 with the President of the Council of Fisheries Ministers, Mr. Georgios Dris, regarding access to the Irish box; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>
      <QRef>[1820/03]</QRef>

    <Speaker pid="DermotAhern" hpid="Mr. D. Ahern Mr. D. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>The main purpose of my meeting with the Greek Fisheries Minister and current President of the Fisheries Council, Mr. Georgios Dris, was to discuss with him the Irish box and to seek his support for urgent actions at Council level to provide for its continuation. I outlined in some detail the history of the Irish box and its critical importance to the conservation of fish stocks and the livelihoods of Irish fishermen. Those fishermen are substantially dependent on fishing within the box.</P>
      <P>I explained that Ireland is totally opposed to the Commission proposal which was presented at the December Council on western waters on the basis that it seeks to eliminate the Irish box as a separate zone. It also proposes scrapping current vessel limits on Spain within the box as well as the effort limits on other member states without imposing an equivalent restriction for the Irish box area. I pointed out that the Commission's approach, which is to introduce effort limits across very large areas of western waters, would not be effective. It would prove very difficult to control and would lead to a transfer of fishing effort into the Irish box from outside, increasing fishing pressure in this very sensitive zone. I pointed out that the Commission's proposal would give Spain's entire &ldquo;Grand Sol&rdquo; fleet of 230 large whitefish vessels access right up to the 12 mile zone of the Irish coast.</P>
      <P>I set down the amendments Ireland is seeking to the Commission's proposal. These involve the establishment of the Irish box as a sensitive zone, establishment of effort limits for the box based on recent fishing effort history of each member state, including Spain, and the continuation of the effort regime for the rest of western waters as at present. I found Mr. Dris open and sympathetic to my proposals for the box. I sought and received a commitment from him to give priority during the first part of the Greek Presidency to working to achieve a compromise that recognises the ecological sensitivity of the Irish box and its importance to the Irish fishing industry. I had the Irish box included on Monday's Fisheries Council agenda. At the conclusion of the debate in Council, the Greek Presidency restated the commitments given at our bilateral meeting and called on COREPER to commence working on a draft compromise for presentation to the Council as soon as possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TommyBroughan" hpid="Mr. Broughan Mr. Broughan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Broughan</NameTxt>
      <P>We have not had the opportunity to question the Minister since before Christmas. Will he confirm that the Commission has taken the view that the Irish Box is a bilateral issue for Ireland and Spain to resolve? Will he also confirm that he has effectively lost the legal <Col N="6" /> argument? For example, he has given no indication that the matter might be referred to the European Court.</P>
      <P>The Spanish armada of vessels has been lying quietly off the coast of northern Spain while problems relating to the recent oil spillage there have been addressed. However, it is now slowly moving towards Ireland's key interests in the 50 mile box. Recently, the first of these vessels was arrested. Will the Minister concede that he has lost the battle and shown the white flag to Spain?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DermotAhern" hpid="Mr. D. Ahern Mr. D. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not accept that. The Irish Box requires more attention than the issuance of a few press statements or discussions with a few journalists. The Deputy referred to a Spanish boat detained over allegations of fishing offences. It was not inside but outside the Irish Box. Despite the portends of doom and gloom since 1 January, the number of Spanish vessels within the box has not even reached double figures on any day. While there are Spanish vessels outside the box, their presence this year is less than usual.</P>
      <P>This issue was not formally placed on the agenda of the Council meeting last December and it was never going to be decided then, despite efforts to suggest otherwise. It was originally contained in the Commission's proposal for resolution throughout this year, with a view to taking action in 2004, not only with regard to the Irish Box but also the Shetland and plaice boxes, also within European Union waters. Last October the Spanish requested a legal opinion which was subsequently tabled although there would not have been enough time to address it. We strongly objected to the opinion.</P>
      <P>Some may wish this to be a bilateral issue, but this Government and others do not take that view. For example, at Monday's meeting, the Portuguese publicly and strongly supported the Irish position, as did the United Kingdom. The Commission's proposals will affect issues beyond the Irish Box which will impact on other countries. In view of this we have a number of allies. The issue may ultimately go to court, but I would like to think we will reach a compromise. In this regard, the Greek President of the Council was very accommodating.</P>

      <AskConj>asked the </AskConj>
      <askee>Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources</askee>
      <Quest> if, as part of the new Common Fisheries Policy regulations, he has made progress in securing for Irish fishermen, an increase in the percentage of total EU quota allocation.</Quest>
      <QRef>[27056/02]</QRef>
    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="DermotAhern" hpid="Mr. D. Ahern Mr. D. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>The Common Fisheries Policy reform package agreed at the December Council was a complex compromise which contains many of the recommendations of the national strategy review group which worked with me in preparing the national position in the reform process. The reform package included key national priorities <Col N="7" /> such as the continuation of the Hague quota preferences, an action plan to address the problem of juvenile fish catches, stronger control and enforcement and new regional advisory councils giving fishermen a strong voice in shaping future fisheries policy at EU level.</P>
      <P>The result of the Council agreement must be seen in the context of rapidly declining fish stocks and reduced quotas for all member states. Agreement was secured in the new framework regulation that when the Community establishes new fishing opportunities the Council shall decide on the allocation of the opportunities, taking into account the interests of each member state. In addition, in the face of concerted pressure from five member states, I was successful in having the Hague preferences specifically recognised within the framework regulation, something greatly welcomed by the industry. The Hague preferences are of critical importance to Ireland as each year they deliver additional quotas for many of the key whitefish stocks in our waters.</P>
      <P>There has been a sustained attempt in recent years to eliminate the Hague preferences and thereby reduce Ireland's share of the total EU quota allocation. There was an intensified effort in December to deny Ireland these extra quotas and, heading into the Council, I was faced with the situation whereby the draft framework regulation contained no reference to the Hague preferences, with the very real risk of these additional quota entitlements being lost for good.</P>
      <P>After lengthy and at times fraught negotiations, I succeeded in overcoming the legislative obstacle and I formally achieved the reinsertion of the Hague preferences into the new CFP regulation, as well as securing the extra whitefish quotas of about 2,000 tonnes for 2003 under the Hague preferences. I also secured changes to the new CFP regulation to ensure there is flexibility in relation to revisions to allocation keys.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaulKehoeFG" hpid="Mr. Kehoe Mr. Kehoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kehoe</NameTxt>
      <P>While the Minister may have been fraught over there, it is guaranteed that fishermen were frothing over here and not for love of the Minister. Following the fisheries negotiations in Brussels recently, the Minister stated that he had negotiated a satisfactory deal for fishermen. I wish to pose several questions with regard to what the Minister means by &ldquo;satisfactory&rdquo; and state what I consider unsatisfactory.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In 2002, the total quota tonnage was over 200,000 tonnes; in talks in which the Minister participated recently, he achieved a little over 190,000 tonnes for 2003, a reduction of 10,000 tonnes. I cannot understand how the Minister can claim this was a satisfactory deal. This will devastate the whitefish fleet in the west and north-west due to boats being restricted to nine days at sea per month. The Minister's claims that he would protect the Irish Box by restricting the number of foreign trawlers to 40 rings hollow on this side of the House. The Minister has totally conceded to the Spanish in giving greater access to the Irish <Col N="8" /> Box while the Irish fleet has access for just nine days per month.</P>
    <P>Is the Minister receiving a list of the vessels entering the Irish Box at present? He said the number had not reached double figures but I do not care what the figures are. I want to know if the Minister knows the names of the vessels entering and the times of entry. During the negotiations, the Taoiseach said that we had to broker a better deal. I want to know what the Minister said to the Taoiseach when he came back from the negotiations.</P>

      <P>Deputy Kehoe is correct to say that last year's quota was 200,000 tonnes and that this year's is 190,000. That is in the context of a position where there were huge reductions in stocks and scientists were calling for a moratorium on fishing in all the waters around our coast with regard to a number of species. Going into the Council meeting there was no possibility of having the Hague preferences, which are very important to us. I was faced with the possibility of either a moratorium or a days-at-sea restriction in relation to all Irish waters. Despite the message put around at the December Council, where it was said this would devastate the entire west coast of Ireland, a small portion of the north-west of Ireland, from Donegal Bay upwards, not from Galway Bay, is affected. In answer to a later question, which may not be reached during the time for oral questions, I point out that at the very most only 20 boats will be affected by the days-at-sea limitation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>If a proportion of those 20 boats make a choice based on the type of fishing they have carried out over recent years, that figure will be even lower. I accept they are affected and that <Col N="9" /> is unfortunate. That small section was included in the days-at-sea limitation because the UK is a supporter of the days-at-sea limitation in relation to cod and hake. The scientific proofs strongly suggested that there should be a moratorium. I do not accept it was a bad deal. It was a very good deal.</P>

My Department is also funding the construction of open access metropolitan area fibre optic networks in upwards of 19 towns and the Liberties-Coombe area of Dublin to facilitate the provision by the private sector of advanced communications services to consumers, educational establishments and business. It is expected that these projects will be completed progressively over the next two years at a cost in the region of &euro;60 million. Construction of networks will begin shortly in Cork, Galway and <Col N="10" /> Mayo and further projects will commence once contracts have been completed.</P>
    <P>In Dublin specifically, my Department is overseeing the development of the digital hub, which is the Government's flagship project in the digital content sector. I met the Dublin Chamber of Commerce on this matter. This project aims to cluster Irish and international new media companies, research and development and educational-community initiatives in the Liberties-Coombe area of Dublin.</P>
    <P>To date, the Digital Hub Development Agency Bill completed all stages in the Seanad before Christmas; the construction of a 3 km, high speed, open access, fibre broadband network in the hub was completed in September 2002; Media Lab Europe, a third level research and development educational facility, has been established as a partnership between the Irish Government and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. It is the flagship project of the digital hub.</P>

      <P>Has the Minister visited Greencastle and Castletownbere since he got his famous fishing deal? Does the Minister agree that Ireland is now in the third division and that, in English terms, we are at the bottom of the second division? The Dublin Chamber of Commerce report makes it clear that cities such as Helsinki, Seoul and Singapore have the quality broadband network which gives video quality services and are in the premiership.</P>
      <P>Cities such as Copenhagen, London, San José, Sydney etc. are in the second division. We are in the third division with Prague, Tel Aviv, Dubai and so on. The Minister has been in office for six months and it is fair to say he has taken little initiative which would change that position. Is it not the case that he slashed the capital budget in this regard? Will he take on board any of the 40 or 50 major recommendations on how to accelerate broadband access for not only Dublin but every part of the country. In relation to regional policy this is vital. What is the Minister's policy on an enhanced tax regime to a lower VAT rate for e-commerce? In other words, will the Minister take a significant initiative to haul us out of the third division where we have been since 1997 The Minister is always harking back to ancient history. When the rainbow Government left office we were top of the league. The Minister did not retain that position. There was no interest the last time around and now he is in a disastrous situation.</P>

      <Quest> his views on television advertising directed at children; if his attention has been drawn to the negative effects of same on both children and society; and if, following RTE's increased income from the licence fee, he will consider the issue further with a view to restricting, or even banning, television advertising directed at children.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="DermotAhern" hpid="Mr. D. Ahern Mr. D. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 19(11) of the Broadcasting Act, 2001, provides that the Broadcasting Commission of Ireland, which is a statutorily independent body, shall draw up new codes and rules relating to advertising likely to be of direct or indirect interest to children. In November 2002, I formally directed the Broadcasting Commission of Ireland to draw up new codes and rules relating to advertising and that priority be given to those codes pertaining to advertising directed at children, and the Commission has commenced that process.</P>
      <P>The question of advertising directed at children is a sensitive and complex matter. While there is broad agreement that children should be protected and should not be exploited as consumers, there are many differing views as to how this objective can be best achieved. The Oireachtas decided in 2001 that the best way to proceed was to provide the Broadcasting Commission of Ireland with the power to draw up and implement codes and rules on children's advertising that would apply to all broadcasters licensed in Ireland.</P>
      <P>The Deputy makes a link between additional increased revenues that will flow to RTE as a result of the increase in the television licence fee and the possibility of restricting advertising directed at children. I am of the view that it is better to have clear codes and rules that will apply to all broadcasters licensed in this jurisdiction. The purpose of the codes and rules will be to set standards and ensure that children are adequately protected.</P>
      <P>The approach at EU level to the question of advertising directed at children is of direct relevance to us in Ireland. The European Commission presented the findings of a study on the impact of advertising and teleshopping on minors in March 2001. The main finding was that the provisions of the television without frontiers directive provide an adequate and flexible framework for member states rules in this area. The EU Commission has recently published its work programme for the review of the directive, and the work of the Broadcasting Commission of Ireland on its new codes and rules will help inform Ireland's approach to the review of the directive.</P>

      <P>What time scale does the Minister envisage? When should we expect a report from <Col N="13" /> the commission? Is he aware Sweden bans television advertising directed at children under 12 years of age? This ban has been commended by the United Nations as a good example for others to follow. I am sure the Minister is aware that many of his constituents from poorer backgrounds, particularly coming up to the Christmas period, are under pressure from advertising specifically geared towards children. There is the crazy situation where children are targeted by advertisers trying to sell products as early as August.</P>

      <P>I wrote to the chairman of the Broadcasting Commission of Ireland in November 2002 and have had discussions with him about this issue to try to bring forward these standards as quickly as possible. I cannot give a time scale as it is up to the Broadcasting Commission of Ireland but in the meantime, the existing codes of standards and practice drawn up in 1995 by one of my predecessors are <i>in situ</i> and will remain so. It may well fall for some consideration during Ireland's Presidency of the EU in 2004 and it might be one of the issues to the fore. It is an issue we are trying to address to build on the international experience from Sweden, to which the Deputy referred, and other countries and the current codes of standards in place.</P>

We surveyed 200 advertisements during the afternoon on &ldquo;Den 2&rdquo; and looked at what was being advertised. It was incredible to see it was typically the highest fat food and products with the highest sugar content &ndash; the worst products one would want for one's children.</P>

      <P>Under the legislation the Broadcasting Commission of Ireland is independent of me, although the Minister has the power to instruct or direct the Broadcasting Commission of Ireland to bring forward codes, a power which I exercised. It would be wrong for me to give a formal view. Obviously, as a parent with young children I have a view but, as Minister, it would be wrong for me to pre-judge any consideration of the Broadcasting Commission of Ireland. The level of complaints brought to our attention is extremely low, and this is also the experience at <Col N="14" /> EU level. Apparently, it is accepted at EU level that the existing directive works pretty well, although there are differences between member states as Deputy Crowe instanced. Part of the review will take into account the differing approaches to see how the matter can be addressed. I accept, however, that the level of advertising targeting children seems to be on the increase. It is something of which we should be very conscious and that is why I took action in November.</P>

      <P>I expect to receive the report of the sea-fishing boat policy licensing group by 30 June 2003. The review group can make interim recommendations at any stage on issues requiring urgent decisions.</P>
      <P>The review group has made two conservation-related interim recommendations, which I have accepted. These are: first, that polyvalent boats not precluded from fishing for herring and/or mackerel but which did not fish for those species in 2002 or 2003 will not break the active pelagic requirement of fishing for either of those species for 16 weeks in each of four successive years; and, second, that polyvalent boat owners also have the option to have 2002 and 2003 included for the purposes of active pelagic track record, subject to their having fished for at least a minimum period of eight weeks in each of those years.</P>
      <P>This is the first comprehensive review of licensing policy for more than a decade and there are many complex issues to be considered before substantive recommendations can be made for a reasonable number of years ahead.</P>
      <P>Clarification is awaited in relation to decisions on the EU Common Fisheries Policy last month affecting some key issues which the review group has to address, notably regarding the permitted overall size, composition and capacity of the Irish sea-fishing boat fleet.</P>

      <P>Given that the quota and tax negotiations have been completed, why do we not have the report? While my second question may cover some earlier ground, it is relevant to the new licensing regime. The Minister has admitted that area six of the Atlantic has been devastated because the British Government did not defend Scottish fishermen and the Minister himself did not defend our Donegal fishermen. Coastal communities such as Greencastle are facing an appalling future as a result of the Minister's incompetent negotiations and the seeding of area six. Fishermen are being restricted to nine days at sea, so will the new licensing regime take into account the fact that our fishermen will be at a <Col N="15" /> disadvantage? They will be facing an enormous challenge in the Irish Box from a huge foreign fleet, so will the Minister be able to organise licensing policy in such a way as to remove these major disadvantages?</P>

At the Fisheries Council we achieved hake preferences and, in addition, we succeeded in defeating the proposal to make the entire Irish Sea and Celtic Sea up to Donegal subject to a days-at-sea limitation. The fact is that a relatively small area is affected within which only about 20 boats are affected, despite exaggerations the Deputy may have heard on the airwaves and which he has just repeated.</P>

They can make them because, based on their previous track record, quite a number of them will be able to fish for at least 25 days a month if they fish a particular species with a particular mesh size.</P>
      <P>One of my first acts on taking up office was to put the licensing of fishing vessels on an independent basis. I established an interim appeals mechanism so that the designation of licences would be at arm's length from the Minister. The Deputy should compliment me on that.</P>

      <P>The Seven Heads gas field, which lies in the North Celtic Sea Basin some 50 km. off the Cork coast to the south-east of the Kinsale Head gas field and for which a plan of development, POD, accompanied by an environmental impact statement, EIS, has been submitted to me for approval, is estimated by the developer, Ramco Seven Heads Limited, to contain some 300 billion cubic feet with an estimated economic field life of 15 to 18 years. The application is currently under consideration in my Department and I hope to be in a position to make a determination in relation to it in the coming weeks.</P>
      <P>Ramco Seven Heads Limited hope to bring ashore the gas in the autumn of 2003. The field will supply Ireland with between 10% and 15% of its requirements for the next 15 years approximately. Moreover, the development will use the processing and export pipelines of the Kinsale gas field. This, in turn, will extend the economic life of the field and its associated employment.</P>
      <P>The company will be liable to pay corporation tax at the rate of 25% on profits from the sale of gas. The corporation tax yield to the State is estimated in the region of &euro;60 million to &euro;100 million.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Broughan</NameTxt>
      <P>What is the Minister's initial reaction to the plan of development? Would he agree that many citizens noticed the widespread publicity given a few weeks before Christmas to the deal between Ramco and the German com<Col N="17" /> pany, Innogy? They were surprised by the estimate put on the value of this resource and the fact that there seemed to be no way this State could acquire any royalties from this flow of wealth. Is it not the case that some of the estimates in the energy press refer to a capacity of 500 billion cubic feet and perhaps more? While I understand Ramco is a specialist company and that it has organised its finance through Bank of Scotland, it seems this small company and others like it are getting a bargain basement deal from the Irish State.</P>
      <P>We sometimes hear that we may be the Norwegians of the future given that our coastal shelf, with new technology, is an immensely valuable resource given its energy freedom and potential exports for many centuries into the future. If that is the case, should it not be a priority of this Administration to look urgently at the return to this State in terms of royalties, the workforce and all other benefits gained from our oil and tax regime?</P>

    <Speaker pid="DermotAhern" hpid="Mr. D. Ahern Mr. D. Ahern">

      <P>I am surprised Deputy Broughan is so critical of his former colleague, Mr. Spring, who was in my position years ago and oversaw the conditions under which oil companies got into this country. Despite all the publicity which people like the Deputy might seek when in opposition as opposed to what they might do when in government, the reality is that the level of exploration around our coast is at an all time low. The vast majority of companies have not even drawn on any of the conditions about which there is so much publicity. This is a relatively small company which had the courage to stay in Ireland and investigate the possibilities. As I said earlier, it is estimated, based on certain price levels which are verifiable, that in the range of &euro;60 million to &euro;100 million will come to the State based on the corporation tax rate, which for oil companies is still very high in comparison to 12.5% for everything else. An objective analysis of oil exploration off our coast over the years will show that, despite what might be perceived as favourable conditions for oil companies, there has been little or no exploration. Many issues about royalties are similar to those granted in the UK and elsewhere.</P>

      <P>On 7 November 2002, the European Commission was formally notified of the events which Ireland proposes to designate as events of major importance to society under Article 3a of the television without frontiers directive. Under that directive, the Commission must verify that the measures proposed are compatible with EU law, communicate them to other member states and seek the opinion of the contact committee established under Article 23a of the directive.</P>
      <P>A meeting of the contact committee, which is chaired by the Commission and includes representatives from all member states, will take place tomorrow. Among the items to be discussed at that meeting are Ireland's proposals on Article 3a. My Department will be represented at that meeting.

      <AskConj>asked the </AskConj>
      <askee>Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources</askee>
      <Quest> if he intends to insist on 100% of licence fee money being spent on programme making within RTE to provide a high quantity of service and value for money to the public.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="DermotAhern" hpid="Mr. D. Ahern Mr. D. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy is aware, RTE is dual funded, receiving moneys from the proceeds of the television licence fee and commercial revenue. As the national public service broadcaster, RTE is mandated to provide a comprehensive range of programmes on radio and television that reflect the cultural diversity of the whole island of Ireland and that entertain, inform and educate. This mandate includes the provision of a programming schedule that will cater for the expectations of the community generally as well as members of the community with special or minority interests.</P>
      <P>The purpose of the licence fee increase was to ensure that RTE had the necessary resources to fulfil its statutory mandate. It was accepted there was a strong case for improving the quality of RTE's programme schedules with more home-produced programming in peak time in particular. RTE's application for a licence fee increase of &euro;43 was based on an assumption that this would generate additional income of &euro;50 million of which &euro;32 million would go directly to additional programming.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="20" />Through the implementation of its change management programme, RTE is committed to achieving efficiencies so that the benefit to the licence fee payer from the substantial public funds provided to RTE is maximised.</P>
    <P>An integral part of the Government decision to increase the licence fee was that 5% of the net proceeds of the television licence fee, approximately &euro;7 to &euro;7.50, would be ring-fenced as a special broadcasting fund to encourage new, innovative and additional public service broadcasting. The remaining &euro;35.50 will go to RTE. This is a significant increase for RTE and is accompanied by a package of reforms to ensure that the paying public get good value for their money. The decision to establish the special fund was an integral part of the comprehensive programme of measures that I announced last December to bring about a fundamental reform of public service broadcasting in Ireland. The special fund will result in enhanced public service programming on a nationwide basis over and above that provided by RTE, which will be in receipt of increased funding, and over and above that already provided by other broadcasters.</P>
    <P>It is my intention that the scheme will be administered by the Broadcasting Commission of Ireland in the first instance and ultimately by the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland. I will bring forward shortly more detailed proposals in connection with the establishment and operation of the fund.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DermotAhern" hpid="Mr. D. Ahern Mr. D. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>There will be an increase in home produced programmes. The Irish people want an Irish broadcaster that produces programmes here, to help to keep jobs here and to support our culture and traditions. It is not desirable to have outside broadcasters always pushing programmes that are produced abroad. If we do not pay for an indigenous service, we will have to do without it. The Government took a strategic and courageous decision to give what is, in effect, a substantial licence fee increase to RTE. I assure the Deputy and the House that my Department will continue its detailed discussions with RTE and will ensure that the commitments made by RTE will be delivered.</P>

      <P>When RTE management and trade unions attended a meeting of the Joint Committee on Communications, Marine and Natural Resources, it was striking that trade unions made the point that RTE's regional structures have been grossly run down. It is inappropriate that the committee is sitting at the same <Col N="21" /> time as questions are being asked of the Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources in the House, given that Deputies do not have the gift of bi-location. Is the Minister concerned about the regional aspects of RTE's service, for example in his territory in the north-east? Despite the fact that there are a few remarkably good regional correspondents, some of whom are justly famous, I do not get the feeling that RTE is sufficiently responsive to regional needs.</P>
      <P>Deputies are probably aware that the local authority of which I am a member had to conduct some important business in recent weeks. I found that my colleagues on Dublin City Council and I had to educate certain journalists, including some from RTE, about some basic facts relating to the operation of local government in Dublin. The Minister is aware that RTE does not have a Dublin correspondent and I believe there should be correspondents in all other areas, including Cork, Louth and Wexford.</P>
      <P>Has the Minister any strong views about RTE's coverage of politics, especially the attention it pays to this House? Does he have any ideas about how television coverage of the House could be enhanced? I appreciate that the Oireachtas needs to make changes so that it can be televised and the new Oireachtas commission should take action in that regard. I hope this debate on broadcasting will be covered on &ldquo;Oireachtas Report&rdquo; tonight and that it will not seem as if we are in a wooden atmosphere.</P>

I may be incorrect, but I understand that Leaders' Questions will be televised live today. I am not involved in the day-to-day running of RTE, but I am sure certain commitments have been made. The expansion of its service in the areas I have mentioned is an immediate priority &ndash; RTE has admitted that its regional coverage can have certain deficiencies.

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 121 and 577 together.</P>
      <P>As the Minister of State, Deputy Browne, has indicated, funding available this year under the forestry subhead will be focused on the maintenance of a viable planting programme. In this regard, approvals for new afforestation projects will continue to be issued. Planting levels in 2003 are expected to reach at least 10,000 hectares and I hope this figure will be increased during the year. Despite the changed budgetary situation, the Government remains fully committed to the long-term development of the forestry sector and I will ensure that this commitment will be reiterated in the current negotiations on a new national partnership agreement.</P>
      <P>I am conscious of the serious concerns among forestry stake holders in relation to the budgetary situation. There have been extensive consultations with the forestry sector, involving the Minister of State, Deputy Browne, and my officials. These consultations were undertaken to ensure a positive outcome in terms of maintaining confidence in the sector, with regard to the contribution of forestry to the economy, rural development and sustainable local employment. On that basis, following the feedback which the Minister of State and my officials received from the sector, I decided that the primary focus in 2003 should be on maintaining the afforestation programme. As I stated earlier, approvals for new afforestation projects have been issued. I have also introduced new procedures in relation to processing afforestation applications, to ensure that those who wish to plant in the short to medium term will be accommodated during the current planting season. This is a pragmatic response to the changed budgetary situation and will allow the delivery of a viable planting programme in 2003.</P>
      <P>I assure the Deputy that the Government remains strongly committed to the continued development of the forestry sector. I welcome the input of the various forestry stake holders to the process in light of the changed budgetary situation and I look forward to working closely with representatives of the forestry groups in taking these matters forward.</P>

Since 1997, more than &euro;540 million &ndash; an average spend of &euro;90 million per year &ndash; has been spent on forestry.

      <P>From the Minister's comments that the limited resources will be concentrated on continuing the current forestry programme, I infer that the two innovative schemes that held great hope for environmentalists and people interested in forestry, namely, the neighbourhood wood scheme and the native woodland scheme, are effectively being cut, as their budgets have been slashed. These programmes have taken years in development and represent a move away from the concentration on soft wood and exotic conifers, which have very low economic value, towards not only forests of high amenity value but also, in the long run, high-value native hardwood timber. Those projects have been the first to suffer in the fairly dramatic cutbacks introduced by the Minister. Can the Minister confirm that they will get funding this year?

      <P>Following consideration of the recommendations of the Forum on Broadcasting and of submissions received on its findings, I announced a comprehensive programme of measures to be implemented that will result in a fundamental reform of public service broadcasting in Ireland. Some of these measures will be implemented in the immediate future, while others will take a little longer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the key recommendations of the forum was that there should only be one content regulator for Irish broadcasters. I concurred with that recommendation and the Government agreed to my proposal to establish a new regulator &ndash; the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland &ndash; that will have responsibility for content regulation and for the independent broadcasters currently licensed by the Broadcasting Commission of Ireland as well as RTE. New legislation will be necessary to give effect to the decision to establish the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland and to the establish <Col N="26" /> RTE as a commercial state company. Work has commenced in this regard.</P>
    <P>In the short-term other measures will be implemented. For example, I will shortly initiate a public consultation on a draft charter for RTE and RTE's statement of commitments for the current year will be agreed. In the first quarter of this year RTE is committed to finalising its new code of fair trading practice and to the appointment of a process auditor to its independent production unit. By the middle of the year, RTE will have established an audience council. I am also considering options for the introduction of the special fund for new, innovative and additional public service broadcasting in the period prior to the establishment of the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland.</P>

      <P>In the lengthy debate we had in the run up to the Minister's decision on the licence fee, it was noted by many commentators that every few years we seem to have a similar debate on the future of public sector broadcasting. Does the Minister think the programme he detailed, particularly the launching of a charter and a customer charter, secures the future of public broadcasting? Will we need to have this debate again in three or four years or more crisis discussions on the future of public broadcasting?</P>

As I said on a previous question, RTE has been very quick to respond to some of the key issues. My Department officials and I will continue to meet RTE officials on a regular basis to ensure that its commitment will be fulfilled.</P>

      <P>The House meets today at a time of great uncertainty, when parliaments and people all over the world are discussing the possible onset of war in Iraq. I consider it an indictment of the Government that this House has not yet had a full, open debate, with questions to members of the Government, about the Government's stance on the possible catastrophic economic and social consequences for humanity of such a war. The Government has been hiding behind language. I hope the Taoiseach will answer this simple question in simple and understandable language: has the Cabinet discussed, and made a decision on, this country's attitude towards the facilities for refuelling being made available at Shannon, first, in the event of UN sanction being given under a second resolution for a military invasion of Iraq, and second, in the event of a military invasion taking place unilaterally? What would the Government do, in the latter case, about the refuelling facilities? Would <Col N="27" /> they be closed down or would the Government continue to make them available?</P>

      <P>The Minister for Foreign Affairs will make a detailed statement on all the circumstances tonight. The Deputy asked what would happen over the next few weeks because there is much uncertainty about what may or may not happen between the US and the UK. The Government totally and absolutely supports the position as set out by the Secretary General of the United Nations, Kofi Annan &ndash; we want to see a peaceful resolution to this issue. The Secretary General does not consider that we have commenced a war. He is not opposed to any military build-up to try to get compliance with Resolution 1441 of 8 November 2002. Until action takes place, the traditional arrangements for fuelling and flyovers will remain. Our preferred solution is that the Security Council debates the new report when it is issued, probably in mid-February, and agrees a new resolution. Whatever happens from that point will be based on the report and its contents. We would like to see this dealt with successfully without military action but that is in the hands of the Iraqi authorities.</P>
      <P>If there is no resolution at the UN , or it does not get to debate or agree a resolution, and there is unilateral action by the US on its own, the US and the UK, or the US, the UK and others, without a mandate from the Security Council, we will have to consider the position at that stage. We would have to revert to the House and the Government would have to make a decision. I hope it does not come to that but we have put contingency arrangements in place if that is the way it falls. I think that answers the Deputy's questions.</P>
      <P>For the information of the House, many issues were raised over the Christmas break about the various procedures and we will outline them in great detail in a contribution this evening.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny" hpid="Mr. Kenny Mr. Kenny">

      <P>I am not a supporter of the brutal regime of Saddam Hussein and we completely understand the economic, political and social ties between this country and the United States, however we are a sovereign independent people. The Taoiseach did not answer whether the Cabinet had discussed or made any decision on this, nor has he referred to Ireland's central role in European affairs &ndash; this country was critical to the expansion of the European Union arising from the people's decision in the referendum on the Treaty of Nice. We should know what the position and attitude of the Cabinet will be in the event of an invasion taking place without UN sanction. It is a shame the Dáil has not had an opportunity to debate this, not just by way of Private Members' motion, but with questions and <Col N="29" /> answers so the people's representatives can give their views on what could be a catastrophic occasion. When the first bombs fall on Baghdad it will be too late to call the House back for such a debate. Will the Taoiseach tell us what is his and the Government's attitude regarding the need for UN sanction for action and is he bringing that response to the other leaders of Europe as is his duty and responsibility?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Our view is in line with that of the vast majority of European countries although I am not here to answer for them. In the event of military action being initiated against Iraq, either with or without UN sanction, the Government will review the situation, initiate a debate in the Dáil, including, if appropriate, the adoption of a motion similar to that which we passed during the Gulf War in 1991. I will not try to predict, as the Deputy is asking me, what Saddam Hussein and his corrupt regime will do or what he has done with the 6,500 chemical bombs, the equipment &ndash; logged on previous inspections and now missing &ndash; and the implements he is known to have and cannot account for or why he is not fully co-operating with the inspectors who have been unable to meet scientists. I hope he will listen to what the world is saying &ndash; the Security Council vote in November was 14 to 0, the meeting in Turkey of Saddam's neighbours last week asked him to co-operate. Practically everyone in the world has asked him to co-operate fully and comprehensively but to date he has refused to do so.</P>
      <P>I share Deputy Kenny's view. I do not want to see this turn into a catastrophe but the one person &ndash; it is ironic in the modern age that one person can call the shots &ndash; who can end all this, send everybody home and stand down the military action is Saddam Hussein. It is a matter of grave concern that he is prepared to allow the world to get into a complex and difficult situation with all the ramifications that might have. I would prefer to see this issue resolved within the international body of the United Nations which is designed to bring world peace and stability. I do not like unilateral action &ndash; I have said so inside and outside the House. I would prefer if the Americans gave more time. I hope they do, and that is what the Security Council is saying &ndash; Kofi Annan has set out the terms clearly. I reiterate that Kofi Annan does not consider the military build-up to be an act of war. He sees it as the only way of forcing Saddam Hussein to deal with issues he has refused to deal with for 13 years. I hope that will resolve the problem. If the situation changes, I will keep Deputies Kenny and Rabbitte and others informed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>There was another killing in this city last night. There were 62 homicides in Dublin last year and the city is now more deadly than London. At least eight of those killings were so-called gangland killings as far as we know. No one has been charged with any of these killings. We know from official Garda figures that the <Col N="30" /> level of violent assaults rose last year by 93%. The Taoiseach will be aware of a horrific incident last week involving the alleged rape of three young women, in which case a prosecution is being taken. Joyriding is at epidemic levels in some parts of Dublin and outside the city. Women, in particular, are afraid to walk some of the streets of our cities.</P>
      <P>What will the Taoiseach do to address this problem? The only Government action I can see is an offer from the Minister of State, Deputy O'Dea, to mediate among the warring gangs in Limerick, an idea not without its attractions. Other than that tomfoolery, what does the Taoiseach intend to do to prevent a situation where crime bosses think they can kill at will and with impunity? What does he intend to do to ensure these people are brought to justice?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>There has been a number of serious and violent acts. While many of the people who have suffered from these have been engaged in crime, their families endured enormous hardship and I extend my sympathies to them.</P>
      <P>In recent years, the Government has implemented and has had before this House stringent legislation to try to deal with crime. Our Garda force is at a record high this year due to further recruitment and full capacity in Templemore. We have resourced the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform to a record level. We would like to have done more this year but that was not possible. The Government will continue to initiate and implement public order legislation and to support the targeted operations, which are aimed at the precise criminal activities to which Deputy Rabbitte referred and which exist. Such schemes include operations Encounter, Dóchas, Cleanstreet and Nightcap, all of which involve Garda units combating sophisticated and high level crime. The extension of CCTVs and the enforcement of the dedicated units of the Garda have to be taken into account also.</P>
      <P>Deputy Rabbitte knows well that we are up against very sophisticated gangs which are, in some cases, very well equipped. The only way to break up those gangs is with heavy resources deployed by specialised units. It is difficult and specialised work. The precise answer to Deputy Rabbitte's question is that the Government has to continue to resource the special units and make them available to break up the gangs. Normal Garda surveillance activities will not break up the gangs that are involved in the kinds of gangland activities to which the Deputy referred. We have to target our resources into particular areas, and that is what the Minister is doing. At times, it means pulling resources from other areas because infinite resources are not available. The Public Order Act will help in some areas, but I am not a great believer that new legislation alone will resolve these issues.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Perhaps I am wrong in thinking that Deputy Rabbitte said the records of detection are not <Col N="31" /> good. The records of detection in respect of murders that relate to domestic and other activities are very good, but not, admittedly, in respect of gangland murders, as I think he said. The Garda feels that the only way to deal with this problem is through specialised units, and that is where the Government is offering the most support.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>Talking about reality, is it not the reality that we have had two gangland killings already this year and that two youths were abducted who are feared dead? There is little point in telling me of the rate of detection in respect of domestic violence when this is the record.</P>
      <P>Is it not also the reality that the Taoiseach and the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform promised 2,000 additional gardaí, but not one additional garda has been appointed? The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, a man who has an opinion on everything but a policy on nothing in his own area, in one of his many interviews over Christmas told us that the Minister for Finance has capped the number of gardaí at 12,500. We were not told that in this House. How does one get 12,500 when one adds 2,000 to 11,800? The Government promised the additional 2,000 gardaí and it is not only in terms of gangland violence that problem exists. It exists on the streets in terms of joyriding in communities that are besieged in their homes. No remedy is offered by the Government.</P>
      <P>The Minister of State at the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy O'Dea, went on radio and advised the nation that he went to his local Garda station to promise it additional resources. It is news to me that a Minister of State can go around advising of additional resources. Maybe when he is finished he can come to my Garda station and that of every other Member of the House to do the same. If the Government's response is to send the Minister of State, Deputy O'Dea, to talk on &ldquo;Morning Ireland&rdquo; to address the situation five years after a Minister came to office beating the drum of zero tolerance, it must be the sickest, most cynical joke in Irish politics in recent years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Rabbitte has raised three points. The abduction and detention of the young men, allied to the difficulties in Limerick, is obviously totally unacceptable in a civilised society. All the resources that are necessary to find these young men are being, and will continue to be, made available. The Army, the Garda, the air support unit, the dog unit and special units have been involved for several days. The dog unit is very important in trying to find these young men so the Deputies should not sneer at it. The only way the young men will be found at this stage, unfortunately, is with the dog unit. That is the regrettable part. Searches have proved negative so far but they are still taking place.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The last Government increased the Garda numbers to the current figure of 11,900, as <Col N="32" /> Deputy Rabbitte knows. Within the Garda Training College in Templemore it is hoped to bring the Garda authorised strength up to 12,200 this year. It will not be possible to go beyond that figure this year, but the figure must be considered in light of resources as they exist within the overall framework to keep a sustainable economy and to keep people in employment.</P>
    <P>In respect of Deputy Rabbitte's question on overall crime, there is crime in other areas. The Public Order Bill, I hope, will give the Garda significant additional powers to deal with drunken, disorderly and riotous behaviour which is evident in beleaguered communities. As soon as the legislation is passed the Government will take the necessary action to try to enforce order in these areas, as we have been doing.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>Why has the Taoiseach, as leader of the Government, and not primarily the Ministers for Foreign Affairs and Transport, colluded in flagrant and persistent breaches of the Air Navigation (Carriage of Munitions of War, Weapons and Dangerous Goods) Order, 1973, which expressly prohibits weapons of destruction or munitions of war to pass through our airports without permission? Does the Taoiseach realise the anger among ordinary citizens over the blatant dishonesty of his Government in respect of the way Shannon Airport has been allowed to be used by the US military?</P>
      <P>Last night the Department of Transport admitted that, in the eight days up to Monday, 19 aircraft carrying weapons or munitions of war sought and were given permission to land at Shannon Airport. For the whole of last year, one single aircraft notified that it was carrying weapons and was given permission to land. Were the other 552 military aircraft &ndash; mainly US aircraft &ndash; that used Shannon Airport last year carrying only soggy lollipops or did the Government recklessly allow the US military to flout, persistently and with contempt, the regulations governing the transport of munitions of war through our airports?</P>
      <P>Does the Taoiseach know what weapons were carried through Shannon in those planes? He is very much in favour of inspecting the weapons or alleged weapons of destruction of the horrific dictator Saddam Hussein. Why did he not carry out an inspection of the planes using Shannon? Did a single inspection take place or is it the case that a blind eye was deliberately turned to the hundreds of aircraft which were undoubtedly carrying huge quantities of arms without permission and in breach of regulations?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy stated that one aeroplane went through last year, but my information is that 30 aircraft were given permission to carry weapons or munitions last year. I do not agree with the Deputy's assertions. The arrangements whereby Shannon is used as a refuelling stop by the US military have been in place for many years under successive Governments. As <Col N="33" /> the Deputy knows &ndash; I told him before Christmas &ndash; we do not board the aircraft of friendly countries to check precisely what is on them. There has been a working arrangement for 40 years which has operated well. The United States of America knows what the regulations are and the Minister for Foreign Affairs reiterated them some weeks ago. The airlines involved were reminded of their legal requirements and they go through a procedure which we have always followed.</P>
      <P>US military aircraft have been granted permission to land at Shannon according to the requirements of the Air Navigation (Foreign Military Aircraft) Order, 1952, for a number of decades. It has been the practice for commercial charter aircraft carrying US servicemen between the USA and overseas bases to refuel at Shannon. Refuelling aircraft which travel all over the world constitutes about 40% of the activity at Shannon Airport. Such activity has always gone on. The regulations are set down and I do not see anything wrong with them. If a war arose, the Government would review the matter, but no additional facilities have been requested by the USA over and above the standing arrangements. If I believed the Americans were storing weapons of mass destruction at Shannon Airport and hiding them from the United Nations inspectors, I would take a different view. That is why I am very concerned about the fact that Saddam Hussein has held such weapons for many years which he has used against the people of his own country, as well as against Iranians and the Kurds whom he tortured and caused to suffer. I am sure Deputy Joe Higgins would join with me in hoping he complies fully with Dr. Hans Blix and others.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I am reminded of what a farmer said recently about a different member of the Government. Asking the Taoiseach a question is like trying to play handball against a haystack. You hear a dull thud and the ball does not come back to you. It goes all over the world, but it certainly does not come back to the person asking the question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like a specific answer from the Taoiseach. The Taoiseach knows that President Bush, the fundamentalists who surround him and his fellow fundamentalist, Prime Minister Blair, intend to attack Iraq no matter what. He should be very clear that they have made up their minds. He knows that doing so will wreak havoc on the peoples of Iraq and has nothing to do with weapons of mass destruction, but is about oil, power and influence in the world. By colluding with that, by facilitating the US military build-up, the Taoi<Col N="34" /> seach will have on his hands the blood of the innocent Iraqi people who will undoubtedly be slaughtered.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach now says that 30 aircraft passing through our airports, mainly Shannon, notified that they were carrying munitions of war and were given permission to land. The other 532 aircraft neither sought nor received permission to carry munitions of war. Will the Taoiseach tell the Dáil that those aeroplanes, whether freight or passenger craft, did not have any weapons on board or munitions designed to wreak havoc on people or property?</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 1 to 21, inclusive, and Question No. 99 together.</P>
      <P>In relation to the European Council meeting in Copenhagen in December 2002, I refer Deputies to my statement in the House on 17 December, reported in Volume 559, No. 5, of the Official Report. I also refer Deputies to my reply to parliamentary questions on 18 December, reported in Volume 559, No. 6, of the Official Report.</P>
      <P>I visited Mexico from 13 to 17 January, 2003, repaying the visit to Ireland last November of its President, Mr. Vicente Fox. A business delegation involving 25 Irish companies was organised by Enterprise Ireland in association with my visit. During my meetings with the President, discussion of a wide range of issues took place including consideration of the bilateral relationship, culture, human rights issues and preparations for the summit meeting to be held during the Irish Presidency between EU and Latin American countries. The President and I will co-chair the summit which will be held in Mexico city.</P>
      <P>Throughout the visit, particular emphasis in our discussions was placed on trade issues. Mexico is now Ireland's largest trading partner in Latin America with the annual combined volume amounting to approximately &euro;800 million. I was received at the House of Deputies by the Permanent Commission, a cross-party group representative of both Houses. Our discussions focused on economic co-operation and the forthcoming changes in the European Union. I also had the opportunity to meet privately with the leadership of the two main political parties.</P>
      <P>The principal event of the economic programme was a well attended business breakfast, hosted by Enterprise Ireland. In my address to the breakfast I stressed the opportunities for Mexican firms through investment in Ireland or co-operation with Irish companies. It also facilitated Irish companies in establishing contacts with selected potential business partners in Mexico. Software and language education enterprises were strongly represented. I had the opportunity to meet with several Irish companies of different sizes that have successfully established themselves in Mexico city and the state of Guanajuato. In addition, I met with senior executives of Bancomext to discuss the potential for Mexican investment in and trade with Ireland. Bancomext, the counterpart of Enterprise Ireland, advised me of the strong Mexican interest in Ireland evidenced by the participation of over 300 firms in a recent seminar it organised.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was delighted to meet with many friends of Ireland at a reception hosted in honour of my visit at the ambassador's residence. Although I cannot list now the many guests from all sectors, I would especially mention that I met a cross-<Col N="38" /> section of the large Mexican team which will participate in the Special Olympics in June of this year. I have a strong commitment to developing the excellent relationship that Ireland enjoys with Mexico. We have much in common in our cultures and traditions and there is great scope for our businesses to work together in a complementary way. Mexico and Ireland will work together to be of mutual assistance in market access for the European Union and Latin America.</P>
    <P>The cost arising to my Department from the visit has not yet been finalised. Costs to date amount to &euro;8,892. A number of travel and subsistence claims relating to the visit remain to be submitted. In addition, outstanding invoices in respect of hotel accommodation and other costs, will be forwarded to my Department by the Department of Foreign Affairs in due course.</P>
    <P>With regard to my plans for official visits abroad in the first half of 2003, I will visit the Czech Republic on 30 and 31 January. The visit will coincide with a trade mission organised by Enterprise Ireland. I will be accompanied by the Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment with responsibility for trade, Deputy Michael Ahern. As part of the official programme, I will attend a working lunch hosted by the Prime Minister of the Czech Republic, Mr. Vladimir Spidla. The principal topics of conversation will centre on the accession of the Czech Republic to the European Union and the ongoing work of the Convention on the Future of Europe. In the afternoon, I will have the pleasure of meeting the outgoing President of the Czech Republic, Mr. Vaclav Havel. The evening will be taken up with business related events and media interviews. On Friday morning, following a call on the Chamber of Deputies of the Parliament, I will return directly to Dublin. Minister of State, Deputy Ahern, will remain on for an extra day to attend further business events.</P>
    <P>On 6 February I will visit Lisbon and will meet Prime Minister Barrosa to discuss issues of mutual concern regarding both European Union and international matters. In accordance with established practice, I expect to undertake a visit to Washington for Saint Patrick's Day. On 20 March, I will travel to Brussels to attend the social summit along with the current Greek and future Italian Presidency. The spring European Council, which will also take place in Brussels, will follow the social summit on 21 and 22 March. On 3 April, I will visit Berlin for a meeting with Chancellor Schröder and Brussels for a meeting with Prime Minister Verhofstadt of Belgium. I am scheduled to attend the EU-Africa summit in Lisbon on 5 April. On 16 April, I will travel to Athens for the signature of the treaties of accession for those countries due to become full members of the European Union on 1 May 2004. On 30 May, I am due to travel to St. Petersberg for the EU-Russia summit and on 19 June I will travel to Thessolonika for the Greek Presidency European Council meeting.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="39" />The President of the Convention on the Future of Europe, Mr. Valéry Giscard d'Estaing, will visit Dublin on 26 March. His visit will provide a useful opportunity to discuss the progress being made by the convention, including the recently presented preliminary draft constitutional treaty. The first meeting this year of the National Forum on Europe took place on 14 January and a further meeting took place on 23 January. Six further meetings are scheduled for the period to March. The focus of these meetings will be the ongoing debate on the future of Europe including the work of the Convention on the Future of Europe, currently sitting in Brussels. Two of the meetings will be plenary sessions in Dublin Castle while the other four will be regional public meetings.</P>
    <P>Although there are no plans for a bilateral meeting with Prime Minister Simitis, I expect that we will be in contact as needs arise during the Greek Presidency. I had a meeting with Prime Minister Simitis at the European Council meeting in Brussels in October last and I expect to meet him next March and again during his tour of European capitals prior to the June Council in Thessolonika. I have ongoing contacts with the President of the European Commission, both at European Council and as required. The need for a bilateral meeting is kept under constant review.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny" hpid="Mr. Kenny Mr. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>The grouping of 21 questions by the Taoiseach is ridiculous. Questions relevant to European Union matters should be grouped together separate from questions relating to visits to Mexico. There is to be another European Union Intergovernmental Conference out of which will emerge a further treaty of even greater importance than the Nice treaty. In view of this, how does the Taoiseach propose to keep an open and continuous dialogue with the electorate to ensure it is as properly and fully informed as possible when the times comes for it to decide on the treaty?</P>
      <P>I fully support the repeated claims for extra resources for the Oireachtas Joint Committee on European Affairs and the National Forum on Europe. The forum's budget has been cut by 65%, which means that only three meetings can be held outside Dublin. How does the Taoiseach propose to properly resource the facilities for the convention and the next Intergovernmental Conference to ensure that their deliberations are properly presented to and debated by the electorate so that it can as fully as possible understand the issues involved? I am sure the House would not quibble with allocating the necessary resources. Will the Taoiseach act accordingly?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with Deputy Kenny on this issue which can be addressed in a number of ways. The Forum on Europe will hold at least eight meetings, at plenary and regional level, before Easter. The cost of holding regional meetings is worth it in terms of the benefit they bring. <Col N="40" /> Last year they proved to be very effective and we should continue with them.</P>
      <P>The Oireachtas will have to provide its own resources, including staff, to ensure the proper functioning of its relevant committees. I appreciate the valuable work undertaken by Oireachtas Members in this area, including at the Convention on the Future of Europe. This issue was raised with me previously and I have allocated to those working on the convention dedicated staff, including research staff and access to legal staff. Additional staff resources have also been allocated to the Oireachtas Joint Committee on European Affairs. Requests for further resources are under consideration.</P>
      <P>We are also seeking to increase the number of meetings on European affairs to be addressed by Ministers. Since the start of the year three or four such meetings have been addressed by Ministers and it is my intention to continue with this process. The Minister for Foreign Affairs, the Minister for Agriculture and Food and I have already addressed large meetings where we have presented and explained the issues addressed by the convention. There has also been greater involvement by the media in this process.</P>
      <P>I hope we continue to attract to the Forum on Europe people of interest who are involved in the convention, including Oireachtas Members and others who can advise on the up to date position at the convention. When the convention reaches the drafting stage of a new constitution the public will become more interested, in addition to the specialists who are already closely involved. It is in our interests to keep this issue in the public domain.</P>
      <P>I appreciate the enormous work done by the Chairman of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on European Affairs, Deputy Gay Mitchell, and others and I hope matters will be quickly addressed as they arise. In this regard, the Department of Foreign Affairs is dealing with issues that arise on a weekly basis. This means we can keep up to date with progress. We have resolved most of the staffing difficulties although a few problems need to be resolved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny" hpid="Mr. Kenny Mr. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Taoiseach for his reply and his interest in ensuring that resources are provided to ensure that dialogue in this area is opened up to the wider public. The President of the Convention on the Future of Europe, Mr. Valéry Giscard d'Estaing, is due to visit Dublin on 26 March. Will the Taoiseach consider asking him to address the House as president of the convention in which capacity he has already addressed the French National Assembly? The Taoiseach might give consideration to that.</P>
      <P>What is the Taoiseach's view with regard to Turkey? Was he disappointed with the outcome of the Copenhagen Summit which agreed that there should be a date for examination of whether Turkey had complied with the requirements for entry to the European Union, as distinct from a date for accession to negotiations?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="41" />I do not wish to know whether the petrol cap fell off the jet in Mexico but it was a source of embarrassment to the country and the Taoiseach for him to be at the end of the red carpet and to have a no-show with regard to take off. On a more serious matter, arising from his observations on his Mexican visit&mdash;</P>

      <P>If Deputy Treacy had pulled back the lever he would have got there, but he was going to an important debate in the Dáil and he sits in the back. In respect of the Taoiseach's observation that the cost of a hit of cocaine has now dropped to 30 cent, is he concerned about the possibility of cocaine importation to this country from Mexico by drug barons? Has he brought his concerns to the attention of his fellow prime ministers in Europe; has he issued instructions that security be tightened; and does he propose to issue further resources to drug enforcement agencies and the Garda to attempt to prevent that?</P>

      <P>With regard to Turkey, I am satisfied with the outcome of the summit. Deputy Kenny knows that some people interpreted it to mean that Turkey will definitely get a decision next time but that is not what was decided. It is very much up to Turkey how it progresses, particularly on the human rights issues that confront it. As I have said, the tactics adopted at the European Council backfired on Turkey and it will have to understand that it is not a question of pressure but of complying with the rules that everybody else has to live by. That will be a useful exercise and, as far as I can see, Turkey seems to have accepted that fully. It is now a question of whether the new Administration will implement, as it has stated, domestic human rights measures and deal with outstanding issues regarding Cyprus. We will see what happens in that regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A report was published concerning what was happening on the streets of Mexico with regard to cocaine, and it was a topical issue. There has been a dramatic drop in the price of cocaine and <Col N="42" /> the security arrangements in the UK were very clear when I arrived back in London. There is concern there due to fears that cocaine is coming on flights directly from Mexico, and that this is having an effect on the price of cocaine in the United Kingdom. Obviously, that will have a knock-on effect and I have brought that to the attention of everyone concerned here. It is feared that this problem is coming from Mexico and Colombia. This is creating a security problem in Mexico, particularly Mexico City.</P>

      <P>In areas of Mexico, including Chiapas, the indigenous people still have serious issues with the Mexican Government in terms of institutionalised poverty and violations of civil rights, as have other sections of the Mexican people. Did the Taoiseach meet any of the organisations representing indigenous peoples or civil rights groups? Did he discuss their concerns and raise those concerns with President Fox?</P>
      <P>St. Patrick's Day is only seven weeks away. The Taoiseach has announced his intention of visiting Washington and, presumably, of being the guest of President Bush. The United States may at that time be engaged in a war in Iraq without the sanction of the United Nations Security Council, although just because Russia and China &ndash; great violators of the human rights of their own peoples &ndash; give approval for a war does not make it right. Leaving that aside, in the event of the United States and Britain going it alone, will the Taoiseach cancel his visit to Washington in protest?</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to Mexico and civil rights issues, I agree with Deputy Higgins that many areas of the country have seen abuses. I met some of the political leaders and representatives in Parliament of the indigenous population and those who help fight their causes. A group also came to see me. My understanding is that President Fox is anxious, and is endeavouring to the best of his ability, to implement reforms &ndash; this is not just from what he said but from what others told me. However, he is meeting substantial resistance.</P>
      <P>Mexico has a presidential system where Mr. Fox is President and head of the Administration. He does not have control in Parliament and, as I quickly learned, there is still in Mexico an old regime and people in the system from previous times who are against reform. These people are working to thwart the President and this is very much the issue of concern for the summer elections, in which the President is involved. He is endeavouring to implement reforms and has done a substantial amount. However, from what I heard from other political leaders, members of the media, and human and civil rights advocates, he is unlikely to get the necessary reforms through unless there are changes in Parliament. It is a major issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In so far as it is progressing, the reform programme is fine but I do not want to give the House the idea that the present reforms will work <Col N="43" /> fully. President Fox made it clear to me that he has not got support for many of the reforms he is trying to bring in to help the indigenous population or to stop some of the human rights abuses. As the Deputy knows, there are many security difficulties in Mexico and within the security forces, which are not totally controlled by the Administration. Strange as it seems, that is the reality of the situation.</P>
    <P>With regard to my proposed visit to Washington, I will make no change in the arrangements until I see what ultimately happens at the Security Council.</P>

      <P>Short of the jet breaking down, I presume the Taoiseach will be going. As a matter of no great significance, but for the record, has the Cabinet decided to purchase or lease a new jet?</P>
      <P>Does the recent conversion of the Minister for Foreign Affairs to the importance of the convention mean that the Government is now resigned to whatever comes out of that convention being endorsed by the Intergovernmental Conference without significant change? Will the Taoiseach confirm that preparations are under way for the Irish Presidency and can he indicate any priorities in that area? In particular, is it intended that there will be an accession ceremony in Dublin Castle for the ten applicant states?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no new decision since last year when the Minister for Defence was asked to look at the various options in preparation for the Presidency, That report is awaited. There is no further decision on the question of the jet. I will say no more about it.</P>
      <P>Regarding the intergovernmental conference, I do not think Deputy Rabbitte is saying the Minister was not interested. Since last February the Department of Foreign Affairs and the Minister have put an enormous amount of effort into the Intergovernmental Conference, as have all the members. The Minister does not attend those sessions himself but there are five Foreign Ministers on the conference. Deputy Rabbitte will have seen the objections to people attending the European Parliament for only a short period and that is a contentious matter. The arrangements that have been made and the effort that has been put into this matter are immense.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As time moves on it looks more likely that the Intergovernmental Conference will probably get a final document. That is certainly the intention of the chair and of the member countries. The Intergovernmental Conference is both the political and legal mechanism for dealing with the convention. Therefore, no matter how much work the convention does matters will still have to be put to the Intergovernmental Conference. At present, it is the intention that the Intergovernmental Conference will be a short one. That is not agreed by everybody. There are other elections and other votes. Principally, the Swedish <Col N="44" /> Prime Minister is very anxious not to move into the Intergovernmental Conference prior to Sweden's vote on the currency in September or October, so that discussion will be in June. I suspect that Mr. Giscard d'Estaing will be almost finished his work at the June European Council meeting but we will not know this for certain until Mr. Giscard comes here. The question then is when it will go to the Intergovernmental Conference. It is well known that Prime Minister Berlusconi is anxious to receive the Convention report quickly and to move quickly to a further treaty of Rome. That is his stated position but it is not clear if that will happen.</P>
    <P>We have been working on the Presidency for some months and I believe a ceremony will be organised. A number of discussions are going on regarding what will happen on the May weekend. No decision has been made on that yet but active discussions have been going on since the start of the year.</P>
    <P>At this stage I begin to take up the agenda from the Troika meeting in two months time at the Social Affairs Council meeting. I am anxious to tidy the arrangements around the spring session to try to have social issues discussed at that spring session so that it is not just an economic discussion. The full social agenda of Europe, which can get sidelined at European Council meetings, should move in as part of the plan for Europe to become the strongest and most innovative economy in the world by 2010. I have started discussions and I will formally join the Troika for March in order to start driving that agenda. I have made my views known on this matter. Otherwise I fear that the other European Councils will centre around justice and home affairs and international issues and that the social issues will be pressed off the agenda. That is an issue I am anxious to pursue during the Irish Presidency.</P>

      <P>Regarding the historic enlargement of the EU to 25 states, I understand from what the Taoiseach has said that the Government supports the concept of referendums in all the EU member states on an EU constitution. A conference in Sweden last November considered the possibility of a Europe-wide referendum on the outcome of the Convention on Europe. This concept was also promoted at the convention by my colleague, Deputy Gormley. Has the Government considered that matter and will it be given the active support of the Government internationally?</P>
      <P>In relation to the Copenhagen summit and the agreement to take over the NATO military mission in the former Yugoslav republic of Macedonia, will Ireland participate in this mission? If so, what moneys will Ireland contribute to the mission? Am I right in thinking that the EU budget cannot be used for such a military operation and that the cost must be borne by member states? Will the mission be UN mandated?</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>It will be a matter for every member state to decide on its own referendum process. I do not think there will be a change from that. Deputy Gormley has raised these issues and Deputy Sargent has seen the replies of Germany and other member states that they have their own referendum processes which they will maintain. We may regard these processes as limited but that is their legal position. In many countries unless the competencies of the European Union were to be extended dramatically &ndash; in Germany, for example, if the Lander were being reconstructed by something Europe was trying to do &ndash; there would not be grounds for a referendum. That is not likely to happen.</P>
      <P>Deputy Sargent should raise his second question with the Minister for Foreign Affairs. This question came up in the foreign affairs section of the European Council. The Deputy is correct regarding the budgetary aspect of the matter. However, I was not party to those discussions and I would not like to give Deputy Sargent wrong information.</P>

      <P>During his recent visit to Mexico the Taoiseach placed significant emphasis on increasing trade between Mexico and Ireland. Any increase in trade between our two countries that would be beneficial to the people of both countries is something we would all welcome. Is the Taoiseach aware of the aquiladora industry in Mexico where multi-national corporations are allowed to employ Mexican workers in low wage sweatshop conditions, specifically in the area adjacent to the US border where special supports are in place in order to attract such industry? Given that health and safety standards in these jobs are questionable and that concern about them has been expressed in Mexico itself, will the Taoiseach ensure that trade with Mexico will be based on ethically approved working conditions and that imports to Ireland will not be of goods produced by exploitative employment practices?</P>
      <P>I heard the Taoiseach's earlier response regarding indigenous peoples in Mexico. In speaking with President Fox did he raise the current peace process in the Chiapas region and the need for justice and peace for the indigenous people of that area?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>On the issue of working conditions, nobody would want to see us doing business on the backs of people who have been badly treated. I was not made aware of that. I want to follow the ILO conventions the same as everybody else. Workers in Mexico are paid low wages and the minimum wage per week is $8. A good industrial worker would receive $10,000 per year, while a top class technical person or experienced <Col N="46" /> person would probably get $30,000. The salaries are low. So far as hardships or discrimination against people is concerned, we would not condone that in any way. The Irish companies there are noted for paying their workers better and providing better facilities for them than most of the traditional industries. They set their own example. When I visited the parliament, both Government and Opposition Deputies were appreciative and aware of the Irish companies and had been invited to and engaged with Irish companies in their regions. Our track record on any exports or imports holds up.</P>
      <P>To reply to Deputy Ó Caoláin, I did not go into any particular region. I had been briefed in advance by civil rights and human rights groups here and spoke on those issues as I said earlier. Just to reiterate, in my discussions with Mr. Fox last autumn and my discussions with him this time, he is determined to do all he can to help individuals and the indigenous populations in every way possible. That was part of his electoral platform. He has already been credited for having done much in this area. However, he accepts that he needs to get reform packages through which, for one reason or another, he has not been able to do. I think Deputy Ó Caoláin asked me a third question.</P>

      <P>May I ask the Taoiseach a few more questions arising from his long replies? The EU-Latin American summit is to be chaired by Mexico in 2004 during Ireland's Presidency of the European Union. Given that it is obvious that South America, as an economic entity, holds massive potential in terms of trade and given Ireland's strengthening special relationship with Mexico, are there any specific proposals to avail of that opportunity to bring further trade delegations to South America in general or to countries close to Mexico? Having had the privilege of bringing a number of trade delegations to countries outside the European Union, they pay enormous dividends. Is the Government activity promoting that in the context of the serious competitive nature of Irish business and the difficulties Irish business faces in terms of exports, fluctuations of currency and labour costs in other countries and so on? Has the Government a pro-active programme for international trade missions?</P>
      <P>Can the Taoiseach confirm if there will be a referendum following the next Intergovernmental Conference and, if so, what is the timescale? We discussed this matter previously. Prime Minister Berlusconi wanted it at the end of his Presidency but that is not possible. Is there a more up-to-date view as to when it might be necessary to ask the people to vote on the outcome of that Intergovernmental Conference?</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>To reply to the Deputy's first question, because Mexico is part of NAFTA, which is an enormous bloc, business people clearly see a special relationship with the United States and the other countries in the region and recognise there are very good opportunities for them. Many small Irish companies as well as the big Irish companies such as Smurfit, Kerry, Vision and Altech employ an enormous number of people. There are many small service, education, technical and software companies involved and they see enormous opportunities. Bancomext sees it the other way round, it sees a means of trading into Europe. Mr. Fox, who is of Irish descent and proud of it, is doing all he can through the system to encourage trade into Europe. He spent some time visiting many European countries and will be back in the Netherlands and Germany next week.</P>
      <P>Mexico has centred much of the administration around a bloc of about 300 million people. Therefore, trade delegations are beneficial and we are trying as much as possible with Enterprise Ireland to build up trade delegations, to make them useful and meaningful because they are time consuming. They are costly to the individual companies but as the Deputy has said there is a different attitude to how trade delegations work in other countries. If one is coming to this country with a trade delegation one would probably be suspicious but abroad the opposite happens, everyone opens every door. That is how it operates in a different culture. Perhaps we should change to theirs in 20 or 30 years' time.</P>
      <P>There is no real decision on the referendum yet. It would be difficult to see a convention completed without a referendum. As far as a timescale is concerned, it is a long way off.</P>

      <P>I wish to raise two issues. The Joint Committee on European Affairs and its sub-committee have taken to the boards running which I hope will have some impact when it comes to the referendum in due course. Does the Taoiseach see any merit in the suggestion, which the committee and the forum backed, to run a European week each year? Would he see merit in the Government, through the Minister for Foreign Affairs or the Minister of State with responsibility for European affairs, the forum and the European affairs committee getting together to try to organise such a week? Would the Taoiseach consider attending at the committee, per<Col N="48" /> haps twice a year, in advance of the main EU summits? I know the Taoiseach has a huge workload and I do not wish to add to it but when the time comes for the referendum and putting the case to the people, the more we can show that we have been proactive in doing the business of the European Union, the more we would have the opportunity to be successful.</P>

      <P>When I asked earlier about the Copenhagen Summit I wanted to know if the Taoiseach was aware if any Irish money is to be used in the EU mission in regard to the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia. I am not sure if the Taoiseach is aware of that but perhaps he will find out; I thought he would be aware as he is interested in fiscal matters. In relation to the visit to Mexico I am pleased to hear he raised the problem of cheap cocaine supplies coming from Mexico and flooding into Europe. Has any plan of action been agreed with Mexico to address that problem and, if so, what is it?</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>On the Iraqi situation, the matter is being dealt with at European level by the General Affairs Council. There is almost daily contact according to the briefs I am receiving. I am not sure when the next meeting will take place. It will not be at heads of state level but at European foreign Ministers level. There will certainly be a meeting and the Minister will refer to that this evening. On the European affairs issue, as Deputy Mitchell is aware I have attended meetings previously and I am prepared to be helpful in every way.</P>
      <P>As regards the Mexican situation and drugs, there is obviously co-operation at European level, particularly with the United Kingdom, because of the access. There is huge oversupply in Columbia, Brazil, Mexico and Peru. I am not sure why it has happened this year more than in any other year. It was a big issue when I was in Mexico and I spoke to some of the security people with me. The concern is that those involved will look for more lucrative markets in Europe. It is being dealt with at European level. I made people aware that since December, it has been highlighted through the European justice and home affairs areas. It is a big problem. Apparently, there is also a considerable amount of drugs coming into Europe from other areas. It will be a problem in the year ahead and I am sure the Deputy has seen some of the reports about the price of cocaine on the streets being significantly reduced. Apparently, this is the reason. The real issue is whether we will be able to thwart the main gangs behind this trade &ndash; international gangs across the world &ndash; which have not been thwarted for some years and have been building up this trade. As far as I know, there was no money but I will clarify it for the Deputy.</P>

It is proposed, notwithstanding anything in Standing Orders, that: (1) Nos. 13, 14 and 15 shall be decided without debate; (2) the proceedings on No. 21 shall, if not previously concluded, be brought to a conclusion at 7 p.m. and the following arrangements shall apply: (i) the statements of the Government Chief Whip, the main spokespersons for the Fine Gael Party, the Labour Party and the Technical Group, who shall be called upon in that order, shall not exceed 15 minutes in each case; (ii) the statement of each other <Col N="53" /> Member called upon shall not exceed ten minutes in each case; (iii) Members may share time; and (iv) the Minister for Arts, Sport and Tourism shall be called upon to make a statement in reply which shall not exceed ten minutes.

I know the matter will be discussed in Private Members' time this evening but there is no opportunity for Deputies from any side of the House to ask questions. Perhaps the Taoiseach will give me that assurance. I know it is close to the line, a Cheann Comhairle, but you will not mind on this occasion.</P>

It is unsatisfactory for the Government merely to land an Order Paper on all parties and Members of the House without any prior consultation. I join other opposition party leaders in making a direct request to the Taoiseach to ensure that the House will be afforded the opportunity substantively to address the issue of the impending war in Iraq and his Government's role in facilitating the <Col N="54" /> intent of the United States in relation to the presentation of its armed might within the area.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>My party will oppose this proposal. Before the Christmas recess we sought the traditional Adjournment debate for which two days have customarily been allowed. This notion of a commencement debate was presented as an innovation, yet it ends up that we are being presented with a schedule for today that provides for less than two hours, even given all the matters that have happened since the House was last in session, including major issues that have already been raised here this evening. Will the Taoiseach agree to permit this debate to continue for at least a further two hours tomorrow? We now have to start the Order of Business and there will be little more than one hour for a commencement debate. In addition, I notice that this so-called innovation, which will be sold to the media as a major breakthrough in Dáil reform, is being introduced by the Chief Whip. I have the highest regard for the Chief Whip, but I am amazed that the Taoiseach is not taking the debate himself. If the Taoiseach was serious about the issues that now confront us, he would introduce the debate. Instead of that, the ball is being passed to the Chief Whip and we will have a string of jokes at the end from the Minister for Arts, Sport and Tourism, which were probably written for him in the Bar Library. That <Col N="55" /> is not acceptable, a Cheann Comhairle, so I am asking the Taoiseach to provide additional time tomorrow, rather than calling a vote.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent" hpid="Mr. Sargent Mr. Sargent">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
      <P>In the ordinary course of events, the concept of statements at the commencement of the Dáil would be a natural formality. However, in circumstances where we are facing into an international crisis it shows that the Government is not taking the situation, or the Constitution, seriously. The Order of Business should be reviewed in light of the fact that the Government is complicit in participating in preparations for war against the terms of the Constitution. We need a debate in the House on that.</P>

      <P>In reply to Deputy Rabbitte, this is purely an initiative to put the legislative programme for the session on the record and to outline some of the details behind that programme.

      <P>I am bound to say that was not the understanding on this side of the House. The notion of an Adjournment debate was to review the end of the parliamentary session. The notion, as communicated to me, was that while the Government would not permit an Adjournment debate, it was bringing in this innovation to allow the House to debate national and international issues, some of which have been raised here this <Col N="56" /> evening. We are now being told that this initiative is being taken rather than the customary press conference that has probably taken place outside already in order to keep the Government's 75 spin doctors busy. It has now been reduced to the status of the Chief Whip telling the House what is in the legislative schedule which we have already received in writing. That was not our intention, Sir. If the Taoiseach is not amenable to providing for that kind of debate, then we will oppose the Order of Business.</P>

      <P>My question relates to legislation already passed by this House. I do not know if this has happened before. With the help of the Opposition, the Minister for Health and Children was able to put through legislation dealing with tobacco advertisements and promotions. He has now been put in the position, because he has failed to comply with an EU directive on transparency, where he has to re-introduce this legislation or part of it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach (Ms Hanafin)</NameTxt>
      <P>Tá áthas orm tús a chur leis an díospóireacht seo, nuair atáimid at tosú seisiúin nua sa Dáil and bliain nua freisin. Ar dtús, I acknowledge your impartiality, a Cheann Comhairle, as Chair of the House. My position as Chief Whip means I spend a considerable amount of time here. It is an education few people get to share. It is also an education in parliamentary skills. I would like to pay tribute at the beginning of this session to the impartiality in judgment and fairness that you, a Cheann Comhairle, and the Leas-Cheann Comhairle exercise during debates here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Our role as a parliamentary democracy is one which is very important to us and the people of this country because the right to free political <Col N="64" /> expression has strong resonance in our history. It is a right that countless generations of past patriot have fought for. We are privileged to live in a generation where it is a central tenet of our democracy. The freedom we have as elected representatives to plan, implement and debate here in the Dáil the policies intended to safeguard and transform our nation is one that should never be taken for granted.</P>
    <P>Our national Parliament is a concourse of ideas, the stage of our national debate and the corporeal expression of the national will. What we do in this House, indeed what we are doing now, is an important and timely initiative in offering Members of the House a chance to take stock of what has been achieved, to review progress and set out our legislative priorities for the session ahead. This commencement debate will give us all a platform to debate the direction of Government, to place our views on record and to put forward suggestions in a constructive fashion. It is a new initiative which I believe can be built on and developed over the coming sessions.</P>
    <P>The task of Government is about getting the job done. Our task is to implement the key pledges on which every Member on this side of the House was elected when the Irish people renewed and strengthened the mandate of the Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats. Our policy platform has been endorsed as a blueprint for our future.</P>
    <P>The mandate of the sovereign people is a great honour. It brings with it a great responsibility for public service. An Agreed Programme for Government sets out what we want to achieve. It is not an <i>à la carte</i> menu. It is not something we can just dip in and out of as taste or appetite might dictate. The Government is keenly aware of our solemn obligation to the people of Ireland to implement the programme in its entirety. The legislative agenda I set out today builds on what we have accomplished as a Government since the Taoiseach, Deputy Ahern, formed his first Administration in 1997.</P>
    <P>Over the past five and a half years, the social and economic policies generated by the Government have been responsible for the creation of 380,000 new jobs, the highest minimum wage in Europe, over 90% of which is entirely free from tax, almost 420,000 removed from the tax net, a cut in long-term unemployment by 80%, the most generous social welfare improvements since the establishment of the welfare state with minimum rates of payments up by 43%, record increases in pensions, with the old age contributory pensions up by 60%. The monthly rate of child benefit trebled; the Government introduced &euro;5 billion in personal tax reductions, weighted heavily in favour of the less well-off; there was a 147% increase in health spending and a 77% increase in education spending. These are just the highlights, but the list could go on and on. We do not have reason to be complacent, but we can take a justified pride in our country's progress since 1997. We see our achievements to date as a foundation <Col N="65" /> on which to build even more ambitiously for the future. In the six months since the formation of the current Government, it has continued to work steadily, building on what has already been achieved.</P>
    <P>In implementing the commitments of An Agreed Programme for Government, the Government is progressing the most ambitious legislative agenda in the history of the State. The programme sets out a strong framework for all major aspects of Government activity. It is divided into five major parts and contains 477 specific pledges. Since the Government took office on 6 June 2002, 18 Bills have been published, 12 Bills have been enacted into law and 34 Bills are currently before the Oireachtas. It is anticipated that a further 17 Bills will be published in the life of the current Dáil session. Every Member has received a copy of the Government's legislative programme and the schedule for progression.</P>
    <P>The State has its roots in the republican ethos of cherishing all the children of the nation equally. At the heart of An Agreed Programme for Government is a commitment to people with disabilities. The Government is committed to building service provision and legislative frameworks which enable people with disabilities to fulfil their potential. In particular, the Government is resolved to meet the special education needs of every child.</P>

      <P>The Government will publish a Bill relating to the education of persons with disabilities in this session, following an extensive consultation process. The guiding principle of the Bill is to provide the statutory framework within which the education of children and those who have special educational needs because of disability can be guaranteed as of right. The Bill will also establish a national council for education which will have wide-ranging functions in the area of planning, assessment, service delivery and research and policy development.</P>
      <P>Adequate housing is central to the health and well-being of families and communities. The Government's record in the housing sector since 1997 is unparalleled.</P>

      <P>In line with the commitment in An Agreed Programme for Government, we will continue to implement a multi-stranded approach to addressing housing needs across the spectrum. We will work not only to improve the quantity and quality of houses but to provide a range of housing solutions to meet the needs of tenants. We will publish a Bill in this session containing a full package of reforms in the private rented accommodation sector, arising from the report of the Commission on the Private Rented Residential Sector. The key objective of the Bill will be to move towards achieving a better managed and more professional sector, with improved security of tenure for tenants and greater certainty for both landlords and tenants.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms Hanafin</NameTxt>
      <P>Among the measures included in this comprehensive legislation are the establishment of a private residential tenancies board on a statutory basis, to resolve disputes arising in the sector; improved security of tenure for tenants and graduated notice to quit periods, as recommended by the commission; and rent levels to be no greater than the market rate and reviews generally no more frequently than once a year.</P>
      <P>As pledged in the programme for Government, a Bill dealing with the proceeds of corruption will be introduced, modelled on the proceeds of crime legislation, to further target white collar crime and corruption. A corruption assets bureau will also be established under the legislation. It is hoped that the Bill will be published in the current session. It will ensure that assets acquired through corruption, or the value of which was enhanced by it, can be frozen by the High Court and ultimately seized by the State. The Bill will ensure that we can tackle white collar crime in the same manner as we have tackled other crime through the Criminal Assets Bureau.</P>
      <P>Other legislation that will be published in this session and which will fulfil the promises made in An Agreed Programme for Government include an employment permits Bill, which will provide for a comprehensive, transparent and sound statutory footing in this sphere; a protection of employees (fixed-term contracts) Bill, which will improve employment protection for fixed term contract workers; a local government Bill, which will provide for the abolition of the dual mandate and continue the process of local government reform; and an Abbotstown sports centre authority Bill, which will establish a sports centre authority for the development and management of the Abbotstown project.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This session will also see the introduction into the House of the Finance and Social Welfare Bills, which give effect to the budget day decisions. While not without some pain, the budget was fair and progressive and looks after <Col N="67" /> those who are less well-off. It strikes the right balance between social protection for today's people and today's needs and investment to underpin and secure our economic prospects into the future. In particular, I draw the attention of Deputies to the &euro;10 increase for pensioners; the &euro;8 and &euro;10 increases in child benefit; the &euro;7 increase for widows and widowers under the age of 66, carers and those on the invalidity pension under the age of 65; and the special &euro;11 per week increase for widows and widowers aged 66 and over on a contributory pension.</P>

      <P>The budget also allowed for an increase of &euro;100 in the respite care grant, an increase in income disregards for carer's allowance and an increase of &euro;140 in the employee PAYE credit. I look forward to hearing Labour and Fine Gael Deputies explain why they will vote against the provisions I have mentioned, which are far more generous than anything they delivered while in Government. I also look forward to the Deputies opposite addressing their erroneous forecasts in relation to the public finances. During the last session of the Dáil, we heard much hyperbole from the doom and gloom brigade on the Opposition benches.</P>

Our real difficulties must be put in perspective &ndash; we continue to outpace most of our competitors. While difficulties undoubtedly exist, these are far from the worst of times. The Government is charting the country through difficult circumstances with skill and resolve. It is the Opposition's luxury to have a problem for every solution, but the Government's duty is to achieve real and steady progress. We are doing just that in a way that is economically sustainable for Ireland in the long-term. During this session of the Dáil, we will maintain our unwavering commitment to prudent spending, responsible fiscal policies, debt reduction and fair and competitive taxes.</P>

      <P>The Government will continue to provide strong leadership and to manage this period of uncertainty. Ireland needs to be poised to take best advantage of the inevitable upturn when it comes. Social partnership is a central part of our preparation for the future. We have every reason to remain confident about this country's prospects, as <i>per capita</i> GDP surpasses the European average, the national debt is the second lowest in the EU and the employment rate compares favourably to our EU partners. These achievements have been built on the foundations of social partnership. We have kept our discipline for more than 15 years through national agreements.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin" hpid="Ms Hanafin Ms Hanafin">
      <NameTxt>Ms Hanafin</NameTxt>
      <P>No, but I will tell it to those who are involved in social partnership. It is the best way forward for the country as it involves a collective effort. The country has been transformed by social partnership and that process will continue. Great credit is due to the Taoiseach, officials, the social partners and others who have continued to make great efforts in this regard at a time when the plenary session of this House was adjourned.</P>
      <P>A positive development in Northern Ireland is the Government's great political goal in the coming weeks. I know that it is an important priority for the Taoiseach. In recent weeks and months the Taoiseach and the Minister for Foreign Affairs have been working intensively with the Prime Minister, Mr. Blair, to bring stability to the political process and consolidate the Good Friday Agreement. Naturally, the happenings there will have a bearing on the debates that take place during this session.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is also the case with issues of international peace and security. Ireland has a well-earned reputation as a peace-loving nation and this Government views it as important that we continue to contribute solutions to global problems and play an active role in promoting peace, democracy and human rights in the world. Our <Col N="69" /> Ireland Aid programme will play a full part in countering the growing global divide between rich and poor and help tackle poverty, inequality and exclusion. We discussed earlier, and will discuss again later, the prospect of war. While it is a huge concern, the war is not inevitable and we have a role to play in making every effort to avoid hostilities. The Government will continue the work it began in the past two years on the UN Security Council to promote peace.</P>
    <P>We believe Security Council Resolution 1441 represents a road map to a peaceful settlement. The Minister for Foreign Affairs has consistently made it clear that the Government's position is based on the conviction that all who believe in an international order based on justice and law have to stand up for the authority of the Security Council and for compliance with the decisions it takes, and with the resolutions it adopts on behalf of the UN members. In the period ahead there will undoubtedly be much debate and many developments. In this House we will continue to monitor changing and unfolding events and will be open and flexible to having debates and to allocating time for Members to air their views on the international situation should the need arise.</P>
    <P>As we embark on a new Dáil session, it is fair to say that all of us in this Chamber have an onerous responsibility. We were elected to do a job and to take responsibility for shaping the Ireland we want for ourselves, our communities and future generations. We are an island nation, small in size, with fewer than five million in population, but huge in history and potential for the future. That potential is at last being realised. As Members of Dáil Éireann, we are at the centre of change in our country. We are called upon to mediate the competing aspirations and demands of our community. Our challenge is to shape the aspirations of our people into a credible plan for our future. I am especially proud to be a member of a Government that is making a difference in the daily lives of Irish families and communities. The vision of the Government is to build a fair society on an island at peace with itself. The work of this Dáil session will be driven towards reaching this objective because, as we have set out, this is our ambition for our country, this is our mandate from the people, and this is our pledge.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan" hpid="Mr. Durkan Mr. Durkan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
      <P>I have the utmost admiration for the Minister of State opposite and I know she is a serious-minded person, but I sympathise with her for having to come into the House and deliver that oration, knowing in her heart that it is not serious, that it does not address the issues, that it is not even aspirational, let alone inspirational. It is not her fault, but the one Bill that is missing from the current proposals is one that would ensure access for the public to the services, supposedly provided by the State, that they are now denied. We could go through a whole list of these. One thing the Government achieved was winning the general election. The slogan was &ldquo;A lot done, more to do.&rdquo;  That could now be changed to <Col N="70" />&ldquo;Damage done, worse to come&rdquo; because things have got completely out of hand.</P>
      <P>Let us look at access to services. Remember that we have had five years of unprecedented growth, development and wealth creation. At the end of that, we are seeing a curtailment of services in virtually every Department, some of which seem to have disappeared altogether, and it now appears that the Government is preparing for the next election by cutting off finances in every direction so that it can release them in four or five years' time. That used to be the practice of Fianna Fáil in the past, but we had moved away from that. There was general recognition among all the parties in the House that it was necessary to have some continuity and consistency and that it was better for the economy to be that way.</P>
      <P>There is a crisis in education. It encompasses the size of classes at both primary and secondary level, the degree to which children with special needs can gain access to education, notwithstanding what the Minister said about a second attempt at a disabilities Bill, and school accommodation. Travelling through my constituency the other day, I saw two trucks carrying prefabs for a school, which is about all they will get for the next four years. It is clear that the Government is saving up for the next general election. All the schools, of which I am aware, to which Deputy Stagg referred will either receive nothing or be fobbed off with various developmental stages over the next three to four years. The Minister has no intention of providing anything for them.</P>
      <P>A crisis exists in agriculture and there is no plan for the short, medium or long-term. The Minister goes to Brussels and opposes everything, and then we hobble on to the next crisis and the ones after that. There is no forward planning, nothing in anticipation of the WTO or the competition that will arise from that, and disaster will be the consequence. That is why the agricultural community is protesting. Its members are uneasy about the future and do not know what it holds because the Minister has not made any plans.</P>
      <P>Let us look at what has happened in the fisheries industry. I had to laugh at Christmas when I saw a Minister of State from Donegal coming forward to speak out on behalf of the fishermen and their families. It is up to the Government to deal with it, notwithstanding the fact that the CFP has proceeded in a particular direction. It is within the remit of the Government to seek to improve matters and to pursue these issues with our European counterparts in an effort to protect the interests of our citizens.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I cannot understand why the Minister referred to housing. Last week I experienced something I had never experienced before in my political lifetime. I had to ring the Garda to see if it would arrest a person on some pretext or other because he had nowhere else to go. He is a single male, of a certain age, on the street at night with no place to go, no hostel or rented accommodation. There is no town, city or village at present that <Col N="71" /> does not have homeless people. There are more homeless people in the city of Dublin than there are in the city of London, which has ten times the population of our capital city. I cannot understand what has gone wrong. The Minister mentioned legislation dealing with private rented accommodation. What will that do about providing extra houses? Nothing. The market dictates everything. Once a year is enough for rents to go up because they will go up enough to create the same problem that exists at present.</P>
    <P>I cannot understand how anybody, or any Government, can claim credit after five years for the awful housing situation, not only for applicants for local authority houses but for first-time buyers. Not only are our houses the most expensive in western Europe but we have some of the most expensive in the world. That has never been known anywhere. I do not know what is happening. I cannot understand why the Government does not recognise this. Tax incentives and breaks have been created for people to build houses, but no effort has been made to ensure that they were ultimately available to first-time buyers. That is the snag in all the legislation, and that should be obvious to the Government. In the current market, investors are buying houses as soon as they are built and they are then let at high rents. The people who need homes, including those on middle income, will never get them. People travel 60, 70 or 80 miles a day from Longford and further afield to my constituency and this city because they cannot afford a house anywhere else.</P>
    <P>An access to services Bill in the area of health services would be a great advantage to consumers. Never has more money been hurled, or intervention made, by a Government for any service than by this one on health. The reform of the Eastern Health Board just two years ago introduced a huge number of administrators who were given new jobs. This was supposed to help the delivery of health services but those services have instead become more remote from the people, more expensive and ultimately non-existent. Anyone who has experienced access to hospitals at first hand must have come to the conclusion that the service was better and more efficient 25 years ago and I cannot understand why the Government has been unable to recognise this. We now export patients to Northern Ireland, the UK and France, yet we are supposed to be providing our own health service. It is falling down around the Government. Much has been done but I am concerned about what will be done because, to date, nothing has happened. What is particularly problematic is that this comes, not after five years of zero growth, deprivation or poverty, but after five years of unprecedented growth and wealth.</P>
    <P>The Government has spoken about waste management and the protection of the environment for some years but it has done nothing. In this context, we have heard much talk about flooding <Col N="72" /> and drainage, yet nothing has been done in terms of proposed legislation. We hear about the alleviation of pollution, yet grants that might have helped have been withdrawn.</P>
    <P>I cannot understand the extent to which the rule of law has broken down under the management of this Government over the past five years. The homicide rate is now on a par with that of New York. Ten years ago, the rate of homicides in New York was about six or seven times that in Ireland but, this year, we may well overtake New York in the rates of unlawful killing. Last year, 82 people were killed in New York; we are rapidly approaching that figure now in Ireland and may well exceed it. Hardly a night passes without a fatal shooting, stabbing or beating somewhere in the country. People are afraid to leave their homes and youngsters are afraid to go out at night to socialise. The Minister and his predecessor have been in office for five and a half years and have looked Caesar-like at what is happening around them without making any concrete suggestions about how to deal with it.</P>
    <P>The saddest part is that the Minister of State &ndash; for whom I have the greatest sympathy &ndash; is forced to come into the House and read out a list of so-called achievements on her colleagues' behalf. I know she is a compassionate person and did this out of compassion but I can assure her that their record is deplorable. In the history of the State, there has never been a group of people in Government who managed to talk so much for so long, have so much money at their disposal, make so many promises of a wild and expansive nature but deliver so little at the end. I have no doubt that the intention is to run to the next general election and save as much money as possible. They will cut health services and spending in justice and housing and will go to the country again with those savings. The mothers of Ireland will receive arrears in a lump sum in the middle of the election campaign and there will not be a sports ground in the country that will not receive a grant in excess of &euro;1 million or more.</P>
    <P>The Government has expressed its annoyance at certain things &ndash; the Taoiseach was humiliated recently when the Government jet would not start. Imagine the humiliation when Mr. Blair and the German Chancellor took off in their sleek machines at the first attempt while the Irish delegation had to jump start the jet or, worse still, the Taoiseach had to take an ordinary commercial flight and leave it to the lads to push the jet.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="73" />A lot of damage done and worse to come. I hope that, by the time of the next general election, the outgoing Government does not attempt to repeat the performance of the past five and a half years because on this occasion, the members of the public will be ready. If they are not it will be our fault. I wish the Minister of State well. I assure her that she will get plenty of constructive opposition from Fine Gael and the other Opposition parties but we will prosecute the Government and hold it accountable. We will do so regularly because that is our job and I hope the public will come to recognise that what we have been saying is true and that the only people who pay in the end are the consumers &ndash; the people of Ireland.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>In this commencement debate of a new parliamentary session and in this new calendar year, the Taoiseach ought to commit to requiring the Dáil to sit for a duration more in line with other parliaments. During his tenure as Taoiseach, Deputy Ahern has contrived for the Dáil to sit for the minimum periods possible and the number of sitting days for 2002 was especially lamentable. The tradition of returning towards the last days of January derives from when the budget was published at the end of January. What is the excuse for continuing as if the budget day had not changed? The schedule of Dáil sittings is fixed by the Government, not by the Whips or the Opposition. The Taoiseach would prefer that the Dáil not meet at all and that, unhindered, he could get on with his interminable schedule of openings, launches, international visits, soft interviews and stage-managed sound bites as well as the serious work. The problem is that this style of leadership is diminishing the Dáil and, more importantly, public confidence in and respect for it.</P>
      <P>During 2002 further damage was done by the decision to delay the appointment of the parliamentary committees until the end of the year because it was not expedient from the point of view of internal Fianna Fáil Party considerations. It was a rocky period for the Taoiseach as the more naive backbenchers were taken aback by the breath-taking abandon with which the Government parties shelved their election promises. To hold out the promise of committee chairmanship was a useful weapon to stifle revolt.</P>
      <P>Excuses about the election of a new Seanad do not wash. Why, for example, was the Committee of Public Accounts not appointed last June, given the volume of work to be done? There are no Members of the Seanad on that committee and the backlog of issues was allowed to accumulate deliberately. A functioning, competent public accounts committee can effectively police public spending from a value for money standpoint and expose waste inefficiency and indifferent management. Yet, it was put into abeyance for six months. Why?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Unfortunately, the Government seems intent on continuing as it started. Piecemeal, minimal <Col N="74" /> reforms of Dáil procedure are gradually introduced depending on whether they are judged to be to the advantage of the Government. The settled policy is to sanitise Dáil procedures to the extent that all spontaneity is stifled and Government backbenchers do not even have to show up for the Order of Business nowadays. Public confidence in Dáil Éireann will continue to diminish if it is not seen as a functioning, relevant forum where the Government makes itself amenable and the procedures are such that it can be held to account by the Opposition.</P>
    <P>A calculation is made concerning how many parliamentary questions are likely to be reached on any given day. Then the remaining questions on the schedule are, where necessary, the subject of vague, abridged, obfuscating replies designed, if not to conceal, not to reveal information to the questioning Deputy. This attitude has given birth to tribunals that have provided information, transparency and entertainment, but which have also been very costly. Deputy John Bruton has remarked that if a Deputy wants to keep his views secret, the place to detail them is in the Dáil Chamber. Certainly, the last place in Ireland that the Taoiseach or one of his Ministers would choose to announce a policy initiative would be Dáil Éireann. A parliamentary question can be replied to misleadingly on the same day as the true position is being unveiled at a ministerial press conference by an army of taxpayer-funded spin doctors. It is all calculated to downplay the role of Parliament and boost the image of the Executive and the great populist leader.</P>
    <P>At the outset of a new Dáil session it is appropriate to put down this marker about real Dáil reform, to ask the Taoiseach and his Ministers to show some respect for Dáil Éireann and to begin by limiting the number of 12 hour days and extending the number of sitting days.</P>
    <P>Throughout this session and the rest of the year, the impact of the Government's ill-judged and unsound economic policies will become increasingly clear. It is now well established that Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats, seeking to return to office at any price, perpetrated a massive fraud on the people. The litany of broken promises goes on and on. In the dog days of Christmas week the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform finally conceded that he will not deliver the 2,000 extra gardaí he promised the people. Just last week, the Minister for Education and Science finally came clean on Fianna Fáil's electoral promises to provide a decent schools building programme. Again, the promises were completely empty and fraudulent, deliberately calculated to win pockets of votes in marginal constituencies.</P>
    <P>Let me give an example from my constituency, which is replicated throughout the country. In Kingswood on 26 April, just before general election day, my newest colleague in Fianna Fáil stated the following in respect of St. Killian's primary schools: &ldquo;I recently raised the matter with the Minister for Education and Science, Dr. <Col N="75" /> Michael Woods.&rdquo;  That will not do a lot of good for anyone, as his colleagues in Fianna Fáil know.</P>

Of course, nothing has happened and the schools are not on the schedule. It was a lie and it was replicated several times throughout the country.</P>

      <P>Nowhere are the lies and deceit of the Government more evident than in the health sector. Before the election, a health strategy was launched with extraordinary pomp and ceremony. Once the Government's re-election was secure, the health strategy, like the reputation of the Minister, Deputy Martin, was shredded in favour of an onslaught of cuts and increases in health, VHI, and hospital and drugs charges. The only thing that has not gone up is the desperately low income level needed to qualify for a medical card. While a single person with an income of over &euro;138 per week cannot get a medical card, retired judges, bankers and retired Taoisigh can simply fill out a form and get one. The Government could not even get its sums right in the disastrous handling of the over-70s issue.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, our accident and emergency departments are overloaded and our disability services are underfunded. I could not believe that the Minister came in here this evening and appealed to our republican ethos to demonstrate her commitment to the disabled. Given the protest that she must have seen outside the Mansion House yesterday it is incredible that she could come in here and make a commitment like that and about equality of educational opportunity. She should tell that to Jamie Sinnott and his mother.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That the Government parties have behaved dishonestly is now well known. Apart from the dishonesty of their economic policy, it is also unfair and unsound. The Government manages the economy not in the interests of the people but in the interests of its own political survival. It squeezed public expenditure in the aftermath of the 1997 election to build up an electoral slush fund, as Deputy Durkan has just said. Then it cut taxes for the rich and splurged on public expenditure in advance of the general election. No thought was given to either structural reform or <Col N="76" /> value for money. In doing so, it pushed up inflation and dealt a severe blow to our competitiveness, with not a whisper of concern from the Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment until after the election. We are now seeing the direct result of redundancies, which have doubled in the past two years, and inflation, which will certainly be over 5% this year. Working families pay the price for this mismanagement and suffer the consequences of the rising figures on the live register.</P>
    <P>Now the stop-start cycle has begun all over again. The cuts impose hardship while the war chest is already being amassed for the next election. Again, working families pay the price in higher bills and poorer services. It need not have been like this. In 2002 the Government recorded a current budget surplus of &euro;5.4 billion. A sum of &euro;5,400 million more was taken in than paid out on the day-to-day running of the State. Because the Government is ideologically opposed to public services, it is squeezing the current budget to support capital spending. Its objection to borrowing for capital purposes makes no sense in good times and is even more foolhardy during a downturn. By abandoning the national development plan the Government is causing long-term damage to our economy. What foreign country wants to invest in a country that does not have decent infrastructure?</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach and the Tánaiste, who delighted in running around the country announcing new jobs in times of boom, now have nothing to say to working families who are facing redundancy and short time work. If they do not have the confidence to invest in the economy, how can they expect others to have it?</P>
    <P>Public services are being squeezed continuously. A current budget surplus of &euro;5.4 billion existed, yet we learned this week that severely mentally and physically handicapped people in St. Mary's in Drumcar are living in conditions that are an affront in a civilised country. Working families bear the strain of this Government's failures and of its abuse of power. They bear it in the form of rising prices, higher charges and stealth taxes while dealing with crises in education, health, housing and child care. This Government has made promise after promise to address child care, but nothing of substance is ever done and nothing will be done.</P>
    <P>The Government does not want to take responsibility for anything, but is happy to lay the blame for every problem at the door of a so-called international recession. It wants to go back to the days of the poor mouth when every problem was met with a shrug of the shoulders and the comment &ldquo;Ah sure, we are a poor country&rdquo;. Ireland is not a poor country; it is, in fact, one of the richest in the world with the second highest GDP per capita in the EU. We are not, by any stretch of the imagination, at risk of returning to the dark days of the 1980s as the Taoiseach regularly attempts to suggest. We have the second lowest debt-GDP ratio of any EU country. We <Col N="77" /> are not poor, but we are poorly governed. We suffer from a poverty of aspiration and a paucity of governmental competence. Blaming the international recession for every ill when we have a current budget surplus of &euro;5.4 billion is simply another example of a dishonest Government which will not deal with issues affecting ordinary working families.</P>
    <P>We commence a new parliamentary session with the world on the brink of a war which is to be launched by the United States of America against Iraq. There is nothing in the preliminary report of the United Nations arms inspectors that justifies the headlong dash to a war that could, according to the UN's own estimates, lead to over 500,000 direct or indirect casualties, the outbreak of disease and the displacement of hundreds of thousands of civilians. In light of the reports of the UN's Dr. Blix, it is essential that the inspectors be given all the time necessary to fully discharge the mandate provided to them by the Security Council. It is not possible to develop or test weapons of mass destruction while the UN inspectors are in the country. Ireland should join with France and Germany, the latter of which is about to take up the presidency of the UN Security Council, in their efforts to secure a peaceful settlement of this dispute. Instead, the Government is dissembling and making things up as it goes along, hoping that something will turn up. It gives information only when it is unavoidable and changes that information depending on which Minister is speaking.</P>
    <P>In two months of work, the inspectors have found no evidence of weapons of mass destruction and Dr. Blix has told the Security Council that, on the whole, Iraq has co-operated rather well in the process. While some of the criticisms of the Iraqi authorities made by Dr. Blix are significant and while pressure must continue to be exerted on Baghdad to co-operate, these do not constitute grounds for war. I draw the attention of the House to the statement by Dr. Blix in which he said that the 1991 to 1998 inspectorate achieved results. Dr. Blix stated that the disarmament achieved by his predecessors was greater than that achieved by allied bombing during the Gulf War. Given the manner in which the US and British military is proceeding, there are real concerns that it was always the intention to proceed to war regardless of the findings of the inspectors and irrespective of whether further military action is sanctioned by the Security Council. US disengagement from events in Palestine and its approach to the more unpredictable regime in North Korea is more than a hint that this war is about oil and the strategic interests of the United States. No democratic country has gone to war in recent times other than in direct response to an act of aggression. Launching a massive war over a possible threat from another country will create a very dangerous precedent indeed. Furthermore, as it is put in the current edition of the American journal <i>Foreign Affairs</i>, the United States of <Col N="78" /> America risks alienating those it is most likely to need as its 21st century allies.</P>
    <P>Even though ours is a small country, we must do all we can to ensure that a disaster is averted. The Government should cease to be silent in respect of the drift towards war and join with others in campaigning for a peaceful settlement. Instead, it is complicit in the warmongering. This is evident in the revelation this morning by the Minister for Transport, Deputy Brennan, that he has given US civilian aircraft permission to transport military equipment through Shannon Airport in direct contradiction of the legal and political position adopted by some of his colleagues. It is another aspect of the Government's desire to be closer to Boston than Berlin, as is the Taoiseach's action to have a vital Dáil debate on this issue postponed. The Government says there has been no change in policy and that all Governments have provided facilities at Shannon Airport for US troops in transit to and from the United States of America. This is true, of course, but the circumstances have changed. Facilities which can properly be made available to a friendly nation at a time of peace may not be appropriate when the nation appears to be embarked on a course of belligerent military action without the approval of the Security Council of the United Nations.</P>
    <P>The Irish public is not being told the truth about the full use of Shannon Airport. Figures given out by the Department of Transport suggest that just seven civilian aircraft carrying weapons or munitions were given permission to land at Shannon Airport in the first three weeks of this month, but that a further 19 were given permission last week. This suggests that there has been either an astonishing increase in the number of such aircraft using the airport or that the law and the requirement to seek sanction was being widely ignored. It emphasises the need for some system of inspection and verification of these aircraft at Shannon.</P>
    <P>I draw the attention of the House to the conflict within the Government with regard to the application of section 3(1)(vii) of the Defence Act, 1954, which explicitly states that no person shall, save with the consent in writing of the Minister, enter or land in the State while wearing a foreign military uniform. Deputy Michael D. Higgins tabled a question on this issue before Christmas and was told by the Minister for Defence that the provisions of section 3(1)(vii) of the Defence Act had not been exercised by him in the period in question. On the other hand, I received a letter from the Taoiseach yesterday which told me that the requirements of section 3(1)(vii) of the Defence Act regarding the wearing of uniforms are being complied with fully. The US authorities have been given express permission which allows their military personnel to wear their uniforms in the transit areas of Irish airports. Who is telling the truth, the Minister for Defence or the Taoiseach?</P>

      <P>I wish everyone in the Dáil well in 2003, which I hope is a better year than 2002, the year of the cuts. Earlier, I listened carefully as the Minister spoke about the republican ethos of the State in cherishing all the children of the nation equally. Tell that to the thousands of children who live in poverty, to the children with disabilities who are on waiting lists and to the 38% of the poorest families who feel completely excluded. These families are so disillusioned that they do not vote in elections. We need a republican ethos in this House, but it has to be a radical, civic form of republicanism which protects the poor and the less well off, otherwise we are dealing with empty words.</P>
      <P>We need only look at the figures published over the last few days which demonstrate the lack of disability services, including the lack of support services at St. John of Gods, County Louth, for 250 adults with intellectual disabilities. There are 1,711 families which need full-time residential service, 861 families in need of a day care service and 1,014 who need some form of respite service. Waiting lists for St. Michael's House catalogue 344 people with intellectual disabilities, three of whose elderly parents are terminally ill. If the Government is serious about disabilities, it will introduce a supplementary budget of &euro;20 million to deal with the crisis and emergency cases. The Taoiseach stated that there were only four groups involved in the protest at the Mansion House yesterday. Many parents from Dublin, Cork and Limerick who gave much time and incurred much expense to be there took great offence at these dismissive remarks, particularly those on the waiting lists. I call on the Taoiseach to withdraw those remarks and to apologise to the 1,711 families on the waiting lists for full-time residential services and to the 861 families who need a day-care service. His remarks had nothing to do with civic republicanism and the equal cherishing of all children.</P>
      <P>On the question of corruption, I will strongly support the proceeds of corruption legislation, which is modelled on other crime legislation. This is a progressive step, but once again, I ask that all confiscated finances and wealth be put back into the poorest communities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the North, we must all work hard to ensure the full implementation of the Good Friday Agreement and to tackle sectarianism, which is destroying this country, particularly in the Six Counties. The peace process is like the Irish football team, it belongs to us all and we all have a duty to move it forward each day by demanding equality and an end to injustice. I <Col N="80" /> look forward to helping in a small way to building a new and inclusive Ireland.</P>

      <P>The time for talking is long gone and now is the time for action. A plethora of reports on the health services points fingers but ultimately amounts to nothing. Actions speak louder than words and in this regard the national health strategy has done nothing but increase expectations. It has made no major improvement to the health services. As a doctor working at the coalface of health, I do not want to see today's problems become crises prior to the next general election.</P>
      <P>The Government has overseen the demise of the Celtic tiger. At this stage it does not even tread in parts of my county. In west and north Mayo, where Asahi, Warners and Babygrow have closed and where Bellacorick is due to close, the census of population predicts that by the end of this century not a living soul will remain in the region. Decentralisation, special tax designation status and infrastructure is urgently needed in the region if it is to survive. Today in Ballinrobe, 16 jobs have been lost due to the closure of Ablecrest Limited, leaving 16 families devastated. I urge the Government to act immediately with the IDA to secure a replacement industry for the town. Sixteen jobs may not be a great number, but it is huge for Ballinrobe and will create great hardship.</P>
      <P>Ballina hospital is without any X-ray facility since the breakdown of obsolete equipment, which should have been replaced years ago, as demanded by the Western Health Board. A similar situation exists in Mayo General Hospital, the county's main hospital, where no X-ray scanning is possible. This means that the diagnosis of bowel cancer and other illnesses is not possible in Mayo. The Western Health Board has sought this equipment for months, indeed a year. A sum of &euro;140,000 would purchase new digital X-ray equipment for the hospital which could be of use to the 2,500 people who are waiting for the service. At present, the Western Health Board is reduced to looking for a second hand X-ray machine. What kind of health service is that? I demand that the Ballina machine be immediately replaced.</P>
      <P>The Government should start with the basics and provide a basic health service and employment opportunities for young people and farmers who must leave the land. It got money on the back of the deprived areas in the west of Ireland, including my county, yet we do not have basic services. We must survive and it is only right that we try to do so. It is not asking much.</P>

      <P>Last year, the 28th Dáil met for 26 days while the 29th Dáil met for 41 days, the same number of days that the Dáil met in 1923, the founding year of the State when a civil war took place. That the Government sanctions meetings of the Dáil on such an infrequent basis negates its claim to have a radical legislative programme. To date it has enacted 12 Bills, nine of which passed through the House on the last week of the previous session with the use of the guillotine and most of which were technical in nature.</P>
      <P>The programme presented to the House today is startling in its lack of imagination. The Bills presented do not go near meeting the needs of those seeking the kind of change required in so many areas of Irish life. For example, the decision to reintroduce the Education for Persons with Disabilities Bill with no indication as to when the Disabilities Bill will be reintroduced shows a further contempt of those with disabilities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin" hpid="Ms Hanafin Ms Hanafin">

    <Speaker pid="DanBoyle" hpid="Mr. Boyle Mr. Boyle">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boyle</NameTxt>
      <P>The memorandum for the Education for Persons with Disabilities Bill refers to guaranteeing the needs of people with disability. Has the Government not learned that both Bills fell in the last Dáil because of its unwillingness to recognise the rights of people with disability? The proposed legislation will not address this.</P>
      <P>One additional health Bill is proposed in addition to the three already before the House. None deals with the central question of health provision and the lack of equity for people who suffer from a health service that is more sick than many of those in need of it. Where is the innovation and the radicalism? This is a tired Government. It has achieved what it wanted and is content to be back in office without knowing what it wants to do.</P>
      <P>The housing Bill is an indication that the Government is only concerned in the environmental area with meeting the needs of property over people. It fails to recognise the problems faced by many in our society. The protection of the environment Bill is indicative of the loose way in which the Government uses language. The Bill is not concerned with the protection of the environment, rather it will be a licensing of pollution Bill, in line with all environmental legislation introduced by the Government.</P>
      <P>It is a pretence to suggest that the local government Bill will improve the powers of local government when its only two provisions will be to eliminate the dual mandate, which should not exist and which all Members should give up voluntarily, and to remove the power of people to democratically elect first citizens in their respective local authorities. The legislation does not contain one initiative in terms of improving the power of local government.</P>

    <P>The Dáil is reconvening three weeks after the Westminster Parliament returned from its Christmas recess. In that time members of the <Col N="82" /> Government, especially the Minister for Foreign Affairs and the Minister for Transport, have signed orders without scrutiny or debate in this House on matters that are slowly dragging the country into involvement in a foreign conflagration which the people do not desire and which the world does not need.</P>

He will ignore the fact that the Government will not introduce any significant legislation in this session. While we will get the knock-about debates, the House deserves more than the Cahirciveen chancer routine. We deserve a more significant legislative programme and we need active debate of sufficient length and depth. Unless the Government changes its ways, this will not happen in this session.</P>

      <P>James Connolly once said ruling by fooling is a great British art with great Irish fools on which to practise. The Government has taken a leaf from the British book and is attempting to rule the State by fooling the people. However, there are not as many fools as it might like to think. I doubt that so many people have ever been so disappointed and enraged at the performance of a Government so soon after it came to office. What angers people most is that the Government has been engaged in transparent efforts to deceive them, something they find insulting.</P>
      <P>As we begin this session the real policies, as against those promised before the general election, are clear. The cuts are beginning to bite. On the eve of the commencement, people with disabilities had to protest outside the Taoiseach's launch of the European year of people with disabilities to highlight the savage cuts in the budget allocated to health boards. For example, the budget for intellectual disability services in 2004 has been cut from &euro;38 million to &euro;13.3 million. This cut has been described by the Federation of Voluntary Bodies and the National Association of Parents and Friends of the Mentally Handicapped of Ireland as bringing us back to the mid-1990s.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I said previously, these caring agencies and voluntary bodies will not be able to maintain existing services, let alone proceed with badly needed new developments in this area. It will mean longer waiting lists for day care and respite care, and affect the long-term residential care needs of many, as I highlighted to the Taoiseach at the conclusion of the last term of this Dáil. I also highlight the continuing scandal of some 500 people with intellectual disabilities being detained inappropriately in psychiatric insti<Col N="83" /> tutions. There is no provision to address this scandal.</P>
    <P>Yesterday, on the eve of the commencement, the community platform representing a host of groups working with the disadvantaged and marginalised in our society pointed out at a press conference that there was nothing in the proposed new partnership agreement to address many pressing social issues. The focus of this Government, the employers and, scandalously, the trade union movement is on pay and appears to be only on pay. That is a failure on their part to address what is essential within any proposed agreement, and that is the pressing social needs of many in our society today. Addressing pay alone will not do that.</P>
    <P>While we are talking about the marginalisation of those with particular needs &ndash; the intellectually disabled and others &ndash; let us look at the reality of this negotiation of a new partnership agreement. This Dáil has been marginalised because an agreement will be negotiated and, presumably, concluded without the elected representatives in this House having any opportunity to have an input, which is another scandal.</P>

      <P>We have seen the deception in the Estimates and the budget; the results have been rolling out since then and especially since the Dáil rose on 18 December last, since which date it has not been possible to hold the Government accountable. After the broken promises to extend the general medical services scheme to an additional 200,000 people and to end waiting lists within two years, we have had more crises in the health services. Accident and emergency units are unable to cope with the number of patients presenting and this is at a time when major changes in training practices are imminent and could lead to the closure of accident and emergency units in a number of additional hospitals throughout the country, not only at Monaghan General Hospital where the hospital has been deemed off call.</P>
      <P>I will restate my point because it is crucial. Major changes in training practices are imminent and there are consequences following from that. I asked the Taoiseach on today's Order of Business, with regard to planned and proposed legislation, whether there was any proposal to curtail the scandalous dominance of the representative bodies of the various consultant specialities over the configuration of the delivery of health care services in this State. I cannot get an answer. The referee or full-back on behalf of the Taoiseach prevented a response.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are many issues on which this Government has failed. Regrettably, within the few minutes I have, I will not be able to address them further. While the Government has abandoned so many of the promises and commitments <Col N="84" /> presented in its pre-election programme, I thought, prior to the arrival of the Ministers for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources and Arts, Sport and Tourism, that it had also abandoned Deputy Hanafin who cut a lonely figure on the Government benches for most of this so-called commencement debate.</P>

      <P>When I announced the policy direction with regard to FRIACO and flat rate Internet access, Deputy Coveney, who is not in the House, issued a press release on behalf of Fine Gael condemning the move. The press release was headed &ldquo;Government must not impose policy on new commission&rdquo;. He opposed my efforts to drive communications policy and my efforts to introduce flat rate Internet access until he read the newspapers the next morning. He then saw that my move was widely welcomed, as it still is. At that stage, Deputy Coveney did a complete about turn and issued a new press <Col N="86" /> release applauding the Minister, headed &ldquo;Directive on flat rate to be applauded&rdquo;.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>Well, we cannot all be perfect.</P>
      <P>The commencement of a new Dáil session is an appropriate time to take stock, to reflect on what has occurred in the life of the Dáil to date and to set out the Government's intentions into the future. The primary task of this House is to ensure that the people of this country are provided with the legislation necessary to ensure the orderly running of society, the efficient and equitable management of our resources and the means of fairly achieving legitimate democratic goals.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="87" />Debate, questions and parliamentary scrutiny are hallmarks of democracy. They are the means by which the people ensure that their taxes are being responsibly spent and by which Government accounts to the people. However, they are not the sole tenets of democracy. Informed choice is the essence of democracy. To make an informed choice the people must know not just where the Government stands but also where the various and often contradictory strands of the Opposition stand.</P>
    <P>The legislative programme which the Government has set out for this session is challenging. It builds on the democratic foundations endorsed by the people in the last general election. Then, the largely complementary manifestos put forward by Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats were, to different degrees, endorsed by the Irish people. Post-election negotiations between the two parties resulted in An Agreed Programme for Government and, in turn, were endorsed by this House in its selection of Taoiseach and Ministers.</P>
    <P>That programme for Government represents a blueprint for stability and advancement. Its aims are to consolidate the gains made over the past half decade and to prepare the way for future growth and development. Its aim is to safeguard existing levels of employment and to provide real opportunities for expansion.</P>
    <P>For the past decade and a half Ireland has pioneered the concept of social partnership which has brought economic peace and spectacular growth. It has resulted in many long-term unemployed securing gainful employment and in advances for many of the disadvantaged in society. It is a process which must be continued for the same reason it was started &ndash; to ensure the long-term survival of a vibrant Irish economy and to ensure that the benefits of that economy are shared fairly among all our citizens.</P>
    <P>We have heard much in recent days of the desire of the smaller parties to hold the Government to account. This is a legitimate function of Opposition in a democratic state but I am somewhat concerned that the Opposition parties have a blinkered and limited view of their own role. Democracy is about choice. It is about the people being properly informed so as to enable them to make an informed choice. In order to make a choice the people have to know where the Opposition stands. Criticism of the Government is but one part of the role of Opposition. Postulating viable alternative policies and actions is the other part. For the past five and half years we have had an admittedly fractured Opposition&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan" hpid="Mr. Durkan Mr. Durkan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
      <P>We have a fractured Government as well.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Mr. O'Donoghue Mr. O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;which is high on criticism, often spectacularly ill considered criticism, and low on alternatives. This may continue but if <Col N="88" /> it does it serves both the Opposition and the people of Ireland poorly.</P>
      <P>The Fine Gael Party under the leadership of Deputy Enda Kenny has undergone a period of introspection or, as Deputy Hogan more colourfully put it, of navel gazing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan" hpid="Mr. Durkan Mr. Durkan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
      <P>No, it was Deputy Kenny who said that. Art gives licence but not that much licence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Mr. O'Donoghue Mr. O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>In the aftermath of an election when both its policies and its leadership were decisively rejected by the Irish people, this is not surprising. Deputy Kenny has said this period of introspection is now at an end. Time will tell if he is right but it would be wrong to think that last weekend's gathering represented the end of the process for Fine Gael.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan" hpid="Mr. Durkan Mr. Durkan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
      <P>I like that. The Minister will find out in due course.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Mr. O'Donoghue Mr. O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>If they are to function as a real Opposition party it will be necessary for the members of their parliamentary party to avert their gaze from their navels and focus on their hearts. If today each member of the Fine Gael parliamentary party were asked to state what the party stood for and enunciate what policies it would pursue in Government each would give a different answer. Not alone do people on the Government benches not know what Fine Gael stands for, people on the streets do not know either.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan" hpid="Mr. Durkan Mr. Durkan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Mr. O'Donoghue Mr. O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>This is not because what Fine Gael stands for is a secret. It is because modern Fine Gael does not stand for anything.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan" hpid="Mr. Durkan Mr. Durkan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister used to stand for zero tolerance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Mr. O'Donoghue Mr. O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>Fine Gael is a movement without a cause. Aimlessly it floats backwards and forwards on the treacherously alluring tide of populism, mistaking opportunism for initiative and confusing existence with substance. At one time in the earth's history it was believed that dinosaurs would always exist because dinosaurs had always existed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan" hpid="Mr. Durkan Mr. Durkan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister must be telling his own story.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Mr. O'Donoghue Mr. O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>History has shown that this belief is untrue. Time may show that it is also untrue for political parties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The other fallacy which pervades the flawed view of the role of an Opposition is that it is the role of the Opposition to ask but never answer questions. In a democracy people have a right to <Col N="89" /> information. They have a right to information about the Government, about Government policies and about Government intentions.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan" hpid="Mr. Durkan Mr. Durkan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
      <P>That is correct, and they have a right to know before an election what will be done and to expect it to be done after the election.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Mr. O'Donoghue Mr. O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>However, they also have a right to information about the Opposition, what it has been and is doing and what alternatives it proposes. In short, the people have a right to know who the Opposition are and what, if anything, they stand for. They have a right to know how much the Opposition's policies would cost to implement and how they should be funded.</P>
      <P>In this regard at least the Labour Party, under the leadership of Deputy Rabbitte, has been focused and consistent. It is a party irrevocably wedded to a policy of borrowing. Many in this House and more among the electorate consider this to be a recipe for economic catastrophe and social impoverishment. It was a policy which was fully utilised by the last full-term Government in which the Labour Party participated, the ill-fated coalition of 1982-87. There, the policy of borrowing was so pervasive and its implementation so profligate that the national debt was doubled in the lifetime of a single term Government, a feat never achieved before and, I hope, never to be repeated in the future.</P>
      <P>No lesson appears to have been learned by the new leadership of Labour from the calamitous mistakes of its past.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan" hpid="Mr. Durkan Mr. Durkan">

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>On any issue, be it health, education, social welfare or finance, the Labour Party approach is consistent. The answer is yes, now what is the question.</P>
      <P>Labour is a party either unable or unwilling to take hard decisions. It is a party bereft of practical vision, unable to ascribe priorities to its ambitions.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>Labour, if it wants to be taken seriously as an Opposition party and as a potential component in Government, is going to have to enter the era of responsible opposition. The challenge I pose to those on the Opposition benches for this coming Dáil term is to engage in <Col N="90" /> responsible Opposition, to be honest with themselves and with the people, to spell out their alternative policies and when they would implement them and to state loudly, clearly and without equivocation what their policies would cost and how they would be funded.</P>
      <P>There is no magic attaching to the management of the public finances, only prudence. Every penny spent must be raised by taxation, saved elsewhere or borrowed. It is time the do-it-all and do-it-now Opposition became a responsible Opposition&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan" hpid="Mr. Durkan Mr. Durkan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>

      <P>If the Opposition rises to this challenge, democracy in Ireland will be more transparent and the people will have the information to make real and informed choices about the composition of any alternative Government.</P>
      <P>It is a proper function of Opposition to ask questions. It is also their democratic duty to answer them. Deputy Rabbitte would have us believe that his ambition for this Dáil session is to usurp Deputy Kenny's position as Leader of the Opposition.</P>

      <P>I also await the response to my call for responsible opposition. I await hearing in debate, questions and documents the individual policies of Opposition parties. I await hearing how they will be funded and when they will be implemented and I await hearing their priorities. From now on, the hitherto universal Opposition call of do-it-all and do-it-now will be met with the refrain of, &ldquo;Tell us how and tell us how now&rdquo;. Penny by penny, tax rise by tax rise, service cut by service cut, the Opposition must be forced to engage with reality. I challenge the Opposition for the duration of this Dáil term to compile a schedule of the expenditure it proposes and the reductions it opposes. At Easter let the Department of Finance measure the magnitude of the tax increase necessary to fund its fantasies. I await its response. This Dáil session has the capacity to be provoking and challenging.</P>

The display of posters or exhibits of any kind are strictly prohibited under long-standing rules of this House and such behaviour has long been regarded as being of gross disorder. The reason for the rule is obvious but it is worth mentioning lest its intention is misunderstood. As duly elected representatives of the people in the national Parliament, each Member when given the floor is entitled to have his or her say in a debate in a civilised manner. Any attempt to upstage legitimate parliamentary activity as witnessed today is totally unacceptable and unfair to Members at large and demeaning to the serious work that this House is charged with under the Constitution. I intend to have this matter brought to the attention of the Dáil Committee on Procedure and Privileges and in the interim I fully intend to take whatever action is necessary to uphold the rulings of my predecessors and protect the rights of Members participating in debate in this House.</P>

      <P>&ndash;&nbsp;notes the huge build-up of United States and British troops and weapons in the Middle East in preparation for a war against Iraq;</P>
      <P>&ndash;&nbsp;notes the relentless drive by President Bush and Prime Minister Blair for such a war;</P>
      <P>&ndash;&nbsp;notes that US Defence Secretary Donald Rumsfeld declared on Fox News, there's currently a state of war with Iraq that has not ended' (19 January 2003);</P>
      <P>&ndash;&nbsp;notes the systematic undermining by the US Administration of the work of the UN weapons inspectors in Iraq and the pre-empting by the United States of the provisions of UN Resolution 1441;</P>
      <P>&ndash;&nbsp;notes the statement by Scott Ritter, a UN weapons inspector in Iraq during 1991-98 and a supporter of the US Republican Party, that 90 to 95% of Iraq's previous weapons of mass destruction were verifiably put beyond use during that time;</P>
      <P>&ndash;&nbsp;notes a leaked UN report projecting potentially a large scale and protracted ground offensive, supported by aerial bombardment, giving rise to half a million direct or indirect casualties; a chronic situation in south and central Iraq for 4.2 million children under five and one million pregnant and lactating women, two million internally displaced persons and an unknown number of infirm, terminally ill and elderly; and the devastation of all major infrastructure facilities such as bridges, railroads, electricity supplies and the provision for potable water;</P>
      <P>&ndash;&nbsp;notes that the United Nations sponsored economic sanctions against Iraq have already caused untold suffering among the ordinary people of Iraq, resulting in the premature death of hundreds of thousands of children;</P>

    <P>&ndash;&nbsp;notes the sentiments of the Irish people expressed in an Irish Times-MRBI poll published on 1 October 2002 which found 68% of respondents profoundly opposed to unilateral US action against Iraq and 59% <Col N="93" /> wishing this State to oppose any UN authority for action;</P>
    <P>&ndash;&nbsp;notes the widespread growth of popular opposition against a war in the worldwide protests held on 18 January this year, including an anti-war demonstration in Washington with up to 200,000 attending;</P>
    <P>&ndash;&nbsp;condemns the brutal dictatorship of Saddam Hussein and its suppression of human rights and national and ethnic rights; and</P>
    <P>&ndash;&nbsp;notes the widespread belief that the real motivation for a war on Iraq is the desire of the US Administration to control that country's oil reserves and increase its presence in the Middle Eastern region; calls on the Government to explain why it is:</P>
    <P>&ndash;&nbsp;facilitating the precipitation of a war in Iraq by allowing US military planes to land and refuel at Shannon Airport;</P>
    <P>&ndash;&nbsp;allowing a flagrant breach of the Defence Act 1954 and the Air Navigation (Carriage of Munitions of War, Weapons and Dangerous Goods) Order 1973;</P>
    <P>&ndash;&nbsp;in apparent breach of Article 5 of the Hague Convention (v) respecting the Rights and Duties of Neutral Powers whereby &lsquo;belligerents are forbidden to move troops or convoys of either munitions of war or supplies across the territory of a neutral power'; and</P>
    <P>&ndash;&nbsp;in apparent breach of Article 28.3.1 of Bunreacht na nÉireann, the Irish Constitution, which directs that the State shall not participate in any war save with the assent of Dáil Éireann;</P>
    <P>further calls on the Government to:</P>
    <P>&ndash;&nbsp;apply all possible pressure open to it to prevent an attack on Iraq by the United States or Britain; and</P>
    <P>&ndash;&nbsp;immediately withdraw all landing and refuelling facilities in Shannon Airport for US military planes and any other aircraft carrying US military personnel, arms or munitions that may be used in a war in Iraq;</P>
    <P>and calls for the future of the peoples and resources of Iraq and the Middle East generally to be determined by the people there, based on the principles of freedom, justice, democracy and human rights, free from both local dictatorships and imperialist or corporate interference.</P>
    <P>The use of Shannon Airport by United States planes, military and commercial, carrying thousands of armed US soldiers and munitions in preparation for war surely makes a mockery of Irish neutrality and of our status as an independent sovereign State. We simply cannot claim to be neutral while the Government actively facilitates and effectively subsidises a military build-up by allowing Shannon Airport to be a critical link in what is clearly now an inevitable US-led war against Iraq. More important, it is clear that many hundreds of US planes landed at Shannon during the past year without declaring they were carry<Col N="94" /> ing munitions and in clear breach of our Defence Act 1954 and the Air Navigation Order 1973.</P>
    <P>From the over 500 planes that landed in Shannon last year, the House was told only today that a mere 30 sought and obtained the necessary permission. It was on 17 January 2003 that the United States was reminded by the Department of Transport of its obligations to seek the required permission. We know full well that this happened only as a direct result of the huge protests at Shannon by concerned Irish people. Will the Minister answer the question that the Taoiseach failed to answer today? Why did the Government collude with the United States for the past year in violation of this country's laws? Why were no inspectors sent on board US military planes at Shannon?</P>
    <P>Iraq is already devastated by the massively destructive weapons used by the United States during the Gulf War. Much of Iraq's infrastructure has already been bombed out of existence. Even its sewerage and water treatment systems were destroyed to such an extent that disease has spread causing the deaths of hundreds of thousands of babies and children. Iraq is militarily no longer a threat and the United Nations inspectors should be given all necessary time to deal with any outstanding issues. The United States has said it has information about weapons of mass destruction. If so, why has it not given that information to the arms inspectors instead of undermining their work and treating them with contempt?</P>
    <P>It is clear Bush and Blair are intent on war but what is the real motivation for this impending war? If the United States was genuinely concerned about weapons of mass destruction, then it would be directing its attention to the nuclear threat from North Korea. If the United States was motivated by breaches of United Nations resolutions, then it would have to deal with the state which for far longer than any other has been in breach of UN resolutions. I refer to its own satellite client state &ndash; Israel &ndash; which continues to occupy, terrorise and savagely suppress the Palestinian people in what amounts to a campaign of ethnic cleansing. If the United States was acting in defence of human rights, then Iraq would be just one on a long list of states requiring so-called &ldquo;regime change&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The truth is that the only motivation for this war is oil, and everyone in this House knows it. Iraq possesses the second largest reserves of oil in the world. We only have to look at the report commissioned by the United States Institute for Public Policy entitled, <i>Strategic Energy Policy Challenges for the 21st Century.</i> This report details that America faces the biggest energy crisis in its history.</P>

      <Col N="95" />The report targets the Saddam Hussein regime as a threat to US interests because of its control of Iraqi oil fields and it recommends the use of military intervention as a means to remedy the US energy crisis. Of course, most of President Bush's closest advisers and leaders of his Administration have backgrounds in the US oil industry.</P>
    <P>Shannon Airport is being used as a military tool to assist the United States war machine in its plan to invade Iraq, install a puppet client state and exploit its oil reserves. That is what this war is about. This motion calls on the Government to oppose this preparation for an unjust war by withdrawing landing and refuelling facilities at Shannon from US military planes.</P>

      <P>I welcome this opportunity for a debate on our motion regarding the terrible potential of another Gulf War. This motion is about peace and about trying to prevent the deaths of tens of thousands civilians in Iraq. This debate is not about being anti-American, and I challenge anyone in this House in that regard. The motion is about a group of Irish citizens being anti-war and not anti-American. We are pro-peace, pro-equality, pro-justice and pro-ending forever weapons of mass destruction. This motion is also about Ireland's neutrality and the need for our country to stand up and be counted.</P>
      <P>Let me also commend the peace campaigners at Shannon Airport. I visited them last Saturday, 25 January, to express my support and solidarity. I thank them for their courage, integrity and love of peace. I urge every Irish citizen to support them in their noble campaign. I remind the people that they are being conned by their Government on this issue. It knows all the planes are coming through with weapons. I ask people to stop fuelling the war at Shannon. We should follow the example of the girls from the Loreto College, Swords, who yesterday and today protested against fuelling the war at Shannon. They are a noble group of students and fair play to the teachers and those involved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let me say why I am opposed to the war. A war against Iraq could result in massive loss of life for innocent men, women and children in that country as well as serious casualties among American and other troops. In the 1991 Gulf War, tens of thousands of innocent Iraqi men, women and children were killed or injured and many are still dying as an after effect of that battle. Among the American casualties not only were 148 killed in action, but close to 100,000 are still suffering from the ill-effects of Gulf War ill<Col N="96" /> ness. Some 5,000 British servicemen are also suffering from the same condition. A new war with Iraq could bring massive destruction and pain.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately, the proposed war against Iraq should not be seen as an aberration of Bush's foreign policy; it is an integral part of his preventative war doctrine which would allow the US to go into battle any time and any place he deems appropriate. With the end of the Cold War, people throughout the world looked forward to a century of peace and improved international relations. The Bush doctrine could result in decades of unending warfare and billions of dollars being spent on weapons of mass destruction rather than on human needs.</P>
    <P>Of course, the Americans feel hurt and destroyed by the tragic events of 11 September but they are lashing out at the wrong target. While Saddam Hussein is a terrible dictator, few people outside the White House believe he would launch an attack on America. His country is militarily weak. We, and the Americans, know where he is and if he ever launched an attack, it could be met with overwhelming military force, and he knows that.</P>
    <P>A US-led war with Iraq will increase the likelihood of attacks against Americans and other citizens throughout Europe, particularly in Ireland. When the most powerful nation on earth unleashes a premeditated offensive attack against a poor and relatively defenceless nation killing thousands of innocent people and occupying that country, there will be massive resentment not only among the billion Muslims but also among people in the developing world. Already in the last year, respect and admiration for the US has plummeted in almost every nation. A pre-emptive war against Iraq would increase anti-Americanism and could result in a massive recruitment boost for others. I say this as a friend and as someone who has many relations who live in America. To be critical of American foreign policy does not mean one is anti-American. It is important we understand that and put it on the record.</P>
    <P>If the United States goes to war without UN approval, it will move the world towards international anarchy and a mindset in which all nations will feel free to attack other nations for whatever reason. That is not a good idea in a world in which at least eight countries have nuclear weapons. What moral authority will the US have in calling for peace and negotiations in the Middle East or between India and Pakistan after it launches a major offensive against Iraq?</P>
    <P>I urge everybody to support our motion. This is an historic moment in world history and I urge people to come out strongly against this proposed war.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Cowley</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad to have the opportunity of speaking in support of this motion. It is not every day that one can contribute something to a debate in this House which may have the effect of saving lives. Hopefully, this debate is about doing <Col N="97" /> something to help people. Like you, a Cheann Comhairle, I work as a medical practitioner at the coalface. I am concerned about all that is happening and this major rush to war. It seems to me that we are being rushed along in a mad way towards a conflict. We can all remember wars, including Vietnam, in which so many people died. As well as the fatalities, many more suffered ongoing disabilities to which previous speakers have alluded.</P>
      <P>A war in Iraq will cost billions of dollars but where is the money going to come from and what will happen as a result of its expenditure? Everything in the garden is not rosy: the United States is a very wealthy country, yet it has domestic problems. I wonder what is really happening. We are now hearing what is happening at Shannon Airport but only for the protests there we would have heard nothing. When all this was happening why did we not know about it? What about our Constitution and the right of the Dáil to have a say in these matters? We have been elected by the people and we should know what is happening. These are the questions that disturb me most and I am demanding answers to them.</P>
      <P>I respect America but what standing will the US have if it rushes into a war without UN sanction? I want to know what all this means to ordinary people on the ground. I hope that what I am saying today may help to save a few lives or maybe even a million lives, who knows? We must consider the reports that are emanating from paediatricians in Iraq who have calculated the effects of the Gulf War. Millions of Iraqi children are in a desperate situation, starving as a result of sanctions, but what will it be like after a war? There have been disturbing reports from psychologists in Iraq saying that children are not even talking about what is happening because they are so afraid. Parents are afraid, also, so how can they reassure their children? I have children and I do not know how I would react in such a situation. We should consider all of this.</P>
      <P>There is an obligation on the House to ensure we know exactly what is happening. We are being rushed headlong into a war that will not do anyone any good. It is time to pause.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnGormley" hpid="Mr. Gormley Mr. Gormley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gormley</NameTxt>
      <P>During the debate on the Nice treaty referendum the Government told us the amendment it proposed would enshrine the concept of neutrality in the Constitution. Anyone who has observed the comings and goings in Shannon will know that they were grievously misled by the Government on this issue and, indeed, by other parties. The question we must ask ourselves is what does neutrality mean now. According to the Government in its own wonderfully flexible way, it means exactly what it wants it to mean. It means it can assist the American war effort, that planes with war munitions can land at Shannon, and that uniformed troops heading for the war zone can walk freely around Shannon. So, it is not quite in keeping with the Hague Con<Col N="98" /> vention on neutrality, or with our Constitution and legislation.</P>
      <P>The House has been deliberately misled on these issues. On 26 November 2002, I received a reply from the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Cowen, on the question of arms being carried through Shannon. The reply was deliberately misleading. The Minister sought to give the impression that no arms were going through Shannon but, of course, we now know that this is not the case. We know from a report in <i>The Sunday Business Post</i> that the Minister had at that stage a confidential memorandum in his possession that showed clearly that soldiers were going through and that they required permission under the Air Navigation (Carriage of Munitions of War, Weapons and Dangerous Goods) Order 1973. That is what it said in the newspaper so perhaps the Minister could refute it.</P>
      <P>Only the week before last, the Minister was forced to concede that American troops were indeed carrying arms, but only when he was caught. He knew he had to concede the point because people in Shannon had witnessed it. Last week, the Minister for Transport, Deputy Brennan, granted such permission surreptitiously and retrospectively. This all reveals an unprecedented level of contempt for the House. Perhaps the Minister, Deputy Cowen, might be good enough to tell the House when he granted permission to uniformed US troops to disembark at Shannon under section 317 of the Defence Act 1954. I would like to have a clear answer to that question. The Minister might also wish to tell the House why he continues to refuse to have checks carried out on planes at Shannon. Is he afraid that such checks will reveal that these cargo planes are carrying munitions, as so many people suspect?</P>
      <P>The Government's position on Shannon and Iraq has exposed its dishonesty, duplicity and hypocrisy. In Finland and Austria, both neutral and non-aligned states, no refuelling of US war planes is taking place. France and Germany, who are members of NATO, are displaying more backbone than Ireland. The Government, however, lacks courage and conviction, unlike the peace campaigners in Shannon who have acted out of conviction. I congratulate my Green Party colleagues in Shannon &ndash; Tim Hourigan, Ed Horgan and Mary Kelly, who stood for our party in Donegal and who this evening is sitting in a Limerick jail.</P>
      <P>Recently, a Minister appeared with me on a radio programme and claimed that in international diplomacy there are no principles, only interests.</P>

Has it really come to this appalling vista: when nothing matters only the mighty dollar, where every person has a price and where the definition of integrity is that when one is <Col N="99" /> bought, one stays bought? Is this what the Boston model of this morally bankrupt Government has to offer the country? I have news for the Minister, however. I think he has misjudged and underestimated the public.

    <Speaker pid="JohnGormley" hpid="Mr. Gormley Mr. Gormley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gormley</NameTxt>
      <P>The polls also tell us that the US population will accept war only with a UN mandate. By assisting the American war effort the Minister is complicit in acts of terrorism against the Iraqi people. He will have the blood of innocent Iraqi women and children on his hands. Let us be clear that the Minister does not speak or act in my name and he certainly does not act in the name of the Irish people. The latest survey shows that the majority of Irish people are opposed to this war. That is a fact.</P>
      <P>I make a distinction between the American people and the Government of George W. Bush. In the same way, I make a distinction between the honourable people of Iraq and the tyrant Saddam Hussein. As Deputy Finian McGrath said, we are not anti-American. Mr. Bush is a dangerously simplistic individual, trying to grapple with some of the most complex foreign policy issues that have ever faced an American president. A war in Iraq will destabilise the entire region. It will be very difficult to keep the lid on civil unrest in countries like Yemen, Saudi Arabia and Jordan. In addition, it will also act as a recruiting call to terrorists, not just in al-Qaeda but also in other organisations. The result will be more retaliatory terrorist attacks leading in turn to greater security measures and, obviously, the erosion of civil liberties.</P>
      <P>We are entering a period of prolonged darkness in human history. The cost to humanity, the global community and future generations is incalculable. At a time when we have the capability and resources to solve global poverty, to rid our world of hunger and disease, we are about to embark on a mad and obscene war which will divide humanity on ethnic and religious grounds, widen the gap between rich and poor and squander billions of dollars on weapons of mass destruction.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The greatest challenge now facing humanity is not global terrorism, it is global warming. We know Mr. Bush's attitude to that and to the <Col N="100" /> Kyoto Protocol in particular. This is about vested interests, and Mr. Bush's vested interest in relation to the Kyoto Protocol is oil, as it is in relation to Iraq. One has only to look at the Cheney report which states that the US has to make the security of oil supply a major plank of US foreign policy. To maintain the consumerist lifestyle of the Americans and the West, oil imports in America will have to increase from the current 10.4 million barrels a day to a massive 16.7 million barrels in 2020. That is a lot of oil, a lot of carbon dioxide, a lot of global warming and a hell of a lot of irresponsibility. Can one doubt this is about oil when one looks at the Bush cabinet, Mr. Cheney, Condoleeza Rice, Don Evans and Gale Norton, all of whom have associations with oil companies?</P>
    <P>Despite all this evidence, the Minister for Foreign Affairs, on a radio programme, dismissed the idea that this could be about oil. I listened very carefully to what he had to say and he very quickly jumped to the defence of the USA. The Minister has become very good at jumping. The only question now is, how high? That is determined by George W. Bush. There is something rather pathetic about this self-styled rottweiler now a performing poodle.</P>

      <P>I will show how the Government, not a single person, in this Chamber has misled the Dáil and the people on the use of Shannon Airport and our neutrality. It has been complicit in war preparations in the absence of a UN Security Council resolution. The Taoiseach and the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Cowen, have repeatedly assured the House since early October that they consider the UN to be supreme in these matters and that they will abide by Security Council resolutions.</P>
      <P>Since October, the Taoiseach has insisted that no deal exists to allow Shannon Airport to be used by the US for war preparations. The Government has been very evasive in its answers to questions raised by me and other Deputies as to whether it has offered co-operation to the US in its war preparations. Recent revelations have shown that the Government has allowed Shannon Airport to be used as a pit-stop on the way to war by civilian and military aircraft. The Security Council has not authorised force and any facilitation of the current US-led war is not in keeping with UN Security Council policy. The Government has, therefore, deceived the Dáil and the public about the true position.</P>

      <P>These war manoeuvres have taken place in violation of our laws. The Air Navigation Order 1973 states that it is against the law to carry munitions of war on an aircraft. We now know that this is happening in Shannon. The Air Navigation Order 1952 states that no foreign military aircraft shall fly over or land in the State without the express permission of the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="102" />The Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Cowen, in reply to a question tabled by me on 10 December said that no routine applications for overflights or landing had been refused because the Government had confirmed that the aircraft did not carry arms or ammunition and were not part of a military exercise or operation. Yet, we know these things have happened. The Minister also said that no applications were made for ministerial exemptions of these conditions. If this is so, either the Government has extended permission so that the applications for exemptions are not required or it is in dereliction of its duties in enforcing the law. We deserve full disclosure in this regard.</P>
    <P>The Defence Act 1954 states that no one can enter or land in the State while wearing any foreign military uniform save with the express permission in writing of a Minister. Yet, we have photographs to prove otherwise. They have been printed in all the national newspapers and throughout the world.</P>
    <P>The Government has breached not only that legislation but the obligations of a neutral State as per the Hague Convention which states that belligerents are forbidden to move troops or convoys of munitions of war or supplies across a territory of a neutral power. Article 5 of that convention states that the responsibility lies with the neutral power to ensure this does not occur. This has not happened in the past six months while US troops have used Shannon on its way to war. This has been done without the consent of the Dáil and in violation of Article 28 of the Constitution and is contrary to the spirit of Articles 29.1 and 29.2.</P>
    <P>In response to a question tabled by me on 3 December the Minister reassured me that the Government would at all times act in accordance with its constitutional and legal obligations with respect to the granting of overflight and landing permission, but it has not done so.</P>

      <P>One need only look at the record of this Government and the previous one on neutrality to see the hypocrisy involved. It joined NATO's PfP despite promises to the contrary. It went around the country last year saying it would protect neutrality through the Nice treaty but did the exact opposite as soon as the treaty was passed. It says &ldquo;here, we have our airport and you can use it&rdquo;. Some 250,000 troops travelling to Iraq is no tea party. They do not have a UN mandate because they are not UN soldiers, but are British and American soldiers on their way to war. For a neutral country to allow its airports to be used breaches any definition of neutrality. These overflights and the permission to land and allow our airports to be used for the transfer of munitions must stop immediately. I urge the Government to withdraw any permission it has issued and use its position, whatever is left of it at this stage, to try to ensure we withdraw from the brink of war and try to deal with international conflicts in a peaceful manner.</P>

    <P>&ndash;&nbsp;recognises that the ongoing granting of overflight and landing rights to US military aircraft and the transiting of US military personnel through Shannon Airport is consistent with arrangements going back decades and is being conducted in full accordance with all relevant Constitutional and legislative provisions, most notably the Air Navigation (Foreign Military Aircraft) Order, 1952, the Air Navigation (Carriage of Munitions of War, Weapons and Dangerous Goods) Order, 1973 and section 317 of the Defence Act, 1954; and</P>
    <P>&ndash;&nbsp;welcomes the commitment of the Government, in the event of military action being initiated against Iraq, either with or without further UN sanction, to review the situation with regard to overflight and landing facilities and to initiate a debate in this House.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I will speak shortly about the current situation with regard to Iraq. Before doing so, however, I wish to deal with comment and speculation on current arrangements to allow for access to Shannon Airport by transiting US military aircraft and personnel.</P>
    <P>Let me begin with the historical and geographical background. Ireland's geographical position places it on the main flight path between North America and Europe. Shannon was initially developed as a refuelling point for transatlantic flights, when limited aircraft range obliged most aircraft to touch down in Ireland when travelling to and from the US.</P>
    <P>For many decades, military aircraft of various nationalities have been refuelling at Shannon or, as aircraft ranges have extended, overflying Ireland on their way to or from North America. There has also been a practice, again going back <Col N="105" /> decades, for civilian aircraft carrying US and Canadian military personnel and civilian staff to refuel at Shannon on their way to and from various bases around the world. Shannon has continued to be popular because of its efficient and friendly service. This business has brought jobs and income to the wider Shannon area and generated revenue for Aer Rianta.</P>
    <P>The fact that these connections developed should come as no surprise to anyone. Ireland is not a military ally of the United States. We are not obliged to the United States by any mutual defence commitment. Ireland and the United States are good friends, and these good relations are obvious. We are bound to America by close ties of blood and history. Irish men and women found prosperity and a future in the United States when Ireland could offer them nothing. These men and women helped make the United States what it is today. Ireland's recent prosperity and the staunching of the haermorrhage of emigration is party due to US investment. Our newfound peace is in no small measure due to the support received from successive US Administrations, Congress and private interests. These facts do not make us a military ally of the US, nor do they require us to uncritically support US foreign policy. They are factors which no responsible Irish Government, conscious of the interests of the Irish people, would wish to ignore.</P>
    <P>The practice of facilitating the overflight and landing of US military aircraft and personnel dates back to a time before many of us in this House, including myself, were even born. This practice continued throughout the Cold War, and all the conflicts, wars and upheavals of the past 50 years. It has been maintained under successive Governments, comprising various political parties. Claims that this Government has adopted a new policy which undermines Ireland's traditional policy of military neutrality are nonsense. They are nothing more than political opportunism.</P>
    <P>Let me now explain in full the details of the arrangements which apply, and the steps I initiated last September to improve the implementation of these arrangements. These improvements have been introduced with the full co-operation of the US authorities. I will deal first with military aircraft.</P>
    <P>The legislative basis for control of military overflights and landings is the Air Navigation (Foreign Military Aircraft) Order 1952 which prohibits foreign military aircraft from flying over or landing in the State except by the express invitation or permission of the Minister for Foreign Affairs. Successive foreign affairs Ministers have routinely granted permission on condition that the aircraft is unarmed, that is, not carrying arms, ammunition or explosives, not involved in intelligence-gathering and not engaged in military exercises. It should be noted that these conditions are policy stipulations applied at the discretion of successive Ministers and not legal requirements. Under the 1952 order, the Minister for Foreign <Col N="106" /> Affairs has full discretion in the granting of permission to foreign military aircraft to overfly or land in the State, which is the legal position.</P>
    <P>The arrangements for granting permission for the landing of foreign military aircraft are the same for all countries. The embassy of the country concerned is required to submit a written request, via a third party note, in respect of every landing. In almost all cases, this will include confirmation that the aircraft carries no arms, ammunition, explosives, photographic or intelligence gathering equipment. After consultation with the Departments of Defence and Justice, Equality and Law Reform, my Department, if satisfied with the application, issues a written response by third party note to the embassy concerned granting permission for the overflight. Any request for a landing by a military aircraft carrying munitions would be examined particularly closely.</P>
    <P>Many of the landing requests relate to refuelling of VIP transports, which are military airplanes. In the case of the US, there are also a substantial number of cargo planes, which we are informed do not carry munitions.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnGormley" hpid="Mr. Gormley Mr. Gormley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gormley</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister does not know that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>The same procedure and conditions applying to landings of military aircraft generally apply to the granting of permission for overflights of military aircraft, that is military aircraft flying through sovereign Irish airspace but not landing in Ireland. In other words, permission must be sought and granted for the overflight of every military aircraft.</P>
      <P>There are two categories of exception to this rule. First, there is a group of 17 countries which has at different times over a long period of years, been granted blanket permission for the overflight of military aircraft on condition that they give my Department advance notice of the details of each flight. If they give us advance notice of the details of each flight, there is no requirement for a confirmatory note from us.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The specific arrangements that apply to the United States regarding overflights were agreed in the exchange of letters in January 1959 between the then Minister for External Affairs, Mr. Frank Aiken, and the US ambassador. Under this agreement, the US is granted blanket permission for overflights of unarmed military aircraft. The terms of the permission specify that the aircraft be unarmed, carry only cargo and passengers and comply with the navigational requirements and flight patterns specified by the Government of Ireland under the International Civil Aviation Organisation. The blanket permission includes a stipulation that the permission will be subject to reconsideration in the event of a serious deterioration in the international situation. In exchanges between the embassy and the Department of External Affairs, which preceded the exchange of letters, &ldquo;cargo&rdquo; was defined generally as &ldquo;support supplies&rdquo;, for example, food, clothing and household equipment. The US <Col N="107" /> Embassy provides regular post hoc statistics of overflights, broken down by month, which is totally in compliance.</P>
    <P>Requests for overflights by US military aircraft carrying munitions are extremely rare. I understand that internal US guidelines make clear that Ireland does not generally permit the overflight and landing of armed military aircraft. At my direction, officials of my Department have reminded the US authorities that advance permission must be sought for every flight not meeting the usual conditions.</P>
    <P>Another point needs to be made in relation to the overflight and landing of foreign military aircraft. On 21 September 2001, the Taoiseach, with my full agreement, announced that the State would facilitate military aircraft operating in pursuit of UN Security Council Resolution 1368 by waiving the normal conditions that apply to the granting of permission for landings and overflights by such aircraft &ndash; that they be unarmed, carry no ammunition or explosives, not be involved in intelligence-gathering and not engaged in military exercises. Deputies will recall that in this resolution, the Security Council classified the terrorist attacks of 11 September 2001 as a threat to international peace and security and called on all states to work together urgently to bring to justice the perpetrators and organisers. In the event, no request seeking to avail of this waiver has been received. The US has continued to follow standard procedures, notwithstanding the availability of this exemption from normal requirements.</P>
    <P>The arrangements in relation to civilian aircraft are the responsibility of the Minister for Transport, but I will address the matter on behalf of the Government with a view to providing a complete account of the present arrangements. Civil aviation standards in force internationally are governed by the provisions of the 1941 Chicago Convention, to which Ireland is one of the signatories. Article 35 of the convention states that &ldquo;no munitions of war may be carried in or above the territory of a State in aircraft engaged in international navigation, except by permission of such State&rdquo;. The provisions of the convention came into effect in Ireland through the Air Navigation and Transport Act 1946, which made provision for the making of ministerial orders to give effect to the terms of the Chicago Convention.</P>
    <P>Sections 6 and 7 of the Air Navigation (Carriage of Munitions of War, Weapons and Dangerous Goods) Order 1973, which was amended in 1989, prohibit the carriage of munitions of war, including weapons and dangerous goods by aircraft overflying or registered in Ireland. In this context, &ldquo;munitions of war&rdquo; includes weapons and ammunition designed for use in warfare and ammunition and parts thereof on an aircraft in or over the State. Under section 5 of the order, as amended, and in the context of a specific aircraft operation, the Minister for Transport is empowered to exempt a specified <Col N="108" /> aircraft from this prohibition to allow for the carriage of munitions of war. The requirement for an exemption does not apply to munitions of war carried on board aircraft registered in another state where munitions of war may legally be carried to ensure the safety of the aircraft or persons on board, for example, weapons carried by authorised air marshals or bodyguards. Any civilian aircraft seeking to land or overfly the State requires the permission of the Minister for Transport to carry, military weapons or munitions. Civilian aircraft carrying unarmed troops are treated as normal passenger freight and do not require special authorisation to overfly or land, aside from permission to wear military uniform. As I have indicated, under the 1973 order carriers of troops accompanied by arms are obliged to seek exemption from landing and overflight prohibitions.</P>
    <P>It came to the notice of my Department during the course of a review of arrangements, initiated at my direction, that US troops travelling by civilian aircraft were often accompanied by their personal weapons, a matter to which I referred in a recent statement. The US authorities made clear that such weapons are not loaded, are normally stowed in the hold and are not taken off aircraft while on the ground in Ireland and that troops are issued with ammunition only on arrival at the ultimate destination. It was pointed out to the US authorities that the airlines concerned were nevertheless obliged to seek the permission of the Minister for Transport to carry such weapons and ammunition and the Department of Transport wrote directly to the carriers concerned reminding them of this requirement. The civilian carriers involved are now routinely submitting advance information on side-arms and any other military cargo to the Department of Transport to facilitate compliance with the terms of the 1973 order. This accounts for the reported rise in the number of authorisations issued by the Minister for Transport for the shipment of so-called &ldquo;munitions of war&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>We are not talking about large scale movements of heavy munitions, but the personal weapons of the soldiers on board and limited quantities of ammunition for the weapons. I am informed that the practice of troops being accompanied by their personal weapons and limited quantities of ammunition is not unusual and has sometimes been followed by contingents of the Defence Forces when travelling abroad on overseas missions. Some 43 overflight exemptions to the 1973 order for overflights of civilian aircraft carrying munitions were granted between 11 September 2001 and early January 2003. The only permission for the landing of a civilian aircraft carrying munitions granted during that period involved the delivery of munitions to the Defence Forces.</P>

      <P>We stand on the brink of a third Gulf war, the consequences of which, if it takes place against our wishes, could be very grave. Apart from the horrific human suffering that is likely to accompany the outbreak of war, there is a risk of destabilising an already volatile region. Support for terrorism could grow and economies may suffer.</P>
      <P>The Irish Government does not wish to see war take place. We have raised our voice and used our influence in every forum available to us to urge the need for a peaceful solution. We are determined to discharge our international obligations, both in trying to avert conflict and in carrying out the decisions of the Security Council.</P>
      <P>Ireland's approach to this crisis is based on our long-standing commitment to international peace, justice, security and stability upheld by the rule of law, peaceful settlement of disputes and respect for human rights. These are the principles which have informed Irish foreign policy under successive Governments ever since the foundation of the State. Ireland is a strong supporter of the system of collective international security set forth in the United Nations charter. We regard the United Nations as the centre of this system of collective security. We attach particular importance to the role of the Security Council as having primary responsibility for the maintenance of international peace and security. In carrying out its duties under this responsibility, the council is acting on behalf of the entire membership of the United Nations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="113" />Under Article 25 all members agree to accept and carry out the decisions of the council. This is a clear obligation on all states. Iraq's continued defiance of the lawful decisions of the Security Council is a challenge to the authority of the council and the legitimacy of the post-war international order. It undermines confidence in the rule of law and the efficacy of international arms control regimes. This defiance is ultimately as much a threat to international security as is the possession of weapons of mass destruction. However, the possession of these dreadful weapons is the immediate threat which must be dealt with. There should be no doubt that possession alone, regardless of whether there is a proven intent to use these arms, is a real and intolerable threat, as well as being banned by international treaties. There is nothing abstract about this. The Iraqi regime has initiated two major wars and used chemical weapons against both enemy soldiers and its own people.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>Iraq has done all in its power to thwart the efforts of arms inspectors and to conceal its weapons holdings and programmes. The regime has spent vast sums of money, diverted a great part of its national effort and subjected its people to severe deprivation rather than co-operate sufficiently with inspectors. The people of Iraq have suffered as a consequence of UN sanctions. Some countries, including Ireland, have striven with limited success to reduce the impact of these sanctions on the most vulnerable elements of society. The Iraqi authorities could have ensured the lifting of sanctions by co-operating with the inspectors. Instead, they sought to use the sanctions as a propaganda tool, disrupting revenue flows to the oil for food programme and failing to concentrate contracts on areas of greatest humanitarian need. UN reports confirm this. They blatantly sought to buy political support for the ending of the sanctions by offering contracts to foreign oil companies. They sought the dismantling of the sanctions regime without complying with the resolutions of the Security Council. What is the purpose of this determined and reckless stand, if not to intimidate and perhaps once again coerce their neighbours and those who stand against them?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The authority of the Security Council must be upheld. Kofi Annan has said: &ldquo;All states have a clear interest, as well as a clear responsibility, to uphold international law and to maintain international order.&rdquo; He could not have been more direct when he said last September: &ldquo;If Iraq's defiance continues, the Security Council must face its responsibilities.&rdquo; This has been clear from the beginning. In the debate which took place in this House on 24 July 1946 when Ireland decided to apply for membership of the United Nations, Eamon de Valera stressed that Article 25 contained a serious obligation and went on to say that &ldquo;we should be bound to take whatever action <Col N="114" /> the Security Council should decide upon, and to participate in the enforcement measures . . . &rdquo; He then commented on the difficulties which would be created for the effectiveness of the UN where &ldquo;nations want to have it both ways. They want to have the advantages of collective security and of avoiding obligations.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Ireland long ago reached the decision that it would live up to its responsibilities as a country proud to be a member of the United Nations. We took this decision on grounds of principle, acting on the belief that nations can order the conduct of international relations so as to deter aggression and remove threats to international peace and security. We also adopted this course on the grounds of national self-interest, knowing that the safety and prosperity of small countries in particular require an international order based on justice and law and respect for the less powerful.</P>
    <P>The United Nations is a body committed to the maintenance of international peace and security, but it is not a pacifist organisation. The Security Council is empowered under Chapter VII of the charter to determine the existence of any threat to the peace and to decide what measures are necessary to restore international peace and security. These measures may include the use of force where sanctions and other means of pressure have failed. No one is under any illusion that military action provides a desirable solution. On the contrary, force must be used only as a last resort when all other means have been exhausted. Ireland very much wants to see a peaceful solution to this crisis. This is why Ireland, together with our fellow members of the Security Council, made such an effort to agree Resolution 1441 on 8 November last. This resolution was adopted unanimously by all 15 members of the Council, including Syria, an Arab state and Iraq's neighbour.</P>
    <P>The resolution brings the entire issue of the use of military force back within the framework of the United Nations. It gives Iraq a final opportunity to demonstrate that it has rid itself of nuclear, biological and chemical weapons as it has been required to do by successive Security Council resolutions. It is designed to avert war. However, the resolution makes it clear that Iraq will face serious consequences as a result of its continued violations of its obligations. In other words, the risk of war can be avoided if Iraq complies fully with the terms of the resolution. The decision is in Iraq's hands. The resolution sent the arms inspectors back into Iraq with a strengthened mandate to complete their task. It requires Iraq to make a complete and accurate declaration of all holdings of prohibited weapons or programmes to develop them and to co-operate fully in the implementation of the resolution and with the arms inspectors. If Iraq should fail to meet these conditions, then the Security Council is to convene immediately to assess any alleged material breach of Iraq's obligations, to consider the situation arising, and to decide upon any <Col N="115" /> further steps necessary to bring about full compliance with its resolutions.</P>
    <P>The resolution does not specify that a further resolution is required to authorise the use of force. This would simply not have been acceptable to either Britain or America, both of whom hold veto power on the council, and was not attainable. These two countries have long held the view that earlier Security Council resolutions already mandate the use of force and that no further authorisation is required. There is no international legal consensus on the validity of the different interpretations. There is no definitive position of the international community on what is still a hypothetical question. Regardless of the legal arguments which have been advanced on both sides, Ireland considers that there is an overriding political need for the Security Council to determine whether its resolutions have been breached and to take a further decision on what measures should be adopted in response.</P>
    <P>Resolution 1441 makes clear that any material breach of Iraq's obligations will come before the Security Council for consideration. We hope that this will inhibit the use of force without a further decision of the council. Deputies will recall that in the months before this resolution was adopted, there was a widespread expectation of unilateral use of force by the United States among some commentators. Today the issue is still before the Security Council and efforts continue in the council to secure a peaceful solution in line with the terms set out in the resolutions. War can be averted and is not inevitable if Iraq divests itself of its weapons of mass destruction now.</P>
    <P>Nevertheless, the Government's amendments to the motion before the House make clear that in the event of military action being initiated against Iraq, either with or without further UN sanction, the Government, having reviewed the situation, will initiate a debate in this House on the position to be adopted by Ireland. All of us in this House hope that military conflict can be avoided. It has to be said, however, that there is still some considerable way to go before this danger can be averted. On 7 December the Iraqi Government submitted its declaration on weapons of mass destruction to the Security Council. Two days ago, the arms inspectors made a report updating the council on the progress of inspections. The report delivered by the head of the International Atomic Energy Agency, Dr. El Baradei, was fairly positive and took the view that Iraq does not have any current nuclear weapons programme. However, he did cite the need for more active Iraqi co-operation with the inspectors.</P>
    <P>The report delivered by Dr. Blix, head of UNMOVIC, the main weapons inspection body, was far less positive and raised a number of serious questions. He pointed out that Resolution 1441 required Iraqi co-operation to be immediate, unconditional and active. He then made it clear that such co-operation had not been forth<Col N="116" /> coming. Dr. Blix reported in his own words that &ldquo;Iraq appears not to have come to a genuine acceptance &ndash; not even today &ndash; of the disarmament which was demanded of it and which it needs to carry out to win the confidence of the world and to live in peace.&rdquo; He went on to say that &ldquo;Iraq has decided in principle to provide co-operation on process, notably access,&rdquo; but that &ldquo;[a] similar decision is indispensable to provide co-operation on substance.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>He then listed a whole series of areas where the Iraqi declaration is incomplete or Iraq has failed to produce evidence to support its claims that it has destroyed weapons or that they are absent. He pointed out that it was for Iraq to produce credible evidence to this effect and not for the inspectors to prove the contrary. Among the discrepancies he listed were 6,500 chemical bombs containing 1,000 tonnes of chemical agent, holdings of VX nerve gas precursors, quantities of anthrax and 650 kilograms of bacterial growth media sufficient to produce 5,000 litres of concentrated anthrax as well as numbers of Scud missiles and further missile development. Iraq's account so far is simply not believable and that is not acceptable. The arms inspectors are not in Iraq to play hide-and-seek with the authorities. They are there to verify that Iraq's claims to have disarmed are true and can be demonstrated. It is not the inspectors' job to search for evidence of Iraqi wrongdoing and deception. It is for the Iraqis to prove they have in fact done what they claim to have done. The Iraqis were known to be in possession of well-documented quantities of weapons. Where are those weapons now? The sums have to add up, and Dr. Blix has made it clear that as of now they do not add up. Instead there are glaring discrepancies.</P>
    <P>The Iraqis are not being asked to do the impossible. They are being asked for normal documentary proof or, failing that, simple human testimony that they have actually destroyed these weapons. They cannot expect the rest of the world just to accept their word without a shred of evidence that these weapons have been destroyed. Nothing Iraq has done merits such trust. It is deeply worrying that Iraq is not prepared to co-operate actively with the inspectors as it is required to do under Resolution 1441. This is not new, however.</P>
    <P>Regrettably, the record shows that the regime in Baghdad responds only to the threat of military action in the face of further non-compliance. For that threat to be credible, it has to be real and visible. When Deputy Gormley says that I have blood on my hands, to which I take grave exception, he should know that Kofi Annan, the Secretary General of the United Nations, who has done more than any other individual to prevent war, has made the same point. Only two weeks ago, he said:</P>
    <P>I would want to make a distinction between pressure and the threat of use of force and the actual use of force. I think there is no doubt in anyone's mind that the pressure has been effec<Col N="117" /> tive, has worked, and without that pressure, I do not think inspectors would be back in Iraq today.</P>
    <P>The military build-up in the Gulf has to be seen in that context. If Deputy Gormley is not prepared to say that Kofi Annan has blood on his hands, he should not claim I do when I say the same thing.</P>
    <P>We have all heard what the President of the United States had to say in Washington yesterday. Even those who disagree with him should be able to recognise his determination. War is avoidable but the plain fact, evident to all except the leadership in Baghdad, is that Iraq will no longer be allowed to evade its disarmament obligations. Anyone, however well intentioned or motivated, whose positions have the effect of encouraging the Iraqi leadership to believe it can evade its disarmament obligations serves only to increase the likelihood of war.</P>
    <P>I expect arms inspectors to be given more time to test the willingness of the Iraqi authorities to co-operate fully and proactively with them. We consider that they should be given as much time as they reasonably consider to be both necessary and useful. It is clear that the inspections will not go on forever in the absence of progress, nor was this envisaged. It should be for the Security Council to make a determination as to whether the exercise continues to be worthwhile. It is for Iraq to respond truthfully, effectively and promptly.</P>
    <P>The Iraqi leadership pretends it can do nothing to stop an attack. This is not true. Saddam Hussein still has time to defuse this conflict by accepting the rule of law and accounting for his extraordinary discrepancies in the record of Iraq's weapons holdings. It is time for him to end the evasion and special pleading, if not for the sake of the United Nations, for the future and well-being of his people.</P>

      <P>When Resolution 1441 was agreed by the United Nations Security Council, including Ireland, few voices, if any, were raised here against multilateralism, that is United Nations solidarity. The difficulty I have with the motion before the House is that it makes no mention of multilateralism, that is approved UN action against the Iraqi regime. In his paper, Iraq, Consequences of a War, Paul Rogers of Bradford University sets out the possible consequences of a war with Iraq for the civilian population. The <Col N="118" /> paper, which was forwarded to Members by Trócaire, is graphic and horrifying. No Member of this House wants to see such consequences.</P>
      <P>The way to prevent such consequences in Iraq or anywhere else is to have good order and democratic institutions whose authority is respected and upheld. The UN, with all its faults, is such an institution. We cannot expect others to be bound by UN resolutions if we, in turn, will not be bound by them. Eleven million people signed a petition in Britain in the 1930s seeking appeasement of Hitler. The number of people who support or oppose an issue does not indicate the rightness or moral worth of such an issue. If the UN passes a new resolution authorising attack against Iraq we in Dáil Éireann must have our say as to whether we will authorise the use of facilities here for such an attack. Let us be aware, therefore, that we cannot have it both ways. The day may be coming when we will be asked to decide.</P>
      <P>If, however, unilateral action by the United States supported by Britain is taken, I have no hesitation in proposing that Dáil Éireann denies facilities such as refuelling and overflight. This brings me to the current use of Shannon Airport. Much has been made of US soldiers bringing arms and weaponry with them via Shannon. Is this really relevant?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government's usual doublespeak on this matter has been appalling. If US troops go to the region, they may have the effect of preventing war or Saddam Hussein may get or be given the message by his own people. Alternatively, if the UN sanctions attack against Iraq, those troops may be used to carry out a UN mandate. We will certainly not be volunteering to carry out that UN mandate. What is the message to Saddam Hussein? Have we not read Dr. Hans Blix's comments, as reported in Tuesday's edition of <i>The Irish Times </i>which states:</P>
      <P>Iraq does not accept UN disarmament. Iraq has failed to account for 6,500 chemical bombs. There are strong indications that Iraq has produced more anthrax than declared. There is evidence that Iraq has weaponised VX nerve gas.</P>
      <P>There is no mention in the motion this evening about those quotes from Dr. Hans Blix.</P>
      <P>Speaking in the Dáil on 23 October 2002, I said:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="119" />The attitude taken by the United Nations towards the Iraqi dictatorship on its activity is one of the most important items on the international security agenda and may well become the most important. As the attitude of the public on the first Nice treaty referendum has shown, it is no longer acceptable for the Government to make decisions of such vital importance without the authority of the people as expressed in the Oireachtas and, specifically, in Dáil Éireann, given the role which Bunreacht na h-Éireann reserves to the Dáil.</P>
    <P>I went on to set out the key five measures of concern:</P>
    <P>First, unilateral action against Iraq by any state is not acceptable. Action, if taken, must have multilateral support and must be authorised in the appropriate way through the UN Security Council. I was alarmed to read recently in a survey that a sizeable proportion of the Irish population is not only against unilateral action, but is also against multilateral action, even if duly authorised through the United Nations. This is an untenable position for Ireland to hold.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeHiggins" hpid="Mr. J. Higgins Mr. J. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>No, it is not.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GayMitchell" hpid="Mr. G. Mitchell Mr. G. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>I stated that Ireland should support a UN resolution in relation to weapons inspections in Iraq. That has been adopted as Resolution 1441. I said:</P>
      <P>If this resolution is not adhered to Ireland should participate in the debate on a further resolution, setting out the action to be taken by the UN to meet such failure. We cannot have it both ways and this approach will allow us to explore, to the maximum extent possible, all other avenues before considering the authorisation of military intervention.</P>
      <P>The second point I made was in relation to independent verification. I said:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was interested to note the Blair dossier on Iraq which was presented in September to the British Parliament. That dossier contained some information that was already in the public domain and made various claims. These claims include that Iraq: continues to produce chemical and biological agents, has military plans for the use of chemical weapons and has command and control arrangements to use them; has tried covertly to acquire technology and materials which could be used in the production of nuclear weapons, has sought significant quantities of uranium from Africa &ndash; despite having no active civil nuclear power programme that would require it &ndash; has recalled specialists to work on its nuclear programme and has constructed a new engine test stand for the development of missiles capable of reaching parts of the EU. These are British claims and must be treated with some caution <Col N="120" /> but if they are correct and can be verified they are of the first concern.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeHiggins" hpid="Mr. J. Higgins Mr. J. Higgins">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GayMitchell" hpid="Mr. G. Mitchell Mr. G. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>I continued:</P>
      <P>The concerns being expressed by the US and British Governments are grave. To assist the Dáil in any consideration we may have to make in support of Ireland's stand at the UN Security Council, the Government should seek to independently verify the claims being made and make such independent verification available to Dáil Éireann. The sources for such independent verification could be the common foreign and security resources of the EU; its support structures and information gathering facilities; the United Nations itself, where our representatives have access to representatives of all countries, large and small; our resident embassies abroad; and non-governmental organisations and churches which have their own network.</P>
      <P>The key question for Europe now is whether it decides its response on the basis of co-operation or otherwise with the US unilateral action or whether we are prepared to take a role as a regional organisation in contributing to world security under the auspices of the United Nations.</P>
      <P>The third point I made was that we must make it clear that we stand with civilised states against demagogues and dictators. In particular, we must remember the enormity of what happened on 11 September 2001 in the United States and the ongoing campaign of terrorism, as demonstrated in Yemen and Bali, and perhaps attempted more recently in London.</P>

      <P>Terrorism can only be reduced and eliminated if the injustices off which it feeds are tackled and ended. The Oireachtas Joint Committee on European Affairs has set up a group under David Begg, the general secretary of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, to look at this issue. I hope it will be a Presidency priority for us next year.</P>
      <P>We must stand up against anti-Americanism. When we wanted US intervention on this island we got it. The United States played a major part in bringing about the Good Friday Agreement and in bringing peace to this island. It has over the years welcomed our emigrants and its businessmen have invested heavily in our country, providing much employment. I am not suggesting that we should be beholden to or blinded by the US, nor am I suggesting that we should be bought by it. However, we should be fair in our assessment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Srebrenica was not sorted out by the neutral countries, such as Ireland, or even by the EU; it <Col N="121" /> was sorted out by NATO, led by the US while cowardly, self-serving European and Irish politicians spoke in the most hypocritical and unpardonable language imaginable.</P>

      <P>Not even the atrocities of Srebrenica moved them from their self-serving and self-satisfied outpourings. They asked where the crowd was going and how they could get ahead of it faster than anybody else.</P>
      <P>The fourth point I made was that we need an independent assessment of Ireland's and Europe's security and defence needs. This will not come about as a result of courageous leadership in this House because we have, in the main, been cowed into outbidding each other by eulogising neutrality to the advantage of politicians while denuding the people of even the most basic capacity for self-defence.</P>
      <P>Prior to 11 September 2001, the American public was quite cosy about the fact that its internal flights lacked any form of real security. It found out to its horror it had to pay for it. We are similarly cosy about our neutrality. However, unlike other neutral states, we are not prepared to defend our neutrality and therefore we are probably the least-defended state in Europe. If we knew a plane was taking off from anywhere within or without our jurisdiction and was to be used to target either a facility within the State or a facility outside it, such as Sellafield, which would have disastrous consequences for us all, we would not have the capacity to deal with it, even if we had notice in advance. We are soon to have the second highest income <i>per capita </i>in an EU with 27 members but our Government has failed to do its first duty, namely to provided for the security of its citizens. That is the issue we should be debating tonight. An appalling lack of leadership has been demonstrated.</P>
      <P>I called on the Government to appoint a committee of wise persons to examine independently the security needs of Ireland and Europe and to report directly to the Dáil, not the Government. Such a committee should examine the role Ireland should play as one of the architects in bringing about a security architecture in Europe which meets our concerns and needs. We have been running away from this issue for far too long. It is an issue of urgent public policy and concern and should be addressed without further delay.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The European Union should consider what its contribution should be to Iraq when, at last, it is freed of the dictatorship of Saddam Hussein. The Iraqi people were forced in recent months, in a so-called referendum in which they had to show their votes publicly, to fully endorse Saddam Hussein. Is this the action of a free people? The three main elements of Iraqi society &ndash; Sunni Muslims, Shiite Muslims and Kurds &ndash; are kept together within the Iraqi borders by a mixture of cajoling and oppression. Succession from any <Col N="122" /> state has serious implications for neighbouring states. Succession from Iraq could have serious implications for Turkey and Iran and other parts of the region.</P>
    <P>The EU is already heavily involved in the Middle East and is trying to bring about a settlement between the Palestinians and the Israelis. It should now be examining ways and means to assist Iraq in the event that Saddam Hussein falls. That should not be left to the Americans and should be well under way.</P>
    <P>I hope that the five points I set out last October will be and have been given consideration by the Government and that when the time comes, as it likely will, for a decision to be made by Ireland on the role of the UN in Iraq, we will be in a position to make an informed one based on reason, good judgment and the rule of law. All we have had so far are statements on Iraq. We need to be able to question our Government so our deliberations and decisions are informed. I have repeated the five points I made last October because I want to remind the Government of Fine Gael's concern. Furthermore, what has the Minister done to address these concerns? What information and advice does he have for the House?</P>
    <P>I call on the Government to respond to my five points. It has had three months notice. I want the Minister to make himself available for a question and answer session so these issues will be addressed in the House. These are matters that run to the heart of the constitutional role of Dáil Éireann. Fine Gael has set out in the motion before the House the issues it believes must be addressed by the House.</P>
    <P>I was more than surprised by the last point in the Minister's amendment, which seems to indicate that he is moving away from the multilateralist policy he has been espousing in recent months and is open to asking this House to support unilateral action. That support will not be forthcoming from my party.</P>

      <P>I thank Deputy Gay Mitchell for sharing his time. As the Member of this House who resides closest to Shannon Airport, I have a special interest in what has been happening there. I am totally against war, as is the majority of people in Ireland and the US. However, the refuelling of military and commercial flights has been part of Shannon Airport's business for many years. This is because it is located on the eastern Atlantic seaboard, and refuelling has helped build up our airport and the local economy to what it is today. About 40% of the airport's business is depending on refuelling.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I accept that there has been a substantial increase in US military flights in recent times, but 35 other countries have had military aircraft refuel in Shannon in 2001. This is a very complex issue for the people of Clare and the surrounding areas and it is not as straightforward as people claim. Stopping the US military planes refuelling, as some people demand, will not solve the prob<Col N="123" /> lem. Sixty percent of the industries in the Shannon free zone are American. This was brought to my attention by the many phone calls I have had from constituents whose livelihoods depend on the jobs provided by these companies.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Breen</NameTxt>
      <P>One should also look at the potential damage this could do to US-Irish relations. We must recognise the good work done by former President Clinton in the Northern Ireland peace process. I agree that the Americans should abide by the air navigation Acts. I believe the Minister, Deputy Cowen, should have instructed US commercial carriers to comply with Irish law much sooner than he did.</P>
      <P>I am worried by the many breaches in security in Shannon Airport in recent times and as late as this morning when &euro;500,000 worth of damage was done to a United States aircraft. I condemn this, as should every Member of the House, because if we do not we are encouraging others to do damage as well.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Breen</NameTxt>
      <P>Furthermore, I am delighted the Minister has said he will improve security at Shannon Airport because that is what is needed. Last week we were informed of 15 people who breached security at a US military base in England. While security cannot be fully guaranteed, I suspect that it will be increased at the airport. Transferring refuelling facilities to another European location will not prevent the anticipated war on Iraq. What is happening at Shannon Airport is not breaking the UN resolution. Every effort must be concentrated on giving the UN inspectors extra time in Iraq and to push the Americans into co-operating under a UN mandate. The EU can play a very important role in preventing a war. Shannon must not be used as a pawn.</P>

      <P>I am grateful for the opportunity to raise the matter of the disastrous closure of the Square D factory in Ballinasloe two weeks ago. I bring to the floor of the House the enormous anxiety and fear shared by the almost 400 people who have lost their jobs and face the dole queue in a couple of months' time. I must tell the Minister that there is great anger in Ballinasloe where people in the town and its hinterland genuinely believe that the Government has let them down. No amount of camouflaging can disguise <Col N="124" /> that. The Celtic tiger boom was a time of unprecedented job creation, but not alone did Ballinasloe not attract industrial jobs, over the past five years it lost almost 1,000 jobs, beginning with substantial redundancies in the local psychiatric hospital. Just over two years ago a further 350 jobs were lost at the AT Cross factory and this latest news sees almost a further 400 watch their employment disappear before their eyes.</P>
      <P>I question the sincerity of the Government and the Tánaiste's intention to bring an industrial project to the town. The Tánaiste is a native of the area and this matter has been put to her on numerous occasions over the past five to six years without result. I also question the sincerity of IDA Ireland. Since the closure of the Digital factory in Galway seven or eight years ago, there has been a massive explosion in the number of new industrial jobs created in the city, but not one has come to Ballinasloe. It is very difficult to understand why some industrialists could not be convinced to locate in a town which has an excellent workforce, swimming and leisure facilities, an excellent golf club, excellent shopping facilities, a new marina and inexpensive housing relative to Galway and Dublin. The town has a mainline railway station and excellent primary and postprimary schools.</P>
      <P>Whatever the reason, the Government seems to want to turn its back on Ballinasloe, but it was there last week that I saw the biggest public meeting I have ever seen in any town in the constituency in all my years in politics. Thousands of people came out in a spontaneous response to what they see as the death of their town. The crowd included the workers, their families, community leaders and politicians. Everybody who has anything to do with the well-being of Ballinasloe was in the town square the other night.</P>
      <P>The people of Ballinasloe feel very angry on another level and I ask the Minister of State to relay that to the Government. While the Government says it has no control over industrialists, although I do not believe that in so far as IDA Ireland is concerned, it is within its power to decentralise. When the Government announced its national spatial strategy before Christmas, Ballinasloe was omitted for some unknown reason. On one side, Athlone was looked after and Galway was taken care of on the other, but Ballinasloe was ignored. There is a new unity of purpose in Ballinasloe and the various bodies and authorities are welded together with a common aim under the county manager, Donal O'Donoghue. Everything that can be done locally will be done, but Ballinasloe must receive outside help from the Government to ensure that it gets an anchor industry to replace what has been lost and to give some hope to the people who have lost their jobs in Square D and AT Cross.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government will have an opportunity when the decentralisation of Departments is announced to make sure that, for once, Ballinasloe is not overlooked. It will not be able to hide on this because it is within its remit. We do not <Col N="125" /> want something small, it must be a substantial section of a Department.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCallananFF" hpid="Mr. Callanan Mr. Callanan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Callanan</NameTxt>
      <P>The announcement of the closure of Square D came as a huge shock to Ballinasloe and east Galway. I sympathise with all 385 workers of Square D who constituted a great workforce. Square D was a great factory. I also sympathise with the management of the company who are also unemployed. They provided excellent jobs at the factory for 31 years &ndash; my wife was employed there for ten years.</P>
      <P>I express my thanks to the Tánaiste for meeting a deputation from Ballinasloe last week, every member of which was encouraged by her promise to get each Department, IDA Ireland, Enterprise Ireland, the County Enterprise Board and FÁS to help to provide employment for the town. The loss of 385 jobs comes after the closure of AT Cross one and a half years ago, a company which employed more than 300 workers. These losses have the same effect on Ballinasloe as the loss of Digital had on Galway some years ago.</P>
      <P>The town needs help, but we do not intend to lie down and die. Ballinasloe has much to offer. It is situated on the N6, 40 miles nearer to Dublin than Galway. It has great hotels, a marina, new educational facilities and a new swimming pool and leisure centre which has almost been completed. Houses are good value, there are no traffic problems, there are 80,000 square feet of factory space at Square D and a workforce which is prepared to adjust and train to suit other employment. The AT Cross factory is also lying idle and there is a new IDA Ireland business park. Ballinasloe is ideally situated for decentralisation and I appeal to the Minister for Finance to transfer a worthwhile Department to the town. The people of Ballinasloe will welcome civil servants.</P>
      <P>I call on the Tánaiste to redouble her efforts to bring new industry to the town and to help other employers there to expand. A number of small industries in the town are hoping to grow with her help and the enterprise centre in the town is doing great work. Ballinasloe should get extra incentives to attract new industry. There is no point putting more industry into cities which are choked with traffic when Ballinasloe has so much to offer. As a local Deputy, I call on everybody to work together to promote and market the town to attract new industry and decentralisation. I compliment Galway's county manager, Donal O'Donoghue, and Ballinasloe town council who have brought together all the agencies in the area to promote the town. Together, we will ensure Ballinasloe returns to prosperity.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children (Mr. T. O'Malley)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Deputies for raising this matter on the Adjournment. The announcement by Square D on 15 January 2003 to close its Ballinasloe plant by the end of June 2003 with the loss of all 387 jobs on its books cannot be described as anything other than <Col N="126" /> a body blow for the workforce, their families and the local community. It is very much a priority for the Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment to ensure that everything possible will be done to find new investment and new sources of employment for Ballinasloe, although I know this will not be an easy task.</P>
      <P>Established in 1971, the Ballinasloe facility manufactures the Square D brand of electrical circuit breakers, sold primarily within North American markets. The closure decision, according to the company, reflects significant change in market demand for circuit breakers, resulting in over-capacity in manufacturing operations at the group's North American division. A number of the group's North American manufacturing operations have already been moved to Mexico.</P>
      <P>In an effort to lessen the impact of the closure, the North American division of the parent company, Schneider Electric, has stated that it is committed to working with IDA Ireland and the Irish authorities to find manufacturing firms that are interested in the Ballinasloe plant and may be in a position to offer suitable job opportunities to a well-qualified workforce; assist Ballinasloe employees obtain new jobs; provide out-placement assistance and job search training; provide counsel and information to employees on company-paid benefits; and provide five weeks severance pay per year of service, in addition to statutory redundancy entitlement. The agencies under the remit of the Minister and her Department are also working to lessen the impact of the closure. IDA Ireland has been aware of the difficult market conditions being experienced by the company for some time and began to intensify discussions late in 2002, when it became apparent that the company was in difficulty. The IDA has already brought one potential client to view the plant and will continue to explore other possibilities as well as seeking out other potential clients.</P>
      <P>FÁS, the national training authority, has already been in contact with the company and is to meet the company management with a view to offering its services to all staff. FÁS will register people as job seekers, provide career information and guidance and carry out a training needs analysis. It will provide a range of training courses which will be designed to meet the skills needs of individuals to enhance their employability, while also providing the area with a skilled workforce. Enterprise Ireland began discussions with the company last week to discuss supports for any possible start-ups by local senior management.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The industrial development agencies were working hard in Ballinasloe, prior to the closure announcement. The IDA was already active in the promotion of Ballinasloe for new inward investment, with the key focus being on providing international standard property solutions in the town to attract new companies. In light of the closure of Square D, the IDA has now finalised plans and a planning application has been lodged with Galway County Council for a new 27,000 sq. <Col N="127" /> ft. technology unit on the IDA's 30 acre business park in Ballinasloe. When planning permission is granted, construction will be undertaken by private developers and the IDA has already begun to actively market this facility together with promoting the Square D facility in the town.</P>
    <P>Enterprise Ireland has approved funding of &euro;120,000 for the work in progress at the community-owned enterprise centre and it is understood that there is still some space available for potential projects. The Galway County and City Enterprise Board has been actively involved in industrial and community development in Ballinasloe. During 2002, considerable progress was made with the area community development group with &euro;63,000 allocated to the small business development park, which now houses four start-up businesses. Over the last three years Ballinasloe has received &euro;350,000 in support from the county enterprise board.</P>
    <P>At Galway-Mayo Institute of Technology and Galway university, there are enterprise platform programmes with places available for staff of Square D who might have an idea to start up their own manufacturing or internationally traded services businesses. This programme affords the opportunity to develop business plans and to carry out market research for ideas before actually starting a business. A similar programme is about to commence in the Athlone Institute of Technology.</P>
    <P>In regard to development in the Galway area, it is significant that five new IDA investment supported proposals, announced in 2002, will ultimately provide almost 2,200 new high quality jobs in the health care and internationally traded services sector. The companies concerned are Abbott, Churchill, Medtronic, Micros and Net IQ. Recognising that urban environments are generally more attractive for mobile investments, the IDA has adopted a target of having 50% of all new greenfield investment located in the Objective One region. It has sought to encourage investments in defined sectors to specific regions, which seeks to build on the relative advantages in different towns. An essential part of this endeavour has been the refining of IDA property offerings. This is a key tool in winning investments.</P>
    <P>The IDA has, and is continuing to design and develop, high quality business parks, fully serviced up to international standards. In Tuam, the IDA has acquired 27 acres and is currently carrying out site development works after which it intends to have a high quality facility provided by the private sector. At Loughrea it is upgrading land to make it more marketable. In Gort it has a 20,000 sq. ft. high quality building which it is actively promoting for suitable projects.</P>
    <P>While the IDA is convinced that it has excellent quality property solutions in the larger towns in the county, it is also cognisant of the slower inward investment climate that has prevailed for the past two years. This also has had an impact on jobs in existing client companies. Much pro<Col N="128" /> gress has been recorded over the past several years in many of the companies that have been attracted here, in the shift up the value chain in many of the companies and in many aspects of our competitiveness.</P>
    <P>Costs are a big issue for all companies. They have moved out of line with our competitors, and this impacts heavily on lower technology businesses. Hence, the IDA has a major emphasis on the health care and internationally traded services sectors. There is now a well developed health care cluster in the west region, especially in Galway, which includes companies like Transition Optical in Tuam, StarGuide in Oranmore, Medtronic, Boston Scientific and Abbott in Galway city.</P>
    <P>Working with the third level institutes in the area, Enterprise Ireland has approved &euro;2.6 million for the development of campus incubator units at Galway/Mayo Institute of Technology in Galway and &euro;695,000 for units in the National University of Ireland, Galway. Some &euro;2.54 million has also been approved for the development of units at Athlone Institute of Technology. These incubation centres support the development and expansion of campus company activity, encourage and support the commercialisation of research and development carried out in the institutes of technology and embed the institutes of technology as major supports for the development of high-tech companies in the regions.</P>
    <P>All of the State agencies under the auspices of the Minister's Department will continue to work closely in the interests of developing Ballinasloe. The Minister has met with many of the Ballinasloe interest groups and hopes to do so again in the near future, to reassure them of her ongoing commitment and that she will continue to work on their behalf.</P>

      <P>The Minister for Health and Children must act as a matter of urgency to address the severe staffing shortage at St. Mary's residential care facility at Drumcar, County Louth, and to ensure that the residents at the centre have all the personnel and other resources they need to live with dignity and safety. As I speak, thousands of people, including the families of over 250 people with physical and intellectual disabilities resident at Drumcar, are sick with worry about the welfare and safety of their loved ones. The consultants' report published yesterday highlights the unacceptable conditions which exist for many residents in Drumcar as a direct result of understaffing. Understaffing leads to inadequate supervision, inappropriate mixing of residents with very different abilities and disabilities, including very aggressive individ<Col N="129" /> uals with passive and introverted individuals, the overuse of restraints in some cases, the leaving of some residents locked up and unattended at night, and increased risk of mortality from fire.</P>
      <P>We can only imagine the distress to the people concerned, the residents of Drumcar, because they cannot articulate it. However, we are aware of the distress to their relatives and friends. This afternoon I was contacted by two sisters from County Cavan, in my constituency, whose brother is a resident in Drumcar. Their aged parents are infirm and in their twilight years, yet they have again been visited with the deep anxiety which never leaves the parents of people with severe disabilities, but which is alleviated by the care and concern shown in facilities such as that in Drumcar, when they have the proper resources to provide that care.</P>
      <P>My brother, Dermot, who has Down's syndrome, spent many years as a resident at St. Mary's and our family has great appreciation and admiration for the religious and secular staff of dedicated carers. I emphasise that in raising this matter I am in no way critical of the staff and management of St. Mary's &ndash; quite the opposite. They are a dedicated, hard working, committed and well trained staff, eager to deliver an excellent service to the residents. However, they are prevented from exercising their skills to the full because staff shortages often mean they can only carry out essential duties.</P>
      <P>The joint report of 1066 Consultancy and Healthcare Consultancy identifies clearly that the problem in Drumcar is caused by inadequate levels of staffing. Fr. Fintan Brennan-Whitmore of St. Mary's has accepted the findings of the report. I ask the Minister if he in turn accepts the recommendations of the report and the crying need for additional staff, and if he will act on them. When will the resources be provided to allow St. Mary's to engage the 30 additional staff for night duty necessary to deal with the serious and dangerous situation at night time? When will the 64 extra staff required for St. Mary's be provided to ensure a safe environment during the day?</P>
      <P>I must point out that the Department of Health and Children approved the engagement of the independent consultants who produced the report. These consultants have an international reputation and were engaged by the Minister for Health and Children last year to advise on the nursing crisis in the accident and emergency services.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am informed that for the past two years the St. John of God order has contracted the whole time equivalent of 23 nursing staff over and above their approved compliment in an effort to maintain the service, even at present levels. The commitment of the Order of St. John of God, the hospital order, is undoubted. It is my hope and that of the thousands of people I have referred to that the Minister will advise this House that he has, as Fr. Brennan Whitmore has, accepted the recommendations of this report, which the Minister sought. I hope the Minister will confirm that <Col N="130" /> he will provide the necessary resources to see these recommendations implemented with the urgency that is clearly required.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanNeville" hpid="Mr. Neville Mr. Neville">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Neville</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Ceann Comhairle for allowing me the opportunity to raise this issue. The treatment of 250 mentally and physically handicapped patients at St. Mary's, Drumcar, County Louth, is a disgrace and should not be meted in a civilised society. Like the previous speaker, I complement the staff at St. Mary's and its head, Fr. Fintan Brennan Whitmore, for their initiative in commissioning this report to assist them in making their case to the Minister.</P>
      <P>The Minister should immediately sanction 100 extra staff, including 30 night nurses. It is not acceptable that patients are locked up and left unattended at night while staff deal with others, leaving epileptic and other high risk patients open to danger. As the consultancy report on the St. John of God-run home stated, in the event of a fire the mortality rate would inevitably be high and the organisation culpable. The chief fire officer for County Louth should examine the situation with regard to the fire hazards in the home.</P>
      <P>In St. Mary's, some of the patients are epileptic, some have IQ levels of less than 20, some are prone to injure themselves, some are autistic, some are schizophrenic, some in their 40s already have Alzheimer's disease and some are very aggressive. There is a need for fundamental change in the home. It is not acceptable and is inhuman that strait-jackets are used to restrain patients and that they are locked in rooms. That practice should have finished long ago but staff are forced to engage in it due to staff shortages. There is also a risk of harm to patients and staff due to lack of supervision. The Minister must address the situation where currently whole wings are left unattended, particularly at night, while staff struggle to cope with demand elsewhere, leaving residents at risk, particularly those with epilepsy and with the potential to self-harm.</P>
      <P>The overuse of mechanical restraints to subdue difficult patients during the day and particularly at night is likely to be in violation of European human rights directives. There is evidence that some staff more than others use restraint in the form of all-in-one suits as a matter of routine. The report also draws attention to the mixing of violent and aggressive residents with more passive and introverted patients, which puts the latter at a disadvantage as staff spend a greater percentage of their time with the demanding residents. It is unacceptable that those who are mentally retarded, passive and introverted are intimidated by more aggressive residents. Their quality of life is severely damaged because of this. Arrangements should immediately be put in place so that people live with those of similar disabilities and abilities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The report also draws attention to the lack of stimulation available to patients which is causing serious problems. As a consequence, their behav<Col N="131" /> iour becomes more aggressive, destructive and violent. At night many of these residents are locked or shut in their rooms and unable to open the door unaided.</P>
    <P>Reading details of the report, the institution is more like a prison than an institution of support for the physically and mentally handicapped, and custodial practice has become the normal routine. Staff should ensure that they support the residents to lead a life that is as fulfilling as possible, including their physical, psychological, social and spiritual needs. This seems to be largely absent in this institution due to the lack of resources available to the Order of St. John of God.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to immediately sanction 30 whole time equivalent nursing staff to cover the night shift as a matter of urgency to ensure that the staffing levels do not put residents' safety at risk. The institution heavily relies on seasonal workers and is short of nursing staff and there is a lack of evident space for a clinical nurse specialist. The result is that practice is out of date, the care is custodial, restraint is common practice and residents' needs are not always met.</P>
    <P>The head of St. Mary's, Fr. Fintan Brennan-Whitmore, has conceded that it is a very difficult place for staff to work, that as patients get older their needs are greater. The Minister must immediately ensure that the conditions for these most vulnerable people are addressed by ensuring that Fr. Brennan-Whitmore and his staff have the necessary resources available.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputies Ó Caoláin and Neville for raising this matter and giving me the opportunity to outline the position concerning the issue. St. Mary's, Drumcar, is a specialist residential facility for people with an intellectual disability. There are 246 residents living in 28 separate units, with a wide range of problems from moderate to profound disabilities and an age range of 19 to 60.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government has made a significant level of additional funding available to services for persons with an intellectual disability and autism. In 2003 additional funding of &euro;13.3 million has been allocated to these services. This funding is in addition to the very significant revenue investment, amounting to &euro;188 million, which has been made since 1997 and which is built into the ongoing budget base. The figures are as follows, to the nearest million: &euro;15 million in 1997; &euro;14 million in 1998; &euro;23 million in 1999; &euro;49 million in 2000; &euro;48 million in 2001; and &euro;39 million in 2002. Additional capital funding of &euro;139 million has <Col N="132" /> been made available since 1997. The additional funding provided between 1997 and 2002 was used to put in place about 1,700 new residential, 470 respite and 3,000 day places.</P>
    <P>Despite this very significant and unprecedented investment, demographic factors are contributing to growing waiting lists for residential services in particular, even though the number of people in receipt of services, including full-time residential services, continues to increase. The increased birth rate in the 1960s and 1970s has resulted in large numbers of adults in their late 20s and 30s requiring full-time residential services. In addition, people with an intellectual disability are living longer than previously, adding to the need for services compared to previous generations. This has also been the international experience in service provision to this population.</P>
    <P>Due to the changing profile of those who have been in services for many years there is a need to review issues such as staffing levels and skills mix. For example, an increased need for additional night cover has arisen in many agencies because of the more dependent profile of the residents, due to old age, illness or behavioural issues. An ongoing review process has been under way for a number of years with the health boards and the voluntary agencies, with funding allocated annually over recent years to meet these identified needs.</P>
    <P>The overall economic position in 2003 has had implications for all aspects of public investment and this is reflected in the Estimates and budget adopted by the Government for 2003. Within this overall framework, however, two thirds of the additional funding available for non-capital investment in services has been allocated to the health services.</P>
    <P>Responsibility for the provision of funding for organisations providing services for people with an intellectual disability or autism in the north-eastern region is a matter, in the first instance, for the North-Eastern Health Board. The situation in Drumcar will be discussed at a meeting between my Department and representatives of the health board on Tuesday, 4 February in the context of the board's service plan for 2003. A meeting between my Department, the health board and representatives of the St. John of God order is also scheduled for the following day. Within the resources available to the North-Eastern Health Board this year, I am hopeful that progress can be made at these meetings on the most pressing problems facing St. Mary's at present.</P>
    <P>The Dáil adjourned at 9.05 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Thursday, 30 January 2003.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources (Mr. D. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy is aware, the Government recently made very difficult choices in the area of the public finances. In making these decisions, the Government was not in a position to make as much money available for all programmes as we would all wish to see across the whole range of public expenditure.</P>
      <P>The average spend per annum on forestry for the period 1997-2002 was &euro;90 million, with an increased spend of &euro;107 million in 2002. The 2003 Estimates provide for expenditure of &euro;82 million.</P>
      <P>While the funding available for forestry for the year 2003 will be less than what would have been expected, this does not take from the strong commitment on the part of the Government, as articulated in repeated programmes for Government, to afforestation policy in Ireland. The Government remains fully convinced of the long-term value of the forestry programme in terms of regional development, strong and sustainable local employment, import substitution and the environment. Over the past weeks my colleague, the Minister of State with responsibility for forestry, Deputy John Browne, has undertaken extensive consultation with representatives of the various groups right across the forest sector. Following this it has been decided to focus resources primarily on maintenance of a viable planting programme in 2003. This will initially mean some curtailment of a number of the schemes, including the native woodland and neighbour wood schemes. I expect to finalise arrangements in respect of such schemes as soon as possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="134" />The Minister of State is committed to working closely with the sector over the coming months so as to maintain confidence in the sector having regard to the contribution of forestry to the economy in general and more particularly in terms of rural developments and sustainable local employment. While the public finances are facing into a difficult period, my priority is to continue and maximise the effectiveness of investment under the forestry structural programmes. The 2003 forestry allocation will require careful management in order to meet this objective. While actual and planned investment under these programmes over the period of the national development plan is in general on target, as of now, to maximise the drawdown of EU funding, it is recognised that annual allocations and overall NDP commitments in this regard must be maintained at a level that respects the public expenditure ceilings set by Government and takes account of wider budgetary priorities. Details of allocations under all forestry programmes are being finalised at present.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DermotAhern" hpid="Mr. D. Ahern Mr. D. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources (Mr. D. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a wide range of technical conservation measures already in place in Community waters generally, including the Irish Box. I would also stress that a number of specific technical conservation measures involving closed and restricted areas have been implemented in recent years in the context of various recovery plans for cod and hake stocks in the Irish Sea, the Celtic Sea and also in waters off the north-west coast of Ireland. Separate from the issue of the Irish Box, to which I will return later, the Commission has presented a proposal for a new Council Regulation providing for the incorporation of all existing technical conservation measures in a comprehensive package together with a number of new measures to further protect juvenile cod and hake stocks in particular. Commissioner Fischler gave a presentation on this subject at the Fisheries Council yesterday. My view is that the Commission's proposal is highly technical and we are now examining it in detail. In that regard, I have asked my Department to work closely with BIM, the Marine Institute and with industry representatives in developing our approach. In that context <Col N="135" /> my Department has met the industry twice in the past two weeks to discuss the proposals.</P>
      <P>As such measures would apply to all Community fishermen, the introduction of such measures would not of themselves reduce the entry of new fishing fleets into the Irish Box. In relation to the Irish Box issue specifically, Ireland's position is that the existing western waters regime remains in place unless otherwise decided by Council. The Commission has tabled a proposal involving the elimination of the Irish Box which is totally unacceptable to me. My position is that any new regime must provide for the establishment of the Irish Box as a sensitive zone, with specific effort allocations based on recent fishing effort history.</P>

      <P>The investigation into the tragic accident off Fethard on Sea, resulting in the deaths of five people, is a matter for the Marine Casualty Investigation Board, which is an independent body established in June last year under the Merchant Shipping (Investigation of Marine Casualties) Act 2000. Under the Act the board is required to publish a report of any investigation it undertakes into a marine casualty after having sought and received the observations of parties likely to be adversely affected by publishing the report. The Act provides for a copy of the board's report to be transmitted to me as soon as it is published. I am advised that under the statutory consultation procedure, a substantial volume of observations has been submitted. These are being assessed in detail by the board.</P>
      <P>I am also advised that the board intends to be in a position to publish the report within the statutory time limit of nine months from the date of notification of the casualties, that is no later than end April 2003.

      <P>For many years now there has been speculation about the time frame within which renewable fossil fuel resources will be exhausted and to my knowledge that time frame has not varied much during the past 25 years. What is of immediate concern to me is the environmental impact of using fossil fuels and the putting in place of policies and measures to alleviate such impacts.</P>
      <P>The Government has elaborated on a number of such policies in the Green Paper on Sustainable Energy and the national climate change strategy. In addition the recent setting up of Sustainable Energy Ireland as an independent, non-commercial State body focused exclusively on sustainable use of energy, including deployment of renewable energy sources, is an indication of Government resolve to see those policies implemented. This represents a good beginning on the road to a cleaner and more sustainable energy future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My Department is engaged in a process to add in excess of 500 megawatts of new renewable energy based electricity generating capacity to the network by 2005 under the alternative energy requirement programme. My officials are currently working on terms and conditions to offer reasonable support to project developers. I expect to be in a position to launch a detailed public tender document very shortly. I have <Col N="137" /> already indicated the tender document will include proposed dedicated support for offshore wind energy and biomass technologies not previously successful under the renewable energy support programme. I am satisfied this support, added to existing renewable energy based stocks, will double our production from approximately 6% towards 12% of electricity needs from renewable energy sources by 2005.</P>
    <P>In addition, I plan to invest approximately &euro;223 million in energy conservation, including &euro;67 million allocated for alternative and renewable energy, under the national development plan and the European Union funded Economic Social Infrastructure Operational Programme. Under this programme, Sustainable Energy Ireland has opened a research, development and demonstration programme with a headline fund of &euro;16.25 million to 2006. The programme is open to a wide range of proposals including policy studies, field research, feasibility studies and technology RD&amp;D. Further information on this programme is available directly from Sustainable Energy Ireland. I am satisfied the steps we are taking now will ensure Ireland delivers a proportionate contribution to a universal solution to a global environmental challenge.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources (Mr. D. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 129 and 131 together.</P>
      <P>The provision, promotion and pricing of communications infrastructure and services, including Internet access, is a matter for the private sector companies that operate in the fully liberalised telecommunications market. It is the task of the Commission for Communications Regulation to supervise access and interconnection among operators for the purpose of the provision of electronic communications services, including Internet access. My responsibility is for public policy in the sector within which these companies operate. The widest possible availability of competitive services has traditionally been an important objective of Irish telecommunications policy.</P>
      <P>Since the publication of the OECD report there have been a number of significant developments which should lead to a greater take-up of the Internet and broadband services. In accordance with the provisions of the Communications Regulation Act 2002, I published draft policy directions to the Commission for Communications Regulation in December 2002. It is my intention that the directions will focus on a number of key policy priorities for the Commission in the short to medium term, including the introduction of flat rate Internet access. The public consultation process closed on 10 January and the all of the submissions received are presently being evaluated. I propose to issue the final directions shortly. I am confident that my initiative in this regard should bring about a substantial improvement on the current position in this area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To accelerate the delivery of faster and cheaper communications services throughout the country by the private sector, my Department has run a number of programmes of targeted intervention in recent years. In 1999, under the National Development Plan, 1994-1999, and INTERREG II, &euro;26.5 million was made available to support the roll-out of broadband to the regions. Thirteen projects which rolled-out broadband infrastructure nationwide to a value, both public and <Col N="139" /> private funding, of &euro;70 million were supported and are now completed.</P>
    <P>Under the National Development Plan, 2000-2006, approximately &euro;200 million was allocated under the two regional communications and e-commerce measures. Funding under these measures is intended to leverage and accelerate investment in competitive advanced information and communications infrastructure and services. This will enhance the potential for the development of electronic commerce facilities and enable the electronic provision of public services, including education services, virtual libraries, welfare and health services.</P>
    <P>A first call for proposals was run in 2000, and on foot of submissions received, nine contracts were signed at the beginning of 2001 which will result in additional investment in the regions in broadband infrastructure and increased availability of broadband services for business and residential users. The projects involved are scheduled to be completed by the end of 2003 and will entail an overall investment of &euro;160 million in broadband leveraged from grant assistance of approximately &euro;55 million. Projects funded under this call include the construction of a new national fibre backbone by ESB Telecom, the development of regional e-commerce centres by Nevadatele, the extension by Esat of its national network, and the acceleration of the Esat roll-out of DSL in 40 locations.</P>
    <P>Under a second call for proposals held in 2001, &euro;3.7 million has been made available to Eircom in respect of DSL roll-out at 14 exchanges nationwide. This will be of benefit to both the business sector and domestic users. I also understand that Eircom is rolling out DSL at 32 centres in the greater Dublin area and have DSL enabled 500,000 customer lines which will greatly facilitate the deployment of broadband nationwide.</P>
    <P>The broadband programme announced in March 2002 will result in the construction of open access metropolitan area fibre optic networks in upwards of 19 towns around the country. By reducing the cost of access to fibre rings, these networks will facilitate the provision by the private sector of always on, low cost and high speed Internet access to consumers, educational establishments, industry and business. It is expected that these projects will be completed progressively over the next two years at a cost in the region of &euro;60 million. Construction of networks will begin shortly in Cork, Galway and Mayo and further projects will commence once contracts have been completed.</P>
    <P>My Department is also exploring the potential of satellite and wireless based technologies to promote the deployment of broadband access in Ireland, particularly in remote areas. Pilot projects utilising VSAT and wireless LAN technologies in diverse user communities, to assess their suitability as a platform for the delivery of advanced broadband services in the regions, are currently under way. WLAN is a technology that <Col N="140" /> was originally developed for in-house use, such as office local area networks but is increasingly seen as an alternative technology in the delivery of broadband services. Five projects have been recommended for funding of &euro;260,510. It is intended that the projects will run from January to October 2003.</P>

      <P>I met with the group chief executive of An Post on 30 December last in view of the evident public disquiet over the delay in mail deliveries over Christmas. At the time I was informed of the difficulties which the company had experienced and the delays which resulted. The company has since indicated that one million items of mail, which were due for delivery before Christmas, were delayed and not delivered until early January. Most of these items were Christmas cards. Business mail was at all times prioritised and the usual level of service for this time of year was maintained for these customers.</P>
      <P>The major difficulties arose within the catchment area of the Dublin mails centre which handled 50 million items of mail during the Christmas period. The main reason for the delay in deliveries was due to operational changes at the Dublin mails centre. An Post has given an assurance that these delays will not be repeated. The Commission for Communications Regulation, which has statutory responsibility for the quality of service to customers within the reserved area, has also requested a report from An Post on this matter.</P>

      <P>The Government's legal advice from the Attorney General, supported by legal advice from the Portuguese Government, holds that the EU regulations governing access to Western Waters (Regulations 685/95 and 2027/95) remain in force. This opinion is on the basis that these regulations provide for the full integration of Spain and Portugal into the Common Fisheries Policy. This is expressly stated and the regulations do not contain any time limit. Accordingly, as provided for in regulations 685/95 and 2027/95, the number of Spanish fishing vessels within the Irish Box is limited to 40 at any one time.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 134 and 166 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The fishing effort limitation scheme approved at the December Fisheries Council comes into effect from 1 February 2003 and may run until the end of this year. The Commission has indicated that it is a temporary measure and that a <Col N="142" /> further, more detailed proposal, will be presented next month for subsequent consideration by Council.</P>
    <P>I consider that the scheme is an extremely blunt instrument and I do not believe that it will prove to be effective in fisheries management. A number of like-minded colleagues and I emphasised this view at the December Council and the potential risk of fishermen putting to sea in dangerous weather conditions was also stressed. In the event, the scheme was approved and it now falls to be implemented. The question of its re-negotiation does not, therefore, arise.</P>
    <P>I am aware that this new scheme gives rise to difficulties for particular fishermen using certain gear types. The nine day limit applies only to one gear type and it is possible to fish for a greater number of days each month if certain other gear types are used or without any limit if fishing exclusively outside the area. It is also possible to fish within the area without any limit if using only fishing gears not covered by the regulation. On the basis of an examination of recent log-sheet data, the best estimate is that a total of 24 Donegal based vessels fished in the area concerned with the fishing gear subject to the nine day limit. Ten of these vessels also fished with other fishing gears subject to a 25 day limit. The impact of the regulation will, therefore, be dependent on the type of gear which vessels elect to use and the area which they choose to fish in. I have discussed this situation with representatives of the Irish fishing industry on a number of occasions since the Council and my Department is working closely with the industry to clarify issues about the scheme and the details associated with its implementation.</P>

      <P>The provision of communications infrastructure and services is a matter for the private sector companies that operate in the fully liberalised telecommunications market with reference to the direction and supervision of the Commission for Communications Regulation. To accelerate the delivery of faster and cheaper communications services throughout the country by the private sector, my Department has run a number of programmes of targeted intervention in recent years. These programmes have been designed following consultation with, and obtaining the support of, the various development agencies, including the IDA, <Col N="143" /> Enterprise Ireland, Shannon Development and Údarás na Gaeltachta.</P>
      <P>In 1999, under the National Development Plan, 1994-1999, and INTERREG II, &euro;26.5 million was made available to support the roll-out of broadband to the regions. Thirteen projects which rolled out broadband infrastructure nationwide to a value, both public and private funding, of &euro;70 million were supported and are now completed.</P>
      <P>Under the National Development Plan, 2000-2006, approximately &euro;200 million was allocated under the two regional communications and e-commerce measures. Funding under these measures is intended to leverage and accelerate investment in competitive advanced information and communications infrastructure and services. This will enhance the potential for the development of electronic commerce facilities and enable the electronic provision of public services, including education services, virtual libraries, welfare and health services.</P>
      <P>A first call for proposals was run in 2000, and on foot of submissions received, nine contracts were signed at the beginning of 2001 which will result in additional investment in the regions in broadband infrastructure and increased availability of broadband services for business and residential users. The projects involved are scheduled to be completed by the end of 2003 and will entail an overall investment of &euro;160 million in broadband, leveraged from grant assistance of approximately &euro;55 million. Projects funded under this call include the construction of a new national fibre backbone by ESB Telecom, the development of regional e-commerce centres by Nevadatele, the extension by Esat of its national network, and the acceleration of the Esat roll-out of DSL in 40 locations.</P>
      <P>Under a second call for proposals held in 2001, &euro;3.7 million has been made available to Eircom in respect of DSL roll-out at 14 exchanges nationwide. This will be of benefit to both the business sector and domestic users. I also understand that Eircom is rolling out DSL at 32 centres in the greater Dublin area and have DSL enabled 500,000 customer lines which will greatly facilitate the deployment of broadband nationwide.</P>
      <P>The broadband programme announced in March 2002 will result in the construction of open access metropolitan area fibre optic networks in upwards of 19 towns around the country. By reducing the cost of access to fibre rings, these networks will facilitate the provision by the private sector of always on, low cost and high speed Internet access to consumers, educational establishments, industry and business. It is expected that these projects will be completed progressively over the next two years at a cost in the region of &euro;60 million.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My Department is also exploring the potential of satellite and wireless based technologies to promote the deployment of broadband access in Ireland, particularly in remote areas. Pilot projects utilising VSAT and wireless LAN techno<Col N="144" /> logies in diverse user communities, to assess their suitability as a platform for the delivery of advanced broadband services in the regions are currently under way. The results of these trials are expected to be available by year end.</P>

      <P>I have been advised by the Commission for Electricity Regulation, CER, of the need for additional electricity generating capacity to come on stream by 2005. This information is based on the most recent forecast statement, entitled Generation Adequacy Report 2003-2009, which was published by ESB National Grid last November in accordance with section 38 of the Electricity Regulation Act 1999. The forecast statement has identified that it would be prudent, based on a median demand-low plant availability scenario, to obtain at least 300mw of centrally dispatched, large-scale plant by 2005 in order to maintain supply-demand balance.</P>
      <P>Under section 9 of the Electricity Regulation Act 1999, the CER, in carrying out its duties, is required to have regard to the need, <i>inter alia,</i> to secure that all reasonable demands for electricity by final customers are satisfied, in addition to promoting the continuity, security and quality of supplies of electricity. Given that at present there is no firm commitment from prospective participants to construct the amount of capacity required, the CER, in exercise of its responsibilities, published on its website in October 2002 a consultation process, Investment in new Electricity Generation Capacity. On foot of that process, the CER announced on 20 December 2002 that, following extensive consultation and having examined a number of options, it was of the view that the most appropriate approach to securing additional capacity is to award a contract to one or more successful bidders, through a competitive process for the purchase of 300mw &ndash; 400mw of electricity. The CER is also of the view that ESB, operating as the Public Electricity Supplier, PES, is best placed in the market to offer such a contract. The CER is currently developing the framework for the competitive process and for awarding the final contract with ESB PES. Further details will be published by the CER in the near future.</P>

      <P>In September 2002 the European Commission submitted to the Transport, Telecommunications and Energy Council a proposal for a directive which aims at replacing the Community's existing legislation on emergency oil stocks so as to achieve a greater degree of alignment with the operation of the internal market in oil products, and to improve the effectiveness of the organisation of security stocks through increased harmonisation and co-ordination of national measures of member states. Among the specific measures proposed are an increase in the minimum level of emergency stocks from 90 to 120 days of consumption; a central role for the Commission in deciding on the release of the member states' stocks in the event of a supply crisis or where prices spike in antici<Col N="146" /> pation of such a crisis; a requirement that all member states should establish a national stockholding agency; liberalisation of the conditions under which stocks may be held in another member state; and the establishment of a system to monitor and study developments likely to effect the supply of oil and gas.</P>
      <P>Although consideration of this proposal is at a very early stage, it is already clear that there is widespread opposition among member states. There is particular concern to maintain harmony with the parallel arrangements in the International Energy Agency.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 142 and 574 together.</P>
      <P>I believe there is justification for optimism in 2003 about petroleum exploration offshore Ireland. Much of the Atlantic margin of our offshore is either untested or under-explored and every effort is being made to promote the exploration of these areas. These efforts face considerable obstacles. Unfortunately, the last 12 months have seen a very steep decline in exploration activity in north-west Europe. In Ireland there are now only seven offshore exploration licences in place &ndash; down from a peak of 32 just five years ago. In addition, western offshore areas are difficult to access and explore, in terms of water depth, distance from land and lack of infrastructure. These define both the difficulties and the challenge that face both the government and the industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="148" />Last November, my colleague in the Department, Deputy John Browne, launched the Porcupine licensing initiative. Its purpose is to re-open the Porcupine region, closed since 1999, for exploration. The region will be opened for licensing in four tranches as it covers a large area, 241 full blocks. There have been some wells drilled there in the past but it still has real exploration potential.</P>
    <P>The results from the Dooish well which was drilled off Donegal last year by Enterprise Energy Ireland also gives grounds for optimism. It is expected that the company will carry out further appraisal of the well this year. My Department has long held that there was real exploration potential within these frontier areas and these results further vindicate this view. It is also likely that a further exploration well will be drilled in the Slyne-Erris Basin in 2003 under a licence commitment.</P>
    <P>Within the last 15 months, two leases, for the Corrib gas field and the Seven Heads gas accumulation, have been signed. Production from Seven Heads is set to commence later this year and production from Corrib will depend on the outcome of the recent hearing by An Bord Pleanála. In addition, there will be a development of the Greensand in the Kinsale gas field. Last November, Marathon submitted a plan of development for its south-west Kinsale Greensand development project for my approval. This is directed at accessing gas reserves that were not being drained effectively by the existing Kinsale gas field wells. Drilling at Greensand will commence in March-April of this year. The target date for gas production is expected to be the following July.</P>
    <P>With regard to non-petroleum minerals no new economic deposits have been discovered in recent years. There have been some encouraging results, however. Exploration adjacent to existing base metal mines at Navan, County Meath, Tara Mines Limited, and Galmoy, County Kilkenny, Arcon Mines Limited, has discovered additional resources which have the potential to extend the life of those mines. A good zinc prospect area near Pallas Green, County Limerick, also has the potential to host an economic deposit and drilling is continuing. The acid test of commerciality with any new discovery is that having made a find the explorationist is then prepared to invest in planning for mining and so makes the necessary applications for permits to me, to the relevant county council and to the EPA. New exploration is continuously undertaken as part of my requirements to holders of prospecting licences, of which there were 348 current at the end of December 2002.</P>

Taking into account the submissions received, I propose to finalise and issue the policy directions shortly, in accordance with the provisions of the Act.</P>

Consequently, as there is no statutory prohibition on the planting of trees on these sites, the question of compensation does not arise.</P>

      <P>Under current European regulations, grant assistance cannot be provided for thinning of forests. However, the mid-term review of the rural development plan to be undertaken in 2003 will afford an opportunity to look at the possible introduction of such a grant. The National Council for Forest Research and Development, COFORD, is currently carrying out a research project called BroadForm based at the Teagasc Research Centre, Kinsealy, County Dublin. The objectives of this research project are to determine the best regimes to produce top quality broadleaf timber and to critically examine all aspects of shaping, tending, and thinning.

      <P>The pier at Ballycotton is owned by Cork County Council and responsibility for its maintenance and development is a matter for the local authority in the first instance. In 2001 the council submitted a report prepared by consulting engineers on the estimated cost of the Ballycotton harbour development plan. The proposed development is estimated to cost a total of &euro;6 million. This includes the cost of constructing a marina. There is no funding available to my Department in 2003 under the fishery harbour development programme for works at Ballycotton pier. The question of funding works at Ballycotton pier post-2003 will be considered in the context of the funding available for fishery harbour development works and overall national priorities.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will be aware that Cork County Council applied for funding last year under the marine tourism grant scheme of the national development plan for a development including a marina of 18 berths at Ballycotton, County Cork. However, as the applicants had not obtained the necessary statutory permissions, i.e. planning permission and foreshore lease, as required under the conditions for the scheme, their application could not be considered further. The applicants were informed of this and that they could apply for funding under a future call following the receipt of the required permissions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Since then, however, the Revised Estimates for 2003 have included major adjustments in marine spending. The funds allocated to marine tourism in 2003 are already fully committed to a small number of flagship projects. Unfortunately, this <Col N="152" /> means that there will be no funds available for any additional infrastructure projects under the NDP marine tourism grant scheme in 2003. My officials wrote to each applicant last December informing them of the latest situation.</P>

      <P>While the European Parliament resolution on media concentration calls on member states to safeguard media pluralism and to ensure that the media in all member states are free and diversified, the remainder of the resolution is directed at the European Commission. Specifically, the resolution calls upon the European Commission to undertake a broad consultation process, draw up an updated green paper, complete its examination within the current parliamentary term and to submit a proposal to the European convention so that the principle of freedom of the media may be given a stronger basis in the treaty. I look forward to the contribution of the Commission in that regard.</P>
      <P>In so far as the broadcasting sector in Ireland is concerned, the Radio and Television Act 1988 and the Broadcasting Act 2001 requires the Broadcasting Commission of Ireland to formulate and apply a policy that takes account of ownership and diversity of content. Following a wide consultation process the Commission published a policy statement on ownership and control which sets out the Commission's overall policy objectives and provides a clear decision making framework for dealing with issues impacting on the freedom and the diversification of the broadcast media in Ireland.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources (Mr. D. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 152, 547 and 569 together.</P>
      <P>The biggest challenge facing the fishing industry and its ancillary businesses at present is in relation to the pressure which many of the key whitefish species are under. The industry accepts that measures must be put in place for the conservation and sustainable exploitation of these stocks. The debate at EU level centres around the appropriate mechanisms for achieving this objective.</P>
      <P>The Commission advocates a policy of large-scale restrictions on days at sea leading to decommissioning of fishing vessels. I believe this approach is disproportionate and not the best method to achieve a sustainable exploitation approach to fish stocks. The socio-economic effects of such simplistic policies cannot be ignored and I have consistently stressed to my EU Council colleagues and to Commissioner Fischler the unacceptable socio-economic affects which such policies would have on Irish fishermen and their families. At the December Fisheries Council a restriction of days at sea was introduced as part of a cod recovery plan, on a temporary basis, for part of the fishing grounds off Donegal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am aware that this new scheme gives rise to difficulties for particular fishermen using certain <Col N="154" /> gear types. The nine day limit applies only to one gear type and it is possible to fish for a greater number of days each month if certain other gear types are used or without any limit if fishing exclusively outside the area. It is also possible to fish within the area without any limit if using only fishing gears not covered by the regulation. On the basis of an examination of recent log-sheet data, the best estimate is that a total of 24 Donegal based vessels fished in the area concerned with the fishing gear subject to the nine day limit. Ten of these vessels also fished with other fishing gears subject to a 25 day limit. The impact of the regulation will therefore be dependent on the type of gear which vessels elect to use and the area which they choose to fish in.</P>
    <P>I have discussed this situation with representatives of the Irish fishing industry on a number of occasions since the Council, and my Department is working closely with the industry to clarify issues about the scheme and the details associated with its implementation. Over the coming months, and in the context of new proposals expected shortly from the Commission on long-term restrictions on fishing effort for recovery plan stocks, I will continue to seek, in respect of stocks in western waters, a more appropriate regime for stock recovery. This regime would involve strong technical conservation measures to protect juvenile fish and adult spawning stock and strong control and enforcement to ensure that recovery plans introduced are implemented in a fair and even handed way across all member states. This approach is generally shared by my colleagues from Greece, France, Spain, Italy and Portugal, in the Friends of Fishing group. I will work to maintain our strategic alliance on such common themes going forward in order to ensure that the recovery plans introduced take account of the need to protect stocks and also take account of the socio economic impact on fishing communities.</P>

    <P>Primary responsibility for coast protection works rests with the property owner, be that a <Col N="155" /> private individual or a local authority.

    <P>In 2002 my Department requested applications from all coastal local authorities for consideration in the context of the 2003-2006 national coast protection programmes. Cork County Council submitted three proposals in relation to coast protection works at Youghal costing an estimated total of &euro;5.5 million. There is no funding available to my Department for works at Youghal in 2003.

      <P>Primary responsibility for coast protection works rest with the property owner, be that a private individual or a local authority. My Department wrote to all coastal local authorities in 2002 requesting proposals, in order of priority, for consideration in the context of the 2003-2006 coast protection programmes. Fingal County Council submitted a proposal for works at Velvet Strand, Portmarnock, ranked at number one and estimated to cost a total of &euro;125,000. In 2002, my Department contributed &euro;37,487.86 towards the total cost of &euro;49,983.81 of materials purchased by Fingal County Council for protection works at Velvet Strand, Portmarnock, which, I understand, will commence shortly. The results of these works will have to be assessed to establish what, if any, further works are required in the area in question.</P>

      <Quest> if his attention has been drawn to the fact that there are three million barrels of spare capacity in the Whiddy oil refinery; and if, in view of the likely shortage of oil in the event of war in Iraq, he will enter into discussions with the owners with a view to having full capacity filled and thereby increase national oil reserves held in Ireland by a further 21 days supply.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="DermotAhern" hpid="Mr. D. Ahern Mr. D. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources (Mr. D. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>Since the establishment of the National Oil Reserves Agency, NORA, in 1995, strategic storage of oil has been a matter for the agency rather than the private sector. As part of its overall arrangements to manage and develop Irelands strategic stocks, NORA has a contract with the owner of the Whiddy Island terminal to store 500,000 tonnes of oil products there, involving seven tanks or half of the terminals total capacity. With the recent acquisition by the agency of approximately 130,000 tonnes of kerosene, NORAs contracted capacity at Whiddy is now fully utilised and I understand that the agency has no immediate plans to extend its holdings at the terminal. Indeed I am conscious that if NORA was to increase its share of capacity utilisation at the terminal this could impair opportunities for developing any commercial activity there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Assuming that the terminal was in a position to make the additional tanks available to NORA, I am advised that the quantities of oil products required to fill them would cost the agency approximately $20 million per tank at today's high prices, before taking account of the associated storage costs. This would come on top of commitments amounting to approximately $35 million by NORA in recent months which have helped to boost Ireland's emergency reserves, which comprise both industry and strategic <Col N="158" /> stocks, to the equivalent of more than 120 days of imports, a record total well in excess of the 90-day reserve required to fulfil our international obligations. If, contrary to the consensus among industry observers, a major oil shortage were to occur as a result of events in Iraq, the internationally-coordinated response would involve eking out these emergency stocks so as to provide effective cover well in excess of their nominal duration.</P>
    <P>NORA will continue to monitor oil product and storage markets to identify cost-effective opportunities for improving Irelands overall oil reserves. However, in view of the very high level of comfort provided by our current emergency stocks, whether held at home or abroad, and NORA's existing commitments in servicing the strategic stocks it has already acquired, it is unlikely that it could justify the level of expenditure necessary to provide the additional cover suggested by the Deputy.</P>

      <P>The main aim of Directive 95/21/EC on port state control is to eliminate substandard ships in community waters. To this end, the directive agrees common criteria for inspecting ships which use a port of the Community. These criteria comply with the undertakings given by the authorities of the member states under the Paris memorandum of understanding on port state control.</P>
      <P>One of the directive's key provisions on port state control of ships lays down that at least 25% of the number of foreign ships entering the ports of a member state should be inspected. In Ireland, 400 port state control inspections were carried out in 2002 which represents an inspection rate of 30%. The corresponding figures for 2000 and 2001 are 14.6% and 21% respectively.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To enable Ireland to meet its port state control obligations, nine additional vessel surveyors were appointed to the maritime safety directorate within my Department during 2002. In addition, improved IT infrastructure and better communication arrangements externally with the port authorities and shipping agents will be introduced this year to further streamline the inspection operation. As Ireland did not reach this target in 1999, the Commission on 26 June 2002 decided to bring an action against the State in the European Court of Justice for failure to enforce legislation on the state control of vessels. However, the <Col N="159" /> Commission has also intimated that it will consider withdrawing these proceedings in view of Ireland having exceeded the 25% target in 2002.</P>
    <P>Port state control continues to be a very effective measure in encouraging full compliance with international safety standards. I have asked the maritime safety directorate to continue to give this work priority. To date, in 2003, 30 inspections have already been undertaken by the directorate, three of which have resulted in the detention of the ships involved. I am confident that Ireland will meet its port state control obligations once again in 2003.</P>

I should point out that employer and public liability insurance cover is available to a limited number of members of the Irish Forestry Contractors Association through a group insurance scheme. Contractors working for Coillte can avail of insurance cover through another group scheme.</P>

      <P>Last year a new maritime safety directorate was established within my Department to undertake the State's marine regulatory safety services. The directorate is committed to strengthening all aspects of safety at sea.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The maritime safety directorate published a consultation paper last November seeking views in respect of the adequacy of legislation regarding the carrying and wearing of life jackets or personal flotation devices. The directorate wishes, in particular, to ascertain the extent of public consensus in support of the statutory obligation to <Col N="160" /> wear life jackets or PFDs on pleasure craft in a wider array of circumstances than is currently the case, including on all small open decked craft and on non-mechanically propelled craft.</P>
    <P>This paper is aimed at as wide an audience as possible in order that all interested parties can give their views on this important safety subject. The maritime safety directorate requested interested parties to respond by 31 December 2002 and I encouraged the widest possible participation in this consultation process.</P>
    <P>I am delighted to state that over one hundred submissions have been received to date and that the directorate is continuing to receive detailed submissions on this subject which is a testament to the level of interest in this matter. The submissions are currently being assessed and I will bring forward proposals for any necessary legislative change as quickly as possible following this assessment of the public response.</P>
    <P>As part of this review I have already undertaken a number of measures to improve safety in small watercraft, including bringing forward the date for implementation of new safety regulations applicable to passenger boats, including boats used for sea angling. The maritime safety directorate also organised seminars around the country to promote the new regulations and safety issues generally on passenger boats. In addition, the directorate is reviewing regulations applicable to passenger vessels, which carry over 12 passengers for reward, as well as preparing proposals to enhance the enforcement of safety regulations across the board in 2003.</P>

I will continue in the period immediately ahead to press for changes which I am seeking in the Commission's proposal for <Col N="161" /> western waters. These involve the establishment of the Irish Box as a sensitive zone, the establishment of effort limits for the box based on recent fishing effort history for each member state, including Spain, and the continuation of the fishing effort regime for the rest of western waters as at present.</P>

      <P>At the end of 2001, the EU Commission put forward a proposal for a Council and Parliament regulation to initiate an annual series of EU-wide surveys on income and living conditions, EU-SILC, from January 2003. This survey will serve as the main source of statistics on poverty and related issues throughout the Union. However, examination of the proposal has been slower than originally expected and the regulation will not now be adopted until the middle of this year. As a result, the mandatory starting date for the surveys has been put back to January 2004, although countries in a position to commence in 2003 are encouraged to do so. These surveys will replace the voluntary European Community household panel surveys which were conducted in most EU countries, including Ireland, up until 2001.</P>
      <P>The allocation to the CSO in the Abridged Estimates Volume for 2003 did not include explicit provision for conducting the survey in 2003. However, a range of Departments concerned with social inclusion and combating poverty considered that priority should be given to commencing the survey in 2003. Accordingly, discussions are ongoing about a transfer of a total of &euro;900,000 from the budgets of nine Departments to the CSO and this, together with a grant of approximately &euro;300,000 from the EU Commission, should enable the office to start the survey in June of this year.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 175 and 176 together.</P>
      <P>Funding for Irish emigrant welfare in Britain is provided through the Díon fund annually from my Department's Vote and administered by the Embassy in London through the Díon Committee. Safe Home was set up as a pilot project in January 2000, without FÁS funding, and made use of the community employment clerical facilities of Mulranny Day Centre Housing Company limited for a period of 15 months.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In 2001 and 2002, a Díon grant was paid to the Safe Home Programme in St. Brendan's Village, Mulranny, County Mayo and since 2001 the Safe Home has been a completely separate entity to the Mulranny Day Centre Housing Company Limited. Safe Home recruited one of the community employment participants as a full-time employee to carry out its clerical work. This organisation acts as the national advice and contact point in Ireland for elderly Irish people in Britain who wish to return to live in Ireland. The amounts paid are as follows: IR£50,000, &euro;63,486.90, in 2001 towards the salary costs of a development officer and an administrator based in Mulranny to provide advice and assistance to elderly Irish people in Britain to return to live in Ireland permanently; &euro;82,500 in 2002 comprising <Col N="166" />&euro;55,000 as continuing funding towards the salary costs of the development officer and administrator and &euro;27,500 as new funding for a development officer based in Ireland to work with Irish advice and welfare centres in the UK who are willing to provide induction courses for elderly Irish people to ensure that they are fully aware of all the implications of resettlement in Ireland, to co-ordinate delivery of the induction and to develop links with new Irish organisations in Britain.</P>
    <P>The new development officer post has been in place since August 2002 and is based in Ireland, close to returned emigrants. This officer acts as a support to returned emigrants, forges links with other groups working on behalf of Irish emigrants both at home and abroad and plans to meet with a number of Irish groups in various locations in Britain early this year. The Safe Home team are in contact with many Irish welfare organisations and Irish centres in Britain whose clients include elderly Irish people. Information open days on transfer of pensions and benefits and on housing and health services will take place in Birmingham and Coventry in January 2003 aimed at potential returnees who are over 60 years of age, as well as induction courses for existing applicants.</P>
    <P>Safe Home has received 4,670 enquiries up to 16 January 2003 and a total of 578 applications covering 834 people. In the first year of Díon funding, Safe Home assisted 102 elderly Irish people to return home to various parts of Ireland and, to date, I understand that 125 elderly Irish people have returned and been housed through its efforts. In its sheltered housing complex at St Brendan's village, Safe Home provides housing and support for a number of these elderly people and it has a large list of applicants. It is also making efforts to secure social and affordable rented housing for returning emigrants from county councils and voluntary housing associations.  </P>

      <P>Regulations 54 to 57 of the Safety, Health and Welfare at Work (General Application) Regulations 1993, which cover the provision of first aid at work, have no specific requirements relating to the provision of defibrillation equipment in workplaces. Regulation 56 of the general application regulations requires employers to:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(<i>a</i>)&nbsp;provide, or ensure that there is provided, in every place of work where working con<Col N="167" /> ditions require it at each place of work under their control such first aid equipment, suitably marked and easily accessible, as is adequate and appropriate in the circumstances for enabling first aid to be rendered to persons at the place of work and (<i>b</i>) provide or ensure that there are provided at each place of work under their control such number of occupational first aiders as is necessary to render first aid at a place of work concerned, taking into account the size or hazards (or both) of the undertaking or establishment.</P>
    <P>These requirements are based on a risk assessment approach. This means that the employer must assess what the relative risk might be and provide appropriate first aid response. It is likely in some cases, particularly in undertakings where there are a large number of employees or of the general public, that the employer may see a need to have appropriate first aid for those who might suffer a heart attack or other cause of cardiac arrest. The Health and Safety Authority therefore advises employers that they must use their own risk assessment in deciding whether or not a defibrillator should be provided in the workplace but if they do so, they must ensure that staff who are likely to use the equipment have been adequately trained in its proper use.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Mr. Fahey)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 178, 182, 188 and 190 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="168" />The administration of training allowances for apprentices is a matter for FÁS who advise me as follows. FÁS introduced the standards based apprenticeship system in 1993 and put in place sufficient training places to meet the demands forecast at the time. In the period 1994 to 1996, registrations of apprentices continued to increase at a steady rate and FÁS responded in providing additional training places to meet these demands.</P>
    <P>When supply and demand for training places are in balance and there are no unusual factors, an apprentice would attend for off-the-job training as follows: phase 2 in the first year, phase 4 in the second year and phase 6 in the third year. In this ideal system, the apprentice would be paid a training allowance corresponding to those years. From 1997-99, however, registrations of apprentices in all 26 trades increased dramatically and this led to a build-up of apprentice numbers with the result that in some trades apprentices experienced delays in progressing to the next phase when it became due. However, to aid apprentices who were delayed in the phased scheduling of their training courses, which arose during the period 1997-99, FÁS introduced an arrangement whereby these apprentices would be paid an allowance which was related to their year of apprenticeship at the time when the offer of training was made. In other words, an apprentice who should have been entering phase 4 of his-her training, but because of the delay due to over-demand in training capacity was obliged to enter phase 2, he-she would have been paid at the phase 4, next year, rate.</P>
    <P>Over the past three years, FÁS, in co-operation with the institutes of technology, increased the training places to meet the demands on a planned basis. The stage has now been reached where capacity is no longer a problem and the need to pay the higher, so called &ldquo;next year rate&rdquo; is the exception. It was intended to place the onus on individual apprentices who were delayed in the phased scheduling of their training courses to make a case to FÁS for payment of the higher rate. However, it was soon recognised, that this would have given rise to a temporary reduction in the take home pay for many apprentices. Therefore, it was subsequently decided by FÁS to revert to the position adopted previously, that is that the higher rate would continue to be paid where the records held by FÁS indicated that the delay in the individual apprentices progress was caused by lack of training capacity. I am assured by FÁS that these arrangements are being implemented forthwith. I am also assured that any individual apprentice who clearly qualifies for the higher allowance will be paid accordingly.</P>
    <P>The table sets out details of the training allowances paid to apprentices over the period 1 April 2000 to 1 April 2002.</P>

      <Quest> the reason funding for Díon has been cut by 5% for the year 2003, especially having regard to the recommendations of the Commission on Emigration and the serious impact the cutback will have on Irish community and voluntary groups in the UK; and if she will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>

      <P>I have a strong appreciation of the situation of many of our emigrants overseas and have had an engagement with many emigrant groups in the UK and have been fully supportive of their efforts. In particular, my involvement with the Díon fund enabled me to see and resource the focused and locally-delivered assistance and capacity-building which the fund supports. I have been able to dramatically increase the level of funding to Díon over the past few years. It was IR£500,000 for many years and only reached IR£750,000 in 1999. I managed to increase it above the £1 million level in 2000, above the £2 million level in 2001, and maintained it at that level in real terms in 2002.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The outcome of the Estimates process was a 5.3% reduction in the Vote of my Department for 2003. In line with this, the amount of moneys voted to Díon was reduced by 5% on last year's level, from &euro;2.708 million in 2002 to &euro;2.573 mill<Col N="171" /> ion in 2003 &ndash; a reduction of &euro;135,000. However, such an arithmetic approach does not give the full picture as it does not take account of the now more favourable euro/Sterling exchange rate movement. When looked at in terms of £Stg. it can be seen that, due to the appreciation of the euro since June 2002, when the main tranche of Díon grants was made, the £Stg. equivalent of the Díon fund was of the order of £1.623 million, &euro;1 = £0.60Stg. The £Stg. equivalent of the 2003 voted amount for Díon is, at 27 January 2003, equivalent to £1.698 million, &euro;1 = £0.66Stg. Therefore, there has been no reduction of impact in the UK.</P>
    <P>I am supportive of the thrust of the main recommendations of the task force on policy regarding emigrants, i.e. that the needs and aspirations of the wider Irish family be identified and supported in an integrated manner and, of course, within available resources.</P>

      <P>A number of developments have taken place since the closure was announced by the company. Meetings took place between FÁS, trade union and company representatives on 13 and 14 January, 2003. One-to-one guidance interviews between FÁS and the employees were scheduled to start in the week beginning 27 January 2003. All employees who register with FÁS are being placed on a FÁS employment tracking system. In addition, the employees are being offered three-day planning for the future courses. These courses will start in February 2003. On completion of this course, participants will be interviewed again and, where appropriate, offered other training or further education courses.</P>
      <P>On 15 January 2003, a meeting of interested parties took place in order to explore how Enterprise Ireland in particular, could work with the other agencies such as the county enterprise board, FÁS, IDA Ireland and community groups in the area to create initiatives that would result in job replacement for the area.  At the meeting, it was agreed to establish a local working group made up of employees of the company and other interested parties to progress the employment agenda for the area. Enterprise Ireland is also prepared to discuss funding under its community enterprise scheme. The final date for submissions under the current call for proposals is 25 April 2003.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the context of the national spatial strategy, I should add that the recent awarding of hub <Col N="172" /> status to Kilkenny will benefit both the city and the surrounding area, including Castlecomer. This is a positive development overall for advancing economic development in the area. I will continue to assist in whatever way I can, as I indicated when I met with the delegation from Kilkenny in relation to the closure on 12 December 2002.</P>

      <P>The issue of job creation is a day-to-day operational issue for the industrial development agencies under the remit of my Department and not one for which I, as Minister, have direct involvement. The main agencies under my Department's remit which deal with job creation are Enterprise Ireland in regard to the development of indigenous industry, and IDA Ireland in regard to the attraction of inward investment. The county and city enterprise boards are also actively involved in supporting the creation of employment in start-up and micro enterprises.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Enterprise Ireland is working closely with its 308 grant assisted client companies in South Dub<Col N="173" /> lin in helping them to increase their competitiveness and their exports by providing business planning finance, in the form of grants and equity, for the development of exports and human resources. Each company has access to the international market through Enterprise Ireland's network of 30 offices worldwide. Finance can also be provided for companies embarking on programmes of research and development to develop new products or services. Enterprise Ireland is working closely with the Institute of Technology in Tallaght, and has recently approved funding of &euro;2.54 million towards a new campus innovation centre.</P>
    <P>In 2002, there were over 10,500 full-time and 1,159 part time people employed in Enterprise Ireland assisted companies in the county. Some of the largest, higher value-added companies in the country are located in the environs of Tallaght. Enterprise Ireland has provided grant assistance to the four community enterprise centres in Tallaght towards tackling unemployment. The agency also works closely with the South Dublin Chamber of Commerce, has representation on the board and evaluation committee of the county enterprise board, and is also represented on the county development board, which is finalising an integrated strategic plan for the county, covering the period up to 2011.</P>
    <P>IDA Ireland, the agency with responsibility for attracting foreign direct investment, continues to work with companies in the Tallaght area to secure further projects, which will benefit the area. The development of the digital park at City West, the installation of the global crossing cable and the four data centres located at the park, will serve the internet infrastructural needs of existing and new businesses. The area is well placed to attract additional business in the technology and e-business sector. In the recent past, a number of companies in the electronics, internationally traded services and software sectors such as AOL, GE Interlogix, UPS, and SAP have established operations in the Tallaght-City West area and will continue to grow in line with projections. Xilinx, which operates in the electronics sector, will shortly complete a significant building expansion and recruitment will begin in the second or third quarter of this year.</P>
    <P>In Grangecastle, Wyeth is nearing completion of its &euro;1.5 billion investment in a new biotechnology facility. Currently, 200 people are employed and this will increase to 1,300 when manufacturing commences in 2004-2005 and the plant reaches full capacity. In addition, Takeda, the Japanese pharmaceutical company, will shortly start construction on a bulk plant in Grangecastle and when fully operational it will employ 60 people. The South Dublin County Enterprise Board is actively involved in supporting the creation of enterprises employing ten people or less in the Tallaght area. The board provides supports such as financial grants, advice and enterprise training to those establishing or expanding their business. Since its inception, the <Col N="174" /> board has assisted 467 projects in the Tallaght area, which currently employ over 1,000 people. The south Dublin board will continue to work closely with community groups in supporting the creation of sustainable employment, which can assist the re-integration of socially disadvantaged groups into the workforce.</P>
    <P>In addition, FÁS Tallaght training centre will continue to address the needs of the unemployed by offering training programmes which will assist in securing employment in the area. The centre offers courses in Starting Your Own Business to assist those who wish to set up their own business. Following a series of meetings between myself, my colleague the Minister for Social and Family Affairs and FÁS, it has been agreed to undertake a further roll-out of the preventative strategy on a phased basis, starting with the Dublin region. The roll-out of the scheme to age groups between 25 and 54 years and who are six months on the live register will commence in March of this year.</P>
    <P>I am sure the Deputy will agree, from the above details, that the agencies of my Department are working to address the employment needs of Tallaght and south County Dublin and I can assure him that they will continue to promote the area for suitable investment projects in the future.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Ms Harney Ms Harney">
      <NameTxt>Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Ms Harney)</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no plans to introduce further legislation in this area. The current law is the European Communities (Contracts for timesharing of immovable property &ndash; protection of consumers) Regulations 1997 (S.I. No. 204 of 1997) and European Communities (Contracts for timesharing of immovable property &ndash; protection of consumers) (Amendment) Regulations 2000 (S.I. No. 144 of 2000), which both implement the European timeshare Directive, 97/47/EC.</P>
      <P>I am aware that timeshare legislation does not extend to membership of holiday clubs, a relatively new phenomenon whereby subscribers can avail of cut-price luxury holidays to popular holiday destinations each year. In this regard, the Office of the Director of Consumer Affairs advises consumers to carefully consider the full implications of the contract being offered in connection with these holidays and to seek legal advice as to the terms and conditions of the contract.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I understand that the EU Commission intends to review the timeshare Directive and has given this pledge in its Consumer Policy Strategy Statement 2002-06. We will, of course, partake in any <Col N="175" /> discussions that take place and ensure that the position of Irish consumers is fully protected. To amend the law unilaterally would only protect consumers who purchase holiday or timeshare products in Ireland. Therefore, the Deputy will appreciate the need to tackle this issue at the European Union level so that rules will be introduced that govern all member states. This will ensure that Irish consumers will be protected in this area when they travel within the European Union.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Ms Harney Ms Harney">
      <NameTxt>Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Ms Harney)</NameTxt>
      <P>The liquidation of IFI is ongoing and I understand that it could take two years or more to complete. At this stage, my Department has made payments of &euro;2.67 million in respect of 322 claims received from former IFI workers in respect of entitlements under the Redundancy Payments Acts. A further 19 claims are being processed at present. In addition, under the insolvency payments scheme, &euro;450,425 has been paid to the liquidator of the company mentioned in respect of claims for outstanding pay-related employee entitlements to wages and arrears of holiday pay on behalf of 323 employees. Claims in respect of a further eight employees received recently are currently being processed and a query has arisen in respect of one other claim.</P>
      <P>With regard to minimum notice entitlements, before payment can be made under the insolvency payments scheme, entitlement must first be established by appeal to the Employment Appeals Tribunal. I understand that appeals have been lodged by 327 employees of the company. A date for the hearing has not yet been set. If the employees receive favourable decisions from the tribunal, they should complete Form EIP2 which will accompany the decision and forward this form to the liquidator, who will then forward the completed forms to my Department for processing and payment. I am not aware of the position as regards the workers based in Belfast but I expect that the relevant authorities there have also dealt with any claims received for statutory entitlements in an expeditious manner.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In addition to the position in relation to the statutory payments outlined, interim payments of &euro;5,000 each have been made to most workers from the <i>ex-gratia</i> trust fund of &euro;24.5 million established by ICI and the State. Discussions are ongoing between representatives of the workers <Col N="176" /> and the shareholders and with the trustee and it is hoped that the distribution of the balance in the fund can take place in the near future.</P>
    <P>Finally, I understand that the liquidator has accepted, based on legal advice, that the workers have contractual entitlements to the redundancy terms offered by the company in the past. The liquidator has estimated that these entitlements are worth in excess of &euro;60 million. However, until the liquidation is completed, it will not be clear how much of this the liquidator will be able to pay. At the time of the liquidation of the company, it appeared, based on the statement of affairs produced by the board, that ordinary creditors could expect to receive about 75% of the amounts owed to them. However, with the addition of the claims which the employees now have as ordinary creditors, it seems likely that the rate of dividend payable to all ordinary creditors, including the employees, will be somewhat lower. I should also mention that the arrangements for claims from the <i>ex gratia</i> fund provide that the amount received from the fund will offset any amounts due from the liquidator in due course.</P>

      <P>European Council Directive 98/50/EC amends Directive 77/187/EEC on the approximation of the laws of the member states relating to the safeguarding of employees' rights in the event of transfers of undertakings, businesses or parts of businesses. The amending directive aimed to clarify the scope of the principal directive in the light of extensive case law developed by the European Court of Justice since the 1977 directive was implemented. In particular, the amending directive focused on the issue of the &ldquo;contracting out of services&rdquo; by the employer.</P>

These regulations are currently being finalised by the Office of the Parliamentary <Col N="177" /> Counsel to the Government and I hope to have them signed and in place by March 2003.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 192, 197 and 198 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The primary purpose of the community employment programme is to provide long-term unemployed persons with the necessary skills and confidence to take up employment in the open labour market. In accordance with the Government's decision in 1999 to restructure CE, participation levels are gradually being reduced in line with reduced levels of long-term unemployment and a strategic shift in policy in favour of training and other more appropriate supports. The aver<Col N="178" /> age participation rate on CE in 2003 is expected to be in the region of 22,000, with a projected year-end participation rate of 20,000.</P>
    <P>An overall appraisal of active labour market programmes is currently under way under the aegis of the PPF standing committee on the labour market. A key element of this appraisal will be ascertaining the scope for re-orienting such programmes to more effectively target the needs of disadvantaged groups such as the long-term unemployed, lone parents, older persons and persons with disabilities. FÁS is also currently undertaking an internal review of community employment and the job initiative programmes and the outcome of this process will feed into the deliberations of the standing committee.</P>
    <P>FÁS has discretion to extend, on a case by case basis, an individual's term on CE, having regard to that individual's personal development needs and future employment prospects. In the case of people aged over 50 years, the three year cap on participation has been removed where people in this age group, having spent three years on the programme, continue to experience difficulties in getting employment. For such participants FÁS may offer a further period on the programme on a case by case basis. A maximum of 20% of the overall number of participants on the CE programme may avail of extensions at any one time.</P>
    <P>Participation on CE is usually for a period of one to three years, based on an annual renewable contract. CE participants are entitled to receive minimum notice in accordance with the Minimum Notice and Terms of Employment Acts 1973 to 2001. Disputes regarding length of notice or right to notice can be referred to the employment appeals tribunal for investigation and decision on the matter.</P>

      <P>I share the Deputy's concern regarding the low level of automated teller machines, ATMs, in this country and I would urge the banking industry and prospective ATM operators to provide consumers with the maximum levels of ATM service possible.</P>
      <P>I am not aware of any confusion which may exist between my Department and the Department of Finance in relation to the installation of ATMs in this country. As there is no requirement that companies installing or operating ATMs be licensed or authorised it is difficult to see where such confusion would arise. Companies are free to engage in the installation of ATMs as they wish.</P>
      <P>Under the Consumer Credit Act 1995, approval of any charges which may be applied by credit institutions or credit institutions sponsoring independent ATM operators is a matter for the Director of Consumer Affairs, who is independent in her functions.</P>
      <P>I have no plans, therefore, to introduce any legislation in relation to the provision of authorisations or licences for companies or persons who wish to install ATM facilities.</P>

      <Quest> the action she intends to take to address the job losses in the town of Ballinasloe, County Galway; and if she will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>
      <QRef>[1961/03]</QRef>
    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Ms Harney Ms Harney">
      <NameTxt>Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Ms Harney)</NameTxt>
      <P>The announcement by Square D on 15 January 2003 that it is to close its Ballinasloe plant by the end of June 2003 with the loss of all 387 jobs on its books cannot be described as anything other than a body blow for the workforce, their families and the local community. It is a priority for me to ensure that everything possible will be done to find new investment and new sources of employment for Ballinasloe, although I know that this will not be an easy task.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Established in 1971, the Ballinasloe facility manufactures the Square D brand of electrical circuit breakers which are sold primarily within north American markets. The closure decision, according to the company, reflects significant <Col N="180" /> change in market demand for circuit breakers resulting in over-capacity in manufacturing operations at the group's north American division. A number of the group's north American manufacturing operations have already been moved to Mexico.</P>
    <P>In an effort to lessen the impact of the closure, the north American division of the parent company, Schneider Electric, has stated that it is committed to working with IDA Ireland and the Irish authorities to find manufacturing firms that are interested in the Ballinasloe plant and may be in a position to offer suitable job opportunities to a well-qualified work force; to assisting Ballinasloe employees in obtaining new jobs; to providing outplacement assistance and job search training; to providing counsel and information to employees on company-paid benefits; and to providing five weeks severance pay per year of service, in addition to statutory redundancy entitlement.</P>
    <P>The agencies under the remit of my Department are also working to lessen the impact of the closure. IDA has been aware of the difficult market conditions being experienced by the company for some time and began to intensify discussions late in 2002 when it became apparent that the future of the company was in question. IDA has already brought one potential client to view the plant and will continue to explore other possibilities as well as seeking out other potential clients.</P>
    <P>FÁS, the State training agency, has already been in contact with the company and is to meet the company management with a view to offering its services to all staff. FÁS will register people as job seekers, provide career information and guidance and carry out a training needs analysis. It will provide a range of training courses which will be designed to meet the skill needs of individuals to enhance their employability while also providing the area with a skilled workforce.</P>
    <P>Enterprise Ireland began discussions last week with the company to discuss supports for any possible start-ups by local senior management.</P>
    <P>The industrial development agencies were working hard in Ballinasloe prior to the closure announcement. IDA was already active in the promotion of Ballinasloe for new inward investment, with the key focus being on providing international standard property solutions in the town to attract new companies. In light of the closure of Square D, IDA has now finalised plans and a planning application has been lodged with Galway County Council for a new 27,000 square foot technology unit on the IDA's 30 acre business park in Ballinasloe. When planning permission is granted, construction will be undertaken by private developers and IDA has already begun to actively market this facility together with promoting the Square D facility in the town.</P>
    <P>Enterprise Ireland has approved funding of &euro;120,000 for the work in progress at the community owned enterprise centre and it is understood that there is still some space available for potential projects.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="181" />The Galway County and City Enterprise Board has been actively involved in industrial-community development in Ballinasloe. During 2002 considerable progress was made with the area community development group, with &euro;63,000 allocated to the small business development park which now houses four start-up businesses. Over the last three years Ballinasloe has received some &euro;350,000 in support from the county enterprise board.</P>
    <P>At Galway-Mayo Institute of Technology and NUI, Galway there are enterprise platform programmes with places available for staff of Square D who might have an idea to start up their own manufacturing-international traded services businesses. This programme affords the opportunity to develop business plans and to carry out market research for ideas before actually starting a business. There is also a similar new programme about to commence in the Athlone Institute of Technology.</P>
    <P>In regard to development in the Galway area, it is significant that five new IDA investment supported proposals announced in 2002 will ultimately provide almost 2,200 new high quality jobs in the healthcare and internationally traded services sector. The companies concerned are Abbott, Churchill, Medtronic, Micros and Net IQ.</P>
    <P>Recognising that urban environments are generally more attractive for mobile investments, IDA has adopted a target of having 50% of all new greenfield investment located in the Objective One region. IDA Ireland has sought to encourage investments in defined sectors to specific regions, which seeks to build on the relative advantages in different towns. An essential part of this endeavour has been the refining of IDA property offerings and this is a key tool in winning investments. IDA Ireland has and is continuing to design and develop high quality business parks, fully serviced up to international standards.</P>
    <P>In Tuam, the IDA has acquired 27 acres and are currently carrying out site development works after which it intends to have a high quality facility provided by the private sector. At Loughrea, the IDA is upgrading land to make it more marketable. In Gort, the IDA has a 20,000 square foot high quality building which it is actively promoting for suitable projects.</P>
    <P>While the IDA is convinced that it has excellent quality property solutions in the larger towns in the county, it is also cognisant of the slower inward investment climate that has prevailed for the past two years. This also has had an impact on jobs in existing client companies. Much pro<Col N="182" /> gress has been recorded over the past several years in many of the companies that have been attracted here in the shift up the value chain in many of the companies and in many aspects of our competitiveness. Costs are a big issue for all companies and those costs have moved out of line with our competitors, impacting heavily on lower technology businesses. Hence, the IDA has a major emphasis on the healthcare and internationally traded services sectors. There is now a well developed healthcare cluster in the west, particularly in Galway, which includes companies like Transition Optical in Tuam, StarGuide in Oranmore, Medtronic, Boston Scientific and Abbott in Galway City.</P>
    <P>Working with the third level institutes in the area, Enterprise Ireland has approved &euro;2.6 million for the development of campus incubator units at Galway-Mayo Institute of Technology in Galway and &euro;695,000 for units in NUI, Galway. A sum of &euro;2.54 million has also been approved for the development of units at Athlone Institute of Technology. These incubation centres support the development and expansion of campus company activity, encourage and support the commercialisation of research and development carried out in the institutes of technology and embed the institutes of technology as major supports for the development of high-tech companies in the regions.</P>
    <P>All of the State agencies under the auspices of my Department are working, and will continue to work, closely in the interests of developing Ballinasloe. I have also met with many of the Ballinasloe interest groups and hope to do so again in the near future to reassure them of my ongoing commitment and that I will continue to work on their behalf.</P>

      <Quest> the measures she intends to take, or has taken, to assist the former employees of Artesyn Technology in Youghal, County Cork to retain, reskill and to gain employment; the measures the agencies under her aegis have taken or intend to take to attract new industry to Youghal and east Cork generally in view of the large number of job losses in the region in recent times; and if she will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>

    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Ms Harney Ms Harney">
      <NameTxt>Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Ms Harney)</NameTxt>
      <P>The announcement of job losses by Artesyn Technologies at its facility in Youghal, County Cork was very disappointing. The Youghal operation supplies power conversion products principally to the telecoms industry which is continuing to experience very difficult market conditions. The company has recently closed other operations around the world as part of its global restructuring and unfortunately the job losses announced for the Youghal facility are a continuation of that process.</P>
      <P>As a result of the announcement, approximately 160 jobs will be lost at the Artesyn facility with the job losses taking place on a phased basis which is expected to be completed by September 2003.</P>
      <P>While these job losses are regrettable, it should be noted that the high value engineering and customer support operation, which employs approximately 80 people, will be retained in Youghal to support product design and sales.</P>
      <P>IDA Ireland has advised that it met with the company to discuss the situation, particularly with regard to the future utilisation of the building which is to be vacated by the company. The IDA is actively working with the company to prepare a profile of the building which will assist in the future marketing of the property to potential investors.</P>
      <P>The IDA and Enterprise Ireland have also advised that they met with the Youghal Chamber of Commerce to discuss the impact of the job losses and are currently working with the chamber in the preparation of a profile of the area. This profile will then become an intrinsic part of the IDA Ireland marketing material of the south west region.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="184" />IDA Ireland will continue to promote Youghal to potential investors and every effort will be made to secure a replacement industry for the Youghal area so that the employees losing their jobs will be in a position to find new employment in the area as quickly as possible.</P>
    <P>FÁS, the national training authority, has already been in contact with company management and offered to put its full range of support services at the disposal of those being made redundant. These supports include skills analysis, jobs placement, guidance and counselling interviews, identification of training needs and suitable training courses.</P>
    <P>Enterprise Ireland and the South Cork Enterprise Board will meet with all employees of Artesyn interested in starting their own business to outline the range of supports available from both organisations.</P>
    <P>The State development agencies will continue to strongly promote east Cork in the attraction of inward investment and the development and expansion of indigenous industry, including small industry. The Government is committed to ensuring the most equitable regional distribution of job opportunities and I have impressed on the development agencies the importance of making even greater efforts in this field.</P>
    <P>While the east Cork area has experienced a number of job losses in recent times, it has also been extremely successful in terms of attracting new overseas investments to the area with 46% of all job announcements in the south west region in 2002 being located in east Cork. This will result in the creation of 610 new jobs in east Cork in the years ahead.</P>
    <P>Currently, the entire east Cork area is proving to be a very attractive location for foreign direct investment, particularly in the healthcare, pharmaceutical and internationally traded services sectors and IDA Ireland is hopeful that this will result in further investments in the year ahead.</P>

Those Acts provide for the grant of a disability pension in respect of permanent disablement due to a wound or injury attributable to military service. Application for a disability pension in respect of a wound or injury must be made within one year of retirement.</P>
      <P>Former members of the Permanent Defence Force are eligible for medical and hospital treatment under the Health Acts in the same way as other members of the community. There is no general provision for the continued treatment of military personnel under the auspices of the Department of Defence or the Defence Forces following their retirement.</P>

      <P>The minimum age for general service enlistment and for the enlistment of cadets to the Permanent Defence Force is 17. There is an exception to the general age limit in the case of apprentices who may be recruited at 16. However apprentices are <Col N="187" /> not assigned to any military duties until they have completed up to four years apprenticeship trade training, at which time they would be close to 20 years of age at a minimum.</P>
      <P>All applicants for the Defence Forces who are under 18 years of age must have the written consent of a parent or a legal guardian. Military personnel who are under 18 years of age are specifically precluded from overseas service.</P>
      <P>The minimum age for young people to join their local FCA or Slua Muirí unit is 17 years.</P>
      <P>I am satisfied that the existing age limits for recruitment to the Defence Forces are appropriate and I do not propose to make any changes in this area.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture and Food (Mr. Walsh)</NameTxt>
      <P>I introduced the 32 million litres scheme in order to make specific provision for milk producers whose initial quota allocations were low as a result of certain circumstances. In that regard, I decided that producers who had been following dairying development plans under the farm modernisation scheme and the reduced interest subsidy scheme for farmers in financial difficulty at the time of the introduction of the milk quota regime would benefit under this scheme. Furthermore, producers whose milk deliveries during 1983, the quota year, were adversely affected by <Col N="188" /> an outbreak of animal disease in their herd in the period 1978 to 1980, were also eligible to apply.</P>
      <P>In setting down the criteria for eligibility in the allocation of the 32 million litres, I adhered to the objectives of providing additional quota to active producers in the small and medium size category who had demonstrated their commitment to milk production. These are the broad criteria which I have used in allocating all of the additional quota available to Ireland under agenda 2000.</P>
      <P>The conditions of the scheme are set down in Public Notice 94/15.</P>

      <P>My Department, as successor to the former Irish Land Commission, does not have responsibility for the maintenance, repair or restoration of river banks or embankments, or other works to prevent flooding.</P>
      <P>However, arising from the acquisition of certain estates, the former Irish Land Commission retained a portion of the purchase money due to the estate owner for the ongoing maintenance and upkeep of embankments on those estates. These retained funds were entrusted to the public trustee, who is now an officer of my Department.</P>
      <P>The public trustee has responsibility for the investment of these funds and the income earned may be applied for the specific purposes described in the trust deed for each estate. In the context of an ongoing or perpetual trust, it is established practice that the capital sum should not be used for general repairs except in very exceptional circumstances.</P>
      <P>The persons concerned should contact the public trustee at my Department's Cavan office if the lands in question are located in an area subject to a trust fund.</P>

      <P>The allocation of the balance of the Agenda 2000 milk quota to certain categories of small and medium scale milk producers has been completed and applicants have been notified of the outcome in their own cases. The person named submitted an application in relation to this quota, under the animal disease category. Unfortunately, as the conditions of the scheme were not satisfied an allocation was not made. Notification to that effect has been issued.</P>
      <P>An appeal procedure exists in relation to this scheme and the person named has now submitted an appeal. The assessment of appeals will be based on recommendations from the milk quota appeals tribunal. When the appeals process is completed each appellant will be notified of the outcome of his or her case.</P>

      <P>The maximum pension payable under the current early retirement scheme is &euro;13,515 per annum for a period of up to ten years. This is made up of a basic payment of &euro;5,403 plus &euro;338 per hectare up to a maximum of 24 hectares. In its proposals for this scheme, which commenced in November 2000, my Department had made provision for annual increases in the rate of pension. However the European Commission <Col N="193" /> rejected this proposal and insisted that a fixed rate be set for the full period of the CAP rural development plan 2000-06.</P>
      <P>The rate of pension payable under the 1994 scheme of early retirement from farming is the maximum provided for in the EU Council Regulation under which the scheme was introduced. The regulation does not provide for indexation of payments. The maximum pension rate for this scheme is &euro;12,075 per annum made up of a basic payment of &euro;4,830 plus &euro;301.90 per hectare up to a maximum of 24 hectares.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture and Food (Mr. Walsh)</NameTxt>
      <P>Because of temporary human resources issues, about 80 REPS applications in Sligo and 40 in Leitrim are now outside the target periods for processing set down in the Protocol on Direct Payments to Farmers. Until processing is completed it is not possible to say what volume of payments these applications represent. Staff have <Col N="194" /> been temporarily redeployed to the Leitrim office and it is hoped to have the backlog cleared within the next few weeks. The position in the Sligo office is also being actively examined and I am hopeful that a solution can be found shortly.</P>

      <P>The position is that under new arrangements introduced with effect from 1 January 2002 all bovine premia scheme applications must be processed at producer level rather than appli<Col N="198" /> cation level. This means that before balancing payments can be made all applications under the special beef premium scheme, the suckler cow premium scheme and the slaughter premium scheme must be examined together to establish, in the case of the suckler cow premium and special beef premium, if stocking density levels have been complied with and-or if there is non-compliance under any of the schemes. Any penalty arising from non-compliance would have to takes into account the total number of eligible animals under each of the schemes.</P>
      <P>While the producer approach will cause a slight delay in the issue of balancing payments under the suckler cow scheme the overall effect will be that any penalties imposed will be more proportional than heretofore. This arises because the number of non-compliant animals are divided by all the eligible animals under the three schemes as distinct from the number of eligible animals for the individual scheme as was the case up to now.</P>
      <P>An additional factor in 2002 is that the national quota for the special beef premium scheme has been exceeded with an increase in the number of animals submitted for the premium in late December 2002. It will not be possible to definitively determine the exact percentage overshoot until such time as the two months retention period has ended and all applications are processed. When eligibility has been established under the bovine schemes and the special beef premium quota overshoot has been determined balancing payments will commence.</P>
      <P>My Department is conscious of the pressures on farm income and will make every effort, taking into account the outstanding issues referred to above, to ensure balancing payments will issue at the earliest possible date. Last autumn I negotiated an 80% advance payment level under these schemes for 2002.</P>

An inspection of all claimed and unclaimed animals in his herd was carried out on 13 August 2002. During this inspection it was found that 20 unclaimed animals were not registered on the cattle movement monitoring system, CMMS, and my Department wrote to him on 9 December 2002 advising that, accordingly, his premium entitlement would be subject to a reduction penalty in accordance with the terms and conditions governing the scheme. He was given the opportunity to have this decision reviewed. The person named wrote to my Department on 23 December 2002 requesting a review and explaining that he had not been well during the year. As a medical certificate was pro<Col N="199" /> vided to substantiate his illness and as all animals in his herd have now been registered on the CMMS my Department has written to him to advise that the decision to apply the penalty has been rescinded.

      <P>Under the 1998 agreement with the EU Commission, which secured generous REPS payments of up to &euro;242 per hectare on commonages, my Department together with Dúchas undertook to have individual framework plans prepared for each commonage. It is not possible to exclude specific areas of commonage from this undertaking. Each commonage has been assessed by a team of two, one agriculturalist and one ecologist, under the overall supervision of the two Departments. The framework plans are objective scientific assessments of the environmental state of the commonages and the impact on them of grazing by sheep. The percentage destocking is directly related to the environmental condition of the commonage and this is reflected in the varying degrees of destocking required across different commonages.</P>
      <P>In October 2002, farmers with commonage land were notified by my Department of their individual stocking levels for 2003 and were told that they had the following three options: to accept the recommended destocking, to have the Department's calculations checked by an agricultural consultant, or to opt out of using their commonage altogether and claim no area-based or REPS payments on it. Farmers who opt out of using their commonage will not be subject to the destocking recommendations, though they must follow any environmental requirements in the relevant framework plan.</P>

      <P>I expect that enlargement will broaden the opportunity for Irish beef exporters to sell a greater proportion of beef products into an enlarged European Union. According to the EU Commission beef production in the CEEC's decreased by 40%, to less than one million tonnes, in the period 1989 to 2001. Production is forecast to decline further in the period to 2009 to some 0.77 million tonnes, while consumption will remain static at one million tonnes. As a result net imports are expected to increase to 214,000 tonnes by 2009. The main beef producing countries among the new members are Poland and the Czech Republic, while Romania, which is among the next group of accession candidates, is also a significant producer of beef.</P>

      <P>As regards a producer who wishes to transfer his-her milk quota to a different dairy-co-operative, he-she may do so provided he-she satisfies the normal transfer conditions i.e. notification of the transfer is given in accordance with time limits and he-she commences deliveries to the new co-op. I am not considering removing the existing ring fencing provisions.</P>

      <P>At the end of December 2002, a total of 6,900 participants were in receipt of pensions under the 1994 scheme of early retirement from farming and 1,265 were in payment under the new scheme that commenced in November 2000. At that time, some 500 other applications for the new scheme were being processed.</P>

      <P>249. <b>Mr. P. McGrath</b> asked the Minister for Agriculture and Food if in relation to the recent changes in the farm retirement scheme, the Minister will confirm if the present income ceiling for farmers by which those pensioners are prevented from benefiting from state pensions will be removed.

      <P>The changes I recently announced relate to the 1994 scheme of early retirement from farming. These changes were approved by the European Commission and remove the obligation on transferees to have enlargement land and to engage in farming as a main occupation once five years' participation in the scheme has been completed.</P>
      <P>The changes have no bearing on the provision in both the 1994 scheme and the new scheme that the early retirement pension may be granted only as a supplement to any national retirement pension that the participant, and his or her spouse or partner in a joint management arrangement, may receive. This provision is a requirement of the European Council Regulations governing the two schemes.</P>

      <P>The Central Statistics Office is responsible for the collection of statistics in relation to imports of meat and meat preparations. The following tables, which were complied from data supplied by that office, set out the details requested by the Deputy. In relation to the tables the following points should be noted: data is not available for the last quarter of 2002; in certain cases the record of import may include the re-import of Irish products that were originally the subject of an export from this country; the information available for imports from member states of the European Union does not differentiate between imports originating in the EU country and those originating from third countries that may already be in free circulation within the Community.</P>
      <P>On a more general point, it should be noted that under EU harmonised rules, imports into the European Union from third countries must have been sourced in premises and in countries which are approved by the European Commission and which are subject to veterinary audits by the EU's food and veterinary office. In addition, such imports are subject to checks on import laid down in harmonised rules prescribed at European level, and must be accompanied by veterinary health certification from the authorities in the country of export.</P>

      <Quest>the reason a person (details supplied) in County Sligo has not received area aid extensification payment for 2001; if there will be any difficulties with the payment for 2002; if, when the payment is released, a Department official will make contact with this person to ensure payment is issued; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <P>The person named participated in 2001 extensification premium opting for the simplified <Col N="211" /> system. He undertook to maintain a stocking density of less than 1.60 livestock units per hectare for each and every day of 2001.</P>
      <P>Under EU regulations, prior to payment, the Department is required to carry out CMMS based stocking density cross-checks to ensure that chosen stocking density payment limits are not breached. In this case cross-checks were carried out at 1 June and 15 October 2001. Respective stocking densities of 1.0226 and 1.6060 livestock units per hectare were found at the dates in question and accordingly the person named was found ineligible for 2001 extensification premium. In order that the person named could check the accuracy of the findings at 15 October 2001, a CMMS based herd profile showing the eartag number and date of birth of each bovine animal over the age of six months present on the holding on 15 October 2001 issued to him on 18 December 2002. He did not revert to the Department to confirm any discrepancies that appeared on the profile which when corrected might bring the stocking density of the holding to less than 1.60 livestock units per hectare on the date in question. An official from my Department was in touch with the person named in recent days in the matter. The person named has stated that some discrepancies appear on the profile and that he has now passed it to his farm adviser with a view to having the discrepancies notified to the Department for updating in early course.</P>
      <P>On receipt of the updated information in the Department, the matter will be attended to without delay and if it can be established that the stocking density of the holding was less than 1.60 livestock units per hectare on 15 October 2001, the person named should qualify for payment of 2001 extensification premium at the rate of &euro;66 per eligible animal.</P>
      <P>Payment of 2002 extensification premium is not scheduled to commence until June 2003. Prior to payment CMMS based stocking density cross-checks will be carried out and eligibility on stocking density grounds cannot be established until then.</P>

      <P>The Central Statistics Office is responsible for the collection of statistics in relation to imports. The total amount of beef imported in 2001, the last full year for which statistics are available, was 17,310 tonnes of which 8,385 tonnes was imported directly from third countries. The CSO does not collect details of the names of importers and distributors of beef.</P>

    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="TomParlonPD" hpid="Mr. Parlon Mr. Parlon">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Finance (Mr. Parlon)</NameTxt>
      <P>At the request of Dublin City Council the Office of Public Works provided assistance following the severe flooding on 14-15 November 2002. This included some emergency works to the rear of houses off Tolka Road, which were in danger of subsiding, by constructing a new concrete wall, in the weeks after the flooding. Some trees, which were obstructing water flow, were also removed.</P>
      <P>The city council has also asked the Office of Public Works for funding to carry out some flood alleviation measures which were identified in the interim report on the River Tolka catchment. The Office of Public Works has agreed to undertake emergency works in the form of the maintenance cleaning of the channel from Distillery Weir in Drumcondra to Glasnevin, to remove accumulated silt and debris in order to maximise channel capacity in this area. As part of the emergency works, embankments are being constructed from Woodville Road footbridge upstream along both sides of Griffith Park.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is also a detailed package of works agreed, which is the subject of a public consultation procedure by the city council as required by Part 8 of the Planning and Development Regulations. These measures include the raising or construction of walls and embankments at various locations between Glasnevin and Drumcondra, replacement and raising of Woodville Road <Col N="221" /> footbridge, and also the raising of some ground upstream of Tolka Park. Council officials hope to put the report on the Part 8 public consultation before the March meeting of Dublin City Council for approval. If it is approved, work on these measures will take place immediately thereafter.</P>
    <P>I am sure the Deputy will also be aware that the Government approved the initiation of an <i>ex-gratia </i>scheme of humanitarian assistance on the 19 November 2002 to relieve hardship arising from the severe flooding of people's homes. The scheme is being administered by the Irish Red Cross Society and almost 600 applications have been received. Approximately 65% of all applications were from the Dublin area and over 95% of these have been finalised at this stage. Average payments are in the region of &euro;8,000. The last few assessments will be made in the next two weeks.</P>
    <P>The Deputy may also be aware that I announced a major review of national flooding policy on the 27 November 2002. The purpose of the review is to assess the extent of the problem countrywide, clarify roles and responsibilities of the various agencies involved and to recommend practical action to deal with flooding. The Insurance Industry Federation, with which I met in December 2002, has been invited to make a <Col N="222" /> submission to the review group and I am hopeful that some useful recommendations, in relation to the insurance problem in areas liable to flooding, will come out of the review. The group is due to produce a report in early autumn.</P>

      <P>There are no specific reliefs under the tax code for donations or contributions to community funds-initiatives, whether made by individuals, local groups or businesses.</P>
      <P>In the Finance Act 2001, I consolidated and significantly extended the schemes of tax reliefs for donations to a variety of approved bodies. These include eligible charities, approved for that purpose by the Revenue Commissioners for more than three years, first, second and third level educational institutions as well as a number of other named bodies. The relief is available in respect of donations by individuals as well as by corporates and is based on donations in any year being in excess of &euro;250. There is no upper limit on the level of donations which can avail of the relief.</P>
      <P>In the Finance Act 2002, I introduced a similar scheme of relief to fund approved capital projects by sports organisations. The scheme is structured in exactly the same way as that for the donations to approved bodies. However, there is an upper limit set in respect of projects estimated to cost in excess of &euro;40 million.</P>
      <P>It may be that certain of the bodies the Deputy is referring to have, or could obtain approval from the Revenue Commissioners as bodies established for charitable purposes only in their own right. As such and subject to the three year rule I mentioned earlier, tax relief would be available for donations to them. Furthermore in certain situations, payments made to community funds/initiatives, for example, for sponsorship may legitimately be characterised as business expenses. These payments would then be deductible for tax purposes in the normal way. The specific circumstances would determine the appropriate tax treatment.</P>
      <P>If the Deputy has any specific community fund-initiative in mind, I suggest that he write to me with the details and I will be happy to arrange to have it followed up at official level.</P>

      <P>The following is the position regarding the Disabled Drivers and Disabled Passengers (Tax Concessions) scheme. In order to qualify for relief under the scheme, the applicant must meet the medical criteria specified in the regulations and be in possession of a primary medical certificate to that effect issued by the appropriate senior area medical officer, who is an official of the relevant health <Col N="224" /> board. Where the issue of the required certificate is refused this can be appealed to the disabled drivers medical board of appeal, an independent body whose decision is final.</P>
      <P>The medical criteria for the purposes of the tax concession under this scheme are as follows: persons who are wholly or almost wholly without the use of both legs; persons who are wholly without the use of one leg and almost wholly without the use of the other leg such that they are severely restricted as to movement of the lower limbs; persons who are without both hands or without both arms; persons who are without one or both legs; persons who are wholly or almost wholly without the use of both hands or arms and wholly or almost wholly without the use of one leg; persons having the medical condition of dwarfism and who have serious difficulties of movement of the lower limbs.</P>
      <P>I understand that the person concerned has been refused a primary medical certificate by the relevant heath board and that they have appealed the decision to the disabled drivers medical board of appeal. I have no function in the determination of whether a person meets the strict medical criteria in order to qualify for the various concessions under the scheme.</P>

      <P>General regulations in regard to sick leave are set out in a number of Department of Finance circulars; Circulars 25/78 and 7/78 are particularly relevant. Certain provisions, in particular those relating to retirement on ill health grounds, also exist within section 9 of the Civil Service Regulation Act, 1956. Other issues relating to sick leave may arise consequent on various social welfare legislation and regulations.</P>
      <P>The general position is that staff who are absent from work through sickness are required, if their illness persists for more than two working days, to produce a medical certificate. Staff returning from sick leave are expected to report for duty on the third day or at the expiry date of their medical certificate(s). Staff are expected to resume duty promptly on their return to full health &ndash; they may not, for example, take annual leave immediately following a period of sick leave.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Sometimes, a medical examination may be sought for other reasons. Staff may, for example, be asked to attend the chief medical officer in order to obtain a second opinion as to the nature of their incapacity, to ascertain the cause of per<Col N="225" /> sistent sick leave or to fulfil the requirements of the regulations relating to retirement on ill health grounds. In particular cases where staff pay A1 PRSI contributions, certain social welfare regulations may also require medical certification for payment of benefits.</P>
    <P>In some cases, staff may be asked to attend for medical examination in order to certify their fitness, or not, to resume work. This situation may arise if, for example, the officer concerned has been absent for a protracted period and if it is judged that there is a legitimate cause for affirming their fitness to resume duty; for example in order to satisfy management that there is no risk on health and safety grounds to either the officer involved or their work colleagues, following resumption.</P>
    <P>As can be seen from this reply, the circumstances where a professional medical input may be required are potentially diverse. If the Deputy has a particular issue in mind, he may like to contact me directly and I will attempt to secure more precise information.</P>

      <P>As of 31 December 2002, there are a total of 640 appeal cases, technically, &ldquo;reviews&rdquo;, on hand in the Office of the Information Commissioner. The breakdown of these appeals in terms of the year of receipt of the appeal is as follows: 1999 &ndash;  seven cases; 2000 &ndash;  85 cases; 2001 &ndash; 264 cases; 2002 &ndash; 284 cases; total &ndash; 640 cases.</P>
      <P>All review applications received since 1 April 2002 are being dealt with immediately by the Office of the Information Commissioner. These cases are not being delayed pending the clearing of the historical backlog of arrears cases. It is the commissioner's objective, in relation to review applications received since 1 April 2002, that to the greatest extent possible they should be decided within the three month guideline timescale provided for at section 34(3)(<i>b</i>) of the Freedom of Information Act 1997.</P>
      <P>Cases received prior to 1 April 2002 will continue to be processed alongside the more current cases. The commissioner envisages that it may, unfortunately, take two to three years to clear this backlog. The commissioner will, however, keep all of his working arrangements &ndash; including those for dealing with the arrears cases &ndash; under regular review.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On its establishment in 1998 the office had a staffing complement of nine. I have sanctioned a further ten posts in 2000, but the impact of this reinforcement on the arrears situation was less<Col N="226" /> ened by delays in recruiting and selecting them, which resulted in the office not reaching its full strength until October 2001.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy)</NameTxt>
      <P>I refer the Deputy to my reply to Questions Nos. 133, 134 and 142 of 11 December 2002, as follows:</P>
      <P>As the Deputy may be aware, the McDowell Group recommended that the existing functions of the Registrar of Friendly Societies, in relation to credit unions, should be brought into the Single Regulatory Authority, SRA, proposed by the Group and that a statutory position of Registrar of Credit Unions should be established within the SRA. Finally, the Group recommended that the supervision of the credit unions by the SRA should be done in a way that would recognise and be supportive of &ldquo;the uniqueness of credit unions and would give comfort that their voluntary character would not be threatened by the establishment of the SRA while still addressing the appropriate regulatory and consumer protection requirements that arise&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>In October 2000, my officials informed me that the Legislative Committee of the Irish League of Credit Unions, ILCU, had asked if we would open consultations with them concerning how we would envisage credit unions being regulated within a single regulatory authority. My officials indicated to me that they intended to respond to the request by outlining to the ILCU how we would envisage the McDowell proposal for a statutory Registrar of Credit Unions might operate. I was happy for my officials to talk to the League on this basis and there were three meetings between then and May 2001.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the course of those meetings, my officials outlined proposals on how the Registrar would be dealt with in the proposed legislation. I should point out that no agreement was drawn up with the League regarding the provisions to be included in the Central Bank and Financial Services Authority of Ireland Bill, 2002. <Col N="227" /> However, I do accept that the League had an expectation as to the provisions that would be in the Bill, based on these meetings. The Bill, as published, reflected what they had been told.</P>
    <P>I should say that credit unions have been regulated under separate legislation from the financial institutions, viz. the Credit Union Act 1997. The Bill provides that this will continue to be the case. The functions of the Registrar of Friendly Societies under the Credit Union Act will be carried out by a Registrar of Credit Unions within the overall framework of the Regulatory Authority, but the basis of that regulation will continue to be the Credit Union Act, 1997. I have no intention of changing this basic position.</P>
    <P>However, both the interim Irish Financial Services Regulatory Authority, which I established in April 2002 to manage the transition to the new regulatory arrangements, and the Governor of the Central Bank, expressed reservations regarding the reporting arrangements for the Registrar of Credit Unions within the proposed Regulatory Authority. Separately, the European Central Bank had expressed reservations about the autonomous position of the Registrar within the overall structure. In the context of these concerns, I felt obliged to look again at the provisions in relation to the Registrar.</P>
    <P>I have, therefore, signalled my intention to propose amendments at Committee Stage of the Bill, which would alter the reporting relationship of the Registrar of Credit Unions, to bring the position more fully within the framework of the Irish Financial Services Regulatory Authority. The reporting relationship of the Registrar would be similar to that proposed for the Consumer Director; as the Bill is published, the Registrar is not subject to the control or direction of the Regulatory Authority in carrying out or exercising the Registrar's responsibilities or powers with respect to the registration of credit unions or the supervision of their affairs or activities and the proposed amendments are designed to correct this.</P>
    <P>The changes I am proposing allow for the credit unions continuing to be regulated separately and distinctly under the Credit Union Act, 1997. Indeed correspondence between the interim IFSRA and the ILCU has confirmed that this is the case.</P>
    <P>In that regard, I understand that the new chief executive-designate and the acting secretary to the interim Irish Financial Services Regulatory Authority, IFSRA, have written recently to the Irish League of Credit Unions in relation to the manner in which they intend that credit unions should be regulated: the members of the interim IFSRA recognise and understand the important role that the credit union movement plays in this country; they recognise both the size and reach of the move<Col N="228" /> ment, its not-for-profit and voluntary nature and its broad support among the communities, which it serves; they recognise that credit unions have different functions and objectives to commercial financial institutions, such as banks and building societies, and that the regulation of the credit union movement must be appropriate to those functions and objectives; they highlight that, for this reason, the Government, in making clear its acceptance of all these principles, is proposing a separate statutory post of registrar of credit unions who will work under the requirements and protections of the Credit Union Act; the IFSRA wants to work positively with the ILCU. In this regard, it has stated that it is open to discussing the valuable role that the ILCU's field officers play in assisting league members; and the IFSRA's only concern with the legislation as currently drafted is the accountability of the registrar of credit unions.</P>
    <P>I would like to stress that the supervision of credit unions by the new regulatory authority should not be viewed as a threat to the movement, but rather as a development that will work to the advantage of the credit union movement and member-customers of credit unions.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The Deputy might like to be aware that both I and officials of my Department have recently met credit union representatives in this regard. I would hope to be in a position to explain the outcome of these discussions when the matter comes before the Finance and Public Services committee of Dáil Éireann in the near future.</P>

      <P>I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that the inspector of taxes has no record of having received an application for a refund of tax from the taxpayer. The inspector's records indicate that the taxpayer paid no income tax during the 1999/2000 tax year and that she paid the correct amount of tax in 2000/2001 and in the short tax year 2001. The inspector does not have sufficient information to determine the taxpayer's tax liability for 2002. The taxpayer should obtain her form P60, certificate of pay, tax and pay-related social insurance, for 2002 and send it to her inspector of taxes, together with any information which the taxpayer wishes to include as to why she may be due a refund. When the inspector of taxes receives the information required the taxpayer's liability will be reviewed. If it is found that the taxpayer has overpaid tax, the inspector of taxes will refund the overpaid tax as quickly as possible.</P>

      <P>Financial Resolution No. 1 of budget 2003 is an anti-avoidance measure aimed at closing off an unintended use of capital allowances by passive investors in the area of electrical generation. In recent years, I have taken action against a number of tax avoidance schemes which used tax incentives in artificial ways to reduce effective tax rates on high incomes to very low levels. For example, in the 1998 budget, I took action against &ldquo;asset-backed&rdquo; schemes, where individual passive investors used special incentive reliefs in relation to expenditure on certain buildings so as to reduce the tax liability on their employment income. If unchecked, schemes such as these would allow individuals with high income to avoid paying their fair share of tax to the disadvantage of the general body of taxpayers. This resolution is entirely consistent with my approach, in other instances in recent years, of ring-fencing losses and capital allowances for passive investors so that they prevent a reduction in tax on their employment income. The measure is targeted at passive investors who do not participate in such businesses in an active way. It was estimated at the time of the budget that this anti-avoidance measure would prevent tax leakage of up to &euro;10 million per year for the next five to eight years.</P>
      <P>The alternative energy requirement programme is the primary state support mechanism for renewable electricity generation. AER offers a guaranteed price for the power produced through a 15 year power purchase agreement with the ESB. Successful applicants are those who comply with the terms and conditions of the competition and who offer to sell the electricity to the ESB at the lowest price at or below the cap price previously notified to the market in each technology in the published terms and conditions of the competition. Five AER programmes were held since 1995. AER VI was held late last year. The total number of megawatts to be provided for by AER V and AER VI combined will be 500MW, the target of additional electricity generating capacity from renewable sources provided for in the Green Paper on Sustainable Energy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As the Deputy is aware, section 62 of the 1998 Finance Act, section 486B of the Taxes Consolidation Act, introduced a scheme of relief for corporate investment in certain renewable energy <Col N="230" /> projects. The relief takes the form of a deduction for tax purposes from a company's profits for an investment in new ordinary shares in a company setting up a renewable energy project. EU Commission approval was obtained for the scheme until March 2002. However, I extended the relief in the Finance Act 2002 until 31 December 2004 and EU Commission approval for this extension is awaited.</P>

      <P>The position is that in Finance Act 2001, I merged and standardised the conditions of the four tax reliefs for third level education into a single relief. The scope of the relief was also considerably widened. Generally speaking, the tax relief now covers tuition fees paid by undergraduate students in Ireland and elsewhere in the EU. It also applies to tuition fees paid by postgraduate students both here and abroad. Undergraduate courses, which may be full or part time, must be of at least two academic years' duration while postgraduate courses must be of at least one, but not more than four, academic years' duration. Tax relief is available up to a maximum of &euro;3,175 per annum at the standard rate of tax.</P>
      <P>The relief is restricted to tuition fees paid and does not include amounts paid in respect of registration fees, maintenance or other expenses incurred by third level students. I have no plans at present to change the relief as suggested by the Deputy.</P>

      <P>Following the severe flooding in Dublin City from the River Tolka on 14 and 15 November, 2002, the consultants, engaged in the study of the Tolka River catchment, were asked to prepare an interim report, outlining any measures which might be undertaken to alleviate flooding in the worst affected areas. A report was presented to Dublin City Council and the Office of Public Works, which contained a number of recommendations aimed at reducing the risk of flooding in these areas.</P>
      <P>Following detailed examination of the interim report the Office of Public Works and Dublin City Council have now agreed a package of works to be carried out on the River Tolka in the Glasnevin and Drumcondra areas of Dublin City. These agreed works will be undertaken by Office of Public Works on behalf of the city council. The proposed works are currently the subject of a public consultation procedure by the city council as required by Part 8 of the planning and development regulations. Included in this are the raising or construction of walls and embankments at various locations between Glasnevin and Drumcondra, replacement and raising of Woodville Road footbridge, and also the raising of some ground upstream of Tolka Park. I am advised that city council officials hope to put the report on the Part 8 public consultation before the March meeting of Dublin City Council for approval. If it is approved, work on these measures will take place immediately thereafter. In the interim the city council are also consulting with the relevant bodies in relation to any environmental implications of the proposed works. The agreed programme of works will be funded by Office of Public Works and is expected to cost in the region of &euro;600,000 &ndash;&euro;700,000. The Deputy will be aware that in addition to the above, Office of Public Works is already undertaking emergency works in the form of the maintenance cleaning of the channel from Distillery Weir in Drumcondra to Glasnevin, to remove accumulated silt and debris in order to maximise channel capacity in this area and construction of embankments from Woodville Road footbridge upstream along both sides of Griffith Park.</P>

Given the requirements for site investigations, detailed design of the works, public consultation and public procurement procedures, and <Col N="232" /> environmental considerations it would take quite a considerable time to implement all the recommendations of the interim report. The concern of the city council and Office of Public Works has been to devise a package of works which can be carried out before next winter and which will provide a substantial degree of protection should similar flood events recur. I am conscious also that the full report on the River Tolka catchment is due to be completed in May and will provide additional information on which decisions in relation to the entire Tolka catchment can be made.</P>

      <P>During the Office of Public Works' restoration of Dublin Castle in the 1980s the clock face in the Bedford Tower in the upper courtyard of Dublin Castle was removed for restoration. This clock face dates from c.1900 and is not the original clock face which was completely weathered and was restored by Henry Spring and Company of Dublin in 1987 before being replaced in Bedford Tower. The original mechanism is too worn to run the clock face but has been left in place. An electronic mechanism has been installed alongside this to ensure that the clock keeps good time.</P>
      <P>When this now restored clock face was removed, an older, marble clock face was found behind it. This clock face dates from the mid 18th century and it is thought to be the original clock face. However, given its condition and the material used in its construction, it was not amenable to restoration. It now stands on display in Castle Hall, which is directly behind the Bedford Tower.</P>

      <P>In order to promote the provision of park and ride facilities in the Finance Act 1999, I introduced accelerated capital allowances of up to 100% for capital expenditure on the construction or refurbishment of park and ride developments in or near designated urban areas which provide parking facilities for commuters using public transport. Relief is also available for expenditure on the construction or refurbishment of related residential developments which are located at park and ride facilities. Guidelines on the operation of the scheme were issued by the Minister for the Environment and Local Government in August 1999. The guidelines set out various criteria which a park and ride development and residential developments which are located at park and ride facilities must meet in order to qualify under the scheme. Certification of a development for the purposes of obtaining relief under the scheme is carried out by certain local authorities.</P>
      <P>The Finance Act 1999 also provided for capital allowances for commercial developments located at these park and ride facilities. Guidelines in relation to the commercial development element of these park and ride facilities were issued in July 2001 after discussions with EU Commission officials on State aid rules.

      <P>The European Commission decided recently to undertake a comprehensive study on the use of daytime running lights. The general aim of the project is to assess the positive road safety effects of daytime running lights use and to investigate possible and perceived negative effects including effects on vulnerable road users such as pedestrians and motorcyclists. It is intended that the results of the study should inform the future requirements of the European Union in this regard.</P>
      <P>A pilot campaign by Dublin City Council to encourage the use of daytime running lights on a voluntary basis in the greater Dublin area has recently been completed.

      <P>Pending the outcome of the comprehensive European Commission's study, the Minister for Transport does not propose to make any decision in regard to the use of daytime running lights in Ireland. Consequently, I do not propose to issue any instructions on the matter at this time.</P>

      <P>As the Deputy is aware, capital allowances are currently available for the construction or refurbishment of buildings or structures in use for the purposes of the trade of hotel keeping. The existing legislation does not grant any specific entitlement to capital allowances in relation to the construction or refurbishment of guest houses. To grant such an entitlement to guest houses generally would <Col N="239" /> greatly widen the tax relief leading to a significant erosion of the tax base. Also, it may lead to calls to extend the regime to bed and breakfasts and other tourist accommodation facilities.</P>
      <P>However, under the current legislation, capital allowances may be available in limited circumstances in relation to the construction or refurbishment of a guest house which is open to all comers, if the number of rooms in the building, the standard of the facilities available and extent of the services provided in the building are similar to those which would be found in a hotel, that is, where the claimant proves that the trade of hotel-keeping is, in fact, being carried on in the building.</P>
      <P>As there is currently a need to widen the tax base rather than narrow it, there are no plans to grant any specific entitlement in relation to the construction or refurbishment of guest houses generally in the capital allowances regime.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 286 and 289 together.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will be aware that in 2002 the Office of Public Works, in conjunction with Kildare County Council, initiated a programme of flood alleviation works at various locations on the Lyreen, Meadowbrook, and Morell Rivers. Work on the Lyreen and Meadowbrook Rivers has been completed. Works to bridges on the Morrell have been completed and work to embankments partially completed. The remaining works were suspended with the onset of winter and adverse weather conditions. This work will be completed as early as possible in the current year.</P>
      <P>Discussions between Office of Public Works and the county council are continuing in relation to flooding at Maynooth, Straffan, Ardclough and Leixlip. The Office of Public Works will consider any proposals for further works which may emerge from these discussions in the context of existing commitments and the many requests for flood relief works and funding which are on hands from other local authorities.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will be aware that I have established a group to review Government policy on flood relief. The purpose of the review is to assess the causes and extent of the problem countrywide, assess the impact of flooding on different sectors of society, clarify roles and responsibilities of the various agencies involved, establish criteria for the prioritisation of expenditure, examine the extent and adequacy of existing powers and processes, identify strategies to manage any increase in the present extent of areas at risk of flooding with particular reference to current predictions regarding the effects of climate change, and consider criteria for initiation of any future humanitarian aid schemes. I regard this as a priority and have asked the group to report to me by August of this year.</P>

      <Quest>the cost of the flood alleviation measures recommended by the consultants in their November 2002 preliminary report on the River Tolka; the cost of the works in phase one; the reason for the very considerable disparity involved; and the reason that the works recommended by the consultants as urgent are not being carried out in full.</Quest>

    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="TomParlonPD" hpid="Mr. Parlon Mr. Parlon">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Finance (Mr. Parlon)</NameTxt>
      <P>The interim report produced for Dublin City Council by the consultants on the River Tolka catchment study included a total of 21 recommendations on flood alleviation measures. These recommendations were estimated to cost in the region of &euro;6.2 million. The <Col N="241" /> consultants also recommended that a further study &ndash; the Dublin coastal zone study &ndash; which had already been under consideration by Dublin City Council, should be carried out. The estimated cost of this study is &euro;1.1 million and I understand that the city council is pursuing this.</P>
      <P>Following detailed examination of the interim report the Office of Public Works and Dublin City Council have now agreed a package of works to be carried out on the River Tolka in the Glasnevin and Drumcondra areas of Dublin city. These agreed works will be undertaken by the Office of Public Works on behalf of the city council. The proposed works are currently the subject of a public consultation procedure by the city council as required by Part 8 of the planning and development regulations. Included in this are the raising or construction of walls and embankments at various locations between Glasnevin and Drumcondra, replacement and raising of Woodville Road footbridge, and also the raising of some ground upstream of Tolka Park. I am advised that city council officials hope to put the report on the Part 8 public consultation before the March meeting of Dublin City Council for approval. If it is approved, work on these measures will take place immediately thereafter.</P>
      <P>In the interim, the city council is also consulting the relevant bodies in relation to any environmental implications of the proposed works. The agreed programme of works will be funded by the Office of Public Works and is expected to cost in the region of &euro;600,000 to &euro;700,000. The Deputy will be aware that in addition to the above, the Office of Public Works is already undertaking emergency works in the form of the maintenance cleaning of the channel from Distillery Weir in Drumcondra to Glasnevin, to remove accumulated silt and debris in order to maximise channel capacity in this area and construction of embankments from Woodville Road footbridge upstream along both sides of Griffith Park.</P>
      <P>Not all of the recommendations contained in the interim report are being carried out at this time. Given the requirements for site investigations, detailed design of the works, public consultation and public procurement procedures and environmental considerations, it would take a considerable time to implement all the recommendations of the interim report. The concern of the city council and Office of Public Works has been to devise a package of works which can be carried out before next winter and which will provide a substantial degree of protection should similar flood events recur. I am conscious also that the full report on the River Tolka catchment is due to be completed in May and will provide additional information on which decisions in relation to the entire Tolka catchment can be made.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy)</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand that a scheme of community support for older people is operated by the Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs. The purpose of this scheme is to provide funding for initiatives to improve the security and social support of vulnerable older people. Under the terms of the scheme, grant aid is available towards the once-off cost of purchase and installation of: small-scale physical security equipment such as strengthening of doors and windows, window locks, door chains and security lighting; and socially-monitored alarm systems, such as the pendant alarm system which is operated via the telephone and is worn around the neck or wrist.</P>
      <P>Annual monitoring fees or maintenance fees associated with socially-monitored alarm systems are not provided for under the scheme. As these fees are levied by private service providers, I understand that the Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs has no role in setting, abolishing, waiving or reducing such fees.</P>
      <P>As regards the VAT treatment of such services, in general, VAT applies equally to all individuals irrespective of status. The VAT rating of goods and services is largely subject to the requirements of EU VAT law with which Irish VAT law must comply. While we can maintain the zero rating on those goods and services which were zero-rated before 1 January 1991 the monitoring services do not fall within this category. Since we cannot introduce any new zero rate of VAT, we cannot therefore relieve such services as referred to by the Deputy. Under the Value Added Tax (Refund of Tax) No. 15 Order 1981, it is possible to obtain a VAT refund in respect of the purchase of a pendant alarm system, as it is considered a medical device for the purpose of this refund order. Applicants should contact Revenue Commissioners, VAT Repayment (Unregistered Section), Kilrush Road, Ennis, County Clare.</P>

There are also other issues such as safety, design, and maintenance to be borne in mind. These matters can be discussed with the city council after the feasibility report is received.</P>

      <P>The Civil Service currently makes provision for staff to avail of a leave of absence from their post in the Civil Service and continue to work in this jurisdiction in four main circumstances. These are set out as follows: (1) Special leave for the purposes of self-employment. (Department of Finance Circular 19/98: Special Leave without Pay for Career Breaks, paragraph 12) &ndash; a career break of up to three years may be granted for purposes of genuine self-employment provided there is no potential conflict of interest between the self-employment in which the officer proposes to engage and his-her position in the Civil Service. It also states that the officer should not undertake any consultancy work, or provide any service in return for payment, for his-her own Department or any other Department while on career break.</P>
      <P>(2) Special leave to set up a business. (Statement of policy made in the Dáil on 1 June 1978; and Department of Finance Circular 19/98: Special Leave without Pay for Career Breaks, paragraph 13) &ndash; civil servants may also be granted special leave without pay, up to a limit of five years, for the purposes of starting up a new business with genuine employment potential. In order to qualify for such leave, proposals must be submitted to show that the establishment of the business will provide at least four new permanent jobs. The usual period allowed is one year but this may be extended if there is proof of the development of the business.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(3) Temporary staff transfers. (Department of Finance Circular 10/79: Temporary Staff Transfers (Lateral Mobility) within the Public Sector) &ndash; this scheme allows for the temporary transfer of middle management staff in the Civil Service to other parts of the public sector, inside or outside the State, and occasionally to the private sector. This scheme is intended to give civil servants an opportunity to broaden their skills and acquire <Col N="245" /> new work experiences. Transfers are on a voluntary basis and will normally be of not less than six months and not more than two years' duration.</P>
    <P>(4) Secondment of Civil Service staff to outside bodies. (Guidance note from Department of Finance) &ndash; civil servants can also avail of provisions for special leave with pay on secondment to outside bodies with close links to the Civil Service for a period of up to five years, during which time they retain the benefit of Civil Service status and continue to be eligible for promotion.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied with the current arrangements providing for leave of absences to work in this jurisdiction and have no plans to introduce any additional arrangements.</P>

The general industrial buildings allowance of 4% per annum over 25 years will apply to expenditure incurred on the construction or refurbishment of such buildings or structures from that date. Transitional provisions will apply which will provide for the continued availability of the special regime subject to certain conditions. Further details of these provisions will be contained in the Finance Bill 2003, which is due for publication on 6 February 2003. The new hotel capital allowance regime is a general regime and applies to all regions of the country. There are no plans to introduce a separate regime based on geographical location or any other such criteria.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 299 and 300 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Ireland has participated actively in negotiations for a new World Trade Organisation global trade round. These negotiations commenced at Doha in 2001 and are expected to conclude in 2005. The new trade round, known as the Doha Development Agenda, is the first such round to accept that development must be at the heart of the international trade policy agenda. The integration of developing countries into the world trading system and the global economy is a central theme <Col N="247" /> of this agenda. The agenda spans market access, trade-related capacity-building, least developed countries and special and differential treatment. It moves the WTO into a new era. The WTO will be able to play a fuller role in the pursuit of economic growth, employment and poverty reduction, in global governance, and in the promotion of sustainable development, while maintaining its key function of improving the conditions for worldwide trade and investment.</P>
    <P>A major obligation on all developed countries arising out of the Doha Development Agenda is to help strengthen the trade capacity of developing countries. In this regard, since 2002, Ireland has been contributing from a fund of &euro;1.5 million to relevant multilateral institutions involved in trade-related capacity-building and technical assistance. The single largest Ireland Aid programme in the area of trade capacity building is support for the establishment and operation of the WTO Law Advisory Centre. The Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment has contributed $1 million to the centre's endowment fund and Ireland Aid is contributing $250,000 annually for five years to help fund the centre's running costs. This centre will assist developing countries, particularly the least developed countries, to take advantage of their legal rights under the WTO's dispute settlement mechanism.</P>
    <P>In addition, Ireland Aid has contributed to the special trust fund subscribed to by international donors for trade capacity-building, set up by the WTO in 2002, to advance the Doha Development Agenda. Ireland is participating in discussions at the OECD Development Assistance Committee on trade-related capacity building and is seeking to base its intervention in this area with developing countries on the OECD guidelines for trade capacity building.</P>
    <P>Ireland has also been involved centrally in the EU's Everything but Arms initiative for the least developed countries. Under this initiative, which was adopted in February 2001, the least developed countries both within and outside the African, Caribbean and Pacific &ndash; ACP &ndash; group, have gained duty and quota free admission to the European Union market for all but three products from March 2001. In three sensitive commodity sectors full and free access will be achieved more slowly and on a phased basis by 2006 for bananas and by 2009 for rice and sugar. This initiative is a particularly significant breakthrough for the least developed countries, as it offers free market access in areas such as agricultural and textile products in which they are most likely to be competitive and which up to now have been highly protected.</P>
    <P>Ireland has ratified the EU-ACP Cotonou Partnership Agreement, which is expected to enter into force shortly between the EU and the 77 ACP states. One of the main pillars of this agreement is economic and trade co-operation. The current all-ACP non-reciprocal tariff prefer<Col N="248" /> ences will be maintained until 31 December 2007. From 2008, a set of reciprocal economic partnership agreements or alternative trade arrangements will normally replace them, following negotiations that commenced in September 2002. These agreements should be compatible with the rules of the WTO. ACP countries are invited to sign as groups or individually, building on their own regional integration schemes. The least developed countries are entitled to maintain non-reciprocal preferences. The agreement also contains a comprehensive programme of action to support the private sector.</P>
    <P>The Government's national programme of assistance to poorer countries comprises two elements. The major component is my Department's Vote for international co-operation, &euro;373 million in 2003, while elements of official development assistance &ndash; ODA &ndash; are also administered by other Departments.</P>
    <P>ODA comprises bilateral assistance, which is aid provided directly by Ireland to developing countries, and multilateral assistance, which is aid channelled through international organisations. Support is provided under each heading for a wide range of development programmes and organisations. Total ODA has increased dramatically in recent years, rising from &euro;177 million in 1998 to an expected &euro;450 million in 2003. Figures for the last five years &ndash; the amounts for 2002 are provisional &ndash; are set out in the following table:</P>

      <P>Ireland supports an independent inquiry into the death of the person referred to in the Deputy's question. The European Union issued a declaration to this end on 5 February 2001. The EU expects Ukraine, as a democratic state, to meet its responsibilities to uphold the rule of law and the freedom of the media, including ensuring that a full investigation of the case to which the Deputy refers takes place.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I remain concerned at the lack of progress in bringing the investigation to fruition. I raised the case directly with the Ukrainian Minister for Foreign Affairs, Mr. Zlenko, when I last met him at <Col N="249" /> the UN General Assembly in New York, on 10 November 2001. My Department has also raised the matter at official level with the Ukrainian authorities in October last.</P>
    <P>The issues involved relate to the legal framework which would apply to the investigation. In April 2001, Ukraine requested assistance with the investigation from member states of the Council of Europe under the legal framework provided for by the European Convention on Mutual Assistance in Criminal Matters. EU member states are prepared to help establish an independent commission of inquiry, including international investigators as requested in Council of Europe Parliamentary Assembly Recommendation No. 1538.</P>
    <P>Ukraine is to define the form of assistance requested, whether this be investigative expertise, forensic expertise or expertise in mounting prosecutions. The Ukrainian authorities must also provide assurances that foreign experts would be able to work unhindered, with unimpeded access to documentary and other evidence, and to personalities. I will continue to raise the matter in future bilateral contacts with Ukraine.</P>

      <Quest>the steps or measures the Government has taken to follow up the Taoiseach's positive statement at the World Summit in Johannesburg in September 2002 regarding the approach to total debt cancellation, particularly cancelling the debts of countries in the developing world.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>I refer the Deputy to the reply to recent questions on the issue of debt relief I gave to Deputies Costello and Mitchell on 17 December last. In July 2002 my colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Tom Kitt, launched a new Ireland Aid &ndash; Department of Finance strategy in the issue of developing country debt. This comprehensive strategy sets out in detail the Government's approach to the problem and updates the principles on debt relief announced by the Government in 1998.</P>
      <P>The debt relief strategy indicates,<i>inter alia</i>, that the Government believes total debt cancellation to be a politically acceptable objective and one that it would support. However, the strategy also emphasises that the funding of debt cancellation would have to come from additional overseas development assistance from donors.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The strategy raises a number of concerns about the operation of the heavily indebted poor countries &ndash; HIPC &ndash; initiative, such as the adequacy of the existing level of debt relief and the projections and assumptions used in the calculation of sustainable debt levels. The bank and the IMF have admitted that between eight and ten countries emerging from the HIPC process continue to have unsustainable debt levels. In September <Col N="250" /> of last year, the Taoiseach reiterated our commitment in principle to debt cancellation in his address to the World Summit on Sustainable Development in Johannesburg.</P>
    <P>While in Washington last November, the Minister of State, Deputy Kitt, had the opportunity to discuss a wide range of development issues, including debt, with the World Bank. He also briefed Canada, the leader of our constituency at the Bretton Woods institutions, on our views on the debt issue as detailed in our debt strategy.</P>
    <P>Last month, the vice-president for Europe of the World Bank, Mr. Jean Francois Rischard, visited Dublin and had a series of meetings with the Minister for Finance, the Minister of State, Deputy Kitt, and others. At his meeting with Mr. Rischard, the Minister of State laid particular emphasis on the importance we attach to our debt strategy including the issues of debt cancellation and debt sustainability.</P>
    <P>Last week the president of the World Bank, Mr. James Wolfensohn, visited Dublin and had meetings with the Taoiseach and the Minister of State, Deputy Kitt. We again used the opportunity of the visit to promote our debt strategy and our concerns about the effectiveness of the HIPC initiative in reducing debt to sustainable levels.</P>
    <P>My Department, in close co-ordination with the Department of Finance, will continue to promote our views on debt relief in all relevant international fora. In the coming months we will continue to follow closely developments in the HIPC process and participate actively in all relevant international meetings. Our debt strategy will guide us as we seek to ensure that the HIPC countries' efforts to achieve the millennium development goals are not inhibited by a continuing high level of debt and that a sustainable exit from the debt treadmill is secured.</P>

      <P>The Government wants to see the present differences between Iraq and the international community resolved peaceably, through the United Nations. We want to avoid any recourse to unilateral action.</P>
      <P>UN Security Council Resolution 1441, which Ireland supported and worked hard to secure, is designed to avoid war by giving the Iraqi authorities a final chance to comply with their obligation to divest themselves of their chemical, biological and nuclear weapons capabilities. Unfortunately, the Iraqi leadership has refused for more than a decade to comply with this demand, inflicting further wilful suffering on its people. It is a matter of considerable regret that only the credible threat that further non-compliance will lead to military action appears to hold any prospect of inducing a change in this attitude.</P>
      <P>In their report to the Security Council, delivered on Monday, the UN weapons inspectors have made clear that while some progress has been achieved, the co-operation of the Iraqi authorities has fallen short of what is demanded and that they can and must do more to demonstrate that they have met the requirements laid down unanimously by the UN Security Council.</P>
      <P>It is obvious to all that, one way or another, the Iraqi leadership will no longer be permitted to evade its disarmament obligations. Those who suggest otherwise serve only to increase the likelihood of war. In the interests of peace, the Iraqi leadership must be left in no doubt that it has no viable alternative but to comply quickly, fully, and unambiguously with the demands of the Security Council. If it does, then war can be avoided. The fact is that Saddam Hussein could end this confrontation tomorrow by simply ordering his regime to co-operate fully and proactively with the UN inspectors.</P>
      <P>The Government will seek to use all its influence in favour of a peaceful solution. Ireland is no longer a member of the Security Council, but we will continue our efforts, through the UN, the EU and bilateral contacts with the US and others, including the countries of the region.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is the view of the Government that military action against Iraq must be undertaken only as a matter of absolute last resort, to be contemplated only when all other means of pressure have been exhausted. If, however, the Iraqi authorities spurn this last opportunity to meet the demands of the international community, the Security Council must, in the words of Kofi Annan, face up to its responsibilities, by deciding on whatever <Col N="252" /> action is necessary to secure compliance. We have not yet reached that point. The inspectors should be given some more time to test the co-operation of the Iraqi authorities.</P>

      <P>The Government's official development assistance programme, Ireland Aid, funds a wide range of programmes and activities carried out by NGOs, non-governmental organisations, and missionary orders in developing countries.</P>
      <P>Projects supported are poverty focused with a key emphasis on basic education, primary health care, water sanitation, income generation, rural development, urban community development and training. The Minister of State with responsibility for overseas development assistance, Deputy Tom Kitt, has recently announced the establishment of a new, dedicated missionary development fund which will facilitate missionaries in their important development activities. The establishment of a new fund means that missionaries will have, for the first time, a dedicated budget designed to help them carry out development projects at community level. The new fund will be administered by APSO, Agency for Personal Service Overseas, which has established a close working relationship with missionaries over many years. Applications for funding may be made to the Missionary Development Fund, Ireland Aid, Bishops Square, Dublin 2, via the order's house in Ireland.</P>
      <P>All applications for funding need to conform to a detailed set of criteria and guidelines to ensure maximum effectiveness and impact. Applicants for funding must demonstrate a capacity to carry out the tasks envisaged as well as a clear and coherent strategy to achieve the aims and objectives of the project. The guidelines are available from Ireland Aid which can also provide assistance to applicants regarding their particular project to ensure that it falls within the missionary development fund criteria.</P>
      <P>On receipt of a completed application for funding, in this instance, a detailed assessment will be made of the project proposal with a view to possible funding.  </P>

      <P>The European Court of Human Rights, on 4 May 2001, found that in the cases of Jordan <i>v.</i> UK, McKerr <i>v.</i> UK, Kelly and others <i>v.</i> UK and Shanaghan <i>v.</i> UK, the United Kingdom was in breach of its procedural obligation to protect the right to life under Article 2 of the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms, ECHR.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="254" />Since the judgments were delivered, the Government has been closely involved in supervising their execution at the Committee of Ministers of the Council of Europe in Strasbourg.</P>
    <P>Under Article 46 of the ECHR, the judgments have been communicated to the Committee of Ministers, comprising the 44 member states of the Council of Europe, which has the collective responsibility of supervising their execution. While information provided by a State to the Committee of Ministers under Article 46 can be made public, the deliberations within the committee remain confidential.</P>
    <P>The British Government has indicated that it takes the findings of the court very seriously and is determined to comply fully with the judgments. In June 2002, they presented a preliminary discussion document to interested delegations and to the secretariat of the Council of Europe. The paper was subsequently revised and on 9 October 2002 the British Government made available a package of measures which are intended to bring the procedures for the investigation of the use of lethal force by State agents in Northern Ireland into line with the court's judgments and with the UK's procedural obligations under Article 2 of the Convention.</P>
    <P>At the Committee of Ministers' meeting on 9 October 2002, the Irish Permanent Representation stated that the Government would examine the British response. The representation in Strasbourg continues to actively monitor the position and maintains close contact with the Council of Europe secretariat, including on the modalities and timetable for execution of the judgments.</P>
    <P>The human rights directorate of the secretariat is currently carrying out a rigorous and detailed examination of the UK's proposals for implementation of the UK's proposals which it will in due course submit to the Committee of Ministers.</P>
    <P>The Government will be guided by the secretariat's examination in coming to a view on the manner in which the British package of measures implements the court's judgments. Our response to this complex issue, in terms of substance and presentation remains under ongoing consideration. We will also carefully examine the views expressed by other parties since the publication of the British proposals in October 2002.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Population Research Institute, PRI, a private US body, has repeatedly alleged that the UN Fund for Population Activities, UNFPA, has supported coercive policies on family planning in China, including the Chinese Government's one child policy. There have been a number of hearings in the US Congress on the basis of these reports.</P>
      <P>UNFPA has categorically denied that it has facilitated the implementation of coercive family planning methods in China or anywhere else. It has invited a number of independent investigators to examine its Chinese operations to assess whether or not there was any justification for the allegations which PRI has made. Two independent investigations, one commissioned by UNFPA and the second undertaken by a number of British parliamentarians, came to the same conclusion that the UNFPA is not involved in supporting coercive family planning methods in China. Both investigations emphasised that UNFPA is promoting a voluntary approach and is working to encourage the Chinese authorities away from coercive measures.</P>
      <P>The US Administration also carried out its own fact-finding mission to UNFPA's operations in China. This mission which reported in May 2002 also found no support for the allegations made by PRI. The report of the mission, addressed to Secretary of State Colin Powell, found &ldquo;no evidence that UNFPA knowingly participated in the management of a programme of coercive abortion or involuntary sterilisation in China&rdquo; and therefore recommended that &ldquo;the $34 million which has been appropriated should be released to UNFPA.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>In the event the US Administration did not accept the recommendation of its own fact-finding mission and decided to withhold its financial support from UNFPA. This decision was taken by the State Department which voiced concern that it was possible that some of UNFPA's activities &ndash; such as the funding of the purchase of computers &ndash; might unwittingly be used to support China's one child policy. UNFPA has denied this possibility and no investigation to date has found any evidence that this is the case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Both UNFPA and the EU are engaged in a dialogue with the US on its decision to withhold its <Col N="256" /> funding from UNFPA. At the EU Development Council in May 2002, EU member states reaffirmed the importance of the role of UNFPA in reaching the millennium development goals in the areas of infant, child and maternal mortality and restated the EU's firm commitment to continue to support the fund. The European Commission has allocated an additional &euro;20 million to UNFPA.</P>
    <P>In the context of the findings by various independent investigations and from our own bilateral contacts with the Fund, the Government accepts that UNFPA is abiding by its mandate in China. We are also satisfied that UNFPA is playing an important role, particularly in Africa, in helping some of the world's poorest countries to fight HIV-AIDS and to deal with the challenges of infant and maternal mortality. In 2003, Ireland Aid will contribute &euro;2.539 million to the UNFPA in support of its work.</P>

Falun Gong is regarded by the Chinese Government as an evil cult.

      <P>The Government holds both the person and the office of the Dalai Lama in the highest regard and considers him to be a significant force for moderation in the present circumstances which exist in Tibet. He is always welcome to visit Ireland whenever he might wish to come here.</P>
      <P>I wish to assure the Deputy that in its bilateral contacts with China, and through the European Union, Ireland has consistently called on the Chinese Government to fully respect the rights of the Tibetan people and to engage in meaningful dialogue with the Dalai Lama.</P>
      <P>The Taoiseach raised the situation in Tibet during his meeting with the Chinese Premier, Mr. Zhu, in Dublin in September 2001, and called for a dialogue between the affected parties with a view to overcoming the current impasse.</P>
      <P>I reiterated this position during my meeting in Beijing with my Chinese counterpart, Minister Tang, on 23 January of last year. I highlighted, in particular, the level of concern in Ireland in relation to Tibet and strongly encouraged the Chinese authorities to engage in meaningful dialogue with the Dalai Lama on the issues of concern.</P>
      <P>Ireland is also pursuing the issue of Tibet through the EU-China human rights dialogue, which has proven to be the most effective fora in which to raise human rights issues of concern with the Chinese authorities. At the session of the dialogue on 5-6 March 2002, the EU raised its concern about the situation in Tibet, in the context of the political and cultural rights of minorities. The EU put forward its concerns, in particular over the detention of monks, closure of monasteries, and discrimination in population control policies.</P>
      <P>The EU will continue to raise these concerns at all appropriate opportunities, including at the forthcoming EU-China human rights dialogue, to be held in Athens on 5-6 March 2003.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="260" />The issue was also raised at the 58th session of the UN Commission on Human Rights, which took place last March in Geneva. In its statement on the human rights situation worldwide, the EU highlighted the situation in China, and Tibet in particular.</P>
    <P>Ireland will seek to ensure that the human rights situation in China, including Tibet, is adequately addressed in any statement made by the EU at the forthcoming 59th session of the UN Commission on Human Rights, scheduled to be held in Geneva in March-April 2003.</P>
    <P>Ireland will continue to raise its concerns regarding the situation of Tibet in its bilateral contacts with the Chinese authorities, and urges respect for the rights of the Tibetan people and support for genuine dialogue with the Dalai Lama.</P>

      <P>I have repeatedly called on the Israeli Government and the Palestinian Authority to pursue the path of peace through negotiations. Most recently, on 27 January, I issued a statement deploring the loss of life resulting from Israeli military action in Gaza on 26 January. It has always been Ireland's position that closures, restrictions on movement and collective punishments are both contrary to international humanitarian law, including the Fourth Geneva Convention, and counterproductive in the search for peace. Demolitions, whether of homes or of businesses, constitute a form of collective punishment. These views have been made known to the Israeli Government and their diplomatic representatives in Ireland on many occasions and have been the subject of numerous statements by the Government.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. N. Dempsey Mr. N. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Mr. N. Dempsey)</NameTxt>
      <P>The National Educational Psychological Service, NEPS, does not keep a waiting list of all children awaiting psychological assessment. Instead, there is effectively a waiting list kept in each school, by the school principal or by a nominated contact teacher. During the first visit of the academic year made to a school by its assigned <Col N="261" /> psychologist, there is a discussion about the school's priorities for psychological support during the coming year, including the needs of children who have been identified as possibly needing psychological assessment.</P>
      <P>In line with my Department's policy, as outlined in the &ldquo;Learning Support Guidelines&rdquo;, NEPS operates a staged model of assessment. This is explained in its leaflet &ldquo;Working together to make a difference for Children.&rdquo; A copy of the leaflet will be made available to the Deputy.</P>
      <P>At the first stage of the assessment process, parents and class-subject teachers meet to discuss their concerns and to devise an individualised programme to meet the child's needs. If significant concerns remain after a period of implementing this plan, the child moves to stage 2. This stage involves input and advice from the school's relevant support teachers. A more detailed or intensive programme will be devised at this point. After a further period of implementation, a review takes place and, if necessary, a referral may be made to the school's psychologist. A number of options will be explored with the psychologist, including the possibility of an individual psychological assessment. The psychologist may, at any stage in this process, offer advice on such matters as behavioural management, learning support programmes, resource materials and such like. Children benefit more from this indirect approach that supports the adults who engage with them on a daily basis and more children can receive help in this way.</P>
      <P>Gathering statistics of children awaiting assessment would therefore be difficult to achieve with any degree of accuracy, as many children who are initially referred by schools as needing individual assessment are, in fact, helped during stages 1 and 2 without the need for individual interview. Furthermore, the attempt to gather such statistics would divert the psychologists from their core work in schools for a substantial amount of time.</P>
      <P>I believe that the system outlined enables schools to address their current priorities and to re-prioritise children as circumstances change. It also allows for a measure of equity of access to the service as between different schools. A strict fixed waiting list system would not allow for this flexibility. However, it can be said that the experience of NEPS psychologists is that the demand for casework generally exceeds the time available. This is in line with the experience of longer established psychological services in other jurisdictions.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Mr. N. Dempsey)</NameTxt>
      <P>In October 2000 the Government agreed to establish a scheme through which victims of childhood abuse while in institutional care could apply for compensation for their injuries. The Government's decision was taken regardless as to whether the religious congregations who owned and managed the institutions concerned would contribute to the scheme.</P>
      <P>Shortly after the Government's decision, the religious congregations indicated that they wished to contribute to the compensation scheme. The Government welcomed this approach because apart from the financial contribution, the Government felt that some closure to the issue of childhood abuse could best be achieved if both the religious congregations and the State participated.</P>
      <P>Negotiations between representatives of the religious congregations and the State followed and arising from this an indemnity agreement was signed on 5 June 2002. Under the terms of the indemnity it was agreed that 18 religious congregations would contribute a total of &euro;128 million to the redress scheme.</P>
      <P>In return for this contribution the Government agreed to grant an indemnity to the congregations that are parties to the agreement. This indemnity applies only to cases which are eligible to be dealt with under the terms of the Residential Institutions Redress Act 2002, which are not resolved within this scheme and in respect of which litigation is commenced within six years of the date of the agreement. It is hoped that all or certainly the vast majority of cases will be dealt with through the redress scheme rather than the courts. Therefore, it is expected that the indemnity will apply to relatively few cases.</P>
      <P>There is no scope within the agreement for the congregations to increase their contribution in the event of the cost of the scheme exceeding a particular level. However, as I have already outlined, the Government's initial decision to set up the scheme was made regardless of whether the religious congregations concerned would contribute. The agreement was not based on any expected total cost for the redress scheme. The breakdown of the contribution is as follows: cash &euro;41.14 million; counselling service &euro;10 million; property &euro;76.86 million.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The property offered to the State is listed on two schedules. The first schedule amounts to &euro;36.54 million and represents properties offered to be transferred to the State. The second sched<Col N="266" /> ule amounting to &euro;40.32 million represents property that has been transferred since 11 May 1999 &ndash; the date of the Taoiseach's apology &ndash; to the State, State bodies, local authorities or voluntary organisations.</P>
    <P>Under the terms of the indemnity the State has a period of nine months to consider the properties offered to establish if the State can benefit from accepting title transfer. In the event the State rejects a particular property the contributing congregation can offer an alternative property or cash equivalent.</P>
    <P>Negotiations are ongoing between officials in my Department and the legal representatives of the congregations in relation to the property aspect of the agreement.</P>

      <P>The question refers to a statement in a newspaper article that &ldquo;budgetary cutbacks and restrictions could threaten the very existence of adult education in Waterford&rdquo;. There is no basis for this statement. National policy is that, apart from the most disadvantaged, part-time adult education provision should be self-financing. Accordingly, vocational educational committees administer local adult education services with funding from two sources.</P>
      <P>My Department provides funding for basic education courses, which are provided free of charge or at nominal costs to participants. The allocation to the City of Waterford VEC for this purpose has increased constantly over the last few years, thereby allowing the service to expand correspondingly.</P>
      <P>Other types of course are required by my Department to be entirely self-financing. Fees are payable by participants. The nature and scale of such courses, and the level of fee charged, are matters to be decided by the VEC.</P>

      <P>Three proposed syllabi in physical <Col N="271" /> education for junior cycle, senior cycle and leaving certificate, have been received in my office from the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment, NCCA, and are currently being evaluated by my officials. The NCCA, in conjunction with the Department of Education and Science, undertook an extensive consultation process prior to the submission of the syllabus documents to my Department. Much of the feedback obtained during this process has been incorporated in the final documents.</P>
      <P>The content of leaving certificate physical education marks a significant departure from existing practice in that it explores the theoretical foundations underpinning physical education and physical activity. The syllabi advocate that this integration of theory and practice should be a primary concern, both in teaching and in assessment, and that this should be reinforced through the structure and methodology of the examination procedures. In addition, the non-examination syllabi, particularly at senior cycle level, seek to encourage and emphasise the importance of greater participation in physical activity.</P>
      <P>My Department is currently examining the extent to which in-career development for teachers may be needed to support the implementation of these syllabi and how this support might be delivered having regard to the need for in-career development in relation to other areas of second level curriculum. When these and other details relating to the assessment of leaving certificate physical education have been agreed by my Department, I will be in a position to make a decision on a date for implementation for all three syllabi.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Mr. N. Dempsey)</NameTxt>
      <P>The approved subjects in the leaving certificate curriculum are currently assessed in a variety of ways.</P>
      <P>In the case of some 20 subjects in the established leaving certificate, assessment is by means of a terminal written examination, involving two examination papers in the case of English, Irish and mathematics, and one examination paper in the case of the other subjects. In the case of the five languages Irish, French, German, Spanish and Italian a combination of a terminal written examination, oral and aural examinations is used.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Assessment of agricultural science and agricultural economics is done by means of a written examination paper and a project while the assessment of engineering and construction studies includes three components: a written examination, a practical test and a project. Art is <Col N="272" /> assessed using a written paper and three separate practical tests. Music is assessed by means of a written examination paper, an aural test and a practical performance test and, in some cases, depending on the elective chosen, an additional written paper or portfolio.</P>
    <P>As leaving certificate syllabi are revised by the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment, NCCA, assessment components other than a written terminal examination are being introduced where appropriate. Examples include the revised syllabi for the sciences and the revised syllabus for home economics.</P>
    <P>In the case of the leaving certificate applied, assessment is undertaken at four key stages during the two year programme with a significant degree of the total of 100 credits, 67 credits, being attainable for course work. For the three link modules in the leaving certificate vocational programme, 60% of the marks are attained for coursework and 40% for a terminal written examination. There is already, therefore, a varied approach to assessment across the range of programmes and subjects at leaving certificate. In addition, the NCCA has recently published a document called Developing Senior Cycle Education: Consultative Paper on Issues and Options. A wide-reaching public debate on this document is due to begin shortly. At the end of this debate, the NCCA will advise my Department on possible reform of all aspects of senior cycle, including assessment.</P>

      <P>My Department allocates resource posts, special needs assistant posts and concessionary teaching hours to second level schools to cater for the needs of special needs pupils. Applications for such support are made to my Department by the relevant school authorities. Each application is considered on the basis of the assessed needs of the pupil(s) in question and determined on the advice of the psychological service.</P>
      <P>The number of pupils with special needs who are attending mainstream second level schools is not readily available. To date, my Department has allocated in the order of 690 wholetime equivalent teaching posts and over 360 special needs assistants to second level schools for the school year 2002-03 to cater for the needs of students with special needs.</P>
      <P>In addition, I am taking steps to ensure that the necessary arrangements are put in place for an efficient and effective system for service delivery. A key development in this regard has been the decision to establish the National Council for Special Education. The council, which will have a local area presence, will play a key role in the development and delivery of services for persons with special needs. It will also have a research and advisory role and will establish expert groups to address specific areas of special needs provision. Such areas would include the question of the future role of the special school sector and how the reservoir of experience, expertise and commitment which the special school sector represents can be better utilised to support the special education system. Arrangements for the establishment of the council are well advanced. A chief executive has recently been appointed to the council and it is intended that it will be vested by the end of March 2003.</P>
      <P>I also intend to bring forward legislation, based on the Education for Persons with Disabilities Bill, to clarify the rights and entitlements of persons with disabilities to an education service and to put in place the necessary framework to deliver the required services. My Department is consulting interested parties on the proposed legislation. My objective would be to secure the passage of this legislation through the Oireachtas before the summer recess. I am confident that the measures I have outlined will ensure that all children with special needs receive the support they require to enable them to gain maximum benefit from the education system.</P>

      <P>An Agreed Programme for Government sets out a commitment to implement changes to retention and support policies, which will assist schools in areas of significant disadvantage to recruit and retain teachers.</P>
      <P>My Department is committed to providing support for teachers in all primary schools. Indeed, following negotiations with teacher representatives, there have been many improvements in the conditions of service of teachers in recent times. These include the introduction of release time for teaching principals, improvements in conditions for the appointment of administrative principals, the introduction of payments in respect of supervision duties and the provision of increased substitute cover for absences.</P>
      <P>My Department is in ongoing discussion with the teachers' representatives concerning the conditions of service of primary teachers. The recruitment and retention of teaching staff is a difficulty for many boards of management at present due to the current shortage. The difficulty is not confined to disadvantaged schools alone. The action being taken to increase the teacher supply generally will ensure that the current difficulties with regard to teacher supply will be eliminated. The difficulties currently being experienced are added to by the number of teachers currently availing of the career break and job sharing schemes.</P>
      <P>In the context of the commitment concerning retention and support policies referred to in the programme for Government, I have asked officials of my Department to examine how best this commitment can be implemented over the next five years and to consult with the partners in education in that regard.</P>
      <P>I understand that a sub-group of the statutory committee on disadvantage is currently examining the issue of recruitment and retention of teachers within schools in disadvantaged areas. I will examine any recommendations, which this sub-committee may make on the issues.</P>

      <P>I can assure the Deputy that I am fully committed to ensuring that all children with special needs, including children with visual impairment, will continue to have access to the best possible education service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Children with visual impairment are catered for in special schools, in special dedicated classes attached to ordinary schools and in integrated settings. Special schools and special classes catering for children with visual impairment operate at <Col N="275" /> a special reduced pupil teacher ratio of 8:1 and are supported by the special needs assistant service. Such children are also entitled to avail of the special school transport service which includes an escort service. Children with visual impairment attending special schools and special classes also attract a special annual rate of capitation funding of &euro;481.50 for children under 12 years and &euro;573 for children of 12 years and over.</P>
    <P>Where a child with visual impairment attends an ordinary school on a fully integrated basis, he or she can be supported by the resource teacher service and-or the special needs assistant service. At present there are approximately 2,300 resource teachers and 3,800 full-time and an additional 1,000 part-time special needs assistants in the primary system.</P>
    <P>Children with visual impairment can also be supported by the visiting teacher service which includes specialists in visual impairment. These children are also entitled to funding support for the purchase of specialised equipment necessary to assist them in their education.</P>
    <P>My Department is currently considering proposals for the establishment of a national centre for the visually impaired. A project team appointed by my Department to develop a master plan for such a development presented its interim report to my Department in December 2002. This plan is currently being examined in my Department.</P>

      <P>As the Deputy is aware, my Department is examining the feasibility of providing a modular course for second level trained teachers who are currently teaching in primary schools with a view to enabling them to become fully qualified primary teachers. It is hoped to discuss proposals with the colleges of education in the near future.</P>
      <P>As part of the minimum academic requirements specified by my Department for entry to primary teacher training, all candidates, including school leavers, mature students and university graduates, must have a minimum of a grade C in higher level in Irish in the leaving certificate or an approved equivalent.</P>
      <P>The approved equivalents in respect of this Irish requirement can be found on the Department's website under the teacher training category of the learners and trainees section. This requirement embodies both the written and oral element of a student's proficiency in Irish. In the event of a modular course being introduced, it is expected that this requirement would also apply.</P>

      <P>In light of this approach to the schools capital programme, it would be unfair to other schools for me to become involved in discussions on individual projects or to receive a deputation from a particular school as this might create the impression that decisions were going to be taken on building projects on the basis of criteria other than the objective criteria outlined by my Department.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 362 and 375 together.</P>
      <P>The school completion programme, SCP, which was introduced in 2002 directly targets those in danger of dropping out of the education system and builds on two earlier schemes, incorporating the elements of best practice established by the eight to 15 year old early school leaver initiative, ESLI, and the stay-in-school retention initiative at second level, SSRI, the pilot phases of which came to an end in August and July 2002 respectively.</P>
      <P>The school completion programme is a key component of the Department's strategy to discriminate positively in favour of children and young people who are at risk of early school leaving.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The objective of the school completion programme is to provide a range of interventions in areas of disadvantage that support the retention of young people in education. It is based on an integrated approach involving primary and post-<Col N="281" /> primary schools, parents, communities and relevant statutory and voluntary agencies.</P>
    <P>Sites for participation were selected on the basis of a detailed analysis of pupil retention rates at second level using the Department's post-primary pupils database. This analysis also identified their main feeder primary schools. Some 82 school completion projects, including the 17 existing ESLI projects were selected to participate in the school completion programme.</P>
    <P>However, in addition to the 82 school completion projects, my Department is continuing to support 53 second level schools, which were funded previously under the stay in school retention initiative but were not selected for the project strand of this programme on this occasion, which includes the school referred to by the Deputy. These 53 schools will be supported under the stay in school retention strand of SCP to 31 August 2005.</P>
    <P>Having regard to the amount of funding available to this programme in future, any decision to include further project sites will be based on a selection process using the most current detailed analysis of pupil retention rates at second level from the Department of Education and Science post-primary pupils database.</P>

      <P>The issue of compensation for certain teachers formerly employed in the Army apprentice school, Naas, was referred to a rights commissioner in February 2002 following discussions with the teachers concerned and the Teachers Union of Ireland. The rights commissioner issued his recommendation on 6 March 2002. The Teachers' Union of Ireland gave notice of appeal against the decision on 15 April but then indicated acceptance of the decision on 20 August 2002.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="285" />The detailed implementation of the rights commissioner's decision will require further discussions with the union concerned and arrangements are being made for these discussions to take place in the very near future. Payment will be made immediately thereafter.</P>

      <P>The group, referred to by the Deputy, has made an application for funding to my Department. This group was established in the United Kingdom in 2002.</P>
      <P>Funding is provided by my Department to a number of survivor groups both in this country and in the United Kingdom. This funding is allocated for the provision of an information service for the survivors of institutional child abuse.</P>
      <P>An outreach service based in the United Kingdom has been established in five Irish centres within the last two years. These centres provide information to survivors based in the United Kingdom on a variety of issues including counselling, housing, the Commission to Inquire into Child Abuse and the Residential Institutions Redress Board. It is my view that any further funding available should be directed towards the further development of the outreach service in the United Kingdom. Official of my Department met with two representatives from the group, referred to by the Deputy, on 8 October 2002 and advised them that no funding would be allocated to new survivor groups in the United Kingdom.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. N. Dempsey Mr. N. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Mr. N. Dempsey)</NameTxt>
      <P>Dealing with educational disadvantage remains a key priority of this Government and my Department has introduced a range of key interventions and programmes in primary schools aimed directly at tackling the problem of educational disadvantage. The early start pre-school pilot project is in place in 40 selected schools in designated areas of disadvantage. It is aimed at children who are considered to be most at risk of not reaching their potential and are aged between three and four years. Early start units have been established in two schools in Dublin 24 and both schools are benefiting from additional resources to cater for the pre-school children attending.</P>
      <P>A new disadvantage programme &ndash; Giving Children An Even Break &ndash; was launched in 2001 to deal with educational disadvantage in primary schools. The schools targeted under the programme were identified through a comprehensive and objective survey of primary schools carried out in March and April 2000 by the educational research centre in Drumcondra on my Department's behalf. Over 75% of primary schools took part in the survey. Indicators such as unemployment, medical card possession and rented local authority housing have been found to be reliable indicators of levels of disadvantage in schools. The survey provides a valuable basis for directing resources to the areas of greatest need. All the schools identified as having enrolled pupils with characteristics of disadvantage have been invited to participate in Giving Children an Even Break.</P>
      <P>Giving Children an Even Break subsumes the previous process of designation of schools that serve areas of educational disadvantage. My Department's approach is now refined to ensure that the individual at risk pupils are targeted. Rather than the old method of designating additional schools, my Department provides support that is commensurate with the levels of concentration in schools of pupils with characteristics associated with educational disadvantage and early school leaving. Schools participating in Giving Children An Even Break are eligible to receive a range of additional supports including teacher posts and financial supports to be targeted at disadvantaged pupils. The additional supports to be provided reflect the level of concentration of pupils from educationally disadvantaged backgrounds in each school invited to participate in the programme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are separate urban and rural dimensions to the programme. I am pleased to inform the Deputy that 29 schools in Dublin 24 have been included in the urban dimension of Giving Children An Even Break. All these schools are benefiting from supplementary funding to provide additional educational supports for the children <Col N="297" /> concerned. Schools categorised as urban with the highest concentrations of at risk pupils are being supported, where necessary, over the three year period through staff allocations to implement a pupil teacher ratio of 20:1 in the junior classes &ndash; infants through second class &ndash; and a pupil teacher ratio of 27:1 in senior classes &ndash; third through sixth classes. Under Giving Children an Even Break, 17 schools in Dublin 24 are benefiting from reduced pupil teacher ratios.</P>
    <P>The home school community liaison scheme, which operates in 20 primary schools in the Dublin 24 area, is a preventative strategy which promotes active co-operation between home, school and relevant community agencies in promoting the educational interests of children. It also raises the awareness among parents of their capacities to enhance their children's educational progress and to assist them in developing relevant skills. My Department's support teacher project operates in 16 primary schools in Dublin 24, in which there are significant numbers of pupils with disruptive, disturbed or withdrawn behaviours. A support teacher works in each school and they support the targeted children's learning through individual and group work. Support teachers help to address the individual needs of children with behaviours that have a negative impact on their learning and that of their peers. Support teachers make a significant contribution to the development of school policy on behavioural management and on the development of appropriate management strategies and skills. A comprehensive in-career development programme supports the project development.</P>
    <P>In 2002, my Department introduced the school completion programme, which incorporates the learning, experience and best practice derived from the previous early school leaving initiatives, assimilating the existing eight to 15 year early school leaver initiative and the stay in school retention initiative at second level. The school completion programme is based at both primary and post-primary level and is focused on young people between the ages of four and 18 years who are educationally disadvantaged and at risk of leaving school early. It entails targeting individual young people of schoolgoing age, both in and out of school, and arranging supports to address inequalities in education access, participation and outcomes.</P>
    <P>Sites for participation were selected on the basis of a detailed analysis of pupil retention rates at second level using the Department's post-primary pupils database. This analysis also identified the main feeder primary schools. In Dublin 24 there are seven school completion programme sites with 18 feeder primary schools receiving funding through this initiative. Such concentrated and focused deployment of funds should not only lead to more and more young people staying on and completing second level education, but making their experience of school more positive and worthwhile and so helping to alleviate the problem of educational disadvantage. I have arranged <Col N="298" /> to forward to the Deputy details of the schools in Dublin 24 involved in the above programmes.</P>

      <P>The entry requirements for the enterprise platform programme in question are matters for the institutes of technology concerned. The institutes of technology are statutory bodies established under the Regional Technical Colleges Acts and Dublin Institute of Technology Acts 1992 to 1999. Under these Acts, the governance and day-to-day activities of the institutes, including admissions, are a matter for the institutes concerned and I have no function in this area. The enterprise platform programme offered by institutes of technology is a training and enterprise support programme that specifically targets graduate entrepreneurs who have an innovative, knowledge-based business idea and hold a recognised third level diploma or degree.</P>

      <P>Educational publishers from Ireland and overseas publish textbooks and activity <Col N="306" /> books to support the implementation of curricula and editors of textbooks and activity books for use in primary schools select the content of such books. The material selected for inclusion in textbooks reflects the personal preferences of the editors. When selecting material for textbooks, editors are required to follow guidelines drawn up by the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment. It is common practice for school authorities and teachers to introduce a new series of textbooks to a school on an incremental basis over a number of years, thereby replacing existing textbooks gradually. It is therefore not unusual for schools to purchase, for example, the books for the junior classes before the books for the senior classes are published. While some changes in textbooks as a result of introduction of revisions to curricula are inevitable, it must also be recognised that textbooks play only a limited role in the teaching and learning process.</P>
      <P>The selection of textbooks for primary schools is a matter for the principal and staff of the school, under the authority of the board of management. The textbooks selected should present positive images of people from different cultures. The guidelines for publishers from the NCCA specifically state that textbooks written <i>ab initio</i> by publishers should present multi-culturalism in a manner that reflects &ldquo;a balance between the child's experiences and the educational responsibility of fostering attitudes of equity and tolerance.&rdquo;  Many books, stories and poems contain passages, which, if taken out of context, could be regarded as portraying people from particular backgrounds in an unfavourable light. Examples of passages from books set in the Second World War immediately come to mind where variously Jews, English, Japanese and Germans are depicted both favourably and unfavourably. Equally, some of the folk tales and fairy tales that are part of our rich literary heritage could be cited in this regard.</P>
      <P>I cannot therefore definitively state that a passage from a book used in a primary school should never contain a negative racial or social portrayal, because to do so would be unduly censorious. Rather, I believe that teachers should be aware of the importance of presenting such material in a manner that challenges prejudice and discrimination.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 429 and 430 together.</P>
      <P>I am aware of recent developments within the National Parents Council, following its conference in November 2002, and the decision of the executive committee of the national congress of Catholic Secondary School Parent Associations, CSPA, to be no longer part of the National Prices Commission. I am conscious of the need to ensure that parents are fully represented as partners in the education system. To this end, my Department financially aids the National Parents Council and recognises it as representing the views of parents in a wide range of fora. Following its decision in relation to membership of the National Prices Commission, the CSPA has also advanced a case for funding and recognition. Before reaching a decision in relation to these matters and mindful of the significance of any decisions for future parental representation, I have put in place a collaborative review process. I have requested Mr. Jack O'Brien, a retired Assistant Secretary General of my Department, to comprehensively review the issue of State financial support for and recognition of parental organisations at second level. My Department has requested the co-operation of all the parental organisations at second level in the conduct of this review.</P>

      <P>Significant improvements have been made in the funding of second level schools. The standard <i>per capita</i> grant increased from &euro;224.74 in 1997 to &euro;256.49 in September 2001 and was further increased to &euro;266.49 in September 2002. An additional <i>per capita</i> grant of &euro;38.09 is paid to disadvantaged schools bringing the total <i>per capita</i> grant in the case of such schools to over &euro;300. In addition, under the school services support initiative, second level schools have benefited from further significant increases in the support grant from &euro;25.40 per pupil in 2000 to &euro;88.88 from September 2002 and to &euro;99 per pupil from 1 January 2003.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Funding for voluntary secondary schools has been further enhanced by the introduction of a range of equalisation measures designed to reduce the historic anomalies referred to in the funding arrangements for the different school <Col N="308" /> types at second level. Under the terms of recent equalisation measures, the support services grant was increased by &euro;28 per pupil with effect from September 2002, bringing the support services grant in the case of voluntary secondary schools to &euro;116.88 per pupil from September 2002 and to &euro;127 per pupil from 1 January 2003. This increase is in addition to the range of equalisation grants of up to &euro;15,554 per school, &euro;44.44 per pupil, per annum that was approved for secondary schools in December 2001. For a voluntary secondary school with 500 pupils, this amounts to extra funding of up to &euro;100,000 per annum, and annual grants of up to &euro;236,761, &euro;255,811 in the case of disadvantaged schools, towards general expenses and support services.</P>

      <P>The Registration Council is the statutory body responsible for the recognition of qualifications for the purposes of teaching in voluntary secondary schools. Each applicant for registration as a secondary school teacher must, among other things, hold a third level degree which must be adequate to enable the holder to teach at least one of the approved subjects or areas of study approved for the purposes of a course of instruction prescribed in the rules and programme for secondary schools and a training in teaching qualification acceptable to the council and which is directed towards those between 12 and 18 years.</P>
      <P>Qualifications obtained through third level colleges in the UK do not have general recognition in this country for the purposes of teaching in a secondary school. It is a matter for college authorities to seek recognition for the third level courses they provide. Procedures are in place in my Department to facilitate any such request from a recognised third level institution here or abroad. The only college from the United Kingdom which has sought and received recognition of certain of its qualifications is St. Mary's College for Physical Education, Strawberry Hill, London. Any teacher who holds a qualification obtained in the UK may apply, as an individual, to the Registration Council to have the qualification recognised for the purposes of registration as a secondary school teacher. Applications should be directed to the secretariat of the Registration Council which is located in my Department's offices in Athlone.</P>

      <P>The fund for students with disabilities, which is ESF-aided, is administered by my Department and provides funding to students with disabilities attending courses in third level institutions and in post-leaving certificate centres. The purpose of the fund is to provide students with serious physical and-or sensory disabilities with grant assistance towards the cost of special equipment, special materials and technological aids, targeted transport services, personal assistants and sign language interpreters. The fund operates on a discretionary basis. Applications for assistance are made in October of each year by the individual students through their third level institution or post-leaving certificate centre. The allocations are paid to the relevant institutions in respect of the particular students.</P>
      <P>Decisions on applications are taken by an <i>ad hoc</i> advisory group which, in 2002, consisted of representatives of the Department &ndash; from the sections dealing with administration and inspectorate, the latter a retired officer &ndash; a representative from the Association for Higher Education Access and Disability and a representative of the Higher Education Authority. There have been no cutbacks in the services referred to by the Deputy; funding has increased from &euro;1.565 million in 2000 to &euro;3.682 million in 2002 and the number of students benefiting has increased from 511 to 1,132. Following the issue of awards, my Department received representations and appeals which related, in particular, to applicants who had, unsuccessfully, requested the services of a note-taker. In view of those appeals, officials from my Department who were not members of the original advisory group conducted a review of all those applications where a note-taker was applied for, but not granted. Following completion of this review, an additional 52 applicants are being awarded funds in respect of note-takers, including the student referred to by the Deputy. The outcome of the review is being communicated to the disability officers, who will then inform the successful applicants.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My Department is aware that, given the current process by which applications for funding are assessed, a period of time elapses between a student with a disability registering for the academic year and the subsequent allocation of funding to that student. My Department also accepts that, given the success and significant expansion of the fund in recent years, it is appropriate that the operation of the fund should be subject to review in 2003. In this context, I have already approved the establishment of the <Col N="311" /> national office for equity of access to third level education within the Higher Education Authority, as recommended in the report of the action group on access to third level education. It will be part of the remit of the national office to take responsibility for the administration of the fund for students with disabilities.</P>

      <P>My Department operates a grant scheme towards the cost of providing school textbooks for needy pupils in post-primary schools. For the purposes of this scheme a needy pupil is a pupil from a family where there is genuine hardship because of unemployment, prolonged illness of a parent, large family size with inadequate means, single parenthood, or other family circumstances, such as substance abuse, which would indicate a similar degree of financial hardship.</P>
      <P>Principal teachers administer the book grant schemes in schools in a flexible way under the terms of the schemes based on their knowledge of particular circumstances in individual cases. A consultancy report, which was submitted to my Department in 1993, dealt with the factors which contribute to the cost of school text books. The main conclusion of the report was that book rental schemes are the most practical way of limiting the cost of school books to parents. The report, copies of which were sent to all schools, contains a number of useful suggestions, including a code of good practice for successful operation of book rental schemes. My Department endorses the recommendations and urges school authorities to put in place book rental schemes to the greatest extent possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Each year, second level schools and vocational education committees furnish to my Department general details of the numbers of needy pupils assisted in the previous school year. Based on these returns the grant is paid by my Department <Col N="314" /> to the individual schools or vocational education committees. In 2002, County Donegal VEC received a grant of &euro;125,873 for distribution among its schools. In addition, seed capital to establish book loan or rental schemes has been provided since 1994 to disadvantaged schools which do not operate such a scheme and which give a commitment to arrange for such a scheme. The intention is to provide some specific financial support for the introduction or expansion of book rental schemes in individual schools on an annual basis, for a maximum of six years, five years in the case of five-year cycle schools. It is envisaged that schools which receive seed capital will be in a position to establish sustainable book loan or rental schemes; ongoing costs will be met by fee income, which can be subsidised in the case of needy pupils from the general book grant scheme allocation. County Donegal VEC received seed capital for the period 1994 to 1999 amounting to &euro;172,557.</P>
    <P>Moville Community College opened in September 2001 and accordingly did not benefit from the grant of seed capital to establish book loan or rental schemes. However, if County Donegal VEC on behalf of Moville Community College submits an application for seed capital it will be considered by my Department.</P>

      <P>The provision of second level school facilities in Newport, County Mayo, under the aegis of County Mayo VEC was given approval by my Department in June 1998. The amount spent to date by my Department on this project is &euro;381,469. As with all proposals involving major capital expenditure, it is essential to confirm that the provision of a new school in Newport is necessary, having regard to pupil numbers and existing provision in the general area, before it can be allowed to proceed to the next stage, that is, invitation of tenders. Accordingly, a review of second level provision in the Newport area is being undertaken at present by the planning section of my Department. A decision on the Newport proposal will be taken on foot of this review. In the interim, no further action will be <Col N="316" /> taken in relation to the development of the proposed school in Newport, including the determination of an official catchment area.</P>

My Department continues to make a number of new appointments of psychologists to the National Educational Psychological Service, including some who will be based in the eastern region, south western area. I am not in a position at present to state whether it will be possible to expand the NEPS service in County Kildare during the current year &ndash; the timing will depend upon when the new psychologists actually take up their posts and complete their induction training.

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Mr. N. Dempsey)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pleased to state that, following a review, an allocation is being made in respect of the student referred to by the Deputy for provision of the services of a note-taker in the current academic year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>By way of background, the fund for students with disabilities, which is ESF-aided, is administered by my Department and provides funding to students with disabilities attending courses in third level institutions and in post-leaving certificate centres. The purpose of the fund is to provide students with serious physical and/or sensory disabilities with grant assistance towards the cost of special equipment, special materials and technological aids, targeted transport services, personal assistants and sign language interpreters. The fund operates on a discretionary basis. <Col N="319" /> Applications for assistance are made in October of each year by the individual students through their third level institution. The allocations are paid to the relevant institutions in respect of the particular students. Decisions on applications are taken by an <i>ad hoc</i> advisory group which, in 2002, consisted of representatives of the Department's administration and inspectorate units, the latter a retired officer, a representative from the Association for Higher Education Access and Disability and a representative of the Higher Education Authority.</P>
    <P>The number of approved applications has increased significantly, from 511 in 2000 to 1,132 in 2002. Expenditure has also more than doubled over the same period, from &euro;1.565 million in 2000 to &euro;3.682 million in 2002. Following the issue of awards, my Department received representations and appeals which related, in particular, to applicants who had unsuccessfully requested the services of a note-taker. In view of those appeals, officials from my Department who were not members of the original advisory group conducted a review of all those applications where a note-taker was applied for, but not granted. Following completion of this review, an additional 52 applicants are being awarded funds in respect of note-takers, including the student referred to by the Deputy. The outcome of the review is being communicated to the disability officers, who will then inform the successful applicants.</P>
    <P>My Department accepts that, given the success and significant expansion of the fund in recent years, it is appropriate that the operation of the fund should be subject to review in 2003. In this context, I have already approved the establishment of the national office for equity of access to third level education within the Higher Education Authority, as recommended in the report of the action group on access to third level education. It will be part of the remit of the national office to take responsibility for the future administration of the fund for students with disabilities.</P>

      <P>The selection and enrolment of pupils in second level schools is the responsibility of the authorities of the individual school. My Department's main responsibility is to ensure that schools in an area can, between them, cater for all pupils seeking second level places in an area. This may result, however, in some pupils not obtaining a place in the school of their first choice. As schools may not have a place for every applicant, a selection process may be necessary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to the application of fair and objective entrance criteria for entry to second level schools my Department has agreed with the three post-primary managerial associations that the <Col N="324" /> selection of pupils for enrolment in second-level schools should not be based on academic ability and selection on that basis, where used heretofore, must be discontinued; under section 15(2)(<i>d</i>) of the Education Act 1998, each school is legally obliged to disclose its enrolment policy and the criteria used in selecting pupils for enrolment to inform parents of the selection procedures and to allay fears of discrimination; the principle of the school working in and for the community it serves should be emphasised. On that basis, emphasis should be placed by post-primary schools on catering, in the first instance, for children from their own communities and catchment areas.</P>
    <P>Schools are advised to use some of the following selection criteria in determining how best to frame a selection policy to meet its individual needs viz. priority to pupils from national schools in the area; enrolment on a &ldquo;first come, first served&rdquo; basis; random selection on the basis of age of applicants; priority to brothers and sisters of pupils already enrolled in the school; priority to pupils of a particular religious denomination.</P>
    <P>Section 29 of the Education Act 1998 provides for an appeal to the Secretary General of my Department where a board of management of a school or a person acting on behalf of the board refuses to enrol a student in the school. An appeal will generally not be admitted unless it is made within 42 calendar days from the date the decision of the board of management was notified to the parent or student concerned. However, a longer period for making appeals may be allowed as an exception where it is accepted that circumstances did not permit the making of an appeal within the 42 day limit.</P>

      <Quest>further to his reply to Parliamentary Question No. 58 of 14 November 2002 wherein he seemed to imply that some aspects of parliamentary business were conductible via the Internet, his views on whether a reply via the Internet is adequate means of holding relevant and responsible Ministers accountable to Dáil Éireann; his further views on whether a more effective and efficient means to elicit such information should be by way of freedom of information; if he accepts the principle of accountability to Dáil Éireann in respect of all matters for which he or his Department has responsibility; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <P>My reply to the parliamentary question referred to by the Deputy expressed the view that it was arguable whether seeking information by way of parliamentary question which is already freely available on a website is &ldquo;parliamentary business&rdquo; and the best use of Oireachtas and Department resources. I was merely drawing a distinction between the concept of access to information which has already been published on a public website and the concept of accountability. The most efficient and cost-effective way in which Deputies can access information published on a website is by looking up the relevant website as opposed to putting down a parliamentary question or submitting a freedom of information request to my Department.</P>
      <P>My reply of 14 November 2002 also made it clear that I did not consider that any business which is proper to Dáil Éireann could be conducted via the Internet. The Deputy can be assured that I fully accept the principle of accountability to Dáil Éireann in respect of all matters within my remit.</P>

    <P>My Department does not make any payments or allowances directly to individual asylum seekers.

Primary schools in which between three and 13, inclusive, non-English speaking non-national pupils are <Col N="338" /> enrolled receive grant assistance. Schools with between three and eight such pupils receive grant assistance in the amount of &euro;6,348.69 while schools with between nine and 13 receive grant assistance in the amount of &euro;9,523.04. This grant aid is designed to enable schools to take measures to improve the standard of English of non-national pupils with significant English language deficits. All non-national pupils, who are validly enrolled, are included in the total enrolment of a school for the purpose of capitation grants and other grants on the same basis as Irish pupils.</P>

In this regard it should however be noted that in the last five years there has been a 95% increase in the provision for the technological sector as the recurrent grant increased from &euro;192.7 million in 1997 to &euro;376.1 million in 2002. In the circumstances it will be a matter for the institutes to manage their resources in 2003 and where necessary to effect economies to keep expenditure within approved budgets. Under the terms of the Regional Technical Colleges Acts and the Dublin Institute of Technology Acts the control and management of the institutes are the responsibility of their management authorities.</P>

      <P>As the Deputy is aware, a need has been identified by my Department for additional primary school provision in the Stepaside area. A formal notification of intention to apply for the recognition of a school in the Glenbourne-Ballyogan area, to commence operation in September 2003 has been received from the Dublin archdiocese. This notification has been referred for consideration to the new schools advisory committee, which I established recently to provide independent advice regarding the recognition of new primary schools. The committee is at present undertaking a consultation process with the current school providers and the general public in the area in which it is proposed to locate the new school.</P>
      <P>A formal application for recognition of the school must be submitted not later than 31 January 2003. Assuming an application is received, the new schools advisory committee will consider the matter and make a recommendation to me on recognition. It is my intention to notify each applicant of my decision in their case by 30 April 2003.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to accommodation for the new school, the position is that the provision of interim accommodation is the responsibility of the patron. A school does not become eligible for capital funding until such time as it demonstrates viability and secures permanent recognition. In the event that permanent recognition is granted, interim accommodation will remain the patron's responsibility until the Department is in a position to provide permanent accommodation. While the property management section of the Office of Public Works, which acts on behalf of my Department in relation to site acquisitions generally, has identified a possible site for the proposed new school, it was not possible to make provision for the purchase of the site in the con<Col N="343" /> text of the 2003 capital programme. The question of site purchase will be considered again in the context of the 2004 programme.</P>

      <P>The group, Irish Survivors of Institutional Abuse International, has made an application for funding to my Department. This group was established in the United Kingdom in 2002. Funding is provided by my Department to a number of survivor groups both in this country and the United Kingdom. This funding is allocated for the provision of an information service for the survivors of institutional abuse. An outreach service based in the United Kingdom has been established in five Irish centres within the last two years. These centres provide information to survivors based in the United Kingdom on a variety of issues including counselling, housing, the Commission to Inquire into Child Abuse and the Residential Institutions Redress Board.</P>
      <P>It is my view that any further funding available should be directed towards the further development of the outreach service in the United Kingdom. Officials from my Department met with two representatives from the Irish Survivors of Institutional Abuse International on 8 October 2002 and advised them that no funding would be allocated to new survivor groups in the United Kingdom.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Mr. N. Dempsey)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very aware of the issue of bullying in schools and my Department has moved to tackle the issue on a number of fronts. The education of students in both primary and post-primary schools in relation to anti-bullying behaviour is a central part of the social, personal and health education curriculum. The social, personal and health education programme is part of the curriculum in every primary school at present and by September 2003 will be a mandatory component of the junior cycle in all second level schools. The content of the programme reflects current best practice in the area of educating children in relation to bullying. As part of school development planning schools are advised to have stated policies and to develop plans on discipline, health and safety and countering bullying behaviour. <Col N="344" /> Parental involvement in the planning process is encouraged. Through their representation on the board of management and through parents' associations parents can readily be consulted in the clarification and development of these policies and plans.</P>
      <P>Guidelines were put in place in 1994 as an aid to schools in devising their individual anti-bullying strategies. The purpose of the guidelines was to assist schools in devising school-based measures to prevent and deal with instances of bullying behaviour and to increase awareness of the problem among school management authorities, staff, pupils and parents. The national educational psychological service is also available as a support service to schools in relation to individual students who encounter difficulties.</P>
      <P>While arrangements with regard to attendance at board of management meetings is entirely a matter for the school authorities at local level, the issue referred to by the Deputy is being considered by the education partners in the context of guidelines under section 28 of the Education Act 1998.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Mr. N. Dempsey)</NameTxt>
      <P>Significant improvements in the levels of direct funding to schools have been made in recent years. The standard rate of capitation grant for primary schools was substantially increased from &euro;57.14 per pupil in 1997 to &euro;105 per pupil in 2001-02 and &euro;111.58 in respect of the 2002-03 school year.</P>
      <P>Significant improvements have been made in the level of funding to second level schools. The standard <i>per capita </i>grant of &euro;224.74 that applied in 1997, was increased to &euro;256.49 in September 2001 and was further increased to &euro;266.49 in September 2002. An additional <i>per capita</i> grant of &euro;38.09 is paid to disadvantaged schools bringing the total <i>per capita </i>grant in the case of such schools to over &euro;300. In addition, under the school services support initiative, second level schools have benefited from further significant increases in the support grant from &euro;25.40 per pupil in 2000 to &euro;88.88 from September 2002 and to &euro;99 per pupil from 1 January 2003.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Funding for voluntary secondary schools has been further enhanced by the introduction of a range of equalisation measures that are designed to reduce the historic anomalies in the funding arrangements for the different school types at second level. Under the terms of recent equalisation measures, the support services grant was <Col N="345" /> increased by &euro;28 per pupil with effect from September 2002. This brings the support services grant in the case of voluntary secondary schools to &euro;116.88 per pupil from September 2002 and to &euro;127 per pupil from 1 January 2003. This increase is in addition to the range of equalisation grants of up to &euro;15,554 per school &ndash;&euro;44.44 per pupil &ndash; per annum that was approved for secondary schools in December 2001. For a voluntary secondary school with 500 pupils, this amounts to extra funding of up to &euro;100,000 per annum, and annual grants of up to &euro;236,761 to &euro;255,811 in the case of disadvantaged schools &ndash; towards general expenses and support services.</P>

      <P>The Teaching Council Act was enacted in 2001. Preparation for regulations providing for the first election to the council is at an advanced stage. These regulations will be the subject of consultation in the very near future. Once agreed, the first tranche of sections of the Act will be commenced. My intention is that this will be during the summer.</P>
      <P>The Vocational Education (Amendment) Act was passed by the Oireachtas in July 2001. To date, five sections have been commenced dealing with the first meeting of newly constituted committees, the designation of reserved and executive functions, and provisions relating to the chief executive officer and the staff of the committees. Consultations with interested parties are at an advanced stage regarding the commencement of the remainder of the Act and I hope to be in a position to make a further commencement order in the next month.</P>

      <P>I am aware of the issues to which the Deputy refers and the potential benefits which a dual enrolment arrangement might afford to certain children with special needs as part of their transition from the special school system to mainstream schools. However, the concept of dual enrolment raises a range of practical issues which require careful consideration. These issues relate to such matters as the manner in which staffing and funding resources allocated in respect of such children should be apportioned between two schools catering for the same pupil for limited periods. Issues relating to capitation funding and entitlement to special transport services would also arise. No decisions have yet been taken in relation to these matters.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 531 and 532 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is intended that the facility in question will be purchased and operated on a joint North-South basis to serve the needs of persons with autism in both jurisdictions. The costs involved will be shared on a 50-50 basis. The purchase cost involved is £3 million sterling. Precise details of the annual operating costs will not be available until final decisions have been taken on the required level of specialist inputs involved in the various elements of the centre's activities. However, current estimates suggest an overall <Col N="347" /> annual operating cost of approximately £2 million sterling. The Middletown campus involves an area of 20 acres and includes extensive educational facilities and residential accommodation.</P>
    <P>Proposals for the centre envisage: a diagnostic support and educational assessment service for children and young people referred to the centre with a suspected or confirmed autistic spectrum disorder; a training and advisory service for parents, teachers and other professionals; an individual learning centre; an autism research, dissemination and information service; and residential accommodation with care staff.</P>
    <P>Following a number of informal contacts, the proposed acquisition of the Middletown facility was formally considered by my Department in early 2001 when a decision in principle was taken to purchase the facility as a centre to support services for children with autism North and South. Because the legal formalities in relation to the contract of sale for the property have not yet been concluded, it would not be appropriate for me to make further comment on the terms of purchase. This information will be made available when the formalities have been completed.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. N. Dempsey Mr. N. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Mr. N. Dempsey)</NameTxt>
      <P>Children with dyslexia are generally catered for on an integrated basis in ordinary primary schools where they can be supported by the learning support teacher service or the resource teacher service. Where the condition is of a more serious nature, provision can be made in one of the four special schools or 23 special classes attached to ordinary primary schools and dedicated to the needs of such children at present. Decisions on placements are based on the professionally assessed needs of the individual child and parental wishes in relation to their children.</P>
      <P>All special schools and special classes dedicated to children with specific learning disability &ndash; dyslexia &ndash; operate at a reduced pupil teacher ratio of 9:1 and pupils attending such facilities attract a special increased rate of capitation funding. Children with dyslexia attending ordinary schools on an integrated basis may be supported by the learning support teacher service or the resource teacher service. The level of support provided is based on the professionally assessed needs of the individual child. At present, there are 1,531 learning support teachers and approximately 2,300 resource teachers in the primary system.</P>
      <P>My Department also provides funding to schools for the purchase of specialised equipment such as computers to assist children with special needs with their education, including children with dyslexia, where recommended by relevant professionals. Grant aid is also provided to the Dyslexia Association of Ireland to aid in its work in supporting persons with dyslexia.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The report of the task force on dyslexia contains over 60 individual recommendations ranging across a wide variety of issues from identification and assessment, to models of service delivery, specialist training for service providers, to issues relating to structural reforms. Since the task force reported, a number of initiatives have been taken in the area of dyslexia. These include: the introduction of the first ever on-line training course for teachers catering for pupils with dyslexia; the appointment of ten new learning support trainers to the primary curriculum support programme specifically to provide in-depth support for the implementation of learning support guidelines for children with dyslexia; and a reduction from 11:1 <Col N="349" /> to 9:1 in the pupil teacher ratio applicable to special classes catering for children with dyslexia.</P>
    <P>In addition to the above measures, significant progress has been made on developing the structural and legislative framework necessary to ensure the successful implementation of the task force's recommendations. To date, a key focus of my Department has been on finalising arrangements for the establishment of the national council for special education which will be of central importance in facilitating the development and delivery of special education services, including services for children with dyslexia. Significant progress has already been made in developing the national council. A chief executive officer designate has been appointed and an order to formally establish the council will be brought before the Oireachtas shortly.</P>
    <P>I will also be bringing forward legislation at the earliest possible date, based on the Education for Persons with Disabilities Bill, which will establish the rights and entitlements of children and adults with special needs, including dyslexia, and provide the necessary framework for effective service delivery.</P>

      <P>The provision, promotion and pricing of communications infrastructure and services, including Internet access, is a matter for the private sector companies that operate in the fully liberalised telecommunications market. It is the task of the Commission for Communications Regulation to supervise access and interconnection among operators for the purpose of the provision of electronic communications services, including Internet access. My responsibility is for public policy in the sector within which these companies operate. The widest possible availability of competitive services has traditionally been an important objective of Irish telecommunications policy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To accelerate the delivery of faster and cheaper communications services throughout the country by the private sector, my Department has run a number of programmes of targeted intervention in recent years. In 1999, under the National Development Plan 1994-1999 and INTERREG II, &euro;26.5 million was made available to support the roll-out of broadband to the regions. Some 13 projects which rolled out broadband infrastructure nationwide to a value, both public and <Col N="352" /> private funding, of &euro;70 million were supported and are now completed.</P>
    <P>A first call for proposals was run in 2000 and on foot of submissions received, nine contracts were signed at the beginning of 2001 which will result in additional investment in the regions in broadband infrastructure and increased availability of broadband services for business and residential users. The projects involved are scheduled to be completed by the end of next year and will entail an overall investment of &euro;160 million in broadband leveraged from grant assistance of approximately &euro;55 million.</P>
    <P>Under a second call for proposals held in 2001, &euro;3.7 million has been made available to Eircom in respect of DSL roll-out at 14 exchanges nationwide and I also understand that Eircom has DSL enabled 500,000 customer lines which will greatly facilitate the deployment of broadband nationwide.</P>
    <P>The broadband programme announced in March 2002 will result in the construction of open access metropolitan area fibre optic networks in upwards of 19 towns around the country, including Dungarvan and Waterford. By reducing the cost of access to fibre rings, these networks will facilitate the provision by the private sector of &ldquo;always on&rdquo;, low cost and high speed Internet access to consumers, educational establishments, industry and business. It is expected that these projects will be completed progressively over the next two years at a cost in the region of &euro;60 million. I expect work to begin on the Dungarvan and Waterford networks later this year and to be completed by 2004.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 545, 553 and 554 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I understand the details referred to by the Deputies are taken from a report prepared by the Centre for Applied Policy Studies of the National University of Ireland, Cork, which was commissioned for the Irish Forestry Industry Chain. I understand the report is currently being finalised <Col N="354" /> by the author. The conclusions of the final report will be studied by my Department on receipt.</P>
    <P>As the Deputies are aware the Government recently made very difficult choices in the area of the public finances. In making these decisions, the Government was not in a position to make as much money available for all programmes as we would all wish to see across the whole range of public expenditure.</P>
    <P>Consequently, the funding available for forestry for the year 2003 will be less than what would have been expected. This does not take from the strong commitment on the part of the Government, as articulated in repeated programmes for Government, to afforestation policy in Ireland. The Government remains fully convinced of the long-term value of the forestry programme in terms of regional development, strong and sustainable local employment, import substitution and the environment.</P>
    <P>Over past weeks the Minister of State with responsibility for forestry, Deputy Browne, has undertaken extensive consultation with representatives of the various groups right across the sector. The decision has been taken to focus resources primarily in 2003 on maintenance of a viable planting programme. The Minister of State is committed to working closely with the sector over the coming months so as to maintain confidence in the sector having regard to the contribution of forestry to the economy in general and more particularly in terms of rural developments and sustainable local employment.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 548 and 550 together.</P>
      <P>In December 2001 my predecessor, the former Minister, Deputy Fahey, announced approval, in principle, for a grant of up to £40,000 &ndash; 75% of the total cost &ndash; to Westport Harbour Commissioners for a feasibility study to examine the potential for a marina at the harbour. The consultants were Patrick J. Tobin Consulting Engineers, Hynes Building, St. Augustine Street, Galway. The total cost of the study was &euro;34,001 of which my Department provided funding of &euro;25,500, representing 75% of the total cost. This was paid to Mayo County Council in November 2002.</P>
      <P>In March 2002, Mayo County Council submitted an application for funding for a marina under the marine tourism grant scheme of the national development plan. The Deputy will, however, be aware that the revised Estimates for 2003 included major adjustments in marine spending. The funds allocated to marine tourism in 2003 are already fully committed to a number of flagship projects. There are no additional funds available for any additional marine infrastructure projects under the NDP marine tourism grant scheme in 2003.</P>

While members of the Western Regional Fisheries Board may from time to time, undertake inspections of salmon farming oper<Col N="358" /> ations as part of the board's role of protection and development of the wild fisheries resource, the Department is not aware that any member of the board has carried out visits of any farms in regard to a possible outbreak of the disease.

The Harbours Acts 1996 and 2000 provide that these companies are wholly owned by the State and I have no proposals to alter this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="359" />As I have already informed the House, a high level review of the ports operating under the Harbours Acts 1996 and 2000 is currently under way. One of the aspects of the review is to examine the adequacy and appropriateness of the current model for ownership and the governance of the ports sector. The review will seek to identify and evaluate appropriate options for the ownership and corporate governance of the ports, including strategic alliance and wider share ownership possibilities and enhanced private sector involvement. The prime objective of the review is to identify how to ensure that the ports are structured so as to provide the best service to port users and the Irish economy. A secondary objective is to ensure that the ports have access to adequate funding to meet the longer term infrastructural needs of the traded sector of the economy. The study is fully inclusive and involves a full consultation process with all relevant stakeholders and interested parties.</P>
    <P>As I stated publicly at the Irish Ports Association National Conference on 27 September last, I have an open mind as to the best management, operation and ownership arrangements for the ports industry and its customers.</P>

In relation to the general issue raised, the position is that the establishment of annual total allowable catches, TACs, and quotas are part of the EU structure for the conservation and sustainable exploitation of fish stocks. These are agreed by Council and their implementation is a legal obligation on member states.

      <P>I am pleased to have been in a position again this year to provide substantial funding to TG4. In the past five years current grant-in-aid funding to TG4 has risen from &euro;14.8 million in 1998 to over &euro;21 mill<Col N="361" /> ion in the current year, representing an increase of over 40%.</P>
      <P>While this year's Estimate is almost &euro;0.65 million less than the funding provided in 2002, last year's provision included a special once off provision of &euro;1million that was announced in the 2001 budget. In the current difficult financial climate I do not expect to be in a position to provide additional moneys to TG4 in 2003.</P>
      <P>I welcome the very positive impact that TG4 has had on the development of the independent production sector. The fact that the vast majority of Irish language programming continues to be commissioned by TG4 means that the independent sector is set to continue to benefit from the significant public moneys provided to TG4.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DermotAhern" hpid="Mr. D. Ahern Mr. D. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources (Mr. D. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 568 and 572 together.</P>
      <P>Like most Irish people, I am very conscious of our island status and extensive and vulnerable coastline and am accordingly only too aware of the potential for marine and environmental damage caused by pollution from oil and other hazardous substances.</P>
      <P>Legislation is continually under review at both EU and international level. Ireland has consistently supported measures to improve maritime safety and the protection of the marine environment.</P>
      <P>The catastrophe of the tanker <i>Erika</i>, which ran aground on 12 December 1999, polluting almost 400 km. of the French coastline, triggered two packages of measures to protect the marine environment.</P>
      <P>The first <i>Erika</i> package of measures comprised: a directive amending Directive 95/21 on Port State Control; a directive amending Directive 94/57 on Common Rules and Standards for Ship Inspection and Survey Organisations (Classification Societies); and a regulation on the accelerated phasing out of single hull tankers.</P>
      <P>The amending directives on port state control and classification societies were adopted by the European Parliament and Council in December 2001 and are expected to be transposed into Irish law during the first half of this year.</P>
      <P>Following agreement at the International Maritime Organisation, IMO, single hulls tankers are to be phased out in 2003 for vessels delivered in 1973 or earlier and in 2015 for those delivered in 1989 or later. While there are no oil tankers on the Irish register, I am very concerned about the dangers of oil spills in international waters close to our coast. Irish legislation giving effect to MARPOL, the International Convention on Marine Pollution, will have to be amended to provide for the phasing out of single hull tankers and, as of this process, I am examining the options for prohibiting the movement of these tankers in Irish waters at this time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The second <i>Erika</i> package contained three proposals. The first proposal was a directive on the establishment of a Community system for the monitoring and control of vessels transporting certain dangerous or polluting goods on board ships &ndash; HAZMAT Directive. It also requires member states to provide places of refuge for ships in distress. The directive was adopted in June 2002. Member states are required to introduce statutory measures to give effect the directive by February 2004. The second proposal was a regulation concerning the creation of a fund for compensation in the case of oil pollution in Euro<Col N="363" /> pean waters and the adoption of related measures. A review of the international liability and compensation regime is currently under way; liability thresholds have been increased with effect from 1 November 2003; and a protocol establishing a supplementary fund at international level is expected to be adopted in May 2003. The third proposal was a regulation setting up a European agency for maritime safety to monitor the effectiveness of EU maritime safety rules. The agency will provide technical assistance to the Commission and facilitate exchanges of good practice between member states. The first meeting of the administrative board of the agency, which includes a representative from each member state, took place on 4 December 2002.</P>
    <P>The <i>Prestige</i> incident off the coast of Spain in November 2002 has added further impetus to the drive to improve pollution prevention arrangements. The Council of EU Transport Ministers adopted a set of conclusions which committed EU member states and the Commission to undertake a number for further measures, including an accelerated phasing out of single hull oil tankers, further strengthening of port state control provisions, and earlier implementation than had previously been planned of aspects of the measures which followed the <i>Erika</i> incident </P>
    <P>The Dáil has recently passed the Second Stage of the Sea Pollution (Hazardous and Noxious Substances) (Civil Liability and Compensation) Bill 2000 which will give effect in Irish law to agreed changes to the International Convention on Liability and Compensation for Damage in connection with the carriage of Hazardous and Noxious Substances by Sea (HNS Convention). The main objective of the HNS convention, which was adopted at the IMO in 1996, is to provide adequate, prompt and effective compensation for loss or damage arising in connection with the carriage of HNS on sea-going ships. The convention complements arrangements which have been in place since 1969 regarding civil liability and compensation in relation to oil pollution, and which have been the subject of regular review and updating.</P>

      <P>Following protracted and difficult negotiations at the December Fisheries Council, agreement was ulti<Col N="364" /> mately reached by EU Ministers on a new basic CFP regulation which will govern EU fisheries policy over the next decade.</P>
      <P>The reform package contains many of the recommendations of Ireland's national strategy review group. In this regard, I draw attention to an action plan to address the problem of the discarding of juvenile fish catches, stronger control and enforcement, and new regional advisory councils giving fishermen a strong voice in shaping future fisheries policy at EU level.</P>
      <P>Throughout the CFP reform process, intensive consultation was maintained by my Department with all the leading players in the Irish fishing industry. I am satisfied that this high level of consultation played a significant role in ensuring a broadly satisfactory outcome from an Irish perspective.</P>
      <P>I will continue to work intensively, in consultation with the industry representatives, to effect change to fisheries policy on an ongoing basis to ensure that EU policy takes account of Ireland's position and needs into the future.</P>

      <P>The provision of communications infrastructure and services is a matter for the private sector companies that operate in the fully liberalised telecommunications market with reference to the direction and supervision of the Commission for Communications Regulation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To accelerate the delivery of faster and cheaper communications services throughout the country by the private sector, my Department has run a number of programmes of targeted intervention in recent years. These programmes have been designed following consultation with and obtaining the support of the various development <Col N="365" /> agencies: IDA Ireland, Enterprise Ireland, Shannon Development and Údarás na Gaeltachta.</P>
    <P>In 1999, under the National Development Plan 1994-1999 and INTERREG II, &euro;26.5 million was made available to support the roll-out of broadband to the regions. Thirteen projects which rolled-out broadband infrastructure nationwide to a value, both public and private funding, of &euro;70 million were supported and are now completed.</P>
    <P>Under the National Development Plan 2000-2006, approximately &euro;200 million was allocated under the two regional communications and e-commerce measures. Funding under these measures is intended to leverage and accelerate investment in competitive advanced information and communications infrastructure and services. This will enhance the potential for the development of electronic commerce facilities and enable the electronic provision of public services, including education services, virtual libraries, welfare and health services.</P>
    <P>A first call for proposals was run in 2000 and, on foot of submissions received, nine contracts were signed at the beginning of 2001 which will result in additional investment in the regions in broadband infrastructure and increased availability of broadband services for business and residential users. The projects involved are scheduled to be completed by the end of 2003 and will entail an overall investment of &euro;160 million in broadband leveraged from grant assistance of approximately &euro;55 million. Projects funded under this include the construction of a new national fibre backbone by ESB Telecom, the development of regional e-commerce centres by Nevadatele, the extension by Esat of its national network, and the acceleration of the Esat roll-out of DSL in 40 locations.</P>
    <P>Under a second call for proposals held in 2001, &euro;3.7 million has been made available to Eircom in respect of DSL roll-out at 14 exchanges nationwide. This will be of benefit to both the business sector and domestic users. I also understand that Eircom is rolling out DSL at 32 centres in the greater Dublin area and has DSL enabled 500,000 customer lines which will greatly facilitate the deployment of broadband nationwide.</P>
    <P>The broadband programme announced in March 2002 will result in the construction of open access metropolitan area fibre-optic networks in upwards of 19 towns throughout the country. By reducing the cost of access to fibre rings, these networks will facilitate the provision by the private sector of &ldquo;always on&rdquo;, low cost and high speed Internet access to consumers, educational establishments, industry and business. It is expected that these projects will be completed progressively over the next two years at a cost in the region of &euro;60 million.</P>
    <P>My Department is also exploring the potential of satellite and wireless-based technologies to promote the deployment of broadband access in Ireland, especially in remote areas. Pilot projects utilising VSAT and wireless LAN technologies in diverse user communities, to assess their suit<Col N="366" /> ability as a platform for the delivery of advanced broadband services in the regions, are under way. The results of these trials are expected to be available by year end.</P>

      <P>The licensing of third generation mobile phone technology is a matter for the Commission of Communications Regulation.</P>
      <P>There are two types of licence to operate 3G in Ireland. The A licence won by Hutchison Whampoa with a total fee of &euro;50.7 million provides for 80% population coverage with minimum roll-out requirements of 53% of the national population by the end of December 2005 and 80% coverage by the end of December 2007.</P>
      <P>The B licences, which were taken up by O2 and Vodafone with a fee of &euro;114.3 million, provide for a minimum population coverage of 53%, equivalent to five major cities, and roll-out requirements of 33% demographic coverage by the end of June 2006 and 53% demographic coverage by the end of June 2008.</P>
      <P>The differentiation in the fees reflects the greater roll-out cost to the A licensee in meeting the coverage and time constraints compared to the minimum requirements for the B licences. All three licensees have licence commitments to launch during 2003 and the commission intends to confirm fulfilment of each operator's milestones at the relevant times.</P>

      <Quest>if his Department is giving every support, advice and assistance in respect of proposals to develop a major swimming pool facility at Jobstown Park, Tallaght, Dublin 24; his views on whether this facility will be of huge advantage, particularly to the local communities in west Tallaght; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <P>Under the local authority swimming pool programme, 2000-2002, which is administered by my Department, there are four stages in a swimming pool project following the submission of a feasibility study. These are, in order of progress: preliminary report, contract documents, tender and construction. My Department's technical advisors, the Office of Public Works, evaluates each stage and local authorities cannot proceed to the next stage of a project unless prior approval issues from my Department. Grant aid is allocated only when tenders <Col N="370" /> have been approved for the project and will be capped at the time of allocation.</P>
      <P>Under the swimming pool programme, grants of up to &euro;3,809,214 are available towards both the refurbishment of existing pools and the provision of new pools, subject in both cases to the total grant not exceeding 80% of the eligible cost of the project or, in the case of projects located in designated disadvantaged areas, 90% of the eligible cost. Priority is given to projects based in RAPID areas. Support is available towards the cost of the swimming pool, toddler pool, sauna and steam room.</P>
      <P>The preliminary report submitted by South Dublin County Council in respect of the proposal for a new swimming pool in Jobstown was approved in October 2001. Jobstown has been designated as a RAPID area and this proposed swimming pool will provide a much needed facility for the local people. My Department is awaiting the submission of the contract documents for the project by the council. On receipt of this documentation the proposal will be considered further.</P>

      <P>The Deputy will be aware that the pre-hospital emergency care council, PHECC, was established in 2000 and that its primary function is to develop appropriate standards in pre-hospital emergency care. It is in this context that the council is pursuing the development of professional and performance standards for the ambulance services and for ambulance services personnel in addition to the accreditation of institutions providing training for emergency medical technicians.</P>
      <P>The council has submitted proposals to my Department regarding the creation within the ambulance service of an emergency medical technician-advanced, EMT-A, post. The proposals require regulatory changes to permit EMT-As to administer medications. These regulatory changes are being progressed by my Department.</P>
      <P>My Department will continue to pursue policy initiatives aimed at improving key aspects of the emergency medical service to ensure that those calling on the service receive timely and appropriate care.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children (Mr. T. O'Malley)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 589 and 637 together.</P>
      <P>I have received a copy of the assessment of staffing levels at St. Mary's, Drumcar, which is being considered by the North Eastern Health Board. A meeting between my Department, the board and St. John of God representatives is scheduled for Wednesday, 5 February.</P>
      <P>I am aware of the concerns regarding the provision of services to persons with an intellectual disability and those with autism. Additional funding of &euro;13.3 million has been allocated to services for persons with an intellectual disability or autism in 2003 to meet the full year cost of the 2002 developments and to enhance further the health-related support services to children with an intellectual disability or autism. This funding is in addition to the significant revenue investment amounting to &euro;188 million which has been made in these services since 1997 and which is built into the ongoing budget base.</P>
      <P>The additional funding provided by this and the previous Government between 2000 and 2002 was used to put in place, in addition to a range of other services, more than 900 new residential, 380 new respite and around 2,000 new day places for people with an intellectual disability and those with autism.</P>
      <P>Despite this significant investment, demographic factors are contributing to growing waiting lists for residential services in particular, even though the number of people in receipt of services, including full time residential services, continues to increase. The increased birth rate in the 1960s and 1970s has resulted in large numbers of adults in their late 20s and early 30s requiring full-time residential services. In addition, people with an intellectual disability are living longer than previously adding to the need for services compared to previous generations. This has also been the international experience in service provision to this population.</P>
      <P>The overall economic position in 2003 has had implications for all aspects of public investment, and this is reflected in the Estimates and budget adopted by the Government for 2003. Within this overall framework, however, some two-thirds of the additional funding available for non-capital investment in services has been allocated to the health services.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This funding is being applied largely to maintaining existing levels of service across all service <Col N="375" /> programmes, including services for people with an intellectual disability. My Department will work closely with the Eastern Regional Health Authority, the health boards and other service providers on service provision this year.</P>

      <Quest>if his attention has been drawn to the fact that there is no service that offers support tailored to the needs of persons who are autistic and also suffer from deafness; and if he will consider the establishment of a residential resource with appropriate respite, workshop and therapeutic services which would work through sign language and provide support to this particular client group.</Quest>

      <P>In particular, &euro;14.6 million has been invested in health-related support services for children with autism or intellectual disability nationally between 1998 and 2002. A further &euro;4 million has been allocated to these services in 2003. This includes diagnostic and assessment services, early intervention, home support and outreach support to children of schoolgoing age.</P>
      <P>I am aware that there are persons with autism who also have a second disability such as deafness and who therefore require a specific response if their needs are to be met appropriately. Responsibility for the provision of services to people with an intellectual disability or autism is a matter in the first instance for the relevant health board. Decisions on the precise services to be developed in each region are taken by the health boards, in consultation with the regional consultative and development committees, and in line with the service priorities which have been agreed for that region. This would include services for persons with specific needs such as those outlined by the Deputy.</P>

      <P>The question of recognition of hospitals and or specific non-consultant hospital doctor posts for training purposes is a matter for the Medical Council and the training bodies in the first instance. The council and-or the training bodies liaise directly with the relevant health board or hospital in this regard.</P>
      <P>Given that decisions regarding training posts may have service implications, I established the inter-agency healthcare forum in 2001 to act as a forum where both the regulatory bodies and the service providers and other key stakeholders meet to discuss these issues to progress developments and to find resolutions to any problems which arise.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy will be aware, responsibility for the provision of services rests with the individual health boards and the Eastern Regional Health Authority. In the case of St. Michael's Hospital, Dún Laoghaire, the relevant board is the Eastern Regional Health Authority. My Department, has therefore requested the regional chief executive officer of the authority to investigate the position regarding accident and emergency services at the hospital and to reply directly to the Deputy.</P>

      <P>As the Deputy will be aware, emergency ambulance service staff are at the front line of medical and pre-hospital care. It is widely acknowledged that clinical intervention in the first hour or shorter in the case of cardiac arrest can have a major impact on a successful outcome where there is life threatening or indeed any serious injury. The timely intervention of an emergency medical technician, EMT, is a critical part of this emergency response. Emergency ambulance crews often have to provide services in difficult and traumatic circumstances. Not only do they have to deal with the application of emergency care to seriously ill or injured patients but often have to calm and reassure distressed relatives and friends.</P>
      <P>The increasing emphasis on the clinical aspects of the EMT's role in emergency medical care is very much in evidence in the development of emergency medical services worldwide. The extensive use of medical priority despatch and clinical audit systems are indicators of this. The ambulance service is in many ways the emergency arm of the health services.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Policy on the development of emergency medical services in Ireland is set out in a number of documents, including the health strategy, Quality and Fairness &ndash; A Health System for You, the Strategic Review of the Ambulance Service, 2001, and Building Healthier Hearts, the Government's cardiovascular health strategy. The approach set out in these documents follows the internationally accepted principles of the chain of sur<Col N="381" /> vival, which provides that effective care for cardiac emergencies requires early access to emergency care, early cardiopulmonary resuscitation, CPR, early defibrillation and early advanced care.</P>
    <P>The cardiovascular health strategy clearly highlights the importance of patient-centred pre-hospital care involving not only the ambulance service but general practitioners, first responders and the public at large who all have a role to play in providing the right care at the right time. In line with this approach, services are being developed to provide an appropriate level of care in the community to deal with cardiac emergencies. My Department funds a bystander CPR training programme which is organised by the Irish Heart Foundation. This programme aims to increase the availability of CPR skills in the community.</P>
    <P>Defibrillation skills now form a part of basic training for all ambulance personnel. In line with developments in technology which allow people to use defibrillators safely with less training than in the past, my Department is supporting a pilot first responder programme which includes defibrillation skills. This project is being undertaken by the North Western Health Board. My Department has also supported initiatives to provide GPs in more remote rural areas with defibrillator and support equipment and training to allow them deal with emergencies in advance of the arrival of an ambulance. These schemes are in line with the focus of the cardiovascular strategy which seeks to put a pre-hospital care network in place based on the principles of the chain of survival. Further expansion of these initiatives will fall to be progressed in the further implementation of the cardiovascular health strategy.</P>
    <P>The Deputy will be aware that the pre-hospital emergency care council was established in 2000 and that its primary function is to develop appropriate standards in pre-hospital emergency care. It is in this context that the council is pursuing the development of professional and performance standards for the ambulance services and for ambulance services personnel in addition to the accreditation of institutions providing training for emergency medical technicians.</P>
    <P>My Department will continue to pursue policy initiatives aimed at improving key aspects of the emergency medical service to ensure that those calling on the service receive timely and appropriate care.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>As the Deputies are aware, BreastCheck, the national breast screening programme, commenced in March 2000 with phase one of the programme covering the Eastern Regional Health Authority, Midland Health Board and North Eastern Health Board areas. Screening is being offered free of charge to all women in those areas in the target age group 50 to 64 years of age. The target population consists of approximately <Col N="385" /> 136,000 women and it represents about 50% of the national target population. To end October 2002, some 101,072 women had been called for screening and 75,668 women have been screened, representing an uptake of 75%.</P>
    <P>The decision to proceed on a phased basis is a reflection of the complexities involved in the screening process and it is essential that the programme be driven by international quality assurance criteria and best practice. The board of BreastCheck has submitted a business plan to my Department for the national expansion of the programme. My Department is in discussions with the executive of BreastCheck in relation to the expansion of the programme and especially the linkages with the existing symptomatic services.</P>
    <P>Any woman irrespective of her age or residence, who has immediate concerns or symptoms, should contact her GP who, where appropriate, will refer her to the symptomatic services in her area.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 603 and 677 together.</P>
      <P>The study to which the Deputy refers was carried out on asthma in Ireland by Allen and Hanburys in conjunction with the Asthma Society in 2001. This research was an extension to the Asthma Insights and Reality in Europe (AIRE) survey, which was carried out in seven countries in Europe in 1999. This study has confirmed that there are some variations in asthma prevalence figures throughout the European Union confirming previous findings in the European Community respiratory health survey. Some of the likely factors, which may influence this variation, include better diagnosis, environmental factors, including smoking and workplace exposures to respiratory irritants. International studies are being carried out to investigate these possible links.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The major recommendations of the study are that standards of care in the treatment of asthma should adhere more closely to internationally agreed treatment guidelines devised in conjunction with the World Health Organisation and that <Col N="386" /> particular emphasis be given to the education of patients and the fostering of shared care treatment protocols.</P>
    <P>My Department has been in contact with the Health Research Board which has agreed to commission research into the incidence of asthma in the population in Ireland.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children (Mr. T. O'Malley)</NameTxt>
      <P>In April 2002, following the release by the Swedish National Food Administration of the initial information concerning the formation of acrylamide during the cooking of starch-based foods, the Food Safety Authority of Ireland (FSAI) issued an information note to food safety enforcement officers. The note provided details of the properties of acrylamide and gave advice on reducing exposure to acrylamide through healthy eating. The advice given was that consumers could minimise the risk to their health by maintaining a well-balanced diet and avoiding large quantities of fried foods such as chips and potato crisps. This information was also made available on the FSAI website, together with answers to a series of questions likely to be of most concern to consumers.</P>
      <P>The information was updated in June 2002 to provide an overview of the international scientific discussions, which had taken place on the issue since April 2002. These included the views of the EU Scientific Committee for Food and the results of the World Health Organisation's consultation with scientific experts on the matter. Information on acrylamide has also been provided on two occasions in the FSAI newsletter.</P>
      <P>In November 2002 the FSAI organised a seminar on acrylamide in food, attended by representatives of the Irish food industry and enforcement officers, at which international experts spoke on the matter. A press release was issued at that time. The FSAI has also commented on the safety of acrylamide in food in a number of media interviews and has provided advice directly to callers to its help line.</P>
      <P>The authority will continue to monitor scientific developments related to acrylamide in food and will provide information on these developments at regular intervals during 2003. In this regard the Public Analyst Laboratories, at the request of the FSAI, have developed methodologies for the determination of acrylamide in food and are currently surveying foods on the Irish market for acrylamide content.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It should also be noted that the Food Safety Promotion Board, one of the North-South implementation bodies established under the British-Irish Agreement Act 1999, is sponsoring a research project based in Queens University <Col N="388" /> Belfast, which involves the design of a rapid and accurate test for acrylamide. It is hoped over the next few years to design and produce two antibody-based tests for acrylamide that can be used over a wide range of foods and in every human blood type, giving accurate and rapid results. It is hoped that these tests will be made available worldwide and will aid the understanding of acrylamide formation in food and its impact on human health.</P>

Under the Health Act 1970, determination of eligibility for medical cards is the responsibility of the chief executive officer of the appropriate health board other than for persons aged 70 years and over, who are automatically eligible for a medical card. Medical cards are issued to persons who, in the opinion of the chief executive officer, are unable to provide general practitioner medical and surgical services for themselves and their dependants without undue hardship.</P>
      <P>Income guidelines are drawn up to assist in the determination of a person's eligibility and these are revised annually in line with the consumer price index. However, the guidelines are not statutorily binding and even though a person's income exceeds the guidelines, a medical card may still be awarded if the chief executive officer considers that his or her medical needs or other circumstances would justify this. It is open to all persons to apply to the chief executive officer of the appropriate health board if they are unable to provide health services for themselves or their dependants without hardship.</P>
      <P>Persons suffering from specified conditions, including acute leukaemia, who are not already medical card holders, may obtain without charge drugs and medicines for the treatment of that condition under the long-term illness scheme. There are no plans at this time to amend the long-term illness scheme to include persons with other forms of cancer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Since the implementation of the national cancer strategy, more than &euro;130 million has been invested in the development of appropriate treatment and care services for people with cancer. Since 1997, approval has issued for 80 additional consultant posts with support staff. This sum includes an additional &euro;29 million which has been allocated in 2003 for cancer services. This investment will ensure that next year we continue to address increasing demands in cancer services in such areas as oncology and haematology services, <Col N="389" /> oncology drug treatments and symptomatic breast disease services.</P>
    <P>The eligibility framework was considered in the context of the national health strategy, Quality and Fairness &ndash; A Health System For You. The strategy outlines a number of measures designed to improve eligibility for health services, including an increase in access to medical cards. However, increased investment in this or any other developmental aspect of the strategy agenda is dependent on the availability of the necessary additional resources. Following the Estimates and budget adopted by the Government, this unfortunately will not be possible in 2003.</P>

      <P>I have arranged to meet with the family concerned on 12 February 2003.</P>
      <P>With regard to the concerns of the family referred to by the Deputy in relation to adverse human health in the Askeaton area, a multiagency investigation, co-ordinated by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), was carried out into health problems at Askeaton. The investigation included a number of human health studies to determine if the health of people living in the area was different to that of residents in surrounding counties and, if so, whether the difference could be attributed to environmental pollution. The results of the human health survey did not support a link to any form of local environmental pollution. The study did not find a significant degree of excessive ill health in the Askeaton area and it concluded that there was little basis for the concern that the problems in the area represented a threat to human health.</P>
      <P>A further study carried out by the National Cancer Registry examined cancer data relating to the Askeaton area covering the period from 1994 to 1999. The results of the examination indicates that cancer rates in the Mid-Western Health Board area from 1994 to 1999 were lower than the national average and that cancer rates in the Askeaton study areas 1 and 2 from 1994 to 1999 were lower than the Mid-Western Health Board average and conformed to national and regional patterns by cause. The data as examined by the National Cancer Registry do not support a hypothesis that the incidence of cancer in the Askeaton region is higher than would be expected based on either Mid-Western Health Board or national cancer incidence rates.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Mid-Western Health Board carried out an inquiry into the issue of missing samples in relation to the family concerned and a copy of the report of the inquiry group was given to the family. The report indicates that routine tests were carried out on some samples and that results <Col N="392" /> of these tests were reported to the clinicians involved. The report concluded that a combination of errors, both human and of the systems involved, had contributed to the problem. The report made a number of recommendations including the need for improvements in the receipt, tracking, testing and storage of samples at the pathology laboratory in Limerick Regional Hospital. The Mid-Western Health Board has advised my Department that it is actively pursuing the implementation of all the recommendations contained in the report. Against this background, I have no plans at present to initiate a public inquiry regarding this issue.</P>
    <P>The Mid-Western Health Board has indicated that some untested samples from the family concerned are being stored awaiting instructions from the family physician as to what testing is required.</P>
    <P>At a meeting with the family in November 2001, I indicated that they should request their GP to organise for an independent assessment of their current health status, which would be funded by my Department. My Department is awaiting a response in relation to this issue.</P>

      <P>The opening and operation of retail pharmacies in Ireland is governed by the Pharmacy Acts 1875-1977, subject to restrictions imposed by non-pharmacy legislation such as the planning Act. A pharmacy may be operated by an individual or company providing that the shop and the dispensing and compounding of medical prescriptions are personally supervised by a person who is a pharmacist and is employed in a full-time capacity and is not acting elsewhere in a similar capacity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Health (Community Pharmacy Contractor Agreement) Regulations 1996, which I revoked in <Col N="393" /> January 2002, following advice from the Attorney General, set out the criteria and procedures for granting community pharmacy contracts by the health boards. Following the revocation of the regulations, there are no restrictions on granting new contracts in terms of location, population or viability of existing pharmacies.</P>
    <P>The pharmacy review group, chaired by Professor Michael Mortell, was established by me in November 2001 to examine the pharmacy issues raised in the OECD report on regulatory reform in Ireland. The group has based its approach on the principles set out for evidence-based policy formulation by the Mandelkern Group in its publication The Mandelkern Group on better regulation final report, 13 November 2001. These include: public and interest group consultation; analysis of the existing position &ndash;<i>ex post</i> analysis; and analysis of possible options &ndash;<i>ex ante</i> analysis. The group has consulted widely and, in particular, with consumer interests. The group is on schedule to complete its task and report to me at the end of January 2003.</P>

      <P>The task force on autism, which was established by the Department of Education and Science, has put forward a range of recommendations ranging from measures aimed at identifying prevalence rates, through issues relating to diagnosis and assessment, the centrality of the role of parents, the required models of education and health care services, the need for specialist training for those involved in service provision, to structural, constitutional and policy issues. The scope of the task force's recommendations is such as to require a multi-faceted response involving educational and health care inputs. The task force's recommendations are currently being considered by both Departments.</P>
      <P>There has been a significant investment in both health related and educational supports for persons with autism in recent years. Additional funding of &euro;13.3 million has been allocated by my Department to services for persons with autism or intellectual disability in 2003 to meet the full year cost of the 2002 developments and to further enhance the health related support services to children with autism or intellectual disability. This funding is in addition to the very significant revenue investment, amounting to &euro;188 million, which has been made in these services since 1997 and which is built into the ongoing budget base.</P>
      <P>The additional funding provided by this and the previous Government between 2000 and 2002 was used to put in place, in addition to a range of other services, more than 900 new residential, 380 new respite and around 2,000 new day places for people with autism and those with an intellectual disability.</P>
      <P>In particular &euro;14.6 million has been invested by my Department in health related support services for children with autism or intellectual disability nationally between 1998 and 2002. A further &euro;4 million has been allocated to these services in 2003. This includes diagnostic and assessment services, early intervention, home support and out-reach support to children of schoolgoing age. The Government is committed to the ongoing development of these services as outlined in the programme for Government.</P>

    </P>
    <P>My Department has asked the health boards and the Eastern Regional Health Authority for information in relation to the number of adults with autism known to them in their regions. This information will be forwarded to the Deputy as soon as it becomes available.</P>
    <P>While some persons with autism, who also have an intellectual disability, are included on the national intellectual disability database, it does not contain information on this population as a whole. For example in the ERHA region, the children's autism services come under the child and family services and these children are not on the database. The adult services are within the disability services and these would, in the main, be included on the database. There is also the fact that parents of children with autism may not want their children entered on the intellectual disability database. The database does not identify persons with specific disabilities such as Down's syndrome or autism into separate groupings as its principal role is as a planning and monitoring tool. The development of an information system which would give a level of information on the needs of this group, similar to that already available from the intellectual disability database, is being followed up with the health boards and the Eastern Regional Health Authority.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children (Mr. T. O'Malley)</NameTxt>
      <P>Additional funding of &euro;13.3 million has been allocated to services for persons with an intellectual disability or autism in 2003 to meet the full year cost of the 2002 developments and to further enhance the health related support services to children with <Col N="396" /> an intellectual disability or autism. This funding is in addition to the very significant revenue investment, amounting to &euro;188 million, which has been made in these services since 1997 and which is built into the ongoing budget base.</P>
      <P>The additional funding provided by this and the previous Government between 2000 and 2002 was used to put in place, in addition to a range of other services, over 900 new residential, 380 new respite and around 2,000 new day places for people with an intellectual disability and those with autism.</P>
      <P>In particular &euro;14.6 million has been invested in health related support services for children with autism or intellectual disability nationally between 1998 and 2002. A further &euro;4 million has been allocated to these services in 2003. This includes diagnostic and assessment services, early intervention, home support and outreach support to children of schoolgoing age.</P>
      <P>However, many health boards and specialist service providers have been experiencing difficulties in recruiting allied health professionals, in particular speech and language therapists, occupational therapists, physiotherapists and psychologists. This is due primarily to the general shortage of available staff in these grades nationally.</P>
      <P>Health boards and agencies have been and are continuing to undertake intensive recruitment drives at home and abroad. My Department has asked the health boards and the Eastern Regional Health Authority to explore other approaches which might result in the maintenance of an existing level of service provision or enhancement in line with agreed services developments for children using the resources allocated to the services. It is a matter for the ERHA and the health boards to decide on the specific approaches, which they may consider appropriate in this area.</P>
      <P>In response to my concern regarding the high level of vacancies my Department commissioned a report from Dr. Peter Bacon and Associates on current and future supply and demand conditions in the labour market for speech and language therapists, occupational therapists and physiotherapists. The study was published in July 2001. The report recommends a major expansion in the number of training places available for those professions.</P>
      <P>An interagency working group was established comprising representatives of my Department, the Department of Education and Science and the Higher Education Authority (HEA). The HEA, following a formal bidding process between third level educational institutions, has allocated an additional 175 training places to respond to the training needs identified in the study. In addition the Northern Area Health Board undertook a concerted overseas recruitment drive on behalf of all health boards. Procedures are being streamlined to minimise the length of time taken to validate foreign qualifications consistent with the primary need to ensure that all therapists working in the health sector are appropriately trained and qualified.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="397" />As the Deputy can see from the measures outlined above, the Government has been and is continuing to work to expand the level of support available nationally to children with autism or intellectual disability.</P>

      <P>The national children's strategy, published in November 2000, contains a commitment that: &ldquo;Children will have access to play, sport, recreation and cultural activities to enrich their experience of childhood.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Local authorities are and always have been empowered to provide play, recreational and amenity areas. While the number of public playgrounds is low, research undertaken in 1997, when the previous Government took office, indicated that 46% of local authorities did not provide playgrounds. This figure has now been reduced to 12% at end 2002. Significant development in public play facilities has occurred since it was identified as an issue for children in the national children's strategy. Most counties' strategies for economic, social and cultural development now include a reference to play and play facilities.</P>
      <P>A recent survey of local authorities indicated that there are 167 local authority provided public playgrounds with fixed play components, one public skate park and six additional public playgrounds provided by Dúchas. As in other countries, public play infrastructure is supported and developed at a local government level. I am unaware of any published statistical comparisons on public playgrounds provision at a national level in other EU states. However, I do know that the city of Edinburgh provides 153 public playgrounds to serve a population of approximately 500,000. I am led to understand that Sweden has some 50,000 public playgrounds serving a population of almost 9 million, but this has not been confirmed.</P>
      <P>The issue of insurance for play facilities will be addressed within the context of the new play policy for the under 12s, which I will bring to the Government before Easter. Playgrounds provided by local authorities are insured through Irish Public Bodies Mutual Insurance Limited. To date, that body has not experienced a significant level of claims relating to playgrounds by comparison to claims relating to accidents occurring on paths or other public areas. However it must be kept in mind that the balance between risk and challenge is an essential element of play and needs to be viewed as such to ensure quality play environments for children.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government's continuing commitment to play and the provision of play opportunities is reflected in An Agreed Programme for Govern<Col N="402" /> ment. Children's play is about more that just public playgrounds. The new play policy currently being developed will adopt an integrated approach to play provision to include the development of a more child-friendly environment and a partnership between children, parents, schools and child care providers, communities and government agencies.</P>

      <P>Additional funding of &euro;13.3 million has been allocated to services for people with an intellectual disability or autism in 2003 to meet the full year cost of the 2002 developments and to further enhance the health related support services to children with an intellectual disability or autism.

    <P>Responsibility for the provision of services to people with disabilities is a matter, in the first instance, for the relevant health board.

      <P>The report of the maternity and infant care scheme review group, which was published in 1994, considered the provision of maternity services in general and made a number of recommendations regarding the operation of the maternity and infant care scheme. The scheme provides for an agreed programme of care, free of charge, to an expectant mother arising out of her pregnancy and to her new born baby for six weeks after birth. In its report, the review group did not envisage a cervical smear test as part of the scheme, but noted that the Department of Health cervical screening committee was, at that time, examining all aspects of the cervical screening service. The 1996 report of the Department of Health cervical screening committee was subsequently published and currently informs policy in relation to the development of a national cervical screening programme. This report states that post-natal smears are not recommended in asymptomatic women.</P>
      <P>It is important to note, however, that while cervical smear testing is not currently provided by GPs under the scheme for medical card holders, such testing, which is found to be necessary in the context of the individual woman's medical examination and clinical needs, is available under the GMS scheme. For those women who require follow-up treatment, such service is available to all women, including medical card holders, within the public hospital system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Phase one of the national cervical screening programme has been up and running in the Mid-Western Health Board since October 2000. Under the national health strategy, a commitment has been given to the full extension of the programme to the rest of the country. The experience gained from phase one should be of assist<Col N="405" /> ance in the context of implementing this commitment.</P>
    <P>The process of planning and organising the national programme is a major undertaking with significant logistical and resource implications that require careful consideration. Following discussions with my Department on the matter, the chief executive officers of the health boards initiated an examination of the feasibility and implications of a roll-out of the national programme. In this context, I understand that the chief executive officers are currently paying particular attention to the need to have an external review of phase one carried out and also to ensure appropriate governance structures are in place for managing the national programme.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 641 and 642 together.</P>
      <P>Action 105 of the health strategy commits my Department to strengthening and expanding provisions for statutory registration of health professionals. In this context legislation is being prepared to establish a system of statutory registration for 14 health and social care professions, including physiotherapy. Under these proposals, which have been approved by Government, a registration board will be established for each profession which will be responsible, <i>inter alia</i>, for establishing and maintaining a register of qualified practitioners and setting standards of education and training.</P>
      <P>Under these proposals, the title of physiotherapist will be protected, that is, only those professionals registered with the registration board for physiotherapists will be legally entitled to use the title, physiotherapist. This will represent a significant improvement on the existing legal position, where currently there is no impediment to a person in private practice describing themselves as a physiotherapist, irrespective of their qualification level. This situation does not arise in the case of those employed or working on behalf of the public health service where the title of physiotherapist refers only to those who meet the minimum qualification level for entry into the profession. This measure currently ensures quality assurance for State physiotherapists.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As far as the request of the Irish Society of Chartered Physiotherapists is concerned, it will be an offence under the proposed legislation for an unregistered person either to use a protected title or to act in a manner which implies that he or she is entitled to use a protected title. In such circumstances it will be a matter for the pro<Col N="407" /> posed regulatory authority for health and social care professionals to investigate any complaint that a person is misrepresenting themselves in any of these respects. It will also be the responsibility of the regulatory authority to ensure that members of the public are properly informed and guided that a registered professional providing a service is suitably qualified and competent. It will remain the responsibility of every individual practitioner providing health care services to the public to ensure he or she is trained and qualified to the level required to work safely within his or her area of competence.</P>

The person was discharged from Our Lady's Hospital, Crumlin, on 6 January 2003. The Eastern Regional Health Authority was in regular correspondence with the relevant hospital with a view to expediting the necessary surgery. The authority was awaiting the successful outcome of the discussions before so advising the Deputy.</P>
      <P>In my reply to the Deputy's parliamentary question of 27 June 2002, I advised that my Department had requested a report on the matter from the chief executive officer of the authority. The authority subsequently advised my Department of the position and in August 2002 I wrote to the Deputy advising him of the up to date position and the efforts of the authority to arrange surgery. I am also advised that the authority wrote to the Deputy in May 2001.</P>

      <P>Comhairle na nOspidéal is the statutory body whose main function is to regulate appointments of consultant medical staff in hospitals providing services under the Health Acts and to specify qualifications for such appointments. At my request An Comhairle undertook a review of the structures, operation and staffing of accident and emergency departments in acute hospitals providing such services. The report, published in February 2002, deals with staffing of accident and emergency departments at consultant level and links <Col N="413" /> reform of accident and emergency departments with the need to look critically at hospital processes and patient flows. An Comhairle did not specify the minimum number of patients per consultant in emergency medicine in its report. Instead it stated:</P>
      <P>Consultants in Emergency Medicine play a key clinical and managerial role in Emergency Departments. The appointment of additional Consultants should contribute to improvements in patient care and the flow of patients through the Emergency Department. However, appointing additional Consultants in Emergency Medicine, without changes in the organisation of Emergency Departments and hospital emergency care, will have little impact.</P>
      <P>The report provides valuable advice on the structures of our emergency services and the necessary linkages which will be required to eliminate the delays in emergency departments. In terms of manpower the report recommends a total of 74 consultants in emergency medicine nationally and recognises that the implementation of this recommendation will take time.</P>
      <P>I was pleased to announce a &euro;40.63 million investment package aimed at alleviating service pressures and maintaining services to patients, particularly in the acute hospital sector, over the winter period 2000-01. The investment package was targeted at a number of areas, including the recruitment of an additional 29 consultants in emergency medicine, of which three were for the South Eastern Health Board. To date, 17 additional consultants in emergency medicine have been appointed under the initiative and the recruitment process is continuing in respect of the additional appointments. These additional 29 consultants will see the total number of consultants in emergency medicine increase to 50.</P>
      <P>Responsibility for the provision of accident and emergency services at St. Luke's Hospital, Kilkenny and the other hospitals in the south eastern region rests with the South Eastern Health Board. The figures, for 2001, in relation to the number of attendances at accident and emergency departments at hospitals in the South Eastern Health Board, are outlined in the following table:</P>

      <P>There is a set protocol in place for processing applications for national lottery grants. When an application is received in my Department it is registered in the finance unit and forwarded to the relevant services division for their assessment, evaluation and recommendation. All applications are then considered in the context of the recommendation and the overall level of funds available.</P>
      <P>The Irish Motor Neurone Disease Association has received grants from the Department of Health and Children allocation of national lottery funds towards the maintenance and expansion of its equipment bank since 1999 as follows: 1999, &euro;12,697.38; 2000, &euro;101,579.05; 2001, Nil; 2002, Nil.</P>
      <P>While the national lottery application submitted in 2002 was recommended for a grant by the services division, the number of applications received far exceeded the available resources and it was not possible to assist in this particular case during 2002. The organisation was informed of this on 26 November 2002 and advised that it may apply for a grant from the 2003 national lottery allocation if funding for this project was still required.

      <P>Arising from the health strategy, Quality and Fairness &ndash; a health system for you, one of the key actions for dealing with the public hospital waiting lists was the establishment of the national treatment purchase fund. The NTPF was set up in April 2002 and referred its first patients for treatment at the end of June. Health boards and hospitals have been asked to identify public patients waiting longest on in-patient lists in order that they can be offered treatment under this initiative.</P>
      <P>The NTPF is initially concentrating on adults who have been waiting on in-patient lists for more than 12 months and children waiting over six months for a surgical procedure. Patients who satisfy these criteria may apply to their GP, hospital consultant or local health board liaison person to seek to have their treatment carried out under the NTPF. Alternatively, patients can telephone the NTPF's lo-call number at 1890 720 820.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="418" />The listing of patients for treatment under the NTPF initiative is an ongoing process and at this time it is not possible to say how many patients will be treated from the South Eastern Health Board area in the current year. However, to date, approximately 140 patients from this area have received treatment. The capacity to treat a greater number is in place. In addition, it is anticipated that some orthopaedic patients can receive procedures, for example, joint replacements in Kilcreene Orthopaedic Hospital in the coming months.</P>

      <P>The provision of health services in the Kilkenny area is a matter for the South Eastern Health Board in the first instance. The board has advised that a working group was established to examine the possibility of providing an interim solution to the provision of extended care beds for the elderly within Kilkenny city pending the development of phase two of the community hospital project at St. Luke's Hospital.</P>
      <P>The group considered the possibility of using vacated ward space at St. Canice's Hospital, Kilkenny. As the Deputy will be aware, a 24 bed unit will become available at the hospital when the elderly patients currently cared for at St. Joseph's Ward relocate to the refurbished psycho-geriatric St. Luke's-St. Gabriel's Ward at the hospital. The 24 bed ward is located on the ground floor adjacent to the refurbished elderly care wards at the hospital and has access to external garden space.</P>
      <P>The working group considers that St. Joseph's Ward would be suitable, following adequate upgrading, to be used on an interim basis for the provision of long stay beds for the care of older people from the Kilkenny area. A proposal for the upgrading of this ward has now been submitted to my Department by the board. This proposal will fall to be considered in the context of the funding available to the board under the national development plan and in the light of other priorities for development identified by the board. I would expect that, following consideration of the proposal by my Department, it will be the subject of discussions between officials of the board and my Department at which stage issues such as its priority rating will be clarified.</P>

      <P>A sum of &euro;277,000 is being provided to Muscular Dystrophy Ireland in 2003 through the Eastern Regional Health Authority. This funding is in addition to &euro;262,000 which was provided to the organisation in 2002 and is for the purpose of implementing recommendations of the service audit of the sector. This is a considerable increase by comparison with the sum of &euro;380,000, the approximate figure which the organisation spent in 2000. The additional funding which has been provided has significantly enhanced the support services which are being provided by the organisation to people with neuromuscular conditions.</P>

      <P>Responsibility for the provision of health services in the Mayo area rests with the Western Health Board, and my Department has made inquiries of the chief executive office of the board, concerning a community <Col N="421" /> nursing unit in Ballinrobe. As the Deputy will be aware, capital funding has been made available to the Western Health Board for the purchase of a site and I understand that a potential site was made available adjacent to the parochial house in the town centre. A full option appraisal has been carried out on the site and it was felt that there were particular design constraints which made it less than ideal for the construction of a community nursing unit.</P>
      <P>I understand that, following discussions with the local clergy, additional land, increasing the site, was offered. This is currently being examined by the board's technical staff and the Valuation Office has been asked to revise its valuation in the light of the additional land offered. A further site, on the Claremorris Road, which is currently owned by Mayo County Council, has also been offered to the board, and a full appraisal and valuation has been carried out on this site.</P>
      <P>A decision will have to be made, in due course, on which site represents the best option for the development of a community nursing unit and ancillary services. As the purchase and disposal of property is a reserved function of the board, both of those site options will be presented to its property committee and, ultimately, to the board, for approval. I am sure the Deputy will agree that is imperative that the site obtained in Ballinrobe be the best possible option for the community nursing unit and ancillary services.</P>

      <P>In 2002 additional funding of &euro;7.618 million was allocated for the maintenance and development of home support services, including personal assistant services for people with physical and sensory disabilities.

This funding was provided in the context of the overall determination of expenditure for each health board in 2002. Under the Health (Amendment) (No 3) Act, 1996, it is the responsibility of each chief executive officer and his board to prioritise funding in order to ensure that services are provided and the allocation is not exceeded. My Department will be monitoring in consultation with the health boards overall spending on health services, including personal <Col N="422" /> assistance services for people with disabilities over the course of 2003.</P>

On completion of this examination, further investigation will take place into the clinical and administrative aspects of the most relevant models examined and a report on the issue will be prepared. At that stage I will consider the introduction of legislation for such a scheme.</P>

      <P>The Nursing Alliance sought third party adjudication on the appropriate retrospection applicable to nurses in respect of a decision by the Department of the Environment and Local Government that acting up allowances should be included for the purpose of calculating premium pay. A Rights Commissioner hearing took place on 9 March 2002.</P>
      <P>The Rights Commissioner issued the following recommendation: nurses who acted in higher posts and to whom premium payments applied, should apply to their health board for payment; for each minimum period of one continuous month acting in a higher post they should be paid <i>pro rata</i> to the value of one year; the value of one year is recommended as &euro;600; and the maximum payment available to any individual is the equivalent of five years, &euro;3,000.</P>
      <P>It was decided that the proposal outlined above in respect of salary arrears to nurses currently in employment, should also apply to salary arrears due to pensioners. Pensioners who acted in a higher post in the three years prior to retirement should have their lump sum and pension reviewed to reflect this fact and any adjustment should be in accordance with normal superannuation arrangements.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The unions have appealed this recommendation to the Labour Court. The issue under <Col N="429" /> appeal refers to the duration of the acting period. The Rights Commissioner's recommendation stated that for each minimum period of one continuous month acting in a higher post a nurse should be paid <i>pro rata</i> to the value of one year. It is the union's contention that this should be for periods of acting of one week or more. The Labour Court hearing took place on 17 January 2003 and the outcome is awaited.</P>

    <P>I am aware of the concerns regarding the pro<Col N="431" /> vision of services to persons with an intellectual disability and those with autism.</P>
    <P>Additional funding of &euro;13.3 million has been allocated to services for persons with an intellectual disability or autism in 2003 to meet the full year cost of the 2002 developments and to further enhance the health related support services to children with an intellectual disability or autism. This funding is in addition to the very significant revenue investment, amounting to &euro;188 million, which has been made in these services since 1997 and which is built into the ongoing budget base.</P>
    <P>The additional funding provided by the Government between 2000 and 2002 was used to put in place, in addition to a range of other services, over 900 new residential, 380 new respite and around 2,000 new day places for people with an intellectual disability and those with autism. In particular &euro;14.6 million has been invested in health related support services for children with autism or intellectual disability nationally between 1998 and 2002. A further &euro;4 million has been allocated to these services in 2003. This includes diagnostic and assessment services, early intervention, home support and outreach support to children of school going age with autism.</P>
    <P>The overall economic position in 2003 has had implications for all aspects of public investment and this is reflected in the Estimates and budget adopted by the Government for 2003. Within this overall framework, however, some two thirds of the additional funding available for non-capital investment in services has been allocated to the health services.</P>
    <P>This funding is being applied largely to maintaining existing levels of service across all service programmes including services for people with an intellectual disability. While it is regrettable that the level of investment in these services achieved in recent years could not be maintained in 2003, my Department will work closely with the health boards and other service providers in relation to service provision this year.</P>
    <P>In relation to the number of respite places available; between 70 and 75 new places were put in place during 2002. My Department has asked the health boards and the Eastern Regional Health Authority for information in relation to the overall number of respite places available. This information will be forwarded to the Deputy as soon as it becomes available.</P>

      <P>Health impact assessment is a combination of procedures, methods and tools by which a policy, programme or project may be judged as to its potential effects on the health of a population and the distribution of those effects within the population. It can operate at local, regional, national and international level.</P>
      <P>Preliminary work has been carried out on the introduction of health impact assessment. The priorities for 2003 are the development of an appropriate methodology which uses health impact assessment tools and the provision of training for individuals and organisations as part of the capacity building process. There is added value in developing this work on an all-Ireland basis and the Institute of Public Health is facilitating capacity development for both my Department and the Department of Health and Social Services in Belfast. It is anticipated that the initial work on methodology will be completed shortly and that training will commence in the next few months.</P>
      <P>The health strategy also recommended the establishment of a population health division in my Department and each health board which would facilitate health impact assessment and promote health proofing of all government decisions. The establishment of a population health division is currently being considered in the context of the restructuring plans for my Department. Work on restructuring is being carried out in parallel with the audit of structures and functions of the health system which is currently under way.</P>

      <P>Preliminary talks on a revised contract for consultants commenced in 2001 and the parties to the negotiations have met in plenary session on seven occasions since then, under the chairmanship of Mr. Mark Connaughton SC. To date the discussions have centred on two key issues arising from the current &ndash; 1997 &ndash; contract, namely: the introduction and operation of a revised grievance and dispute procedure; and the proposal to amend Clause 4.3 (Administrative Leave) of Appendix IV of the contract (Disciplinary Procedures).</P>
      <P>In relation to the former, the parties agreed to a revised scheme in October 2002. The latter is a more complex issue, which is still some way from resolution. Once agreement is reached on this issue, it is hoped that both parties can begin talks on the substantive issues in relation to a new common contract for consultants.</P>

      <P>I am aware of the concerns regarding the provision of services to persons with an intellectual disability and those with autism.</P>
      <P>Additional funding of &euro;13.3 million has been allocated to services for persons with an intellectual disability or autism in 2003 to meet the full year cost of the 2002 developments and to further enhance the health related support services to children with an intellectual disability or autism. This funding is in addition to the very significant revenue investment, amounting to &euro;188 million, which has been made in these services since 1997 and which is built into the ongoing budget base. The additional funding provided by this and the previous Government between 2000 and 2002 was used to put in place, in addition to a range of other services, over 900 new residential, 380 new respite and around 2,000 new day places for people with an intellectual disability and those with autism.</P>
      <P>There has also been further significant progress in relation to the transfer to more appropriate accommodation of persons currently accommodated in psychiatric hospitals and other inappropriate placements. The number of persons accommodated in psychiatric hospitals in October 2002 was 452, down from 571 in 2001 and 970 in 1996. Planning approval has been granted in respect of the new residential and day services to be built on the St. Ita's campus for residents of the St. Joseph's intellectual disability services, with building work due to commence this year. Approval has also been given to commence the planning and design work in relation to a residential and day service complex for a further 30 persons in Lusk.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is specific mention of this programme in the health strategy with a stated objective to complete the overall transfer of persons with an intellectual disability from psychiatric hospitals in all health board regions as soon as possible. The Department will be working with the Eastern <Col N="436" /> Regional Health Authority and the health boards to achieve this objective.</P>
    <P>Despite this very significant investment, demographic factors are contributing to growing waiting lists for residential services in particular even though the numbers of people in receipt of services, including full time residential services, continues to increase. The increased birth rate in the 1960s and 1970s has resulted in large numbers of adults in their late 20s and early 30s requiring full-time residential services. In addition, people with an intellectual disability are living longer than previously adding to the need for services compared to previous generations. This has also been the international experience in service provision to this population.</P>
    <P>The overall economic position in 2003 has had implications for all aspects of public investment, and this is reflected in the Estimates and budget adopted by the Government for 2003. Within this overall framework, however, some two thirds of the additional funding available for non-capital investment in services has been allocated to the health services.</P>
    <P>This funding is being applied largely to maintaining existing levels of service across all service programmes including services for people with an intellectual disability. While it is regrettable that the level of investment in these services achieved in recent years could not be maintained in 2003, my Department will work closely with the health boards and other service providers in relation to service provision this year.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>The drugs payment scheme, DPS, with a monthly threshold of £42, &euro;53.33, replaced the drug refund scheme, DRS, and the drug cost subsidisation scheme, DCSS, in 1999. This scheme provided that families only had to meet the first &euro;53.33 a month of spending on approved prescribed medicines. The DCSS threshold was £32, &euro;40.63, per month per individual, and for the DRS it was £90, &euro;114.28, per quarter for each eligible person and dependants. Under the DRS, the person paid for medicines at the pharmacy, and claimed a refund from the health board at the end of each quarter. There was no increase in the thresholds for the DRS or DCSS since 1991. The threshold for the DPS was raised from &euro;53.33 to &euro;65 with effect from 1 August 2002 and from &euro;65 to &euro;70 with effect from 1 January 2003.</P>
      <P>The DPS has provided a fairer and more user friendly system than the previous schemes, particularly through the provision of monthly medicine budgeting for families, and has produced significantly greater overall benefit for patients. It introduced full reimbursement, at point of supply, of the cost of approved drugs above the monthly threshold. In line with quality customer service principles, there was no longer any need to pay first and then reclaim this expenditure from the health board, and, unlike the DCSS, everybody was eligible for the DPS.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The increases in the threshold of the scheme are running slightly ahead of inflation since <Col N="439" /> August 2002. However, I would like to emphasise that the aggregate financial benefits for patients under the DPS are clearly significantly greater than the old schemes. The total patient benefit under the DRS and the DCSS in 1998 was £75 million in the last full year of operation. In contrast, the DPS subvention was £110 million in 2000, the first full year of operation, and rose to <Col N="440" /> £140 million in 2001, an increase of 87% in three years.</P>
    <P>The cost of the drug refund and drug cost subsidisation schemes for the years 1992 to end June 1999 and for the drug payment scheme from July 1999 to end December 2001, together with the cost of drugs, medicines and certain appliances for the general medical services scheme are set out in the following table.</P>

      <P>The general medical services scheme is a treatment based scheme which provides for a range of services and the supply of drugs and medicines from an approved list, free of charge to medical card patients. These services are provided by general practitioners, community pharmacists, dentists and other health care professionals who hold contracts with the local health boards.</P>
      <P>Since acupuncture is as yet an unlicensed treatment in Ireland, it is not available under the scheme. I am not in a position to indicate what the position of the Irish Medical Organisation would be as the matter has not been discussed with it.</P>
      <P>I would add that in November 2002, the Institute of Public Administration launched a report, which I commissioned, into alternative medical practitioners. One of the recommendations of the report was the establishment of a working group to examine the whole area and advise my Department. This working group is in the process of being established.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>Entitlement to health services in Ireland is primarily based on residency and means rather than income. Any person, regardless of nationality, who is accepted by the health boards as being ordinarily resident in Ireland is entitled to either full eligibility, category 1, that is, medical card holders, or limited eligibility, category 2, for health services. Health boards normally regard a person as &ldquo;ordinarily resident&rdquo; in Ireland if he or she satisfies the health board that it is his or her intention to remain in Ireland for a minimum period of one year.</P>
      <P>Persons in category 1 are medical card holders and they are entitled to a full range of services including general practitioner services, prescribed drugs and medicines, all in-patient public hospital services in public wards including consultants services, all out-patient public hospital services including consultants services, dental, ophthalmic and aural services and appliances and a maternity and infant care service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Persons in category 2, non-medical card holders, are entitled, subject to certain charges, to all in-patient public hospital services in public wards including consultants services and out-patient public hospital services including consultants services. The current public hospital statutory in-patient charge is &euro;40 per night, up to a maximum of &euro;400 in any 12 consecutive months. Attendance at accident and emergency departments is <Col N="442" /> subject to a charge of &euro;40 where the patient does not have a referral note from his-her doctor. This charge applies only to the first visit in any episode of care. A maternity and infant care service is provided during pregnancy and up to six weeks after birth.</P>
    <P>Under the Health Act 1970 the determination of eligibility for health services is the responsibility of the chief executive officer of the appropriate health board and neither I nor my Department has a function in the matter. I add that health boards have discretion, in cases of exceptional need, to provide assistance to individuals where undue hardship would otherwise be caused.</P>
    <P>Alternatively, one can opt to be the private patient of both the consultant and the hospital. Any patient, whether a medical card holder or not, who opts for treatment in a private hospital or as a private patient in a public hospital is liable for the costs relating to such treatment. I have asked the chief executive officer of the Eastern Regional Health Authority to examine the matter and reply directly to the Deputy.</P>

      <P>The grade of specialist in orthodontics has been created in the health board orthodontic service. This year, my Department and the health boards are funding 13 dentists from various health boards &ndash; including two from the Western Health Board &ndash; for specialist in orthodontics qualifications at training programmes in Ireland and at two separate universities in the United Kingdom. An additional &euro;0.146 million has been provided to the Western Health Board for the training of these two dentists. These 13 trainees for the public orthodontic service are additional to the six dentists who commenced their training last year and one dentist whose specialist training is nearing completion. Thus, there is an aggregate of 20 dentists in specialist training for orthodontics. The creation of an auxiliary grade of orthodontic therapist is another structural measure being introduced in order to increase the number of orthodontic treatments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the short-term, additional funding of &euro;6.729 million was approved for orthodontic services in 2001 of which &euro;4.698 million was to fund an initiative on orthodontic waiting lists. The additional funding of &euro;0.628 million allocated to the Western Health Board in 2001 for orthodontic services, includes &euro;0.533 million for an ortho<Col N="445" /> dontic initiative in the board. The chief executive officer of the board has informed me that under the initiative, the board has, <i>inter alia</i>, recruited an additional specialist in orthodontics. Furthermore, two specialists in orthodontics who completed their training last year, have since taken up duty with the board. This brings the board's complement of specialists in orthodontics to three, with a further part time specialist employed by the board one day per week. In addition, the orthodontic department has one specialist trainee working in the department two days per week.</P>
    <P>Last year, my Department provided additional funding of &euro;5 million from the treatment purchase fund to health boards specifically for the purchase of orthodontic treatment. This funding is enabling boards to provide both additional sessions for existing staff and purchase treatment from private specialist orthodontic practitioners. Under the scheme, the Western Health Board received &euro;0.465 million for the treatment of patients in this way.</P>
    <P>The chief executive officer of the Western Health Board has informed me that the number of cases awaiting orthodontic assessment and treatment, as at 30 September 2002, was 599 and 1066 respectively. This is a reduction of 539 on the treatment waiting list in comparison with the corresponding figure at the end of the December 2001 quarter. The chief executive officer has also informed me that the average waiting time for orthodontic treatment in the Western Health Board area is 3.5 years and that 1,403 people were receiving orthodontic treatment at the end of September 2002.</P>
    <P>For children who are placed on a waiting list for treatment, the initiatives and structural changes that I have set out above will bring about an improvement in waiting times for treatment and positively impact on the future delivery of orthodontic services in the longer term.</P>

      <P>Arising from the health strategy &ndash; Quality and Fairness &ndash; A Health System For You, one of the key actions for dealing with public hospital waiting lists was the establishment of the national treatment purchase fund, NTPF. The NTPF was set up in April 2002 and referred its first patients for treatment at the end of June. A total of 1,920 patients received treatment under the national treatment purchase fund initiative in 2002.</P>
      <P>Expenditure by the NTPF in 2002, including set up costs, amounted to &euro;6.6 million estimated, of which &euro;5.6 million, awaiting year-end invoices, was attributed directly to patient care and approximately &euro;1.0 million to indirect patient care and once-off costs. Private hospitals who treat patients under this initiative are paid on the basis of an agreed price per procedure which in turn is competitive having regard to what is paid to these hospitals by medical insurers.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 744 and 745 together.</P>
      <P>Significant progress has been made in addressing the human resource requirements of the health service in the area of clinical psychology. In the year to end-2001 there has been an increase of over 100%, plus 30 posts to approximately 60, in the number of trainee clinical psychologists employed. The Deputy may also wish to note the significant increase, in excess of 30%, plus 91 to 380, over the past two years in the numbers of fully qualified psychologists working in the health service.</P>
      <P>My Department is currently supporting the provision, for the second year, of in excess of 30 training places in clinical psychology through the Psychological Society of Ireland's, PSI, post-graduate diploma. The report of the joint review group on psychological services, published in March 2002, refers to the swift response of my Department to the requirement for the provision of additional training places.</P>
      <P>Primary responsibility for the provision of training places to meet recruitment needs in clinical psychology, consistent with the recommendations of the joint review group rests with the health boards, especially in the context of the requirement to better integrate human resource planning with the service planning process. This is reflected, for example, in the provision of funding directly by health boards in support of training places in clinical psychology at UCD and TCD.</P>
      <P>I understand that, following a request received from my Department, the director of the health boards executive has undertaken to work with the directors of human resources in the health boards to develop an approach to facilitate the implementation of the recommendations of the joint review group. This will be undertaken in light of service imperatives, funding priorities and relevant developments such as the recommendations on investment in education and training included in the action plan for people management published in November 2002.</P>

      <P>In December 1999 the Government concluded that the arrangements in place to provide insurance and indemnity cover for health service agencies and the professional staff employed by them were no longer satisfactory. It decided that these fragmentary arrangements should be replaced by a new State-funded scheme based on the principle of &ldquo;enterprise liability&rdquo;. In directly assuming responsibility for these liabilities the Government was concerned to ensure that the Exchequer did not assume responsibility for liabilities which properly belonged to others. Accordingly the Government decided that the new scheme would have no retrospective effect. This means that insurance companies and medical defence bodies which were paid premiums and subscriptions to cover events which had occurred before the commencement date of the new scheme remain liable for claims arising from these events.</P>
      <P>The new scheme covers the corporate liability of publicly-funded agencies providing clinical services and the activities of their professional staff. It is proposed that it will also cover the private practice of hospital consultants that takes place in public hospitals. Consultants will remain responsible for organising their own indemnity cover for any private practice which takes place elsewhere. This issue is still the subject of discussions with the organisations representing the medical profession.</P>

      <P>The information sought by the Deputy is not readily available. My Department has therefore written to the chief executive officers of the health boards and the regional chief executive of the Eastern Regional Health Authority asking for a report on the issue. This information will be forwarded to the Deputy as soon as it is received.</P>
      <P>I should point out that I am committed to facilitating boards in achieving a reduction in the waiting times for cervical smear test results. In this regard, my Department has, over the last few years, allocated additional funding to provide for the establishment of new posts, purchase of new equipment and the introduction of new technology in the cervical cytology laboratories. In 2003, an extra &euro;1.4 million has been provided to assist ongoing developments in the cervical cytology and colposcopy services.</P>
      <P>I recently approved the piloting by the phase one cervical screening programme of a proposed contingency plan to assist in overcoming capacity problems in the cervical cytology laboratories. This plan involves the contracting out of cervical smears to an external laboratory subject to compliance with the requirements set out in the 1999 document, Quality Assurance Guidelines for the Irish National Cervical Screening Programme. I am advised that arrangements for the pilot are at an advanced stage.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. Brennan Mr. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Transport (Mr. Brennan)</NameTxt>
      <P>In August 1999, my Department issued local authorities with guidelines relating to the certification of qualifying park and ride facilities and residential development located at a park and ride facility. Further guidelines on commercial development located at a park and ride facility <Col N="453" /> were issued in July 2001. Copies of the guidelines have been made available in the Oireachtas Library.</P>
      <P>Issues relating to the current tax incentive schemes for park and ride facilities are a matter for the Minister for Finance. The park and ride tax incentives are provided for in the Finance Act 1999 and the Finance Act 2001. The qualifying period for the incentives was extended to June 2004 in the Finance Act 2002.</P>
      <P>The purpose of these tax incentives is to support the development of park and ride schemes in order to facilitate the use of public transport. A person wishing to avail of the capital allowances and reliefs available must make a formal application in writing to the relevant local authority. If the local authority is satisfied that the park and ride facility, and associated development, where relevant, conforms to the guidelines issued by my Department and also conforms with the relevant sections of the Finance Act, it may issue a certificate which will enable the developer to avail of the tax incentives. Tax incentives for private sector provision of park and ride car-parking were introduced in addition to provision being made by the public sector.</P>
      <P>In the greater Dublin area, the DTO's blueprint for the development of the region's transportation network, A Platform for Change, recognises the role of park and ride as part of an integrated approach to transport.</P>
      <P>The Government provided specific funding in 1999 and 2000 to create an additional 2,300 car-parking spaces adjacent to DART and suburban rail stations in the greater Dublin area. Planning for the Luas system also incorporates proposals to create park and ride facilities at appropriate stops.</P>
      <P>A recently completed DTO-commissioned study into the role bus-based park and ride facilities could play in the greater Dublin area concluded that only a limited role could be played by bus-based park and rides in the greater Dublin area because of the size of the city. I understand that the office of the director of traffic has been mandated to develop a pilot project. The operation of the pilot project will be monitored by the DTO to assess the potential for further projects.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. Brennan Mr. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Transport (Mr. Brennan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 761 and 763 together.</P>
      <P>The penalty points system was introduced on 31 October 2002 in respect of speeding offences. Penalty points will be applied to the driving licence of those convicted of speeding offences, and to those who pay a fixed charge to the Garda in order to prevent the instigation of court proceedings.</P>
      <P>It would be premature to draw any firm conclusions as to the overall effectiveness of the system at this early stage. However, preliminary indications from the Garda Síochána in respect of November and December 2002, show that, with no reduction in enforcement efforts, there has been a significant drop in the number of detections for speeding offences. There was also a significant reduction in road deaths over that two-month period when compared with the same period in 2001, 46 in 2002; 77 in 2001.</P>
      <P>The statistical data available from this early operational period for the system suggests that the core objective of improving driver behaviour through the deployment of penalty points is being achieved.</P>
      <P>The recording of convictions for offences is a matter for the Courts Service. In addition, the compilation of data relating to payments of fixed charges where the relevant notices are issued by the Garda Síochána is a matter for that force. Both of those organisations transfer the appropriate data to the Department of the Environment and Local Government to facilitate its entry into the national driver file which is the responsibility of that Department. It is understood from the Department of the Environment and Local Government that 2,216 penalty point notices have issued as at 24 January 2003. This represents a small proportion of detections for speeding since 31 October last as persons have up to 56 days to pay a fixed charge notice and penalty points can only be applied to a licence record where a fixed charge has been paid or the offender has been convicted.</P>

      <P>I have no plans to introduce new regulations on the maximum power ratings and size for vehicle lights, including spot lights and fog lights.</P>
      <P>Irish regulations require lamps that show a light to the front of the vehicle to be fitted and constructed so that they will not dazzle or mislead other traffic when lit. In addition, such lamps must be fitted with a dipping device so that the beam of light from the lamp, when dipped, is incapable of dazzling a person more than 25 feet away from the lamp and in a specified position which approximates to that of the driver of an oncoming vehicle. Exceptions to the dipping device requirement are made for directional indicators and for one or more other lamps with a combined maximum power output of seven watts. Dipped headlamps must be used when a vehicle is either passing another vehicle or travelling close behind one. The use of fog lights is permitted only in fog or falling snow. Within this framework a maximum power rating is not specified for vehicle lights. The Garda is responsible for the enforcement of these regulations.</P>

All new cars sold in Ireland are required to meet the standards which are also deemed to comply with national vehicle lighting law. Within this framework, gas discharge headlamps and other headlamps that contain inert gases such as halogen have been type approved in accordance with European Union law and are consequently in compliance with Irish lighting law.</P>

      <P>The appointment of authorised testers for vehicle testing is a function of city and county councils in accordance with the European Communities (Vehicle Testing) Regulations 1991 to 2002. My Department has no involvement in such appointments, but provides the general regulatory and administrative framework for the operation of commercial vehicle testing.</P>
      <P>The main practical requirements for appointment as an authorised tester are as follows: an application form should be submitted to the local authority in whose functional area the proposed test centre will be located &ndash; the current application fee is &euro;95.23; the applicant must have or have access to suitable premises and equipment, in accordance with standards set out in guidelines on premises and equipment, available from local authorities, and the premises and equipment are subject to inspection by an authorised officer of the local authority; and subsequent to an appointment, testing must be carried out by suitably qualified mechanics who have received appropriate training approved or supervised by an authorised officer of the Minister.</P>
      <P>At present there are 112 centres authorised for the testing of light goods vehicles with 117 centres authorised for the testing of heavy goods vehicles.</P>

      <P>The Retired Aviation Staff Association are seeking a cash injection into the Irish airlines general employees superannuation scheme to bridge the difference between the annual consumer price index related increases awarded to the pensions in payment and salary movements from 1989.</P>
      <P>The case made by the Retired Aviation Staff Association was forwarded by my predecessor, former Deputy Mary O'Rourke, for consideration to the Minister for Finance, who has overall responsibility for pension matters in the public sector. The contents of his reply were communicated to the retirees' association in October 2001.</P>
      <P>In summary, the Minister does not consider that it would be appropriate to accede to the request from the association for an injection into the pension fund and that there must be continued adherence to the long-standing policy in this area, that is, that pension entitlements for employees of commercial State bodies, which includes Aer Lingus and Aer Rianta, are matters primarily for the trustees, the members of the relevant scheme and the company involved.</P>
      <P>I have been advised that neither Aer Lingus nor Aer Rianta is in a position to provide additional payments into the pension fund to meet the claim by the retirees' association. I understand that both companies have been meeting all of their liabilities towards the pension fund in accordance with the rules of the scheme.</P>
      <P>There has been no obvious solution to this matter despite detailed examination over the last number of years. Nevertheless I am asking the companies to keep the situation under review.</P>

      <P>I am not in favour of closing rail lines. In this context, my Department has engaged consultants to undertake a strategic rail review of the Irish railways to provide the Government with a basis for establishing a strategic policy framework for the future development of the rail passenger and rail freight sector in Ireland. The review will provide a framework for future rail development in Ireland over the next 20 years having regard to: the spatial planning context provided by the various land use and transportation studies undertaken around the country; the extensive public transport investment programme under the national development plan; relevant findings and conclusions of Iarnród Éireann: The Way Forward; and the desirability of rail freight services to include consideration of existing freight capacity and its potential for development.</P>
      <P>The Limerick Junction to Rosslare line was examined by the consultants in carrying out their review. I expect the strategic rail review to be published shortly and to set out proposals for the future development of this line over the next 20 years.</P>

      <P>The regulation of military flights through Irish airspace is a matter for the Minister for Foreign Affairs.</P>
      <P>As noted by the Minister for Foreign Affairs in his press release dated 13 January 2003, it has been indicated that troops travelling on civilian aircraft are sometimes accompanied by their personal weapons which are carried in the hold of the aircraft. This practice requires an exemption from the Minister and no applications for exemptions for such troop movements were made in 2002. One exemption for a flight landing at Shannon carrying munitions of war was granted during 2002 &ndash; however this was for a cargo aircraft rather than a civilian passenger aircraft carrying troops.</P>
      <P>Officials of the Department of Foreign Affairs have been in touch with the United States authorities to ensure their civilian carriers are reminded of their obligations to seek permission for the transit of weapons and munitions through Irish airports.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Officials of my Department here have also issued a similar reminder directly to the airlines concerned. Since then my Department has been receiving requests for exemption in relation to <Col N="466" /> flights carrying troops accompanied by their weapons.</P>

      <P>I am not in favour of closing rail lines. In this context, my Department has engaged consultants to undertake a strategic rail review of the Irish railways to provide the Government with a basis for establishing a strategic policy framework for the future development of the rail passenger and rail freight sector in Ireland. The review will provide a framework for future rail development in Ireland over the next 20 years having regard to the spatial planning context provided by the various land use and transportation studies undertaken around the country; the extensive public transport investment programme under the national development plan; relevant findings and conclusions of &ldquo;Iarnród Éireann: The Way Forward&rdquo;; and the desirability of rail freight services to include consideration of existing freight capacity and its potential for development.</P>
      <P>The Limerick Junction to Rosslare line was examined by the consultants in carrying out their review. I expect the strategic rail review to be published shortly and to set out proposals for the future development of this line over the next 20 years.</P>

These standards have been adopted at EU level following extensive consultation with vehicle manufacturers and with member states.

On 19 November 2002 the Government approved the establishment, initially on a non-statutory basis, of the office of the national taxi regulator.</P>
      <P>Pending the drawing up of formal legislative proposals and subject to the enactment of legislation, it is envisaged that the office of the regulator will have a national focus and will have full effective control over the promotion of a professional, efficient and customer-friendly service by all small public service vehicles, including taxis, hackneys and limousines. This will include the overall application of standards for drivers, licence holders and for vehicles. In relation to drivers, it is envisaged that the functions of the office of the regulator will include the setting of standards for driver training, including requirements for entry, as well as standards for customer service and for meeting the needs of people with disabilities. It is also envisaged that the regulator will oversee the licensing of drivers following consultation with the Garda Síochána.</P>

      <P>I am aware of the report in question. I am informed by the Garda authorities that the general issue of identify fraud/theft is not a significant crime problem at present in this jurisdiction. At the same time, it is worth noting that the annual report of An Garda Síochána for 2001 indicates that there has been an increase worldwide, and in this country, in certain types of offences involving credit card fraud and account use in particular.</P>
      <P>The Garda bureau of fraud investigation has national responsibility for fraud related crime. In addition to investigating such offences, the bureau plays a proactive role in prevention and early detection. Strategies employed include: presentations to commercial organisations and financial institutions; various training programmes; publication of information and consultations with professional bodies, Government Departments and other agencies.</P>
      <P>The recent Criminal Justice (Theft and Fraud Offences) Act 2001 provides that offences such as making gain, causing loss and obtaining services by deception are subject on conviction to terms of imprisonment up to five years. A deterrent to certain thefts by deception, of course, is the fact that the Criminal Justice Act 1994 requires that designated bodies, such as financial institutions, take reasonable measures when providing certain services to establish the identity of their customers.</P>

      <P>I signed an order on 16 December 2002 directing that Shanganagh Castle cease to operate as a place of detention on and from 20 December 2002. At the time of closure, there were 44 Irish Prison Service staff based in Shanganagh Castle.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The staffing complement was composed of: management grades &ndash; one governor and one assistant governor. The governor and assistant governor are responsible for the overall management of the institution and for the supervision of all staff and offenders. In the supervisory grade there was one chief officer II. This officer is responsible for the overall supervision and control of all prison service personnel and offenders. There were seven assistant chief officers. These officers report to the chief officer and carry out first line supervisory functions. In administration <Col N="474" /> there was one clerk I, the officer in charge of general office administration and two clerk II. These officers carry out general administration duties and report to the clerk I.</P>
    <P>In maintenance there is one chief trades officer, which position was vacant, who is responsible for the maintenance of the institution. There were five trades officers who report to the chief trades officer. They are qualified craftsmen: electrician, plumber, plasterer, carpenter and painter. There was one nurse officer who provides general nursing care to offenders. There were 24 prison officers. These officers report to the assistant chief officers, supervise offenders and perform general security duties. Arrangements have been put in place for the re-assignment, and any necessary re-training, of the staff. There were also a part time chaplain and two part-time doctors employed at Shanganagh Castle.</P>
    <P>The Irish Prison Service staffing costs of running Shanganagh Castle during 2002 amounted to: basic pay &ndash;&euro;1,575,000; allowances &ndash;&euro;371,000; overtime &ndash;&euro;646,000; employers PRSI &ndash;&euro;51,000. Total staff costs in 2002 were &euro;2,643,000. Finally, a number of teachers were employed by the County of Dublin VEC at Shanganagh Castle. Their staffing costs were met by the VEC.</P>

      <P>Following a survey of prisons in 2001 by specialist engineers, a number of areas requiring removal of asbestos were identified. In February and March 2002, asbestos material was removed by professional contractors, advised by the specialist engineers, from the areas identified in Portlaoise Prison. The removal was carried out in accordance with the health and safety regulations, Department of the Environment and Local Government regulations and approved codes of practice for the removal of asbestos.</P>
      <P>The areas identified in Portlaoise Prison neither housed prisoners nor were accessible by prisoners or their visitors. Neither did the contractors employed for the removal of the material come into contact with prisoners. The areas from which the asbestos was removed were monitored and tested and all test results showed that the areas are now free of asbestos. Queries were raised by and on behalf of some families of prisoners in Portlaoise Prison regarding possible contamination from asbestos subsequent to the removal of asbestos from the prison and were dealt with by the Prison Service through a representative of a prisoner support group.</P>

Additional money would be collected through the courts in respect of on-the-spot notices which became the subject of court proceedings. The local authorities would also collect fines issued under their aegis.</P>
      <P>I am informed by the Garda authorities that statistics are not compiled in such a way as to differentiate between fine-on-the-spot notices issued in respect of offences detected in the various speed limit bands. However, information in relation to the total number of speeding notices issued by the Garda Síochána in 2001 and 2002, in so far as it is available, is set out in the tabular statement hereunder.</P>

      <P>Kilkenny is one of 17 locations set to receive new Garda CCTV systems over the next two years subject, of course, to the availability of funds. The other locations are, in alphabetical order: Athlone, Ballyfermot, Bray, Carlow, Castlebar, Clondalkin, Clonmel, Dundalk, Dún Laoghaire, Ennis, Finglas, Galway, Limerick, Sligo, Tallaght and Waterford.</P>
      <P>Applications for Garda CCTV systems are assessed by the advisory committee, which was established by the Garda Commissioner to evaluate CCTV applications, on the basis of Garda operational needs and include the following criteria: crime/public order statistics in the area; population and level of activity there; the recommendation of local Garda management; any special circumstances/needs that exist and the likely impact of a Garda CCTV system in the area. Co-funding is also a feature of Garda CCTV systems and this is usually addressed when it has been decided to install a Garda CCTV system in an area. All applications for Garda CCTV systems must be prepared in co-operation with the local Garda district and divisional officers and receive their support. Applications will normally have been made as a result of representations from groups forming residential, commercial and local government interests, and would be expected to contain the location and scope of the cameras required.</P>
      <P>An application for a CCTV system was received from Kilkenny, with the support of both the Kilkenny county borough and chamber of commerce, and has been approved. I am advised by the Garda authorities that planning for the installation of a CCTV system for Kilkenny is scheduled to commence later this year. There are a number of stages in the planning of new Garda CCTV systems. A tender process is initiated by the drafting of tender documents which include, <i>inter alia</i>, details of the evaluation criteria to be applied and the technical specifications of equipment required for the CCTV system. These documents are produced by the superintendent in charge, telecommunications project management at Garda headquarters.</P>
      <P>At this stage, the local divisional officer will be appointed chairman of a local CCTV implementation group. This group, which is kept aware of the progress of the scheme, will consist of representatives of each local group expressing an interest in the scheme, such as the chamber of commerce and the relevant local authority. Representatives of the Office of Public Works, ESB and other service providers who may be in a position to advise on or provide assistance in the implementation of the scheme are also included as well as Garda crime prevention and representative body personnel.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>All purchasing is subject to Government public <Col N="483" /> procurement guidelines which require a tendering process. Due to the costs involved in such projects, the scheme must also comply with EU public procurement directives. The tendering and procurement process and the provision of services by outside agencies will determine the time frame within which each system is completed.</P>

      <P>I understand that the question of colour schemes for marked police vehicles is a matter of each EU member state. Currently the Garda Síochána use &ldquo;diamond grade&rdquo; yellow and blue markings on patrol vehicles and tender for vehicles on that basis. At the moment, the Garda Síochána has no plans to specify a silver and blue colour scheme in invitations to tender for marked Garda vehicles. The question of vehicle conspicuity is one that is continually under review, having regard to the safety of Garda personnel, public visibility and general law enforcement. The best advice available is used in coming to any decision regarding the choice of colouring and markings for patrol vehicles.</P>

      <P>I am informed by the Garda authorities that they have invested considerable resources, both in terms of manpower and money, in working with at risk young people throughout the M district, which covers the areas mentioned in the Deputy's question. The investment has manifested itself through the provision of local juvenile liaison officers and in providing several Garda youth diversion projects within the M district. These projects are crime prevention initiatives and are targeted at &ldquo;at risk&rdquo; juveniles in the ten-18 years age bracket. While the projects themselves have a broad range of objectives, the essential aim is to divert young people from becoming involved in criminal/anti-social activity through the provision of suitable activities to facilitate personal development and encourage civic responsibility.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy may be aware, there are three Garda youth diversion projects operating in Dublin south-west at present, namely, the GRAFT project (Giving Ronanstown A Future Today), the KEY project (Killinarden Enhancing Youth) and the JAY project (Jobstown Action for Youth).

      <P>I am further informed that the area in question is regularly patrolled by both uniform and plainclothes Garda. These patrols are further augmented by Garda assigned under &ldquo;Operation Encounter&rdquo;. In addition, I understand that the community police van patrols the area on Thursday, Friday and Saturday nights in order to curtail anti-social behaviour. The community Garda for the area has spoken to residents and discussed their concerns. Garda are continuing to monitor the area and will continue to take appropriate action where necessary.</P>

      <P>I am informed by the Garda authorities that, at present, vehicles seized by Garda are retained at respective Garda stations, space permitting. The amount of space currently available at each location for this purpose is limited. In the Dublin metropolitan region, there is a dedicated car compound available at the Talbot complex in Santry. A car compound is provided at new divisional/district Headquarters that are being built, provided that there is sufficient physical space on the site. No discussions have taken place between the housing section in Garda headquarters and south Dublin city council in this regard.</P>

      <P>The Garda Síochána (Admissions and Appointments) Regulations 1988, as amended, govern entry to the Garda Síochána and provide that applicants generally must be at least 18 and under 26 years on the first day of the month that the competition is advertised (the regulations provide for some extension to the upper age limit for applicants with certain specified service in the Defence Forces).</P>
      <P>Section 37 of the Employment Equality Act 1998 provides, <i>inter alia</i>, that those parts of the Act relating to discrimination on the age ground do not apply to employment in the Garda Síochána. On 27 November 2000, Council Directive 2000/78/EC was adopted establishing a general framework for equal treatment in employment and occupation. The implementation of the directive will have implications for the age provision of the Employment Equality Act 1998. My Department is currently formulating legislative proposals to implement the Council directive and any implications for admission to the Garda Síochána will be considered in that context.</P>

      <P>My Department provides a focal point for disability equality policy and legis<Col N="488" /> lation development. As part of that remit, my Department collects data in relation to the 3% target for employment of people with disabilities in the public service (excluding Civil Service data which is collected by the Equality Unit in the Department of Finance). Although the target has yet to be achieved, there has been a degree of progress over the last number of years. No differentiation is made in the collection of the statistics between people with particular types of disability. The overall statistics for the public service (other than the Civil Service) at 1 January each year are as follows:</P>

    <P>The figures given for January 2000 and January 2001 are provisional figures as returns are outstanding from a number of individual public service bodies.</P>
    <P>A Government commitment in the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness requires that &ldquo;every Department will take appropriate action to ensure that agencies under its aegis achieve the 3% target for the employment of people with disabilities in the Public Service at an early date&rdquo;. Accordingly, it is the responsibility of each individual Government Department to consider the question of the action to be taken against agencies under their aegis that fail to reach the 3% target for employment of people with disabilities. A monitoring committee established and chaired by my Department helps to monitor and guide progress in relation to the target. It has supported a number of initiatives in recent years including: approval of a draft code of practice for use in the public service and exploration of the options for common selection procedures for people with disabilities; raising awareness of the 3% target among, and giving information to chief executives, personnel officers and disability equality officers in the public service through a series of eight regional seminars, and publication of an information brochure; publication of a brochure designed to encourage people with disabilities to consider a career in the public service and promotion of this option at the Public Sector Careers Expo in April, 2001; commissioned research on the issues and barriers relating to achievement of the target in six public service organisations. The report, published in November 2001 and titled research project on the effective recruitment of people with disabilities in the public service provides an insight into some of the issues which hinder progress and includes recommendations to assist future progress. My Department, in partnership with the Equality Authority, launched an employer resource pack on 3 December 2002 to assist public service employers in the recruitment and retention of people with disabilities.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="489" />The Minister for Finance is responsible for the 3% target for the employment of people with disabilities within the Civil Service. The 3% target is based on the definition of disability set out in the Civil Service code of practice on the employment of people with disabilities. This definition includes people with physical, sensory or psychological impairments. In order to maintain confidentiality, the statistical returns made by Departments and offices do not specify the nature of the disability. It is not possible, therefore, to provide information on staff with physical disabilities. The attached table shows the percentage of employees with disabilities in each Government Department.</P>
    <P>The Programme for Prosperity and Fairness included a commitment to a review of the employment of people with a disability in the Civil Service to ascertain ongoing adherence to the 3% employment target. While Government Departments met the target in the mid-1990s, since then the percentage has dropped below the target and as at December 2001 the percentage <Col N="490" /> of people with a disability in the Civil Service was 2.78%. The Department of Finance has written to the all heads of Departments and offices to ensure that they are aware of their legal obligations and of the importance of reaching and maintaining the 3% target.</P>
    <P>In light of the commitment in the PPF and to improve adherence to the target, the Department of Finance, in partnership with the Civil Service Commission and the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, commissioned a study on the career progression of people with a disability in the Civil Service. The research, which was carried out by a team led by Goodbody economic consultants, will be published shortly. The research examines career progression for people with disabilities, highlights the challenges they face in pursuing their careers and makes recommendations for improvements. The Department of Finance is considering the recommendations and will be drawing up proposals shortly. Officials from the Department of Finance are meeting with the Civil Service staff unions to consider the recommendations.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="493" />The Prisons Service placed public advertisements in October 2001 seeking suitable sites for the location of a juvenile detention facility for the purposes of the Children Act 2001. On foot of these advertisements, submissions regarding 25 properties were received by my Department. The information involved was conveyed in confidence in many cases. In addition to the above properties, another 15 or so sites in state ownership, including all existing prison properties, were considered.</P>
    <P>Overall, therefore, a total of around 40 locations within the greater Dublin area were assessed by officials from the Prisons Service in conjunction with the Office of Public Works. No final decision has been taken on the location and development of the proposed facility. All possible options remain under consideration in the broader context of the implementation of the Children Act 2001, and all relevant factors will be fully taken into consideration in identifying the best way forward.</P>

Ireland is, however, a party to the Council of Europe Convention on the Transfer of Sentenced Persons.

When the station is not open, personal access call box and call diversion systems are in operation which are linked to the district headquarters at Enniscorthy Garda station. I am further informed by the Garda authorities that the extension of the current opening hours to 24 hours would necessitate the employment of Garda personnel on indoor administrative duties and it is considered that such personnel can be utilised more effectively in providing a visible Garda presence on outdoor policing duties.</P>

The total value of cocaine seized in the area is approximately &euro;135,000. Garda from the divisional drugs unit are aware that cocaine use has increased across the north inner city and in this regard they continue to monitor the area and give it appropriate attention through specific targeting and patrolling. The area is regularly patrolled by uniform and plain clothes Garda units augmented by divisional task force, drugs and traffic units where necessary.</P>
      <P>In addition, the Garda Síochána policing plan 2003 contains a commitment to conduct research in 2003 on the level of cocaine use in Ireland. The Garda research unit will conduct the research in consultation with the Garda national drugs unit and will bring forward policing recommendations accordingly. This commitment is in line with the objectives and key performance indicators in the national drugs strategy 2001-2008.</P>

      <P>Under section 2 of the Guardianship of Infants Act 1964, as inserted by section 4 of the Children Act 1997, an unmarried father may become a guardian of his child by means of a statutory declaration made jointly with the mother. Such declarations are retained by or on behalf of the parents: there is no provision for their lodgement or registration. Accordingly, I have no information on the number of persons making declarations.</P>
      <P>Under section 6A of the Guardianship of Infants Act 1964, as inserted by section 12 of the Status of Children Act 1987, an unmarried farther may apply to the court to be appointed a guardian of his child. In determining whether an unmarried father should be so appointed, the court has to regard the welfare of the child as the first and paramount consideration. The vast majority of section 6A applications are made at District Court level. According to the annual report of the Courts Service, in 2001, 785 such applications were granted by the District Court, 37 were refused and 194 were withdrawn or struck out. The corresponding figures for 2000 were 763, 41 and 205.</P>
      <P>The balance struck in the existing legislation is a good one in that it provides that an unmarried father can become the guardian of his child by agreement with the mother or by obtaining a court order and, in making such an order, the court is required to regard the child's welfare as the first and paramount consideration. Subject to the welfare consideration, children should have the benefit of a family life which involves both parents and that it is highly desirable that unmarried fathers should, as the Deputy says, play an active role in their child's life.</P>

    <P>The criteria used to identify possible locations were as follows: a minimum of 3 hectares &ndash; 7 acres &ndash; in size; fully serviced with sewer, water, gas and electrical connection readily available; located within a radius of 40 kilometres &ndash; 25 miles &ndash; of Dublin city centre; convenient to and accessible from the main public transport and road networks; and available for immediate development, subject to the relevant planning requirements.</P>
    <P>No final decision has been taken on the location and development of the proposed facility. All possible options remain under consideration in the broader context of the implementation of the Children Act 2001, and all relevant factors will be fully taken into consideration in identifying the best way forward.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 859 and 860 together.</P>
      <P>In its interim report of May 2002, the strategic task force on alcohol recommended a statutory role for health boards in relation to the granting and renewal of intoxicating liquor licences. It also recommended that health boards be allowed to set specific conditions for licences in their respective areas. As regards legislative reforms in this area, I have already announced a comprehensive codification of the entire liquor licensing code. This codification will draw on the valuable work of both the strategic task force on alcohol and the commission on liquor licensing and the recommendations set out in their respective reports.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. McDowell)</NameTxt>
      <P>As I previously explained to the Deputy, a visiting committee is appointed to each prison under the Prisons (Visiting Committees) Act, 1925 and Prisons (Visiting Committees) Order, 1925.</P>
      <P>The function of visiting committees is to visit at frequent intervals the prison to which they are appointed and hear any complaints which may be made to them by any prisoner. They report to me any abuses observed or found by them in the prison and any repairs which they think may be urgently needed. The visiting committee has free access either collectively or individually to every part of its prison. In inspecting prisons, the visiting committees focus on issues such as the quality of accommodation and the catering, medical, educational and welfare services and recreational facilities.</P>
      <P>Members of committees are appointed by the Minister for a term not exceeding three years. At that point they are automatically removed from the committee and are either re-appointed for a further term or are replaced by new members. The maximum number that can be appointed for each institution is 12. Each committee elects its own chairperson.</P>
      <P>There are no specific criteria used in selecting individuals for appointment. The composition of each committee is drawn from as wide a spectrum as possible to ensure that the needs of prisoners are understood and met. This is the long standing practice used by successive Ministers in appointing members to the prisons visiting committees.</P>
      <P>Members of visiting committees receive no remuneration. Vouched expenses for travel and subsistence are paid, on the authorisation of the Prison Governor, in line with Civil Service rates.</P>
      <P>While an inspector of Prisons and Places of Detention was appointed in April last, his terms of reference do not include the hearing of individual prisoner complaints, which is an important function of the prison visiting committees.</P>
      <P>The visiting committees perform a valuable service and I take this opportunity to thank them for their efforts and hard work.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment and Local Government (Mr. Cullen)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 870 and 872 together.</P>
      <P>While Safe Home is an approved voluntary housing body, it has not undertaken any project under my Department's voluntary housing schemes. Under the amendment made to the terms of the capital assistance scheme in November 2001, up to 25% of accommodation in new projects provided throughout the country by individual voluntary housing bodies with funding under the scheme may be allocated to elderly returning emigrants who satisfy eligibility criteria in relation to their present circumstances and are included in the Safe Home waiting list. Safe Home carries out a co-ordinating role liaising with relevant individual voluntary housing bodies throughout the country in relation to accommodation for eligible elderly emigrants who are included in their waiting list.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Any emigrant for whom accommodation is provided under the scheme is advised by Safe Home of the date on which the accommodation will be available for occupation ensuring that accommodation is available to the emigrant on <Col N="503" /> his or her return. I understand that Safe Home advises all potential returning emigrants who contact them, including those providing their own accommodation, to ensure that accommodation is available for occupation by them before returning.</P>
    <P>The question of persons being included in a local authority waiting list due to any failure on the part of Safe Home to directly provide accommodation under the scheme or because accommodation provided for a returning emigrant by any other approved housing body under the scheme is not available for the person on return should therefore not arise.</P>
    <P>The information available to my Department is that in January, 2000 Safe Home was established on a pilot basis under the umbrella of Mulranny Day Centre Housing Company Limited to provide information and practical advice to emigrants considering returning to this country. I understand that it was not the practice at that stage for Safe Home to arrange or identify accommodation for emigrants wishing to return and that its function at that stage was purely one of providing advice. I also understand that Safe Home offers its advice service to emigrants who wish to return to any part of the State and its service is not restricted to persons wishing to return to any particular area.</P>
    <P>I am informed that Safe Home was approached in late 2000 on behalf of the persons to whom the question refers to assist in providing accommodation for them as it was intimated that they were being evicted from their social housing accommodation in Britain and that they wished to move to this country because they had no alternative accommodation to go to. I understand that, due to the particular circumstances of the case, following this approach Safe Home agreed to assist the persons involved. I am informed that they were initially offered emergency accommodation in high support accommodation in St Brendan's Village, Mulranny, which is managed by Mulranny Day Centre Housing Company Limited, as a temporary measure until they could be provided with low support accommodation in an extension to the village which was then proposed and for which a planning application had at that stage been made.</P>
    <P>I am also informed that shortly before the two individuals involved were due to move, Safe Home identified a three bedroom flat in Mulranny Village which was considered suitable for their needs. I understand that they agreed to accept the accommodation in preference to the high support accommodation and it was rented on their behalf with necessary modifications to the premises being arranged to take account of the special needs of the two people involved.</P>
    <P>I understand that when it emerged that planning permission for additional low support units at St. Brendan's Village was refused, the possibility of the two people being considered for a future vacancy in the existing low support units <Col N="504" /> in the village was raised with them. I understand, however, that having inspected that accommodation, the two persons deemed it unsuitable for their needs on the grounds that a one bedroom unit would be too small and they indicated that they wished to remain in the rented accommodation where they then resided and where they continue to reside.</P>
    <P>In relation to the number of staff employed by Safe Home, I understand that the organisation has two full time staff based in Mulranny and a full time development officer who works part of her time in Britain and for the remaining part in this country. In addition, I understand that the organisation avails of the services of three volunteers in this country and eight based in Britain, all on a part-time basis.</P>

      <Quest>the plans his Department has to designate further bogs as NHAs, other than those advertised prior to Christmas 2002; the counties involved; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <P>All of the bogs advertised as proposed NHAs or cSACs in December 2002 are in the raised bog category, which is mainly found in the Midlands. I consider designation proposals for raised bogs to be complete and I have no plans to propose designation of further sites for this type of bog habitat.</P>
      <P>Blanket bog habitat characteristically occurs at all altitudes in the western coastal counties, from west Cork to Donegal, and on mountain ranges further east, notably in Counties Cavan, Laois, Offaly, Tipperary, Waterford and Wicklow. A substantial proportion of this particular type of bog has already been protected within candidate Special Areas of Conservation, cSACs, under the EU Habitats Directive.</P>
      <P>With the completion of proposals for designation of raised bogs, the blanket bog category is the next priority for consideration for Natural Heritage Area designations. Areas of blanket bog not protected within cSACs will be reviewed during 2003. I intend, before the end of this year, to propose those that meet appropriate scientific criteria for designation as statutory natural heritage areas. Most of the areas likely to be suitable for designation were published some years ago as proposed natural heritage areas on a non-statutory basis.</P>

      <P>The Office of the Director of Consumer Affairs took a case to the High Court in 2001 under the European Communities (Unfair Terms in Consumer Contracts) Regulations, 1995, and with the support of my Department. The subsequent High Court Order, December 2001, prohibited the use of 15 &ldquo;unfair&rdquo; terms in house building contracts and also prohibited stage payments in house building contracts, which exceed the percentages stipulated in the Irish Home Builders Association, IHBA, code of practice or which exceed &ldquo;the extent and value of works carried out at the date specified for the payment in question&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The IHBA code of practice stipulates that in the case of a purchaser who obtains the title to the site prior to the completion of the transaction, three distinct stage payments may be required, namely at joist level, i.e. 25%; at roof level, i.e. 25%; and at internal plastering stage, i.e. 25%, in addition to a booking deposit, 4%; contract deposit, 11%; and completion payment, 10%. Site costs are the subject of a separate contract.</P>
      <P>The IHBA code of practice may be accessed on the Construction Industry Federation website at www.cif.ie.</P>

      <P>Article 18 of European Parliament and Council Directive 94/62/EC on packaging and packaging waste prohibits member states from impeding the placing on the market of packaging which satisfies the provisions of the directive i.e. which is in accordance with the essential requirements in annex II of the directive as to the composition and the reusable and recoverable nature of packaging. Article 15 of the directive, however, allows member states to adopt economic measures in support of the objectives of the directive to ensure the recovery of packaging waste.</P>
      <P>On foot of the success of the plastic bag levy &ndash; which has dramatically reduced the number of disposable plastic bags provided to consumers, with a consequent positive impact on visible nuisance litter &ndash; An Agreed Programme for Government contains a commitment to consider extending the use of levies to other areas such as non-reusable packaging. In this regard, my Department has recently received a report from Comhar &ndash; the national sustainable development partnership &ndash; which suggests that levies could be considered for problematic waste streams such as polystyrene food containers, subject to proper evaluation. I am now considering the issues raised in the Comhar report with a view to taking forward the Government commitment in this area.</P>

      <P>New Connections, the Government's action plan for the information society, outlines a number of e-government projects in the local authority area. A copy of New Connections is available in the Oireachtas Library. My Department is not directly involved in delivering these projects, which is the responsibility of the local authorities themselves. The Local Government Computer Services Board, LGCSB, performs a key role in co-ordinating local authority efforts in e-government implementation and in providing local authorities with the systems required to deliver e-government services.</P>
      <P>My Department makes payments on behalf of the information society fund to the LGCSB in respect of e-government projects. Details of moneys paid in 2000, 2001 and 2002 follow. However, it should be noted that this does not represent the totality of investment in e-government initiatives by the local authority sector. Local authorities also fund projects in this area from other sources, including their own resources.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment and Local Government (Mr. Cullen)</NameTxt>
      <P>Where an activity that involves a risk to groundwater is being carried on by any person, that person carries primary responsibility for protecting the groundwater against pollution. It is an offence for a person to cause or permit polluting matter to enter waters, including an aquifer. Among public authorities, responsibility for the protection of groundwater is assigned primarily to local authorities under the Local Government (Water Pollution) Acts. Other functions for protection of aquifers are exercisable by local authorities under legislation such as the Waste Management Acts and the Planning and Development Acts. The EPA exercises general supervision under the Environmental Protection Agency Act 1992 in relation to the performance by local authorities of their environmental protection functions, and has responsibility for groundwater protection in the context of its own licensing, monitoring and other functions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="511" />Maps of aquifers in all member states, including Ireland, were published by the European Commission in 1982 at scale 1:500,000. The map for Ireland was prepared by the Geological Survey of Ireland. Work has been ongoing by GSI since then for the production of more detailed, modern maps at a scale of 1:50,000 as part of groundwater protection schemes being prepared by local authorities. Modern aquifer maps have been prepared for 13 counties, mapping of the remaining counties is ongoing by the GSI and will be completed by end-2004 as part of work being undertaken in river basin management projects for implementation of the EU Water Framework Directive (2000/60/EEC).</P>
    <P>The publication &ldquo;Groundwater Protection Schemes&rdquo; a copy of which is in the Oireachtas Library, was jointly published in 1999 by my Department, the GSI and the EPA and contains guidance for local authorities on the preparation of groundwater protection schemes to provide a systematic framework for the protection of these waters.</P>
    <P>As part of its functions under the Environmental Protection Agency Act 1992, a national groundwater quality monitoring programme was established by the EPA in 1995 with the assistance of the local authorities. Data generated by the programme are included in the EPA reports &ldquo;Water Quality in Ireland&rdquo; for 1995-1997 and 1998-2000, copies of which are in the Oireachtas Library. The report for the period 1998-2000 indicates localised pollution of groundwater in certain areas but no widespread pollution of particular aquifers. Groundwater is monitored by EPA in association with the GSI at some 300 sampling points nationally. Monitoring is carried out twice a year, to coincide with groundwater levels at their lowest and highest levels.</P>
    <P>Council Directive 80/68/EEC on the protection of groundwater against pollution caused by certain dangerous substances, the Groundwater Directive, is concerned with the protection of groundwater by means of an authorisation, licensing, system for discharges which may contain dangerous substances. The directive applies to a specified range of substances which could pose a serious threat to groundwater quality, through direct discharges to groundwaters or by indirect discharges arising form waste disposal operations or other activities. The groundwater directive has been transposed and implemented in Ireland mainly through the Local Government (Water Pollution) Acts, the Waste Management Acts and related regulations.</P>
    <P>The Water Framework Directive (2000/60/EC) (WFD) came into force on 22 December 2000 and addresses all inland and coastal waters, including groundwater, and all sources of water pollution. Proposals are being developed by the European Commission in accordance with Article 17 of the WFD for specific measures to be taken to prevent and control groundwater pollution. I refer to the reply to Question No. 417 on 10 <Col N="512" /> December 2002 for detailed information on the measures being taken for implementation of the directive in Ireland.</P>

In April 2002, my Department reminded local authorities that under the 1998 Act they were required to review their programmes before 31 December 2002.

    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment and Local Government (Mr. Cullen)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to answer Questions Nos. 889 and 934 to 936, inclusive, together.</P>
      <P>Part IV of the Planning and Development Act 2000 sets out new and important powers for the protection of Ireland's architectural heritage through the planning code. Where a structure is of special architectural, historical, archaeological, artistic, cultural, scientific, social or technical interest, it may be listed by the local authority in the record of protected structures and comprehensive protections then apply to those structures. The Act however seeks to balance the rights of owners and occupiers of these structures with the overall obligation to protect and conserve the nation's heritage.</P>
      <P>While the Act does impose a duty of care on owners and occupiers of protected structures to ensure structures are not endangered, the owner or occupier of a protected structure has the right to seek a declaration from the local authority, to determine the works which may be done to a protected structure without the necessity to seek planning permission. The local authority declaration can be appealed to An Bord Pleanála. No fee is payable for a declaration.</P>
      <P>The declaration procedure is intended <i>inter alia</i> to ensure that the protections imposed in the Act are not unduly burdensome on owners and occupiers of protected structures who wish to do minor works which will not affect the character of the structure. It can also permit the owner or occupier to discuss proposed works with the authority to ensure that no misunderstandings can arise later.</P>
      <P>A conservation grants scheme was introduced in 1999 with the new legislation to assist owners and occupiers of protected structures to undertake necessary works to secure their conservation. The standard grant is 50% of the approved cost of works subject to a maximum of &euro;13,000. A local authority may, at its discretion, vary this amount downwards, or in exceptional circumstances upwards, subject to a maximum allowable grant of 75% of the cost of the approved cost of works or &euro;25,000 whichever is the lesser. A total of &euro;2.88 million has been provided for the scheme in 2003 and allocations to local authorities will be announced shortly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In addition to the protected structures scheme, funding is also made available under the Regional <Col N="516" /> Operational Programmes 2000-2006. This is a scheme of EU co-financed grants for the conservation of the architectural heritage. It provides support for local authorities, civic trust and other not-for-profit bodies to upgrade buildings of significant architectural and heritage merit and which are in public ownership or open to the public generally. Almost &euro;500,000 was spent under the programme in 2002. I will be allocating further funding under this programme in 2003 following evaluation of the grant applications currently before my Department. In all around 100 applications were received by the closing date for this year on 17 January last.</P>
    <P>A tax incentive scheme is in operation for buildings of architectural merit which are open to the public for a certain number of days this year. The introduction of new tax reliefs is of course the responsibility of my colleague the Minister for Finance.</P>
    <P>My Department will continue to monitor the system closely and will review the grants system if it seems appropriate to do so, particularly in light of the recent incorporation of Dúchas, the Heritage Service, into my Department.</P>
    <P>I do not feel that the current fees payable for applications for planning permission in relation to protected structures are unduly burdensome. The fee payable for any works to a house, for example, is &euro;34.</P>
    <P>As regards the application of planning levies, it is also a longstanding principle of planning law that developers who benefit from the provision of infrastructure by the local authority should be required to contribute towards the capital cost of that infrastructure. I have no current proposals to exclude developments to protected structures from the requirement to pay fees or development contributions.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment and Local Government (Mr. Cullen)</NameTxt>
      <P>The current standard for domestic effluent treatment and disposal from single dwelling houses is set out in Recommendation SR6:1991, which was drawn up by the National Standards Authority of Ireland and which was issued by the Department by way of circular letter to each planning authority on 8 January 1992.</P>
      <P>Recommendation SR6 indicates that, in general, site sizes for the proposed dwelling should be such that the septic tank effluent can be disposed of within the boundary of the site, without recourse to disposal in adjoining land, even in the event of failure of both the main and reserve percolation areas. Where a site has no mains supply, SR6 indicates that the basis for determining the site size must be the nature of the soil and subsoil and the depth to water table and-or fissure rock. Where groundwater is afforded good natural protection, for example by a thick clay-rich soil and subsoil, the recommendation is that that the site be no less than 2,000 square metres, approximately half an acre. Where the natural protection is limited, for example gravel rich soil and subsoil, the site should be no less than 3000 square metres. SR6 indicates that the overall density of septic tank systems in a locality may also need to be limited if there is likely to be a build up of contaminants, such as nitrates in the water supply. Sites with mains water supply, i.e. which do not depend on a groundwater supply within the curtilage may be slightly smaller. The minimum site size recommended for sites with a mains water supply is 1,500 square metres.</P>
      <P>The Environmental Protection Agency, EPA has published a draft manual on treatment systems for single houses in 2000 which was designed to help planning authorities, builders and others to deal with the complexities of on-site systems, including packaged systems. Instead of recommending a minimum site size, the draft EPA manual makes recommendations about matters such as separation distances from water courses and wells, site boundaries etc.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I understand that the EPA are currently reviewing the draft manual in the light of com<Col N="518" /> ments received from interested parties. My intention is to call up the revised EPA manual, when available, in technical guidance document C-drainage and waste water disposal &ndash; on the national building regulations. I also understand that the National Standards Authority of Ireland, NSAI intends, at that stage, to withdraw SR6: 1991 in favour of the revised manual.</P>

      <P>Faulty alarms gave rise to 11% of the noise complaints made to Dublin City Council in 2001, the only local authority for which my Department has information. In this case noise from faulty alarms is the third lowest of all categories of complaints listed. Nevertheless, I recognise that alarms are a source of neighbourhood noise. A number of arrangements are in place to reduce the incidence of unnecessary noise from alarms and to tackle persistent incidence of such noise.</P>
      <P>In the case of Dublin, the city council issues guidelines in relation to intruder alarms which recommend that owners/occupiers of alarmed property should nominate at least two keyholders that can be contacted in the event of the activation of the alarm.</P>
      <P>The National Standards Authority of Ireland has published a voluntary standards specification (No. 199 of 1987). It operates a certification scheme to that standard which, <i>inter alia</i>, specifies a minimum of 15 minutes and a maximum of 30 minutes duration for the sounding of external alarms in buildings with the alarms being required to cease automatically after the maximum duration. The connection of monitored intruder alarm systems to Garda stations is contingent, <i>inter alia</i>, upon the use of alarm systems which are certified by NSAI and installed by certified installers, and the provision to the Garda of contact details for the keyholder and alternate keyholders.</P>
      <P>A European standard for external intruder alarms, which will replace all current national standards, will incorporate considerably stricter controls regarding minimum and maximum duration for the sounding of alarms. The new limits are 90 seconds minimum and 15 minutes maximum. This new standard will be the only one applied by the NSAI from September.</P>
      <P>The promulgation of the Irish standard, the development of the European standard, the requirements of the Garda for monitored alarms, improved equipment and the co-operation of installers certified by the NSAI have all been instrumental in ensuring that the incidence of false alarms and the failure of audible alarms to cut off have been significantly reduced.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Part E of the building regulations, sound, details the legal requirements to be met in <Col N="524" /> relation to sound insulation between separating walls and floors of new dwellings, houses and apartments. Part E requires such walls and floors to have reasonable resistance to airborne and impact sound. Technical guidance document E, 1997 edition, provides technical guidance on how to comply with these requirements.</P>
    <P>Compliance with the building regulations is primarily the responsibility of the designers, builders and owners of new dwellings. Enforcement of the building code is a matter for the local building control authority.</P>
    <P>Under the Environmental Protection Agency Act, 1992 (Noise) Regulations, 1994, a local authority or any person may seek an order in the district court to have noise giving reasonable cause for annoyance abated. The procedures involved have been simplified to allow action to be taken without legal representation. A public information leaflet outlining the legal avenues available to persons experiencing noise nuisance is available from my Department.</P>
    <P>In light of the above it is not proposed to develop further proposals at present in relation to noise arising from house alarm systems.</P>

      <P>As indicated in the reply to Question No. 367 of 20 November 2001, it is not proposed to provide a subsidy from public funds for the ongoing operational costs of private sector recycling projects.</P>
      <P>In accordance with the &lsquo;polluter pays' principle &ndash; of which producer responsibility is a fundamental element &ndash; it is right that producers should take responsibility and contribute towards the waste management costs of products which they place on the market. In support of this approach two successful producer responsibility initiatives already operate in Ireland in the areas of packaging waste and farm plastics waste, Repak in the case of packaging waste and the Irish Farm Films Producers Group in the case of farm plastics. In the case of the Repak scheme, membership fees contributed by producers are used to provide a subsidy for the collection for recycling of packaging waste from both the household and commercial sectors. In the past two years Repak paid almost &euro;20 million in direct subsidy to waste operators for the collection of packaging waste, providing significant economic support and stimulus to the sector. Further producer responsibility initiatives are proposed for other waste streams, including end-of-life vehicles, tyres and waste electronic and electrical equipment. These initiatives, together with the increasing cost of landfilling waste, will further stimulate and improve the economics of recycling in Ireland in the years ahead.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In addition, significant capital funding is being made available in the period to 2006 towards waste recovery infrastructure under the waste infrastructure capital grants scheme which was announced last year. On 7 November 2002 I announced, as the first round of allocations to local authorities, up to &euro;15 million in grant assistance towards the development of recycling facilities. Further allocations in respect of both public and private sector projects will be made throughout the year. Waste management will be a primary focus for support from the environment <Col N="526" /> fund to which the proceeds of the plastic bag and landfill levies accrue.</P>

      <P>The use of dipped headlights, daytime running lights, is not currently subject to regulation.</P>
      <P>Recently the EU Commission decided to undertake a comprehensive study into the use of daytime running lights. The general aim of the project is to assess the positive road safety effect of daytime running lights use and to investigate the possible and perceived negative effects, including such effect on vulnerable road users such as pedestrians and motorcyclists. It is intended that the results of this study should inform the future requirements of the EU in this regard.</P>

      <P>Subject to compliance with the Waste Management (Use of Sewage Sludge in Agriculture) Regulations, 1998, as amended, sewage sludge may be used in agriculture.</P>
      <P>Sewage sludge is an inevitable and potentially useful by-product of advanced waste water treatment processes. Overall volumes of such sludge will inevitably grow as a result of the major investment in waste water treatment facilities now under way as part of the national development plan. It is desirable, and in accordance with EU requirements, that sewage sludge should be reused wherever appropriate.</P>
      <P>In this regard all relevant local authorities are required to prepare a sludge management plan in the context of waste management planning generally. These plans are intended to address the management of waste water sludge in a progressive and environmentally sustainable way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My Department does not issue specific recommendations on reuse methods but has taken steps over the past decade to promote improved management of sewage sludge, for example by providing detailed guidelines and financial assistance to support the preparation of sludge management plans by local authorities. Following a series of studies commissioned by my Department in relation to the re-use of sewage sludge, arrangements are being put in place by local authorities for the full treatment of sewage sludge, including <Col N="529" /> pasteurisation, and its conversion into a soil conditioner and fertiliser, or biosolid. Treated sewage sludge from the main Dublin waste water treatment plant is already used in this way as an agricultural fertiliser.</P>
    <P>To further assist the farming sector and local authorities in implementing this approach A Code of Good Practice for the use of Biosolids in Agriculture and A Guidance Document for the Preparation of Sludge Management Plans by Local Authorities, with an associated model plan, have both been published under my Department's auspices.</P>

      <P>The national rural water monitoring committee has recommended a pilot programme by local authorities to test a range of new, small-scale wastewater collection and treatment systems, based on design-build-operate procurement, as a means of meeting the requirements of small rural communities. My Department has accepted the recommendation and expressions of interest have been sought by the relevant local authorities for the provision of such facilities at some 12 locations around the country. Subject to a satisfactory outcome to the pilot testing, the report envisages a potential role for group sewerage schemes in the collection of domestic wastewater from households outside the immediate catchment of the new treatment systems. The confirmation of such a role for group sewerage schemes and any review of the associated grants must await the results of the pilot programme.</P>

      <P>In a monitoring system recently put in place, my Department has requested housing authorities to provide details of accommodation provided to returning emigrants under the amended terms of the capital assistance scheme as part of their quarterly progress reports on activity in the voluntary housing programme furnished to my Department. The amended terms of the capital assistance scheme provide that up to 25% of accommodation in a project undertaken by a voluntary housing body with funding under the scheme may be made available for allocation to elderly returning emigrants who satisfy the eligibility criteria. It is a matter for an approved housing body to decide whether it will provide accommodation for returning emigrants in a project which is being undertaken by it under the scheme. Where an approved body decides to make such accommodation available for a returning emigrant, it is a matter for that body to select a suitable candidate from the Safe Home waiting list in consultation with Safe Home. The relevant local authority has clear rights of consultation in relation to the granting of tenancies in projects funded under the capital assistance scheme. Local authorities are <Col N="536" /> advised by my Department to facilitate approved voluntary housing bodies which propose to accommodate emigrants in projects being undertaken by them within the amended terms of the scheme.

      <P>An original allocation of &euro;1.93 million was provided for the Rock of Dunamase under the National Development Programme 2000-2006. The objective of the NDP project is to stabilise, consolidate and conserve the structures on the site. Provision for interpretation has also been included. The cost to date of the first phase of works, which established the methodology to be adopted in subsequent phases, is &euro;356,650, including professional fees. This involved comprehensive topographical and photographic and architectural surveys of the site, removal of vegetation, and provision of access routes without damage to existing ground surface. Consolidation and repair of masonry faces uncovered in the archaeological excavation and other extant masonry was carried out by skilled craftspeople using suitable lime mortars and stone. This is an internationally accepted approach to conservation works of this nature.</P>
      <P>The second phase of the works comprises further conservation and repairs to stone walls, provision of graded access routes and site fencing. The conservation works to the walls will be quite extensive, aimed at consolidating existing structures to safeguard the castle into the future. This will be carried out in accordance with internationally accepted best practice and a feature of such works is that the resultant conservation should be unobtrusive so that the essential historical character of the castle remains. The estimated cost of this phase is &euro;1.24 million, including consultant's fee.</P>

      <P>The new house grant scheme was terminated as and from 14 November 2002. However, subject to the conditions of the scheme, a grant may be approved where a contract to purchase or to build a house was entered into or, in the case of a &ldquo;self build&rdquo; house, the foundations were poured on or before 14 November 2002 and the application for the grant was received in my Department on or before 4 December 2002. In all cases, the house must be completed and occupied and an application for payment of the grant received in my Department on or before 13 November 2003. A new house grant cannot be allowed in this case as the application was received subsequent to 4 December 2002.</P>

      <P>As the Deputy is aware, my Department has responsibility for overseeing the work of the Local Drugs Task Force, LDTFs, which are based in 14 areas of high drug misuse in Dublin, Cork and Bray. The LDTFs are made up of representatives from the statutory, community and voluntary sectors and each area has developed a local action plan. The selection of projects, and the funding allocated, is based on the task force's prioritisation of the identified needs within its area and the ability of the proposed projects to meet those needs. Most of the LDTFs are currently implementing their second round plans and, to date, over &euro;14 million has been allocated to implement these plans. As funding for the LDTFs is approved by the Cabinet Committee on Social Inclusion, the Deputy will appreciate that it is not open to me to re-allocate funding within these plans. Furthermore, it should be noted that these are the only moneys available under this initiative to fund such projects.</P>
      <P>As regards the SWAN project, this group has been allocated funding of &euro;19,046 under the second round plan of the Tallaght LDTF. To date, projects under both of the task force plans for Tallaght, including mainstreamed projects, have been allocated over &euro;4 million. In addition, just over &euro;1.4 million has been allocated to drugs projects in the area under the premises initiative and approximately &euro;2.8 million has been allocated to Tallaght under the young people's facilities and services fund, YPFSF. Funding for the YPFSF is held by the Department of Education and Science.</P>
      <P>Finally, the Deputy should note that my colleague the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Micheál Martin, has responsibility for funding decisions made by the South-Western Area Health Board.</P>

      <P>The National Assessment Committee, NAC, of the young peoples facilities and services fund, YPFSF, which is chaired by my Department, is currently examining the services projects funded under round one of the fund. The intention would be where they are found to be effective, they will be mainstreamed by enabling their on-going provision by statutory agencies. Qualification for continued funding will be dependant on the successful evaluation of each project &ndash; including the Carlow project. A steering group, consisting of members of the NAC and representatives from the four principal vocational education committees involved in the local drug task force areas, i.e. City of Dublin Youth Services Board, County Dublin VEC, Dún Laoghaire Rathdown VEC and the City of Cork VEC, has been established to oversee the overall evaluation process and it will make recommendations to the NAC on the projects to be mainstreamed. The steering group will be contacting each development group in the areas involved, including Carlow, in the next week or so setting out the procedures to be followed. The NAC hopes to be in a position to make recommendations to the Cabinet Committee on Social Inclusion on projects to be mainstreamed by April 2003. Each services project, has been provided with interim funding pending the outcome of the evaluation-mainstreaming process.</P>

The reduced allocation may, however, <Col N="540" /> mean that we are not in a position to progress the expansion of the community development support programme at the same pace as we have done in previous years.

      <P>No funding has been sanctioned from my Department for the development of Downings harbour, although assistance of £23,380 was provided to Donegal County Council in 2001 towards the employment of consultants to carry out a feasibility study in this regard. From the investigations carried out it appears that the estimated cost of the harbour development could be as high as &euro;10.2 million, depending on the particular development option chosen. My Department has informed Donegal County Council that funding estimated at some &euro;630,000 for planning work on the project could not be considered until the funding for the overall project has been secured by the council. Expenditure of the order envisaged in regard to the majority of the options identified by the feasibility study would not come within the normal parameters of my Department's scheme for strategic Gaeltacht harbours. The Deputy should also be aware that my Department has recently provided assistance for works to three strategic Gaeltacht harbours in Donegal &ndash; Baile Fuar Uisce, &euro;1,079,500, Teileann, &euro;802,930, and Bun Beag, &euro;1,244,500.</P>

Under the CLÁR Programme, &euro;14.14million was spent in 2002 on capital projects in 17 counties, mainly in relation to roads, water schemes, sewerage schemes, village enhancement and sports.

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 958 and 959 together.</P>
      <P>The students summer jobs scheme was first introduced in 1993 to provide income support for less well off students who were disqualified under social welfare legislation from receiving unemployment assistance during the summer months. The scheme allowed students to take up part-time work useful to their community and to receive payment for this work. When the scheme was introduced unemployment levels in Ireland were among the highest in the EU and students found it difficult during the holiday period to obtain work. Since 1997 the take up has been dropping gradually, coinciding undoubtedly with the upsurge in the economy and wider availability of alternative and well paid summer jobs. Given the financial pressures on my Department and in order to focus resources available in the best possible way, it has been decided to discontinue the students summer job scheme.</P>

      <P>Since the commencement of the scheme of community support for older people, a total of &euro;32.5 million has been allocated to the scheme, which to the end of 2001 has assisted some 89,136 individuals. A sum of &euro;4.4 million was provided for the scheme in 2002. The purpose of the scheme is to provide funding for initiatives to improve the security and social support of vulnerable older people. Under the terms of the scheme, grant aid is available towards the once-off costs of purchase and-or installation of small-scale physical security equipment such as strengthening of doors and windows, window locks, door chains and locks and security lighting and socially-monitored alarm systems such as the pendant alarm system which is operated via the telephone and is worn around the neck or wrist.</P>
      <P>Annual monitoring fees or maintenance fees associated with socially-monitored alarm systems are not provided for under the scheme. As these fees are levied by private service providers, this Department has no role in setting, abolishing, waiving or reducing such fees. Any changes to the terms of the scheme for 2003, will have to be considered in light of the resources available to the scheme.</P>

      <P>Arising from the analysis of the 2002 population Census by NUI Maynooth, the Government decided on the additional areas for inclusion in the CLÁR programme and I announced these additions on 17 January 2003. The critical criterion in the review of the CLÁR programme was to maintain the 50% overall reduction and involved identifying and including any district electoral divisions with a 50% + population decline contiguous or near to existing CLÁR areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the case of Westmeath, with the additional 12 district electoral divisions, the average population decline from 1926-2002 is 50.73%, which meets the criterion of the review. The population <Col N="551" /> changes in the district electoral divisions referred to by the Deputy are as follows:</P>

      <P>The White Paper on Supporting Voluntary Activity published in September 2000 provides for a number of funding schemes including a scheme for the provision of training and supports in the community and voluntary sector. An application under the scheme referred to was received from Independent Living and Community Services.

There was a strong response to the advertisement for this scheme, with 540 applications received.</P>
      <P>It has now been decided that in order to expedite the assessment of this large number of applications, consultants should be recruited to make an assessment of all applications received and to make recommendations to me at the earliest date possible. My Department is making the necessary arrangements for recruitment of a suitable consultant for completion of this task. Applicants will be advised of the outcome of their application as soon as possible following completion of the assessment process.</P>

      <P>My Department was established to produce a more co-ordinated engagement by the State with communities around the country, as they pursue their own development. As a first step towards this goal, a review is being undertaken of the programmes and activities which come within the remit of my Department, with a view to achieving optimal coherence across the various schemes and maximising the effectiveness of the programmes for local communities. This process will shape the future development of the Department's programmes, including the community development support programme.</P>
      <P>In the context of a tighter economic situation generally, the level of funding allocated to the community development support programmes for 2003 has been reduced by comparison with 2002. This allocation will enable my Department to meet its current core commitments to existing community development projects in 2003. The reduced allocation may mean that we are not in a position to progress the expansion of the community development support programme at the same pace as we have done in previous years. The question therefore of providing funding to new groups, including those in the western region, will be considered in the context of existing commitments and the available resources.</P>

      <P>The funding scheme to support the role of federations and networks in the community and voluntary sector is one of a number of measures introduced by the White Paper on Supporting Voluntary Activity with the objective of supporting and developing the sector. The scheme attracted 152 applications which required detailed examination and assessment which was carried out with the assistance of the White Paper's implementation and advisory group. The group, which consists of both statutory and voluntary representatives, is tasked with advising on the implementation of the recommendations in the White Paper. A number of issues arose in the course of processing the applications received under this scheme which it was considered could give rise to legal challenge. To ensure that eventual funding decisions would command full public confidence it was considered necessary to re-advertise the scheme and to seek fresh applications. My Department is making the necessary arrangements for the re-advertisement of the scheme in the coming weeks.</P>
      <P>Provision has been made in the Estimates for my Department in 2003 for more than &euro;100 million for community affairs including &euro;29.538 million for community and voluntary services. In relation to the scheme for federations and networks in the community and voluntary sector, funding will be available for this scheme in 2003 but at a reduced level. The reduction in 2003 reflects the tight estimate provision across Departments in response to the overall Government financial position. The Government remains fully committed to the principles and features outlined in the White Paper including the support of federations, networks, and umbrella bodies in the sector.</P>

      <P>The free travel scheme is available to all people living in the State aged 66 years or over. It is also available to carers and people with disabilities who are in receipt of certain welfare type payments. Time restrictions on the free travel scheme have been a feature of the scheme since its inception. They do not, however, apply in the case of people with learning disabilities, people attending long-term rehabilitation courses or certain work experience programmes and certain other disabled or blind people. These people <Col N="554" /> are issued with an unrestricted free travel pass which enables them to travel during the normally restricted travel times.</P>
      <P>The central issue in regard to time restrictions is that of capacity constraints and in recognition of the pressure of the transport system from commuters travelling to and from work and school in the morning and evening. There are no peak time travel restrictions on DART, suburban rail services, and on services provided by private transport operators in other parts of the country. Any general lifting of the time restrictions could cause capacity problems for transport operators. In exceptional or extenuating circumstances, however, where hospital appointments cannot be arranged out of peak travel time, my Department can issue a temporary unrestricted free travel pass. Requests for such passes can only be considered on a case by case basis and passes are only granted in very exceptional circumstances. The operation of the free travel scheme is kept under review with a view to identifying the scope for further improvements where circumstances allow.</P>

      <P>People who receive a rent supplement under the supplementary welfare allowance scheme have always been required to make a minimum contribution towards the cost of their rent. When last set in 1994 the contribution represented approximately 10% of the minimum social welfare weekly payment rate.</P>
      <P>In November, I announced my intention to restore the minimum contribution to an equivalent level. In this regard I introduced regulations which provided for an increase in the minimum contribution from &euro;7.62 to &euro;12.00 per week which represents 9.6% of the current minimum social welfare weekly payment rate.</P>
      <P>Any increase in the level of the minimum rent contribution has an impact on the net income of people affected. The recent increase, however, restores the relationship which existed previously and I am satisfied that relationship is reasonable and should be maintained.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 972, 973 and 974 together.</P>
      <P>Free travel is available to all persons aged 66 or over, and to categories of people under that age who are in receipt of social welfare support for invalidity, visual impairment and carers. At end December 2002 there were 635,998 free travel passes in existence for the relevant client groups.</P>
      <P>In 2002 approximately &euro;46.2 million was spent on the scheme. The CIE group of companies received approximately &euro;40.4 million, the private transport operators some &euro;2.8 million and the cross-Border free travel scheme, covering certain public and private operator services, accounted for approximately &euro;3 million. The amount paid to CIE is paid to the group of companies as a whole and is apportioned internally by CIE between the constituent companies.</P>
      <P>On average, about 1,000 replacement passes are issued per month to customers where their existing pass was lost, damaged or stolen. About 700 replacement passes have been issued in 2003 to date. My Department is conscious of the need to control and prevent abuse of the scheme. In this regard, my Department is involved in discussions with the Department of Transport and the Rail Procurement Agency, RPA, regarding the development of a more secure travel card.</P>
      <P>Transport operators are kept aware of the different types of pass on issue to the various categories of customer and advised to contact the Department in suspected cases of misuse. Customers living in Dublin, Cork, Limerick, Galway and Waterford are required to add CIE photo-identity to their free travel pass. A further control is applied in the case of an individual who reports a number of free travel passes lost, stolen or confiscated. It is departmental policy in these cases to issue the customer with a temporary pass only, which may not be further replaced until the date on the temporary pass has expired.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The small private operators of the free travel <Col N="558" /> scheme are reimbursed for individual journeys undertaken by pass holders and in these circumstances cases of abuse have not been detected. In the case of the remaining operators, payment in respect of free travel services is on a fixed price basis. It is in the interest of these operators to apply controls of various kinds at present to present fraudulent misuse and if any arises the cost is borne by the transport operator directly, as is the case with any form of fare evasion. However, while there is no direct impact on scheme expenditure through abuse, the Department is always willing to co-operate to the greatest extent possible with CIE and other relevant transport operators in dealing with any scheme abuse cases.</P>

      <P>The carer's allowance is a social assistance payment which provides income support to people who are providing certain elderly or incapacitated persons with full-time care and attention and whose incomes fall below a certain limit.</P>
      <P>From August 1999 the full-time care and attention requirements were relaxed to introduce an element of flexibility for carers while still safeguarding the needs and interests of care recipients. Under these arrangements, which were introduced in recognition of the economic and therapeutic value of work, carers may work for up to ten hours per week.</P>
      <P>However, the carer's allowance scheme is designed for full-time carers and, accordingly, in allowing for flexibility to work, a balance needs to be struck between the needs of the care recipient and needs of the carer to maintain contact with the labour market. The present arrangement achieves this and there are no plans to change the hours condition in present circumstances.</P>

      <P>Pre-1953 contributions may be used to satisfy the qualifying conditions for the old age (contributory) and widow-widower's (contributory) pensions and orphan's (contributory) allowance. In <Col N="559" /> order to qualify for these pensions a person must, amongst other things, have a minimum number of paid social insurance contributions and achieve a minimum yearly average of contributions paid or credited on their social insurance record.</P>
      <P>There is no average contribution test for the orphan's allowance. In the case of the widow-widower's (contributory) pension, pre-1953 contributions may be used to satisfy both conditions. In the case of the old age (contributory) pension, these contributions may not be used to satisfy the average contribution test. Section 83 (2) of the Social Welfare Consolidation Act 1983 sets out the manner in which the average contribution record is to be calculated for the purposes of the old age (contributory) pension.</P>
      <P>However, in line with the Government's commitment to ensuring the widest possible coverage for old age (contributory) pension, a special flat-rate pension payable at 50% of the maximum personal rate, was introduced from May 2000 for people with pre-1953 social insurance contributions who, due to the yearly average rule, failed to qualify for a pension. To qualify, a person must have paid at least 260 contributions which may comprise all pre-1953 contributions or a combination of pre and post-1953 insurance. In excess of 23,000 people have benefited from this special measure.</P>
      <P>Other social welfare contributory benefits are generally aimed at those who, for one reason or another, are absent from work. Claimants must demonstrate a recent attachment to the workforce and so qualifying conditions usually require that contributions be made in a recent tax year. In the circumstances, pre-1953 contributions would not be relevant in the context of qualification for such benefits. Any further development in relation to recognition for pre-1953 contributions would have to be considered in a budgetary context.</P>

The qualifying age for old age pension was subsequently reduced to 66 years of age. In the <Col N="560" /> circumstances, the retirement condition now only applies to one year.</P>

The wife died on 25 July 1999 but my Department was not made aware of this at the time. Consequently, the qualified adult allowance continued in payment until March 2001 when notification of the date of death was first received.</P>
      <P>As a result of this, an overpayment of qualified adult allowance arose in respect of the period 10 September 1999, i.e. six weeks after the date of death, to 8 March 2001 and amounting to &euro;7,747.60. The overpayment is recoverable under Section 279 of the Social Welfare (Consolidation) Act 1993. In accordance with the code of practice on the recovery of overpayments it was decided to accept weekly deductions of &euro;6.00 from the weekly rate of old age contributory pension. These deductions commenced on the 18 October 2002. Allowing for this deduction his current weekly rate of pension is &euro;147.70 increasing to &euro;157.70 from 3 January 2003.</P>

      <Quest>the standard calculation of the cost of a diabetic diet which she sets out for the community welfare service in calculating the payment of dietary supplements; the way in which this standard diet is calculated; and the way in which its cost is adjusted from year to year.</Quest>

      <P>Recipients of social welfare or health board payments who have been prescribed a special diet as a result of a specified medical condition, including diabetes, and whose means are insufficient to meet their needs, may qualify for a diet supplement under the supplementary welfare allowance scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The amount of supplement payable depends on which of two categories of diet, that is lower cost diet or higher cost diet, has been prescribed by <Col N="561" /> the applicant's medical advisor as well as the income of the individual and his/her dependants. Separate rates are payable in respect of child dependants under 18 years of age.</P>
    <P>In the case of an adult, a diabetic diet is deemed to be a low cost diet, in which case the amount of diet supplement payable is &euro;34.28 less one third of the applicant's income, one sixth in the case of a couple. In the case of an adult on a higher cost diet, the amount of diet supplement is &euro;44.44 less one third of the applicant's income, one sixth in the case of a couple. In the case of a child dependant, under 18 years, a diabetic diet is deemed to be a high cost diet, in which case the amount of supplement is &euro;10.26. A low cost diet supplement for a child dependant, under 18 years, is &euro;6.35.</P>
    <P>The rates of diet supplement are reviewed on a regular basis. In addition, in assessing an applicant's income for diet supplement purposes, increases in weekly social welfare payments since 1996 are disregarded under current arrangements.</P>
    <P>All aspects of the current system of diet supplements are being examined in conjunction with a review of the supplementary welfare allowance scheme which is currently under way in my Department.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 984, 985 and 986 together.</P>
      <P>The farm assist scheme, which introduced special arrangements for farmers on low incomes, came into operation in April 1999. At present 8,496 farmers are benefiting under the scheme. The average weekly payment is &euro;139.74.</P>
      <P>In 2002, a total of 2,804 farm assist customers had their means reviewed. As a result of these reviews, 723 customers received an increase in their weekly payment and 1,104 had their rates reduced.</P>
      <P>A total of 134 appeals in relation to farm assist were received by the social welfare appeals office in the period January to December 2002. Of this number, 36 had a favourable outcome at appeal and a further 24 had their means revised favourably by a deciding officer following the lodging of the appeal. In 59 cases, the appeals officer upheld the deciding officer's decision in relation to the means assessment. Ten customers withdrew their appeal and a decision is awaited in the remaining five cases.</P>
      <P>Of the 8,496 farm assist customers currently receiving payment, a total of 535 were receiving the maximum rate of payment relative to their family size, i.e. there were no means assessed against them. This compares with 551 at the end of December 2001.</P>

    <P>My Department spent a total of &euro;1,319,239 on advertising in 2002, of which &euro;981,960 was in respect of the print media and &euro;337,279 in respect of the broadcast media. This advertising covered a range of departmental schemes and services.</P>

    <P>In relation to consultancy on advertising, no consultants were used for that purpose as all tendering documentation was prepared by staff in the Department. The cost of advertising agencies is included in the advertising costs referred to above.</P>
    <P>Expenditure by my Department on consultancy work, the bulk of which relates to major IT projects in which the Department is involved, amounted to &euro;11,805,025 in 2002, &euro;9,944,933 in 2001 and &euro;2,382,255 in 2000.</P>
    <P>Expenditure by my Department on professional legal services and advice in 2002 was &euro;236,781, of which &euro;199,465 was included in the expenditure on consultancy work for 2002 shown above.</P>

      <P>A broader objective of the 2003 social welfare package is to protect the position of the less well off in our society. Budget 2003 made provision for an increase of &euro;6, or 5.1%, in the weekly personal rate of disability benefit, with an additional increase of &euro;4, also 5.1%, in the weekly rate of qualified adult allowance, where payable. The Social Welfare Act 2002 brought these increases into effect from the first week in January.</P>
      <P>Overall, an additional &euro;833 million in social welfare spending is provided for during this year, and this will bring the projected level of annual spending to over &euro;10 billion for the first time. At a time of great economic uncertainty, this emphasises the Government's commitment to protecting those at highest risk. My colleagues and I are committed to safeguarding the position of all social welfare recipients and I look forward to making further progress in the years ahead on the achievement of our social inclusion commitments.</P>

      <P>The range of employment support services administered by my Department was reviewed last year in the light of the major economic and labour market changes that have occurred since the scheme was introduced. When the back to work allowance was introduced the overall unemployment level was 15.7% and long-term unemployment stood at 8.9%. By 2001 overall unemployment had fallen to 3.7% and long-term unemployment was down to 1.2%.</P>
      <P>The review also took cognisance of an independent evaluation of the scheme carried out by consultants which was published in December 2000. The report recommended, in the light of the current tight labour market situation, that the scheme be refocused on the longer-term unemployed, that the non-financial supports be enhanced and that the overall numbers on the scheme be reduced.</P>

    <P>It is important that my Department's employment support services retain their relevance to current employment and economic conditions and continue to focus on the more vulnerable in our community. Following on from this review, the qualifying period for persons on unemployment benefit assistance has been increased from 12 and 15 months to five years with effect from <Col N="568" /> 1 January 2003. Other social welfare qualifying payments are not affected by the change.</P>
    <P>The person concerned wrote to me on 17 December 2002 expressing her concern at the changes. A reply has been issued to her explaining my position on the matter.</P>

      <P>It is not possible to provide a breakdown of the farm assist scheme claimload by Dáil constituency. A breakdown of such claims by local office is provided in Tables 1 and 2.</P>
      <P>Table 1 shows the total number of claims in payment and the number of claims in payment where the application was made in 2001 and 2002.</P>
      <P>During 2002, a total of 311 farmers had their farm assist application disallowed either because of failure to disclose means or because their means exceeded the prescribed limit. The corresponding figure for 2001 was 448. Further details of disallowances on a local basis will be made available to the Deputy as soon as possible.</P>
      <P>Table 2 shows the number of farm assist cases where no means have been assessed against the farmer and the farmer is therefore in receipt of the maximum payment appropriate to his-her circumstances.</P>
      <P>All costs that are associated with farming e.g. feed, fertiliser, contractor charges, interest on loans, fees, fencing, repairs, rent of conacre, labour hire, maintenance etc. are taken into account in accessing eligibility for the scheme. In addition, 30% of the assessing income is disregarded. There are child disregards of &euro;253.95 per year for each of the first two children and &euro;380.92 per year for each subsequent child. Capital is favourably assessed with the first &euro;12,697.38 held by the farmer being disregarded.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Where, at any stage, a farmer considers that his or her circumstances have changed since the most recent means assessment, it is open to him or her to request a means review. Where a farmer is dissatisfied with a means assessment, he or she may appeal the decision to the social welfare appeals office. The following is a breakdown of the num<Col N="569" /> ber of farmers receiving farm assist under a range of payment bands.</P>

    <P>To increase awareness of the farm assist scheme, my Department undertook a publicity campaign in July 2002. The focus of the campaign, was a promotional video which describes who may benefit under the scheme, how to apply and how means are calculated. The response to the orders were very positive and I know that the scheme is valued in particular by farmers at the lower end of the farm income spectrum.</P>
    <P>I am aware of the difficulties that farmers and their families are encountering at present. My Department recognises these difficulties and takes account of any loss of income or any additional costs incurred due to adverse weather conditions etc.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that farmers with difficulties can be catered for within the current arrangements for the assessment of means. I will of course keep the matter under review.</P>
    <P>The following table shows a breakdown by county of farm assist recipients in 2001 and 2002. It should be noted that the figures have been compiled from data that is maintained on a local office catchment area basis and these do not correspond exactly with county boundaries.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan" hpid="Mary Coughlan Mary Coughlan">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Social and Family Affairs (Mary Coughlan)</NameTxt>
      <P>In recent years a number of measures have been introduced to protect the pension rights of those who take time out of the paid workforce to care for children or sick relatives and to make qualification for a pension easier for those with broken or interrupted insurance records.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The homemaker's scheme was introduced in 1994 and allows for periods spent out of the work force caring for children or sick relatives to be disregarded when a person's contribution record is being averaged for pension purposes. This scheme is at present being reviewed as part of an overall review of the qualifying conditions for the old age contributory and retirement pension, the <Col N="572" /> first phase of which was published in August 2000. Changes to the homemaker's scheme will be considered in the context of the findings of the phase 2 report which I expect to publish in the coming months.</P>
    <P>The Government is committed to increasing the rate at which the qualified adult allowance, QAA, is paid for those over 66 years of age to the rate of the old age non contributory pension and to allowing for the payment of this allowance directly to the qualified adult. This process commenced in budget 2001, with increases of up to &euro;19.05 per week granted at that time. Further increases were granted in the budgets of 2002 and 2003.</P>
    <P>Since the 1 October 2002, arrangements are in place, in accordance with the conclusions of the PPF working group on administrative individualisation, which reported in September 2002, to allow spouses and partners of people entitled to a retirement or an old age contributory pension to receive payment of the QAA directly.</P>
    <P>More flexibility has also been introduced into the qualifying conditions for the old age contributory pension scheme, including a reduction in the average number of contributions required for a minimum pension to ten, the introduction of <i>pro-rata</i> pensions for those with mixed rate insurance records and the special pension for those with pre-1953 insurance contributions. These measures are of benefit to many women who have gaps in their PRSI records due to working in the home looking after children or caring full time for an elderly or incapacitated person.</P>
    <P>The issue raised has been discussed with various groups, for example, as part of the pre-budget forum last October. It was also discussed at a meeting I held with the Farm Families Committee of the IFA on 14 November 2002. The committee, in its pre-budget submission welcomed the developments, outlined above, in relation to a personal pension for pensioner spouses and considers that this initiative helps to overcome the exclusion of many spouses from PRSI coverage.</P>

      <asker>Mr. Cregan</asker>
      <AskConj>asked the </AskConj>
      <askee>Minister for Social and Family Affairs</askee>
      <Quest>her plans to amend the regulations for old age pensioners in relation to calculating the yearly average and allow contributions up to retirement date to be included as currently persons are being denied the opportunity to have all their contributions assessed by the rule which allows contributions to be included up to the end of the previous financial year only; and if she will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan" hpid="Mary Coughlan Mary Coughlan">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Social and Family Affairs (Mary Coughlan)</NameTxt>
      <P>The records of my Department show that the person concerned has a total of 520 full rate contributions recorded for the period 1974 to 2001, 28 years. The balance of his record com<Col N="573" /> prises modified rate insurance which is not reckonable for old age contributory pension purposes. This is equal to a yearly average of 19 contributions, which entitles him to a reduced rate personal pension payable at the rate of &euro;110.50 per week. He is also in receipt of a qualified adult allowance in respect of his spouse of &euro;73.60 per week.</P>
      <P>Under current legislation only contributions made up to the end of the last complete tax year before a person reaches pension age may be counted when eligibility for a pension is being considered. The person concerned was 66 in October 2002 and consequently only contributions made up to December 2001 are reckonable.</P>
      <P>In 2000 the Department published a review of the qualifying conditions for the old age contributory and retirement pension, phase 1. This report proposed, amongst other things, that consideration be given to changing the basis of assessment for old age contributory and retirement pensions from the current system of average contributions to one based on total contributions paid or credited. The phase 2 report, which is examining these issues further, is at an advanced stage of preparation and it is hoped to publish it as a discussion document in the coming months. Further changes in qualifying conditions for pensions will be considered in the light of the response to that report.</P>

      <P>The person concerned claimed unemployment benefit on 17 September 2002. Following a full examination of his case the claim was disallowed on the grounds that the person concerned was not genuinely seeking work. Notification of the decision and his right to appeal issued on 24 October 2002.</P>
      <P>The person concerned appealed the deciding officer's decision to the independent social welfare appeals office. The appeals officer upheld the original decision and the person concerned was notified of the result on 10 January 2003. Supplementary welfare allowance was paid to the person concerned from 17 September 2002 to 29 January 2003.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 1004 and 1005 together.</P>
      <P>Asylum seekers who arrived after 10 April 2000 are allocated a place in the direct provision system operated by the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform where they are provided with full board accommodation, including laundry and other services.</P>
      <P>In addition, they receive a weekly personal allowance of &euro;19.10 per adult and &euro;9.60 per child under the supplementary welfare allowance scheme which is administered by the health boards on behalf of the Department. Exceptional needs payments are also made by the health boards where appropriate.</P>
      <P>In some circumstances an asylum seeker may vacate the direct provision system. Those who are allowed to do so and who live within the community may receive the full standard rate of supplementary welfare allowance, including rent supplement. The current maximum rate of basic supplementary allowance payable is &euro;124.80 for a single adult, &euro;207.60 for a couple. This also applies to asylum seekers who arrived before 10 April 2000 who are not covered by the direct provision system.</P>
      <P>A person who has been granted asylum is entitled to the same treatment under the social welfare system as an Irish citizen. Such a person also has the right to seek employment. Persons who applied for asylum before 26 July 1999 and who had completed 12 months in the asylum process were also allowed to seek employment.</P>
      <P>A small number of asylum seekers and a small number of those who have been granted asylum are in receipt of other social welfare payments such as unemployment payments, one parent family payments, pensions, disability allowance and child benefit. Details of the numbers involved in these categories are not available.</P>

      <P>I understand that the Deputy is referring specifically to entitlement to unemployment benefit. A principal requirement for entitlement to unemployment benefit for any claimant is that he or she must be able to demonstrate availability for full-time employment. In consideration of this condition, any factor which would place restriction on the acceptance of an offer of suitable <Col N="576" /> employment would lead to the claim being disallowed.</P>
      <P>Where a visa is not renewed following expiration, the person cannot be considered to be available for full-time employment, on the basis that he would not be in a position to take up a suitable offer of work. A person in this situation would not, in the normal course, qualify for unemployment benefit.</P>
