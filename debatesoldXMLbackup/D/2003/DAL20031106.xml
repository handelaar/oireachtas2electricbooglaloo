      <P>Before proceeding to the Order of Business, I propose to deal with a number of notices under Standing Order 31. I will call on the Deputies to raise the matters in the order in which they submitted their notices to my office.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. F. McGrath</NameTxt>
      <P>I seek the adjournment of the Dáil under Standing Order 31 to discuss the following matter of national importance, namely, the major disruption to people's homes in Marino, Fairview, Drumcondra and Santry areas during the construction of the Dublin Port tunnel, the urgent need to compensate the families of the 90 homes damaged and the need to investigate the many serious complaints about this project.</P>

      <P>I seek the adjournment of the Dáil under Standing Order 31 to discuss the following matter of national importance, namely, the decision by Irish Rail to close the DART service over the holiday period 27 December to 4 January inclusive. There is now an urgent need for the Minister for Transport to put alternative rail and public transport services in place over this period and to review the operation of the communications between his Department and Irish Rail.</P>

      <P>It is proposed to take No. 24, Statements on Tobacco Regulations; No. 25, Education for Persons with Disabilities Bill 2003 &ndash; Second Stage (resumed). It is proposed, notwithstanding anything in Standing Orders, that the proceedings on No. 24 shall, if not previously concluded, be brought to a conclusion at 1 p.m., and that the following arrangement shall apply: the statements of the Minister for Health and Children and of the main spokespersons for the Fine Gael Party, the Labour Party and the Technical Group, who shall be called upon in that order, shall not exceed 15 minutes in each case; the statements of each other Member called upon shall not exceed ten minutes in each case and Members may share time; the Minister for Health and Children shall be called upon to make a statement in reply which shall not exceed five minutes.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to object to this, except to say to the Tánaiste that she might remind the Taoiseach that he should perhaps clarify his comment that the introduction of these regulations would allow for decent people to return to public houses. The implication is that those who attend public houses are not decent.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>This is an important matter on which unfortunately the House is not permitted to vote after the debate. That is a great pity, given the unity and determination on the Government benches, driven only by considerations of health. It is important that the House be given an opportunity to positively vote on this statutory instrument. Unless the Tánaiste is minded at this stage to concede a vote, I would have to reluctantly oppose the measure.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gormley</NameTxt>
      <P>I support Deputy Rabbitte. It is very important that we have a vote. I very much welcome this measure but I understand that there are some recalcitrant backbenchers in the Government parties who may not be supportive of this. We would like to see the colour of their money.</P>

      <P>I wish to highlight the ludicrousness of our having the opportunity at this point to have statements on a measure that has already been signed by the Minister. This is <Col N="1231" />not a debate. All we are being offered here is statements, while the real debate has been going on outside this House over the past several months. We have never been afforded that opportunity. It is like so much that happens in <Col N="1232" />this House, being too little and too late. I concur with the other Deputies. We should have the right to exercise a vote on this matter.</P>

      <P>I wish to raise two matters with the Tánaiste on the Order of Business. The Taoiseach told the Dáil on 7 October regarding the disruptive DART works that CIE had not made it clear <Col N="1233" />until recent days that the work would start now. On 8 October he said that the chairmen of CIE and Iarnród Éireann had arranged on the evening of 6 October to meet the Minister to brief him.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>Thank you, though the Taoiseach <Col N="1234" />should be here to answer the first. On a previous Order of Business, I raised with the Tánaiste that she was unable to attend a meeting in Brussels at which 27 Ministers were present, while Ireland was represented by a deputy ambassador. None of the Tánaiste's Ministers of State was able to attend either. One matter on the agenda was embryonic stem cell research. The next meeting is to be held shortly and I understand that the Tánaiste will attend. In view of the fact that the Joint Committee on Enterprise and Small Business yesterday unanimously recommended that the proposal from the European Commission be rejected and that the moratorium on embryonic stem cell research not be lifted, can the Tánaiste explain what action she proposes to take when she attends the next meeting in view of the fact that the Government has indicated support for the motion?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle An Ceann Comhairle">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps the Deputy might come to a question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny" hpid="Mr. Kenny Mr. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>As a medical doctor, the Ceann Comhairle will understand that Dáil Éireann has never discussed the matter, which is very important to a great number of people. I would like the Tánaiste to explain what she will do in view of the committee's unanimous proposal yesterday.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="The Tánaiste Mary Harney">
      <NameTxt>The Tánaiste</NameTxt>
      <P>To clarify the matter for Deputy Kenny, the moratorium runs out at the end of December. If no decision is taken by the Council of Ministers on 27 November, the research can proceed without any controls. The issue for the Ministers on 27 November is, in the context of the moratorium ceasing at the end of this year, whether they wish the research to be carried out in those countries which believe that it is ethically possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GayMitchell" hpid="Mr. G. Mitchell Mr. G. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not the issue. It is funding.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="The Tánaiste Mary Harney">
      <NameTxt>The Tánaiste</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, exactly. It is European funding. The question is whether the Ministers want such research to be carried out in those countries that do not have ethical problems with it under some control regime or without such controls. The next meeting of the Council of Ministers, which I will attend, is next Monday. As I explained to Deputy Kenny previously, I was unable to attend the last meeting for private family reasons, and I think he understood that. The matter was discussed informally at that meeting. It was not tabled for formal discussion, but it will be down for that on 27 November. My officials and I will be at that meeting.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach had to correct the record yesterday morning about exaggerating the number of gardaí on our streets. Notwithstanding that, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform asserts that the 2,000 gardaí promised at the last election may still materialise in part. I would like to ask the Tánaiste about the statement by the Minister for Finance this morning on Today FM, when he said that there is no necessity for additional gardaí on the streets.</P>

      <P>Perhaps I might raise a second matter while the Tánaiste considers which side she wishes to take on the first. I draw her attention to the landmark case taken by a young per<Col N="1236" />son against a residential institution in Sligo. A case initiated in 1999 found that the State had to be called in under Deputy Michael Woods's indemnity deal last Friday and a settlement made for &euro;50,000, highlighting what a newspaper calls a new flaw in the controversial indemnity deal. Regarding the Commission to Inquire into Child Abuse (Amendment) Bill, will the Government deal with any of the flaws in that remarkable deal?</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad to have the opportunity to state the Government's position on the tobacco smoking prohibition regulations of 2003. The adverse impact of tobacco consumption on human health is well documented. Tobacco smoke is the leading preventable cause of death and disability in Ireland. Medical evidence has repeatedly confirmed tobacco as a cause of cardiovascular disease, including heart attack and stroke, as well as common cancers, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, asthmatic attacks, low birth weight babies and sudden infant death syndrome.</P>
      <P>Inhalation of environmental tobacco smoke by non-smokers, commonly referred to as passive smoking, also poses a substantial health risk, particularly in confined spaces including bars, restaurants, clubs and other workplaces. There is an international scientific consensus that second-hand smoke can kill and cause disease. The World Health Organisation has designated tobacco smoke as a carcinogen. Given the overwhelming medical evidence of the harm caused by tobacco smoke, strict regulation of tobacco products and their use is necessary to reduce the enormous burden of disease and death resulting from tobacco consumption through active and passive smoking. Environmental tobacco smoke increases the risk of heart disease among non-smokers. This has not been stressed as much as the cancer issue in the debate. Damage to the circulatory system and the heart are very significant, but there is also an increased risk of respiratory illnesses affecting asthmatics, those with emphysema, pregnant women and other groups.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On 30 January 2003 at the launch of the report of the Health Effects of Environmental Tobacco Smoke in the Workplace, commissioned jointly by the Health and Safety Authority and the Office of Tobacco Control, I announced a prohibition on smoking in all places of work, including licensed premises, with effect from January 2004. Smoke-free workplaces will mean a major cultural change for people throughout the country. I announced the measure almost a full year in advance to give employers, employees and the public the time needed to adjust. Given what we now know about the harmful nature of tobacco smoke, I have no choice other than to take the <Col N="1247" />necessary measures to provide protection for workers from second-hand smoke. The reality is quite stark; one does not have to be a smoker to be made ill by tobacco products.</P>
    <P>The primary purpose of the prohibition is to protect the health and safety of workers and the public from toxic environmental tobacco smoke. I published draft regulations in April 2003 and notified these to the EU Commission in accordance with the transparency directive. Completion of the three month notification period ended in July 2003. I signed the regulations on 16 October 2003, confirming 26 January 2004 as the operative date for the prohibition on smoking in the workplace. These regulations were made under section 47 of the Public Health (Tobacco) Act 2002.</P>
    <P>It was stated this morning that there was no room for a vote on the issue concerning section 47, but we should recall that there was. There were even amendments made to the section, although we did not feel they were necessary at the time because there was a clause that used the phrase, &ldquo;all or part of any other premises or place&rdquo;. Spokespersons in the House, particularly the Opposition, were particularly strong on this issue, especially Deputy Gay Mitchell. He stated with conviction that he specifically wanted to include in the legislation the phrase, &ldquo;licensed premises and registered clubs&rdquo;. This received some media attention at the time and we agreed to do it. I tabled an amendment to the principal Act to make sure there would be no doubt that this would apply to pubs and licensed premises. This was voted on unanimously by the House. It is important to point out that there was debate on environmental tobacco smoke when the Bill was being considered in the House. I heard certain interest groups comment that this measure went through on the nod and that, in passing it, Deputies did not realise it would enable the Minister to prohibit environmental tobacco smoke in pubs by regulation at a future date.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>They meant Members from across the House. The measure requires me to do nothing more than lay the relevant regulations before the House. Following a widespread public debate on the matter, I welcome this debate on the issue in the Chamber.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is widespread support for this measure and I appreciate the consistent support given by all sides of the House for effective tobacco control measures. I also acknowledge the formidable work undertaken by the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Health and Children, chaired my colleague, Deputy Batt O'Keeffe. A sub-committee of the joint committee issued two reports on health and smoking, recommending prohibitions on smoking in the workplace and licensed premises. The first, chaired by the former Deputy, <Col N="1248" />Alan Shatter, was unequivocal in its recommendations to the Minister at the time, while the second, chaired by Deputy Gay Mitchell and in which Deputy Gormley was also involved, gave me as Minister and the Department an equally unequivocal message that we should take the prohibition route.</P>
    <P>I have been heartened by the cross-party support for the measure, which should not be underestimated in the context of the lobby which opposes it. The strong and cohesive position taken by the Oireachtas on this matter has been an important factor in winning the political debate and bringing public opinion with us on an important public health measure.</P>
    <P>Surveys carried out since the announcement of the measure have consistently shown support for this important public health initiative. A recent survey commissioned by the Office of Tobacco Control showed that more than 80% of people believed that those involved in the licensed trade should comply fully with the new measure. We must not forget that most people do not smoke and most who do regret starting and want to give up. Surveys also show that many smokers &ndash; the figure in the most recent poll was, I believe, 61% &ndash; welcome the prohibition despite smoking themselves.</P>
    <P>Information campaigns to assist employers, employees and the public in preparation for the new health protection measure will be carried out in advance of January 2004. A national implementation group has been established to co-ordinate guidance and oversee the issuing of guidelines for groups in the various sectors, including the hospitality sector.</P>
    <P>I pay tribute to the officials from the Office of Tobacco Control and the Health and Safety Authority for their active engagement with officials from my Department in seeking to ensure a consistent approach in the introduction of the new measure and its subsequent enforcement. As the Office of Tobacco Control and the Health and Safety Authority jointly commissioned the original expert report, the measure is viewed as a twin-track, joint approach by these agencies aimed at ensuring we bed it down in every way possible. We appreciate the advice and support of the Health and Safety Authority. With its considerable experience in health and safety issues in the workplace, it has particular expertise to bring to the table.</P>
    <P>I have made it clear in public statements that the prohibition on smoking will apply to enclosed places of work. To further confirm this I have notified an amendment to the regulations to the European Commission clarifying this. When announcing the publication of the new regulations on 23 October, I stated I would also introduce an appropriate measure to deal with the unique position in prisons and an amendment to this effect has also been notified to the European Commission following consultation with the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform. The regulations do not apply to dwell<Col N="1249" />ings. Some queries have been raised with regard to the types of premises covered by the term &ldquo;dwelling&rdquo; and the advice of the Attorney General has been sought to clarify this matter.</P>
    <P>Tobacco imposes a significant burden on individuals, families and society through death, illness and medical costs. Even a modest reduction in the considerable burden of disease caused by tobacco will result in significant health gains. The real beneficiaries of the measures we are taking will be the future generations who will live, work and socialise in a tobacco free environment. Members of the Oireachtas can be proud of their role in having secured that achievement.</P>

      <P>I thank the Minister for finally giving the House an opportunity to discuss this matter. I was trying to think of another issue which in my lifetime received as much comprehensive coverage and analysis, sometimes to the point of inanity, as the prohibition on smoking in the workplace. The only issue which came to mind that received such coverage was the assassination of President Kennedy.</P>

      <P>The smoking ban received almost as much coverage as the assassination of President Kennedy. I have to hand it to the Fianna Fáil Party that as an exercise in distracting and diverting the public's attention from the real problems in the health service, its performance throughout the summer was masterly. It was quintessential Fianna Fáil.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="OliviaMitchell" hpid="Ms O. Mitchell Ms O. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Ms O. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>It is true and it showed the Fianna Fáil Party doing what it does best, namely, garnering support on both sides of every argument, while at the same time giving its backbench Deputies an opportunity to make a little run during the silly season.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As the Minister is aware, the Fine Gael Party completely supports the ban. I also support it, not I hope with the zeal of a reformed smoker but because I and my party recognise that the evidence regarding the effects of environmental tobacco smoke is incontrovertible and the arguments cannot be answered. We have no choice but to proceed with the ban. Smoking not only damages the health of the smoker but also that of others, which is the reason it is a public health issue. Now that the evidence is available, the Minister, all employees, publicans and the hotel industry, or anybody who facilitates smoking on their prem<Col N="1250" />ises, is liable to prosecution, which in today's society is increasingly likely.</P>
    <P>As a former smoker I am conscious that this measure will be difficult for smokers. It will be particularly difficult not so much in pubs, but for those who in their everyday working lives do not have the flexibility to leave their desks when they feel a need to go outside for a cigarette. In the early days, as people try to adjust to the ban, I hope employers will show reasonable understanding that smoking is an addiction.</P>
    <P>I am less sympathetic to smokers on the issue of the ban in pubs. No one is compelled to sit in a pub and people generally spend two or three hours rather than an entire day in a pub. Having said that, I do not underestimate the impact the ban will have on people's social life. While it may in the early stages also affect the profitability of publicans, I am convinced this will be temporary and normal patterns of socialising will be quickly re-established. Although I would not use the same terminology as the Taoiseach to describe people who have not frequented pubs in recent years, perhaps because they are asthmatic, perhaps they will consider socialising in a pub once the ban takes effect.</P>
    <P>We have not heard a murmur of complaint from the majority of employers. Although we have heard the hospitality industry complain, we would have heard much less from it if the Fianna Fáil Party had not decided to make the industry's cause its summer project. The support the licensed vintners were garnering, not only from backbench Government Deputies but also from Ministers, gave them false hope that they would be able to change public policy and did a grave disservice to the industry. While Members knew this was a carefully choreographed performance to distract from the health service, the licensed vintners did not and genuinely believed they would be able to change public policy. Believing they had always been friends of the Fianna Fáil Party, they expected the party to ride to their rescue. They are now learning the hard lesson taxi drivers learnt, that when it comes to political expediency the party's interests will supersede those of any group.</P>
    <P>During the summer the campaign being waged by backbenchers was shown by one opinion poll to be changing public opinion. It was a serious instance of toying with public opinion. The support they were giving to the licensed vintners suggested that this was a bad policy, that they did not support it and that it would be changed. The public believed it and the licensed vintners were threatening civil disobedience. They were genuinely convinced that they had won the campaign. I am glad good sense has reasserted itself among the public, with the latest opinion polls showing more than 80% support for the ban.</P>
    <P>The Minister might not have been aware of one ploy used by backbenchers, which was to blame me. A number of publicans and representatives of the licensed vintners told me that the Minister really wanted to do a u-turn but was afraid to do <Col N="1251" />so because I would criticise him publicly. He did not realise that the backbenchers were saying this to the licensed vintners. I do not know if my colleague, Deputy McManus, had the same experience. The inference was that the Minister was anxious to withdraw the ban and would find some formula to do so and save face, if only I would promise to keep quiet about it. That was an utterly improbable proposition but it gives one an idea of the nonsense that took place during the summer.</P>
    <P>The vast majority of publicans agree with the ban. In their hearts they know that it is time for it. However, they have concerns about the legislation and the regulations. I have mentioned the concern about enforcement. I do not believe enforcement of the ban in pubs will be the big issue it was claimed to be during the summer. Most will obey the law and there will be a certain amount of peer pressure to do so. When somebody lights up a cigarette in the pub, their friends will object to it, as they already do. In some cases, people even refuse to go out with smokers.</P>
    <P>Nevertheless, publicans will have some problems with enforcement, first because there is drink involved and second because employers have some leverage with their employees while publicans feel they have less leverage with those who are their customers. The legitimate gripe of publicans is that if they fail to enforce the law, they will be culpable. That is a new departure from established practice. If the smoker will not stop smoking, the publican will be fined. That is bizarre and defies all logic. It is contrary to the protocol in criminal legislation to link the offence to the perpetrator. In this case, the legislation transfers culpability for the offence from the smoker to the person unfortunate enough to own or manage the premises in which the offence takes place. This goes against all established practice and is unfair.</P>
    <P>There should be clarity about the obligations of the publican and they must be reasonable. The legislation should be changed to articulate what the publican must do. It would be reasonable to provide that the publican should be able to ask a smoker who lights up to stop smoking and then refuse to serve the person and his or her companions drink. However, to ask the publican physically to stop someone smoking is going too far. Environmental health officers have said they will be reasonable about this but that is not good enough. It will be a constant source of contention if it is left in the legislation. The publican's responsibility for enforcing the ban must be clarified and limited to what is reasonable. If the Minister does not intend to change the legislation, will he at least give a commitment that he will review it in six months to see how it is working?</P>
    <P>Many hares have been raised by the media since the regulations were published but they did not amount to much. One matter, however, has been raised previously and should be raised <Col N="1252" />again. It is the situation where the workplace is also a home. I am glad the Minister has clearly ruled out the domestic dwelling. Trying to enforce a ban in that case would be not only almost impossible but also ridiculous. The next step would be the introduction of thought police. It is nonsense to think somebody should monitor whether a person is smoking while they have a person employed to clean the windows. We should not even go there.</P>
    <P>There are situations, however, where people are in care in public or private institutions such as hospitals, hostels, nursing homes, homes for the handicapped and so forth. People living in such circumstances should have, where possible, the same freedoms as the rest of us. The prisons are a separate case. It is ironic that prisoners will be looked after but those who are vulnerable and need our protection are not. Some concession must be made for them in this respect. I accept that workers in these places have to be protected but the institutions, perhaps on an individual basis, should be able to negotiate some arrangement with environmental health inspectors whereby people will be permitted to smoke on the premises.</P>
    <P>The proposed arrangement is not fair. It is also unsafe. In institutions such as St. Vincent's Hospital where there are terminally ill cancer patients, psychiatric patients and addicts, there is a genuine fear that there will be attempts to evade the ban and that these will present a fire hazard. That is a legitimate concern for those running the institutions. They fear there will be attempts to smoke, even under the bed clothes in some cases. We must accept that in some care settings this will be a problem and that we will have to be flexible. A reasonable accommodation should be reached.</P>
    <P>I support the regulations and the legislation. They will reduce not just the damage caused by passive smoking but also change the culture and attitude to smoking. Many young people have started to smoke in the social setting of the pub. If it is no longer possible to smoke there, fewer people will take up smoking. I congratulate the Minister on overcoming whatever real or apparent objections were raised by Government backbenchers.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LizMcManus" hpid="Ms McManus Ms McManus">
      <NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>
      <P>The Labour Party supports the Minister in introducing this ban on smoking in the workplace. We have been consistent in our support. I regret that the House will not vote today on the regulations. It would have been important to have a vote if for no other reason than to draw a line under the events of recent months and clarify that the House supports the regulations and the implementation of the ban. It is regrettable and a signal of something within the Government that there is to be no vote today.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister has generously and correctly acknowledged the support of the Opposition in the House but he should also be aware of the support he received from us outside it. Deputy <Col N="1253" />Olivia Mitchell referred to this when talking about what had happened during the summer months. I had the rather strange experience of going to an angry public meeting of publicans in Aughrim, County Wicklow. All the usual suspects, including the local Deputies, were lined up on the platform. Deputy Timmins and I spoke in support of the ban. I made it clear that I thought it was a public health issue. I said I was conscious of the fact that cigarette smoking kills people and that it causes premature death and terrible diseases, such as cancer, cardiac conditions, etc. I got a certain amount of grief for saying that. However, I was interested in the fact that the most trenchant attack on the ban and on anything I said came from the Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs, Deputy Roche.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnGormley" hpid="Mr. Gormley Mr. Gormley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gormley</NameTxt>
      <P>That is typical.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LizMcManus" hpid="Ms McManus Ms McManus">
      <NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>
      <P>It is typical of the man, but it raises questions about leadership and about Government policy. It is sickening to hear that type of political opportunism on an issue which requires leadership and people to stand their ground. The Minister for Health and Children has stood his ground. He deserves the accolades he is receiving for that. However, other Ministers have acted extremely shabbily and have done damage to the issue of public health in recent months, but they have not been called to account for it. It is demeaning behaviour by Ministers who get all the benefits of being Ministers but who are not willing to live up to their responsibilities. That typifies this Government and it will eventually lead to total paralysis because Ministers are not willing to share collective responsibility for policies devised at Cabinet level. We are not talking about Fianna Fáil backbenchers who are treated as if they are badly behaved children. This goes to the core of Government. It is important to note that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards the approach adopted by the Minister, I have raised concerns about how the ban will be regulated and implemented. I did not do that to be destructive or to cause problems for the Minister, but because I am conscious of the fact that there are extremely powerful forces at play. Cigarette manufacturing companies do not give up the fight. We can see from examples elsewhere, particularly in the United States, the strength of their determination to do down any legislation or powers which will reduce the spread of their markets and sales. It is extremely important that when a significant change is being introduced and implemented, it is done in a cast iron way without any flaws. I do not understand why it is required to have two sets of regulations, one from the Minister for Health and Children and one from the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment. That is a weakness. I suspect it may have something to do with territorial claims for which Ministers and Departments are known. I do not know and I do not want to know if that is the reason. However, <Col N="1254" />there are dangers involved in having two sets of regulations. We know there are differences and that the regulations diverge. It is important that the legislation is tight and robust.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to this issue. When he published his regulations, I presume it had not been fully thought out because the definition of workplace was taken from an earlier Act and it did not describe the workplace as &ldquo;enclosed only&rdquo;. This is like a three card trick because at the time the Minister said he was sorting it out and that it had gone to the EU. I am still not clear when the EU was informed about the amendments. I know the Minister referred to the amendments, but I am not sure what they are. Under the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment regulations, the ban is specifically applied to enclosed workplaces. Under the regulations published by the Minister for Health and Children on 23 October, workplaces were not defined as enclosed. That led to issues such as whether the ban would apply to people in the street or farmers on their land because they are workplaces if workplaces are not defined as being enclosed. The Minister said he sent the amendments to Europe, but I do not have a copy of them. Did I receive a copy of those amendments?</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>I will clarify that in my reply.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LizMcManus" hpid="Ms McManus Ms McManus">
      <NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes. I am not attacking the Minister. However, if we are debating regulations in this House, we should know what we are debating. If we do not have the amendments the Minister said he sent to the European Union, then we are not debating the regulations. That is not the way Parliament should function.</P>
      <P>As regards the issue of dwellings, the regulations published by the Minister for Health and Children excluded dwellings as a workplace from the beginning. That makes sense and people appreciate it is reasonable. There should not be a difficulty with that. However, dwellings are not excluded under the health and safety regulations. That is a direct contradiction. The health and safety regulations cover carcinogens, industrial processes and chemicals and poisons, such as asbestos, which should not be used in people's homes. They do not deal with a social habit, such as smoking, which damages people's health. They are directed at something else. I am interested to hear what the Minister says about the conflict in terms of dwellings. That issue must be clarified.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister said that as regards appropriate measures to deal with the unique situation in prisons, an amendment to this effect has also been notified to the EU Commission following consultation with the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform. We have not seen the amendment, which means I am talking in the dark. That <Col N="1255" />is not a satisfactory position, but I will proceed. Approximately 90% of prisoners and many prison officers smoke. If we determine that people's homes will be exempt from this ban, we must do it under both regulations or it will not make sense. I agree with the idea in principle and it is fair that prisons should fall into the same category.</P>

      <P>Psychiatric hospitals.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LizMcManus" hpid="Ms McManus Ms McManus">
      <NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>
      <P>However, if people have been living in a nursing home for a long time and do not have another home, will we tell them they cannot smoke there? Why should that person have fewer rights than a prisoner or psychiatric patient? The Mental Health Commission has recommended that there should not be an exemption for psychiatric hospitals, which I can understand &ndash; if somebody is mobile, he or she can make arrangements to smoke outdoors. However, what about a bedridden person? I was talking to a nurse in a nursing home the other day who was wondering how she would cope. She has an elderly patient, a smoker, who is bedridden and suffers from Alzheimer's disease. How can she explain to this woman that she is barred from smoking and will have to give up at this stage in her life? That is a real predicament. Not only will the lady with Alzheimer's disease be penalised but the nursing home owner could also end up in jail or be fined. I cannot remember the amount of the fine but the nurse knew.</P>
      <P>One can say this is all nit-picking and these things will not happen but if these provisions are to be made in the secondary legislation, we must consider whether they are justified. Anything could happen &ndash; funny things happen in this world. Many will take a case &ndash; good luck to them. I spoke to another woman who works in a drug treatment centre. She has enough difficulty stopping lads shooting up in the toilets. How will she stop them smoking? In this case the lads can always go outside but elderly people with mobility difficulties will be a problem.</P>
      <P>If we were making no exceptions for anybody, that would be fine but once we start making allowances for prisons we must ask whether, for example, a nursing home is also a dwelling. Perhaps there is no answer to this &ndash; in that case I would still support the ban. However, these matters should be taken into consideration. As I do not have the amendment in front of me, I do not know whether the Minister is doing this the right way. Mistakes have been made along the way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I pay tribute to the members of Fine Gael, Deputy Gay Mitchell and former Deputy Alan Shatter, who did pioneering work in this area. Had they not done this, the Minister would have had less support in his work. It is interesting to see how quickly attitudes are shifting on these issues. When we started to work on the issue of smoking at the Joint Committee on Health and Children, attitudes were significantly different. <Col N="1256" />There is still a long way to go but it is interesting to see the shift in attitudes. Cross-party support for this measure is very important. It would not be viable otherwise.</P>
    <P>It is our job, as legislators, to ensure any regulation coming into force works. There are two sets of regulations, each of which contradicts the other in certain respects. We have not seen the proposed changes to the regulations but are being asked to comment on them. This is not very satisfactory. I would like to know exactly what the amendments are and when they were forwarded to the European Union. Are there any further contradictions between the two sets of regulations in the matter of what constitutes a dwelling? This is still an issue because dwellings are covered by the Health and Safety Authority.</P>
    <P>What about implementation? Health and safety officers will be dealing with one area while environmental health officers deal with the hospitality industry. This will probably create problems. As it is, health and safety officers cannot deal with problems, including those on building sites, because they are so overloaded. I have made complaints to the authority about serious problems on building sites and it has done its best but it is under pressure. This is of crucial importance for implementation.</P>
    <P>Six months is too soon in which to have a review. These changes will not happen overnight or in six months &ndash; there will be difficulties. Cultural change and good management will be required. Insurance companies have a part to play. If a pub owner is told by an insurance company that it will have to apply the regulations, that will be the end of it. Publicans are not justified in threatening to carry out actions contrary to the law on an issue of public health such as this.</P>

It is a sensible measure, one of which we can be immensely proud. I say &ldquo;we&rdquo; because the Opposition has been most supportive. The Minister needs to look to his backbenchers and even some of those within the ranks of Government to find those who have not offered their support.</P>

If we can be seen to be leading the way, it will only be a matter of time before this measure is introduced throughout the Union. I hope this is done.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="1257" />There are some possible problems with enforcement which I will mention. I have no doubt, however, that this is a very popular measure. I know this anecdotally and from the polls. If there had been a vote in this House, only a daft backbencher or member of the Government would have opposed it. He or she would find out very quickly that while people may quibble, as they always do, they support the measure. Even smokers support it and they are the ones addicted.</P>

However, I know from my own experience of working in pubs from the age of 12 years just how unpleasant and unhealthy that environment can be. The ban will immeasurably improve the quality of life for bar workers. They will no longer have to wash their clothes because of the stink. It can be a very unpleasant lifestyle for them. So many of us who have been against smoking for years and have been called cranks have now come into our own. People have seen the light at long last.</P>

      <P>I would like to congratulate a number of people, in particular Dr. Luke Clancy, with whom I worked for many years on the smog issue. Now that the Minister has tackled the problem of smoke he needs to tackle the issue of air quality in this city because, as he is probably aware, three times more people die as a consequence of exhaust fumes than in car accidents. I am talking about PM10s, benzine, volatile organic compounds, air pollution in this city which is killing people. The Minister needs to tackle that problem. It is the logical step forward. He also needs to examine the amount of traffic in our city and the way it is affecting people.</P>
      <P>If we leave enforceability to environmental health officers we will have a problem. We need to see how it will be done. When people start to smoke on buses it is usually when they have taken a few drinks. Now we are dealing with a pub situation where they may have taken too much drink and they smoke. Will the publicans call the Garda? Whom will they call at that stage? These are teething problems which can be sorted out but I have no doubt this initiative will be a great success and I congratulate the Minister once again.</P>

      <P>It is ludicrous that we are having these statements at such a late stage when the ministerial order has already been signed. This cannot, in all truth, be called a debate. The debate has been going on for months and we are addressing it at the 11th hour. Once again, the relevance of this Dáil has been undermined on a very important issue.</P>
      <P>That said, on behalf of Sinn Féin, I wholeheartedly endorse the Government's decision to introduce a ban on tobacco smoke in the workplace. Most of the debate has focused on the effect of this ban on pubs, restaurants and hotels but it must not be forgotten that it applies to all workplaces. That is a positive and important advance for workers in terms of the conditions in which they labour and in terms of public health generally. No one can credibly deny the damage to health from passive smoking. No one should be subjected to passive smoking against their will, least of all in the place where they have to spend their working hours and earn their livelihood.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Opponents of this ban have argued that it is not enforceable. Undoubtedly, there will be difficulties. However, smoking is already banned in many public places. It does not require gardaí to police the smoking ban in cinemas, on public <Col N="1259" />transport or in hospitals. There are occasional infringements but stringent policing is not necessary.</P>
    <P>The ban's extension to the hospitality sector will present a new set of challenges. I believe the vast majority of smokers as well as non-smokers broadly welcome this ban. I hope these new regulations will speed up existing social trends, and there is no doubt that the clear and welcome social trend is against smoking as health education and awareness increases. Many smokers are glad of any assistance to help them reduce or eliminate their consumption of tobacco. Many non-smokers cannot tolerate the discomfort and health risk of passive smoking.</P>
    <P>I welcome the fact that the Minister for Health and Children has said he will address the ban for non-employees in places of detention but note that he did not refer to residential care facilities. This concerns the definition of &ldquo;home&rdquo; and &ldquo;workplace&rdquo;. A cell is a prisoner's temporary home. A residential institution or a care facility for the elderly is also a home and I urge the Minister to revisit that area. This needs to be recognised and an accommodation worked out so that the same right to smoke in the home applies to these citizens as to all others with due regard for all those who work in such locations.</P>
    <P>When we in Sinn Féin examined and debated this issue we agreed that we would be prepared to consider a sustainable case for specially designed smoking lounges or rooms in licensed premises and hotels where strictly monitored extraction systems would be an absolute requirement. I understand the concern of many people in the licensed trade, especially in the Border area I represent. There is genuine concern that their businesses could be seriously affected by the ban given that it does not apply in the neighbouring Six Counties. There will be effects on trade, especially in the Border area. As there appears to be no willingness on the part of the Minister and Government to reach an accommodation with the hospitality industry, I am obliged to make a judgment on the proposals in the round. That said, I trust and believe that the health, social and economic benefits of the smoking ban will become clear in the medium term and trust too that any fall-off in custom will be short-lived.</P>
    <P>In the final analysis, this is an issue of both general public health and the rights and health of workers but it is not a panacea, and the Minister would be the first to acknowledge that. We need to see continuing measures to discourage smoking, especially among young people, and we need to address the worrying trend whereby young women have clearly a high level of nicotine addiction.

      <P>The legislation is about banning smoking in the workplace. That could be a hotel, hospital, school, factory, laboratory or any enclosed space that can be described as a work<Col N="1260" />place. The primary purpose of this legislation is to protect workers so that they can go about their daily routine without inhaling second-hand tobacco smoke.</P>
      <P>Many people think about this legislation only in terms of smoking in pubs, yet I would ask some of those who wish to allow smoking in pubs how they would feel if their wife, husband, grand-daughter, grandson, son or daughter was working in that pub? Would they be happy if, for eight hours a day, five days a week, they had to inhale somebody else's tobacco smoke even if they did not want to or did not care? Would they still be happy that the inhalation of what is recognised by the World Health Organisation as a known human carcinogen was putting those closest to them in danger of contracting heart disease, lung disease or emphysema? Sometimes we can accept standards for ourselves but perhaps the real question is whether we would accept those standards for people who are close to us.</P>
      <P>According to the information contained in the report, The Health Effects of Environmental Tobacco Smoke in the Workplace, published by the Health and Safety Authority, environmental tobacco smoke in the workplace increases the risk of lung cancer among non-smokers by between 20% and 30% and heart disease by between 25% and 35%. Are those acceptable risks? Our answer has to be &ldquo;No&rdquo;. This is a health issue, first for workers and, second, for customers, but we must remember that customers or consumers have a choice when workers do not. I am not dismissing the concerns of those in the hospitality industry, or indeed any business which considers that this smoking ban will pose a problem. I am not saying it does not matter because we all have to deal with the reality of the situation but this is, first and last, a health issue for workers and customers.</P>
      <P>Nobody has mentioned it in the debate up to now but employers have to be concerned about the threat of future litigation. Given that environmental tobacco smoke is recognised as a human carcinogen, any employer who knowingly exposes employees to this risk is likely to be sued. It is as simple as that, and we all know it. However, the implementation of this legislation should not impose impossible responsibilities on employers, and in that regard I agree with Deputy Olivia Mitchell. If the law states we must wear a seat belt and as an adult I do not wear one, then I am personally responsible. If the law states we cannot live on the streets or throw our rubbish at the bottle bank and I do so, as an adult I am personally responsible. Equally, if the law states I cannot smoke in the workplace and I do, then I am personally responsible. It does not make any sense and it makes an ass of the law if somebody cannot, or is unable to, influence my actions and is responsible for my wilful, considered and determined illegal behaviour. I ask the Minister to take that into consideration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Sympathetic consideration should be given where the home and the workplace are the same, <Col N="1261" />such as residential care facilities, psychiatric hospitals, hospices, etc. I hope the Minister will take that into consideration.</P>

      <P>I would like to present a different view on the proposed ban on smoking. It will not be fashionable and trendy. I would also like to challenge much of the information on the issue. I am against the regulations and I am in favour of the compromise solution. We all respect the rights of non-smokers and workers but there is a solution &ndash; designated smoking areas in all hotels and pubs. There is an element of the nanny state and the health police coming into this debate and sometimes I believe Ministers and their advisers are losing the run of themselves. This is a wake-up call for all genuine civil libertarians.</P>
      <P>Let us look closely at the facts and then decide. We all know smoking, like drinking or eating too much, is bad for one's health. However, the figure of 7,000 deaths in Ireland each year is widely quoted as being attributed to tobacco-related illnesses. There is no scientific foundation for such a statement. We have, however, been fed with it so often that we have begun to believe it. This figure relates to the total number of deaths from cancers in Ireland. The national cancer registry gives a figure of 7,500 cancer deaths occurring each year. The commonest cancers are those of skin, large bowel, lung, breast, in the case of women, and prostate, in the case of men. It does not indicate, in any way, that these are due to smoking. This is simple misinformation.</P>

      <P>From what did he die?</P>
      <P>We should look at the facts and that is why my approach to this debate is warped. Deputy Gormley, other Members and I, spent four years looking at the facts. We should look at the facts presented by consultants, the tobacco industry and people who were wheeled in in wheelchairs with oxygen masks attached, one of whom I asked if her concern was that she had started smoking. The woman replied that her concern was that she had four children, two of whom smoked even though they had seen what it had done to her. She was worried about her children and not herself.</P>
      <P>Members of the health committee who smoked gave up smoking because they heard and saw what we did and met the people on shows like Joe Duffy's. We met the governor general of Florida who had won a settlement from the tobacco industry. We went to Florida, met the people, got the facts and listened to the experts, although we may have been condemned for junketing. We also went to Canada and to Washington where we listened to the politicians there. The facts everywhere were the same, namely, that we cannot ignore this issue and do what the tobacco industry did in the 1960s whereby it commissioned a report to try to prove its product was safe but found the answer to the question it set out to prove did not match and then buried the evidence. Somebody else brought that evidence into the public domain.</P>
      <P>We must stand up and say this is a health issue for those who can do something about it, like the people who have given up smoking. I congratulate Deputy Olivia Mitchell on doing so because it is not easy to overcome the addiction. We met people who were addicted and who had tried everything to give up smoking but could not do so. We have a choice either to act or to be litigated against. Even the vintners must realise that. They have said that is unlikely to happen but I would say otherwise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1263" />I would like to see the 70:30 option or the ventilation compromise work. &ldquo;Compromise&rdquo; is a wonderful word to use. It is easy to say one wants compromise or the interim solution. All politicians want the solution which will please everybody. However, in this case, there is not a compromise or a 70:30 option because one cannot confine smoke to one side of a room because it will spread. A small pub in my home town, for example, with only one room cannot divide it and have what has been described on the airwaves as a telephone kiosk to which the smoke can be confined.</P>
    <P>What we have is equality. Whether people like it or not, they are in the same boat regardless of whether they have a small or a large pub. I am not saying these regulations will be easy to implement or that they will not cause hardships because people who are addicted to cigarettes will have a problem. Approximately 70% of people do not smoke and approximately 70% of the 30% who do want to give up and many of them have said on the airwaves that they hope this is the mechanism which will help them to do so. When I was teaching and I went into the staff room, I had to have a mug of coffee. If I had been a smoker, I would have had a cigarette. If people go for a pint and are not allowed to have a cigarette, maybe it will help them to give up smoking. This is not only a pub issue; it is a workplace issue.</P>
    <P>When the health committee conducted its research it found that it took 12 people per day to start smoking to replace the 12 people per day who died from smoking-related illnesses in Ireland. Sitting in a room with environmental tobacco smoke is more dangerous than sitting in a room with asbestos. Few of us would sit in a room with asbestos. That must be said repeatedly because I heard it on the radio the other day as if it was new information. We have heard it so many times that we take it that everybody understands it, but they do not.</P>
    <P>As Deputy Finian McGrath said, some people believe there are no medical facts to indicate that smoking is causing health problems and that plenty of revenue is coming in. We met the consultants who would rather that the money going into the health service did not have to go in for smoking-related illnesses. They were able to give us the costings of what they saw as the cost of smoking-related illness. They did not come from a politician but from the consultants.</P>
    <P>A good health scare helps people to give up smoking. My father smoked a pipe but he was always told it was nothing compared to a cigarette. He coughed at a council meeting on one occasion and Dr. Delap turned to him and asked if he coughed first thing in the morning. He said he did and Dr. Delap said it was time he gave up. He said if the price of tobacco increased to £1 in the budget, he would give up. It increased to £1.01 and he was grumpy as hell for three months, but he gave up. A good health scare can work.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1264" />I would like to see musicians performing in pubs and other workers protected. I mention musicians because I come from a musical background. There may be a cost implication in Border areas but I hope people cross to our side of the Border because we have good hotels and a pleasant environment, and the exchange rate between sterling and the euro gives them good value. I do not believe there are more smokers in Northern Ireland than here so a number of non-smokers will be happy to come to our pubs, clubs and hotels.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to listen to the needs of specific cases. People should be listened to and reasonable issues should be addressed. However, phased implementation of the measure would not work. European experts have not been able to say how it would work. During Ireland's Presidency of the EU we should encourage other member states to expedite their moves to follow our example.</P>
    <P>I spoke to a Scottish colleague at the recent meeting of the British-Irish Interparliamentary Body who told me that the Scottish Parliament is currently debating a private members' motion on this issue. Our Scottish colleagues were impressed that we plan to go the full distance. I believe Norway will join us in six months' time.</P>
    <P>When I was a teacher in England I worked with colleagues who smoked 40 cigarettes a day and found it impossible to give up smoking. In my last year there, the school obliged staff to smoke in a small cubby hole. When I returned for a visit five years later I met an old colleague who had been one of the heaviest smokers in the school. I did not recognise him because he did not have a cigarette in his hand. He told me he had got fed up smoking in a pokey wee place with a smell of smoke and an unpleasant atmosphere. Because it was too cold to go outside he had given up smoking. This man had always insisted that he could never give up smoking.</P>
    <P>There must be unity of approach. I am disappointed in the North-Western Health Board. The chairman of the health board joined board members in advocating a move by the Minister on this issue. The motion was twice passed by the board between January and June of this year. However, when the chairman left office he became a vintner once again and is not now in favour of a total ban. He wishes to see it phased in. We cannot sit on both sides of the fence.</P>
    <P>We must provide maximum access to replacement therapies and treatments, even if this means providing them in public houses. A person who gets the urge to smoke a cigarette while attending a wedding or a celebration should be able to buy a nicotine patch or gum immediately. If they cannot do so they are faced with a greater difficulty.</P>
    <P>I congratulate Dr. Luke Clancy and those who have been involved in this issue.</P>

      <P>The cleverness of the tob<Col N="1265" />acco industry's marketing is unbelievable. In the United States one can send away a number of empty Camel cigarette packets and get a pair of flipflops in return. A camel is stamped on the sole of the flipflops so that when one walks across the beach one leaves the cigarette logo stamped in the sand. This is just one example of the industry's very clever marketing.</P>
      <P>What happened the Marlboro man? One of the conditions of the large financial settlement in Florida was that $70 million would be spent on anti-tobacco advertising. Very effective peer advertising was used. One of the advertising campaigns showed two young people driving a lorry to the Marlboro plant and asking to see the Marlboro man. The security man said they could not see the Marlboro man. Subsequent advertisements in the campaign showed the two young people asking repeatedly to see the Marlboro man, to be told, eventually, that the Marlboro man is dead. They then ask what did the Marlboro man die of. The final advertisement of the campaign shows the two young people sitting in the lorry and asking, &ldquo;Do you know what the Marlboro man died of?&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Product placement is being used by the tobacco industry. It is sad that girls are taking up smoking to lose weight. They may lose weight but they will do so for the wrong reasons and they will face heart attacks, lung disease, strokes, amputations, low weight babies, asthma and all the other health issues which we meet in our constituency clinics and which cause problems to the health services.</P>
      <P>I congratulate the Minister on this brave move. The implementation of this measure will not be easy but this time next year we will see a different attitude and enjoy a different atmosphere in pubs. That will be a positive development for everybody.</P>

      <P>I have met many medical card holders who do not have the luxury of availing of these therapies. This area should be revisited &ndash; perhaps it can be done in the area of taxation in the budget. While I know these measures will help stop smoking, there is also a need for assistance. My colleague, Deputy Olivia Mitchell, knows this all too well as eight months ago she gave up smoking 60 cigarettes a day.</P>

      <P>I thank Deputy Neville for sharing his time. I unequivocally support the general thrust of the Tobacco Smoking (Prohibition) Regulations 2003.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="IvorCallely" hpid="Mr. Callely Mr. Callely">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TonyGregory" hpid="Mr. Gregory Mr. Gregory">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gregory</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister of State said diversity was beneficial to his party and I am sure it is beneficial to the Independents as well. I strongly believe these regulations are in the best interests of the health of our people. As one who has campaigned against drug pushing, I have always <Col N="1268" />emphasised that my focus was on heroin simply because there had been a plague of heroin addiction among young teenagers in my north inner city Dublin constituency. Even in that context, when I acted as rapporteur for the Joint Committee on European Affairs in 1998-99 and published a report on the drugs problem, I made a point of emphasising in the opening paragraphs of the report:</P>
      <P>It is important to restate here that the damage done by tobacco . . .  is far greater than any other drug, legal or illegal. The more one smokes, the more likely one is to suffer from heart disease, blood clots, lung infections, strokes, bronchitis, bad circulation, ulcers and cancer of the mouth and lungs . . .  It is now well established that the population is at risk from the effects of passive smoking ranging from respiratory irritations, infections and asthma . . .  through to cancer.</P>
      <P>I insisted on this emphasis as I felt it was nonsense to produce a report on addictive substances while at the same time ignoring the most addictive of all, namely, nicotine.</P>
      <P>At that time European surveys showed that young school children, especially in Ireland and most particularly among school girls, were increasingly becoming addicted to tobacco. What astonished me was that when the full committee discussed a report that dealt with highly controversial aspects of the drug problem, for example the Swiss experiment involving the medical prescribing of heroin to acutely addicted persons, the only element that provoked heated debate was that I had included tobacco in the same context as illegal drugs. To state that tobacco was part of the drugs problem was, for some Members, simply not acceptable and the report had to be changed to reflect this.</P>
      <P>There is no doubt that in the four years that have elapsed since, there is now a far greater awareness, for most of us at least, that nicotine is the deadliest of all drugs, not just for those who are addicted to it, but also for the victims of passive smoking. This is even more the case among the more vulnerable lower socio-economic groups.</P>
      <P>I now turn to the current difficulties with the licensed vintners. I do not accept these regulations will even remotely confirm the fears they have outlined. Smokers will become accustomed to the change in circumstances. While I do not wish to antagonise or draw the ire of decent licensed vintners, the televised sequences from their recent meeting in Portlaoise did not help their cause. What I saw on television depicted them as a bunch of self-interested, greedy, bully-boys, some of whom thought they were running the country, reminiscent of an equally arrogant bunch of taxi men who reacted in much the same manner when their monopoly was threatened some years ago.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Regardless of the power of vested interests, the message must go out &ndash; I acknowledge that it is <Col N="1269" />going out from the current Minister for Health and Children &ndash; that these regulations are essential to public health for all of us, both now and in the future.

      <NameTxt>Mr. C. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a pleasure to speak on this measure. What the Minister, Deputy Martin, has put forward is a decisive move in favour of health and against smoking. I am a smoker and know how this addiction works. I called for this measure to be introduced in an article I wrote for a Sunday newspaper four years ago.</P>
      <P>The Minister has been courageous in the same manner in which Deputy Harney showed great courage in banning bituminous coal in Dublin. That measure caused huge problems with the vested interests involved, namely, the coalmen. They got up in arms and felt their entire lifestyle and way of working would be ruined by this measure. There is also a similarity between this measure and that taken by the Minister, Deputy Michael Smith, on the blood alcohol limit. At that time, we heard publicans and other vested interest groups making all forms of dire predictions about the consequences of a lower blood alcohol limit for driving, but none of those dire prophecies of doom was fulfilled. In both urban and rural areas most people came to terms with the new limit.</P>
      <P>I suspect this will also be the case regarding the smoking ban. The public will quickly acclimatise to this new measure. I do not believe there will be a problem of enforcement as most people now accept that smoking is not acceptable in public places where it affects other people. We needed legislation to confirm this opinion that already exists. Even before the Minister took this measure, it was clear that there was strong support for it, evidenced by opinion polls. Those figures diminished when the infamous, unholy so-called hospitality alliance got its act together and started lobbying and scaremongering to an extent.</P>

      <P>Recent opinion polls seem to indicate huge public support for this measure. I am struck by the support of a huge silent majority. If one were to listen to various radio programmes, including the Joe Duffy programme, one would get the impression on this issue and even of our profession of politics&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="ConorLenihan" hpid="Mr. C. Lenihan Mr. C. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. C. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;that everybody is negative about politicians and about the ban. In my experience, both regarding our profession and the smoking ban, I have found the opposite is the case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A huge silent majority wants this measure <Col N="1270" />introduced and do not want it phased in. They want decisive action in the same vein as that adopted by the Ministers, Deputy Michael Smith and Deputy Harney. There were direct consequences for people's health as a result of the ban on bituminous coal introduced by the Minister, Deputy Harney. I suspect Department of Health and Children figures will quickly show the beneficial effects of introducing this ban.</P>
    <P>Some startling figures and statistics have been quoted during this rather noisy debate. One figure that stuck me forcibly was that 7,000 people die every year from smoking and smoking-related illnesses &ndash; that is the equivalent of the town of Thurles being wiped out. It is also twice the number of people killed in the 30 years of struggle in the North of Ireland. That 7,000 people die annually is a sobering statistic and one that must be kept to the forefront of our minds.</P>
    <P>I worked in a newsroom when the ban on smoking in offices was introduced. At the time, journalists were renowned for dangling cigarettes from their mouths while writing articles. The newsroom was almost synonymous with smoking, yet when it was banned there were no dire consequences and no frustration or edginess in the office. However, it had a beneficial effect on the office and its atmosphere. People did not leave with a horrible smell of cigarette smoke on their clothing.</P>
    <P>The Minister's motivation principally revolves around the safety of bar workers who have welcomed this measure. While bar owners in my constituency are annoyed about the measure, bar staff are absolutely delighted. I visited one of my local public houses recently and the owner disappeared from the premises having given me a strong lecture about the smoking ban. His head barman approached me immediately afterwards and apologised while also thanking me because the ban was being introduced. In addition, a drink was put on the counter.</P>

      <P>I have never been the subject of so many offers of a free pint from bar staff in my constituency as a result of the stance taken by the Minister and me on the ban. It was invidious of a number of publicans to petition their staff to protest against it. A great many of them, because they are vulnerable in such employment given the ease with which bar staff can be replaced, signed the petition, even though they did not believe in it. However, they felt obliged to sign to please their bosses. The reality is different. Most bar staff and their trade unions strongly favour the ban.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Ireland has been to the fore in regard to anti-tobacco legislation. Mr. Haughey, in particular, led the way in this regard during his wilderness <Col N="1271" />period in the Department of Health and Children. As he awaited his assumption to the leadership of Fianna Fáil, he took the brave move to outlaw tobacco advertising on television. Many dire predictions were made about the consequences of this move for televised sport with a number of people suggesting that sponsorship and televised sport would be at an end because cigarette companies would be prevented from sponsoring sports events. That did not come to pass and the ban was copied by almost every other European country. It is possible for the Government to lead the way on legislation in Europe as has been done in regard to tobacco. The measures introduced by Mr. Haughey with those introduced by Deputy O'Hanlon during his time in office were copied almost in their entirety in European directives.</P>
    <P>The Minister's brave move to introduce a smoking ban will be copied in other European countries. The former Labour Party member in Britain, Ken Livingstone, with whom I worked, is conducting an on-line poll in London to ascertain whether a similar measure could be introduced there. The rest of the world is looking on keenly at the leadership the Government is showing on this issue.</P>
    <P>I worked in Westminster as a journalist in the 1980s when Mrs. Thatcher was in power. Every time a health Minister in the jurisdiction proposed a curtailment of the cigarette industry, a series of articles was promptly printed in publications such as <i>The Spectator</i> and <i>The Daily Telegraph</i> commenting on the nanny state and how terribly intrusive it was of the state to proselytize against smoking. Auberon Waugh was a great character who wrote in this vein. He depicted a nanny state that was intrusive and prevented people from exercising fundamental liberties.</P>
    <P>Nothing could be further from the truth. The Government is not promoting a nanny state. The allegation has been made in regard to a range of measures but it is not the case. Those who make this suggestion are mischievous and their position is contradictory because the Government is alleged to be too right wing while introducing the nanny state at the same time.</P>
    <P>During a debate on radio yesterday it was pointed out that nicotine is six to eight times more addictive that heroin or cocaine. That is frightening and I hope the Minister will go further in terms of encouraging people who want to break the habit.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EmmetStagg" hpid="Mr. Stagg Mr. Stagg">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Stagg</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Durkan for sharing time. The Labour Party supports the proposals contained in the tobacco regulations. A decision by the House today would have demonstrated its will on the matter and, as Labour Party Whip, I would not only have voted in favour of the measure but would have ensured my colleagues did so also. We are again forced into conducting a sanitised Thursday debate to avoid a decision of the House. Government members and back<Col N="1272" />benchers, in turn, are allowed to talk out of both sides of their mouths at the same time and sneak off to their offices and constituencies while the matter is debated.</P>
      <P>All publicans are not opposed to the ban. I walk to my local pub in Straffan, County Kildare, because of the drink driving regulations. The landlady, Teresa McNeill, is looking forward to introducing and enforcing the ban as fully as possible.</P>
      <P>Nicotine is a highly addictive substance and there is no doubt the ban will causes difficulties for addicts. However, if it protects the health of bar staff, the discomforts of addicts will not measure up. It is hoped the ban will encourage those addicted to nicotine to stop smoking. The various alternatives to smoking are expensive. Will the Minister consider including the various nicotine substitutes under the drug refund or medical card schemes? They cost up to &euro;10 a day and the savings to the taxpayer in the long run would be significant. It would, therefore, be a good investment.</P>
      <P>I acknowledge the difficulties in implementing the regulations and quantifying the results. However, on a related issue, radon gas is measured and quantified and absolute prevention of lung cancer is achieved. I wrote to the Minister recently about this matter and received an acknowledgement. The letter stated:</P>
      <P Just="Right">24th October 2003</P>
      <P>Dear Minister,</P>
      <P>You will be aware of the National Survey of the incidence of Radon Gas carried out by the Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland. This demonstrated a high incidence of the carcinogenic gas nationally but particularly in Counties Carlow, Kilkenny, Waterford, Wexford, Wicklow, Clare, Galway, Mayo and Sligo with other smaller hot spots throughout the Country.</P>
      <P>It is estimated that 91,000 homes built prior to 1998 are exposed to levels of the gas that are in excess of the safe limit of 200 Bq/M³ and according to the published figures of the Department of the Environment this Class A carcinogen accounts for 10-15% of all lung cancer deaths in Ireland. That is 150-200 deaths per year that are entirely preventable. These figures are supported by the World Health Organisation. This unnecessary death toll is also greater than the estimated deaths from lung cancer in those exposed to passive smoking.</P>
      <P>I recently raised this issue with your colleague, Mr. Martin Cullen T.D., Minister for Environment and Local Government, who has responsibility in the area. In short, he told me that he had no money to deal with the issue (budgetary constraints) and that people should open the windows in their homes to let the gas out. It does not work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the context of your recently announced programme for Radiotherapy and Oncology, I would urge that you examine the benefits of a <Col N="1273" />remedial scheme for homes polluted with this Class A carcinogen (radon gas). Testing and remediation are both simple and relatively inexpensive and cost wise fades into insignificance when compared with the cost of treating a lung cancer patient over a period as long as five years.</P>
    <P>This simple preventative measure would also free up at least 10% of the treatment capacity of the Radiotherapy and Oncology units and allow for improved facilities for the remaining patients.</P>
    <P>Over a five-year period, the programme could be completed and it should be encouraged by an education programme and a remedial grant scheme.</P>
    <P>I am convinced that neither Minister Cullen, who opposed your passive smoking regulations, or his Department are neither willing nor have the necessary ethos to deal with this, which is essentially a health issue.</P>
    <P>I would urge that you, as the Minister responsible for the health of our citizens, take this matter into your area of responsibility so that it can be effectively tackled. We cannot ignore 1,000 unnecessary and preventable deaths every five years. Please examine this matter seriously and advise me of your decision.</P>
    <P>The Minister has acknowledged my letter. I ask the Minister to deal with this issue in his response. There will be no controversy or protest. This is guaranteed to prevent up to 1,000 lung cancer deaths in five years.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan" hpid="Mr. Durkan Mr. Durkan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank my colleague for sharing time with me. I admit that I am one of the culprits in this case. I am a smoker. I do my best to curtail my smoking. I do not smoke in the workplace, or in the morning, or at meals. I am not perfect. I smoke in the evening and I enjoy a smoke. There is no doubt about that.</P>
      <P>All the people I meet, including the customers I meet in my usual rounds of the pubs, are very concerned about the effect the ban will have on them. I hope it does not result in driving young people out of business premises and onto the streets. I fully accept that smoking is bad for people. Maurice Neligan recently pointed out that smoking is definitely not good for one. Excess drinking is not good for one either. It is morally correct that one should do something about it. We will see.</P>
      <P>I would like to see the Minister progress the argument a little further. Maurice Neligan said &ndash; I hope I am not misquoting him &ndash; that it was a great smokescreen to divert attention away from all the other things that the Ministers in their Departments were not attending to. Examples include long hospital waiting lists, the lack of proper orthodontic treatment for children, and the morality or otherwise of the 100,000 people who do not have a home to go to in this country. What is moral about that? What is moral about people sleeping rough on the streets of this city?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1274" />I ask the Minister and the Minister of State to outline when we will see the same resolution and the same reaction to those injustices, because they are injustices. They affect people's health. There are people currently sleeping rough in Dublin whose health is not being improved and is being seriously threatened by their living conditions. That is happening not only in this city but in every other city, town and village throughout the country. I would hope that the Minister, the Minister of State and their colleagues would address the issue of children attending school in prefabricated buildings and in some situations going through their entire educational life in such conditions.</P>
    <P>At what stage will we see a positive reaction coming from the Government benches to address that particular issue? When will we see a positive reaction from the Government benches to the current serious issue of crime, or a resolution to address the issues that arose in the last few days, which involved witnesses being openly intimidated at railway stations? Nothing seems to be done about it. Why is it that Departments cannot address their core responsibilities and do something about them?</P>
    <P>I have no hesitation in supporting the proposal to phase out smoking. I merely ask the questions of the Minister and Minister of State. I ask them to address the very important questions relating to their own Department and their own responsibilities for health in general. I am sick to my teeth of listening to the tirade from those on the Government side about the amount of money they are currently spending on a particular service, as if they were the people who invented it. It is their responsibility. The fact that they are spending money in a particular area or category and failing to solve the problem is a reflection on them. To come regularly into the House and say that so much is being spent by them and that they are doing their best is not an excuse. Their best is not good enough. They should call on someone else to take over.</P>

In Deputy Keaveney's brilliant presentation she gave an excellent illustration of the work done by the members of the Oireachtas sub-committee in arriving at the conclusions which the reports by Deputies Shatter and Mitchell reached, in terms of recommending to the Minister at that time that environmental tobacco smoke should be prohibited.</P>

The Act states that any person who contravenes a provision or regulation made under the section shall be guilty of an <Col N="1277" />offence. Subsection (4) notes that regarding a specified place, the occupier, manager and any other person being in charge shall be guilty of an offence. It then refers to proceedings for defence, in that it shall be a defence for the person against whom such proceedings were brought to show that he or she made all reasonable efforts to ensure compliance with such provisions.

    <Speaker pid="DenisNaughten" hpid="Mr. Naughten Mr. Naughten">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Naughten</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to resume my contribution on this matter. The point I was making when we adjourned the debate two weeks ago related to the turf war between the Departments of Health and Children and Education and Science and the buck passing taking place in that regard. I also referred to buck passing within the health boards. My constituency lies between two health board areas, the Midland Health Board and the Western Health Board. It has come to my attention that four disabled pupils in a special school in my constituency and living in the Western Health Board area receive no speech therapy service because the Midland Health Board provides the speech therapist at the school. Every pupil in attendance at that school and living in the Midland Health Board catchment area is in receipt of speech therapy but the four children from the Western Health Board catchment area are denied access to it. That type <Col N="1278" />of situation, which is repeated throughout the country, is a typical example of what happens when we try to divide very little money among a number of disabled people.</P>
      <P>It is critical, therefore, that we have an integrated needs assessment system at cross-departmental and cross-sectoral level if we are to succeed in this area. There is no point introducing a needs assessment system for education and another for health. It is the responsibility of the Minister of State, Deputy Brian Lenihan, to ensure that happens and that we do not have persistent turf wars between the agencies under his brief. I urge him to ensure such an integrated system is put in place and enforced. There is no point telling a parent his or her child is entitled to A, B or C if there is no mechanism for enforcement. We cannot have the health boards and school authorities saying they do not have the resources to implement the system. We must ensure the legislation is enforced. If not, we are wasting our breath and the system will continue to break down.</P>
      <P>Therapy services in general are in a disgraceful state, be it speech, occupational or physical therapy. There are long delays for even the most basic assessment. The lack of speech therapy for children with disabilities is nothing short of a disgrace. I recently met the mother of a child with Down's syndrome. That child had not received one hour of speech therapy during his nine years in the education system as a result of a lack of funding in this area and the petty bickering between the Departments of Health and Children and Education and Science. There is no co-ordination or co-operation between these Departments on services for the mentally handicapped. How can we pontificate about integration when children are not given the opportunity to communicate properly. This is disgraceful.</P>
      <P>The physical and sensory disability database is not even up and running in some parts of the country. We do not know the scale of the problem to be addressed. This matter raises its head every year when bodies are pitted against each other for day-to-day funding. The Government is good at pitting the physical disability sector against the intellectual disability sector. One sector is consistently pitted against the other. Organisations in the health and education sectors are fighting for limited amounts of resources. It is the children who are losing out and the Government is getting away scot-free.</P>
      <P>Under section 9, a parent no longer has a choice on where the child goes to school. That is contradictory in terms of the Constitution and current legislation dealing with children. The Commission on the Status of People with Disabilities in its submission, stated:</P>
      <P>People with disabilities do not want to be pitied nor do they want their disabilities to be dismissed as of little importance. All they require is a little respect and basic needs and rights. Surely this is not too much to ask.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1279" />I do not believe it is a lot to ask. I hope there will be significant amendment of this legislation before it is passed.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DennisODonovan" hpid="Mr. O'Donovan Mr. O'Donovan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donovan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this timely and forward-thinking Bill and congratulate the Minister and his Department on introducing it. Focus on disability has never been so acute or accentuated in this Year of the Disabled.</P>
      <P>Educational disability, intellectual or physical, has been neglected for far too long. The Government is playing catch-up on an issue swept under the carpet for decades. The debate on disability began to emerge in the late 1970s and early 1980s. Great credit is due to the voluntary groups which were the first to hone in on the disabled and those with special needs. To this day, facts continue to emerge. CoAction West Cork, once a voluntary group, is doing excellent work with young people. It recently purchased property with a view to catering for ten clients. When the facility opened, another 16 people, who had been neglected and hidden away for many years, came out of the woodwork. The facility now caters for 26 people.</P>
      <P>Voluntary groups have done a great deal of work in the background. Often they get involved when it is too late. We need to acknowledge that fact. I laud those, be it COPE in Cork or the Brothers of Charity in Killarney, who do excellent work in this area. CoAction West Cork which deals with children and adults is of tremendous importance in that it deals with areas almost 100 miles from the major population centres such as Cork city. We must all acknowledge that the State neglected this area for decades. Successive Governments neglected it during the years. In the 1980s this debate took off but it was not until the 1990s that any Government really did anything about it.</P>
      <P>In fairness, credit is due to the last Fianna Fáil-led Government, since substantial progress has been made in the area over the last five or six years. I will quote a fact that I obtained through my research, which may originally have been quoted in the Minister's speech. Since 1998, the number of special resource teachers catering for children in ordinary schools has increased from 104 to more than 2,300, a phenomenal achievement in such a short space of time. At the same time, the number of full or part-time special needs assistants in the system has grown from fewer than 300 to almost 5,000. That is progress evident at first hand, particularly in some of the more remote parts of rural Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Having said that, there is still a long road to travel. It is like climbing a mountain. The State, in the shape of the Department and the Government, is moving up it through realising that there is a problem. However, the summit has not been reached, and there is a long way to go. I acknowledge this, whether through financial support, more Government action, or whatever. This legislation is timely &ndash; some might argue that is has come not before time. It opens windows of <Col N="1280" />opportunity to those who have suffered disadvantage. I have lauded voluntary groups, the Government and the State for eventually recognising these problems.</P>
    <P>The greatest single tribute that can be paid, which we must not forget and which is mentioned in the Bill, goes to the parents of the disabled, particularly young disabled people. The parent or parents must deal with this from the cradle to the grave. It is a lifelong service of dedication, not simply an eight or ten hour day, five days a week. It is a 24 hour service provided by the parent seven days a week, 52 weeks a year. In other words, the parent is involved 365 days a year. This should be recognised.</P>
    <P>The Bill says it deals with the education plan. The interpretation section says &ldquo;a child&rdquo; means a person not less than three years of age and not more than 18 years of age. Despite some criticism, this is a sensible provision, because one can never, either for the able or the disadvantaged, plan for someone indefinitely into the adult future. If the problem is tackled at the earlier stages, either at crèches or primary schools, much can be done. It was not tackled in the past, instead being neglected.</P>
    <P>Section 2 refers to an integrated education plan for the child while section 3 covers its preparation, whereby the onus is placed on the school principal to implement it. We must acknowledge the significant respect and status attaching to national schools, with the principal obliged under the Bill, first, to recognise the problem and then put the wheels of such an integrated plan into motion.</P>
    <P>According to section 3, when the principal of the school has taken the measures referred to, if in his or her opinion the student concerned is still not benefiting from the education programme provided, he or she, after consultation with the parents of the student, is to arrange for an assessment of the student to be carried out. That assessment, if currently in place, is not regular or right across the board but it is a crucial mainstay of the integrated education approach.</P>
    <P>The Bill goes on, in section 3 but particularly section 17, to refer to the setting up of the national council for special education. Once again, this is a huge step towards resolving the problems we have encountered during the decades. It must be lauded as an excellent way of tackling and monitoring the problems of children with disabilities.</P>
    <P>Section 4 goes on to say that, where the relevant health board is of the view or opinion that a child or student may have an educational disability, it is to cause an assessment of that child to be carried out. This is also critical, since one is starting off with the identification of the problem by the principal, the parent, or both in a combined effort. The principal puts the wheels in motion, and the assessment is dealt with by the council in a manner which it is important to recognise and laud.</P>
    <P>Section 5 is of some concern to me. It deals <Col N="1281" />with the mode of assessment under sections 3 and 4. It reads:</P>
    <P>5.&ndash;(1) An assessment under <i>section 3</i> or <i>4</i> shall be carried out with the assistance of persons possessing such expertise as&ndash;</P>
    <P>(<i>a</i>) the health board or the Council, or</P>
    <P>(<i>b</i>) in the case of an assessment under <i>section 3,</i> the principal, having had regard to any guidelines referred in <i>subsection (3)</i> of that section,</P>
    <P>considers appropriate; those persons may, in the discretion of the board, Council or principal, include one or more of the following:</P>
    <P>(i) a psychologist;</P>
    <P>(ii) a medical practitioner;</P>
    <P>(iii) the principal of the school which the child is attending or a teacher of that school nominated by the principal;</P>
    <P>(iv) an appropriately qualified social worker; and</P>
    <P>(v) a therapist who is suitably qualified to provide support services in respect of a child.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister will see this as constructive criticism. Going back to the whole cornerstone of the debate on the Bill, I fail to see the reason the parent or guardian is not included in the list. It strikes me as unusual, having regard to the prime, basic role of the parent or guardian in the process, that he or she is not included under section 5. I ask the Minister to dispel my doubts in that regard by giving sufficient reason the parent or guardian of the child is not encapsulated in the process.</P>
    <P>Another important aspect of the development of the special needs child is the laying down of an education plan as set out under section 8. This is an excellent approach. For far too long, going back probably less than a decade, someone with a learning difficulty was placed at the back of the class or in the corner and neglected. This legislation proposes that a special plan covering a wide range of needs and assessing the abilities, skills and talents of the child be put in place, I hope at a very early age. I certainly welcome this, as I hope others will. It looks at, &ldquo;the nature and degree of the child's educational disability and how that disability affects his or her educational progress&rdquo;. The plan will refer to his or her day-to-day life. It will examine the current performance of the child, as well as his or her special educational needs.</P>
    <P>Section 8(2)(<i>f</i>) refers to, &ldquo;the special education and related support services to be provided to the child to enable the child to effectively make the transition from primary school education to post-primary school education&rdquo;. This is a critical factor. My experience is that those people in my age group with learning disabilities or special educational needs struggled through primary school. When they had to progress to secondary <Col N="1282" />school, they got lost or were abandoned. This process is a very important factor in keeping such people in the education system until the age of 18. This is to be welcomed because, historically, persons with disabilities who received a primary school education &ndash; many such persons did not receive that level of education &ndash; did not go any further, other than in exceptional cases. This is very important.</P>
    <P>Section 9 of the Bill mentions the designation of schools to be attended by children with special educational needs. Deputy Naughten mentioned that every school should have this facility, but I am not sure if that is possible. If one examines those areas of rural Ireland, such as west Cork, where parishes are peripheral and spread out, one finds that national schools struggle to meet the quota of 25 or 30 pupils needed to survive. I welcome the fact that certain schools are to be designated, but it does not seem likely that every school can be designated. The demographics of rural Ireland should be taken into account. The special designated schools should be reasonably accessible to people in all parts of the country.</P>
    <P>The Bill also sets out the duties and responsibilities of the Minister for Health and Children in this regard. I am subject to correction, but I think this is the first time that such duties have been clearly set out in order to support the provisions of Article 42 of the Constitution. The Bill imposes a statutory duty on the Minister of the day to ensure that the regulations and the system are effectively controlled and monitored.</P>
    <P>I am Chairman of the All-Party Committee on the Constitution, which will embark in February 2004, if not sooner, on an examination of the constitutional rights of people with disabilities. This has never been done before and we have agreed to give it priority in the new year. The Taoiseach suggested to me some time ago that the committee could examine this area. We would have done so already were it not for the fact that we have been examining the issue of property rights. We will conclude our consideration of that matter early in the new year. I am looking forward to the challenge that will be presented by the assessment of the constitutional rights of people with disabilities.</P>
    <P>The Bill places the duties of schools in a statutory framework. My experience is that school principals have been to the forefront, over the last ten or 15 years, in recognising the difficulties faced by children with special problems. Together with parents, principals have pointed out the problems that such children face. They have brought the matter to the attention of those who can help. As far as I am aware, that duty has not been enshrined in statute in such clear and succinct terms until now.</P>
    <P>Section 14 of the Bill deals with planning for future educational needs, which is important. Although this Bill places an onus on the State to provide special education for children under the age of 18, I believe that the section relating to future planning goes beyond that. I think my <Col N="1283" />understanding of this matter is correct and I invite the Minister to comment on it in his response. This section of the Bill deals with the development of the person from childhood to adulthood.</P>
    <P>I have made about half of the points I intended to make, but I cannot continue as I have time constraints. I would like to broadly welcome this important legislation, which represents a brave step forward. It will create challenges for the Government, particularly for the Minister concerned. It will create huge challenges for the Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, and his successors. A great deal of money has been invested in this area in recent years. Future Deputies will have to deal with the growth in expenditure in this area. Perhaps the financial nature of this issue is secondary to the debate but, as I said earlier, the summit of this problem has not yet been reached.</P>
    <Speaker pid="KathleenLynch" hpid="Ms Lynch Ms Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Ms Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>I will pick up on Deputy O'Donovan's final point, which related to finances, as it is perhaps the key point to be made in respect of this Bill. Section 12 of the Bill, which deals with resources, is so fuzzy that I am worried that the Bill will cause more confusion. It is clear that it is not intended to cause confusion, but I am worried. This matter has to be dealt with at an early stage.</P>
      <P>The consultation process that preceded this Bill began six years ago, but it collapsed in a heap of shattered dreams last year. People whose hopes had been raised in that time were faced with a Bill that would have removed certain rights, such as the right to go to court in order to demand what the State should provide. The levels of cynicism increased among people with disabilities and those who care for them. Their hopes, which had been raised, were dashed. We have reached the point of having a debate about this Bill six years after the start of the consultation process.</P>
      <P>This Bill places the cart before the horse. I am convinced that this Bill should follow the disability Bill proper &ndash; the &ldquo;mother Bill&rdquo;&ndash; which should be before the House at the moment. I am worried by the fact that we are approaching the matter in this fashion. I know the Minister will tell us there are difficulties with the disability Bill and that he wants to ensure there will be no further difficulties, but I still believe we should be doing this the other way around.</P>
      <P>One must feel as if the world has fallen in when one discovers that one's child has a disability. Such people manage and get on with it, however, for example by finding out about the needs of the child. In some instances, a sibling may be responsible for caring for the person with a disability. As such people get on with the task, however, they discover that very few services are available. When they seek what little is available, they find that the support services they need do not exist.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If one thinks about this, one will realise they are the very people who have been campaigning <Col N="1284" />consistently over the past eight to nine years for the type of legislation necessary to ensure that the least fortunate among us are cared for properly. These people have less time and energy than others to engage in such a campaign, yet they have made it their business to fight for what they believe is the right of their children. We should all consider the matter in this fashion.</P>
    <P>The Bill is flawed in all sorts of ways. Although it is welcome and although I am sure it will be amended on Committee Stage, the issue of resources worries me. I can only imagine what schools are thinking when the Minister refers to their duty without caring about the necessary resources. It must be appalling for them to have to deal with this. They will ultimately get the blame. They will have to meet the parents and tell them they have not got the resources to cater for their children. The parents will rightly respond by referring to the rights afforded to their children under the Education for Persons with Disabilities Bill, yet they will be told by the schools that they do not have the resources. This worries me.</P>
    <P>I am equally worried by the fact that the Bill deals only with children up to the age of 18. All of us &ndash; I am no different from anybody else &ndash; know young men and women of 18 are no longer entitled to training or education. The concept of life-long education for people with disabilities has been thrown out the window. When they reach 18 they are young adults and have different needs. They are probably at a stage in their lives at which they need the type of service being provided to those under 18, and yet their parents probably have less energy than they had when their children were two or three. The Bill does not address this.</P>
    <P>I would have thought that the Sinnott case &ndash; the last speaker referred to the constitutional review committee &ndash; should have taught us that life-long education for people with disabilities is not only possible, but necessary. I thought we had learned this lesson and that the concept of life-long education would be dealt with in this legislation. This is not the case. We should be dealing with the disability Bill because one clearly flows from the other. However, we have put the cart before the horse.</P>
    <P>If the people aged 18 have a difficulty &ndash; they and their parents clearly do &ndash; the children at the other end of the scale equally have a difficulty. As I stated, when one has a child with a disability, it becomes very obvious, after the initial trauma of coming to terms with it, that children with disabilities need an early start and additional input at a very early age. Parents know this better than anybody and they recognise the value children with a disability get from an early start, yet we still have a haphazard admission policy on pre-schools and crèches. A child can be admitted to one and not to another. All sorts of different rules and regulations exist.</P>
    <P>I recently wrote to the Minister for Health and Children and asked him if there was a clearly <Col N="1285" />defined policy on admission of children with disabilities to pre-schools. I received the standard reply stating that he is looking into it. Clearly, he is waiting on this Bill, which does not deal with the matter at all. This is very worrying.</P>
    <P>One constituent wrote to me stating her son, who is two years old, was born with Down's syndrome. His sister has just moved on to national school after spending two happy, productive years at a certain pre-school. The letter states it is the woman's intention and hope that, if her son continues to develop as he has thus far, he would be capable of attending mainstream pre-school between three and five. She recently discovered that the school in question has a policy of accepting a child with Down's syndrome only if he or she is toilet-trained. Everybody who has reared a child knows that to have a child completely toilet-trained at two is a difficult enough task and that to hope to have a child with Down's syndrome toilet-trained at two is simply not realistic. The school to which the woman referred is a State school, funded by a health board. The admissions policy ordains that the child in question will not be admitted until fully toilet-trained, which could be at the age of four or five. However, the mother states in her letter that she will continue to argue and campaign to have her son admitted to a pre-school. She knows what it will mean to her son in the future and that it will ensure he will be more capable of dealing with his sister, family and society. The school down the road accepts children with disabilities who are not fully toilet-trained but, because the spaces are not available, she has focused on the other school.</P>
    <P>Another letter I received was from a parent with a four year old daughter with Down's syndrome. This parent was informed by phone that a management committee had decided not to offer the girl a place in its pre-school in September unless she was fully toilet-trained. She proved, in a two day assessment, that she could be offered a place and that she was ready and able for pre-school. However, she is four and not fully toilet-trained. Therefore, this Bill is of no benefit to such children and will not help the very people at whom it is aimed.</P>
    <P>Anybody who knows anything about education and children knows that an early start is vital. However, this is not available to those who need it. One cannot necessarily blame the pre-schools because they do not have the resources to look after the children in question. The pre-schools to which I refer are run by the Southern Health Board and are not private, bearing in mind that some private pre-schools accept children with disabilities who are not toilet-trained and have the resources to deal with them. The State is claiming that State-run pre-schools do not have the resources and therefore the children cannot benefit from them. This is completely unacceptable.</P>
    <P>The early start programme was first introduced in 1995 but still has not extended into this area. Section 12 does not lead me to believe that the children to which I referred will be accepted next <Col N="1286" />year. By the time the resources are in place, which will probably be around 2007, the year in which the next general election is due, they will be of no benefit to the children. Therefore, the education plan for primary and secondary levels, pertaining to children up to age 18, will not benefit the children. All that are required are additional resources and a change in the admissions policy. One cannot blame the schools because they simply do not have the resources to cater for children who are not toilet-trained. The schools are not saying they cannot cater for children with intellectual disabilities, but that they cannot cater for children who are not toilet-trained. It does not take rocket science to change a nappy. The children in question could benefit more than others from pre-school.</P>
    <P>Another element has to be considered. Last Saturday I attended an annual general meeting in Cork concerning people with autism. Despite the mire in which these people find themselves as they struggle to obtain services to keep their heads above water and provide care, I was amazed to find that their main concern, apart from the disability Bill which should be before the House, was the withdrawal of grants funding for people with disability. While they accepted that their children would receive services once they went to school, as provided for in this Bill, they pointed out that they cannot provide proper care now because their houses are not properly equipped for this purpose. When furnishing their homes, couples who want to have children, whether cohabiting or married, do not anticipate that they may have a child or parent who will need special equipment. Grants for such equipment have been virtually withdrawn and the Southern Health Board now issues a standard letter to grant applicants stating no money is available for this purpose and it will consider their application next year. Parents are struggling to keep their children at home because they do not have the required resources.</P>
    <P>I do not understand the reason we are not capable of stating that people with disabilities have the same rights as everybody else. During the recent hearings, someone asked whether people with disabilities are seeking more rights than other people. They are not, they are seeking equal rights. In the current climate as one of the richest countries in Europe, we should at least give those less fortunate than ourselves in society exactly the same rights as we enjoy.</P>
    <P>I do not understand the reasoning of those who argue we cannot do this or it would cost too much. I heard similar arguments in the past, usually with regard to women. It was argued that maternity benefit, equal pay for women and employing women in the Defence Forces would cost too much, yet none of these developments broke the bank or led the world to implode when they eventually occurred. This is one of the barriers we must overcome. We need finally to realise that people with disabilities can make a <Col N="1287" />worthwhile contribution to society. It is in our interests that their rights are protected.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Education for Persons with Disabilities Bill 2003 and the opportunity to speak to the legislation. At a number of meetings I had with representatives of the Dyslexia Association of Ireland in County Donegal, they impressed upon me the vital importance of having dyslexia included in the terms of the Bill. For too long, dyslexia has not received the recognition it deserves. The Letterkenny branch of the Dyslexia Association of Ireland is one of four branches in County Donegal. As a voluntary organisation it relies on parental subscriptions, donations and fund-raising for financial support, not to mention the time and effort parents must invest to keep the courses it provides up and running.</P>
      <P>It is of utmost importance that children with dyslexia and other educational disabilities receive an adequate level of support, funding and services. One of my concerns regarding dyslexia is the lack of training for teachers in identifying and dealing with children with this disability. Pre-service teacher education programmes and in-career development courses for serving teachers are of vital importance and need to be implemented. The number of postgraduate training places for educational psychologists should be increased and educational psychology should be offered as a subject in colleges of education, which is currently not the case.</P>
      <P>One of the most important factors in helping children with learning disabilities is early identification of the problem. In County Donegal there are still too many children on waiting lists for assessment. These students are not being identified sufficiently early or assessed sufficiently promptly and some of them must wait several years for an educational assessment. Valuable time, during which they should be receiving help appropriate to their disability, is wasted while they are waiting to have their learning disabilities assessed.</P>
      <P>I welcome the provision in the Bill to carry out assessments within three months. This is an absolute necessity because each day missed in identifying a child's learning disability is a day lost in his or her education. In dealing with children with learning disabilities, increased co-ordination between the various individuals who deal with the child is important. Class teachers, speech therapists, learning support teachers, parents and others must work together for the development of the child.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of my main concerns about the Bill is the weakening of the role of the parents which may <Col N="1288" />deprive them of a choice of school for their child. If, as provided for in the Bill, the national council for special education will have the power to designate a school or centre for education which a child with special educational needs is to attend, where will this leave parents and their choice of school or education centre for their children? Does this mean a child can be withdrawn from a mainstream education school? The role of parents in their children's education is vitally important and should not be minimised.</P>
    <P>I also wonder if the legislation will pave the way for the development of many more schools specialised in dealing with special educational needs. This would, in turn, defeat the notion that children with special learning disabilities need to be treated equally and on a par with children who do not have such needs. The resources required to deal with such disabilities should be provided within the current mainstream education system and no further specialist schools should be established.</P>
    <P>I welcome the efforts being made by the Minister to tackle the current problems faced by children with disabilities and their teachers. While I agree with many of the provisions of the Bill, the points I have raised warrant serious consideration and the Minister would improve the legislation by addressing my concerns. While the Bill has considerable scope and potential to do much for disabled children, as other Members have pointed out, resources will be the key.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCallananFF" hpid="Mr. Callanan Mr. Callanan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Callanan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this progressive and long awaited legislation. In the past, people with disabilities were offered no assistance when seeking education. On the contrary, rather than being assisted, children with disabilities were regarded as incapable of receiving an education or excluded completely from the educational process. Even in the recent past, when marginal resources were given to special education, very little was done.</P>
      <P>Only with the return to power of the Fianna Fáil Party in 1997 did the response to children with special educational needs improve. In 1998 the Government created a funded programme which had the effect of creating an environment in which a proactive approach could be taken to the needs of special education students. In the same year, all primary school children with special needs received an automatic right to have their needs met. As the number of resource teachers in ordinary schools has increased from 104 to 2,300, the number of special needs assistants rose from fewer than 300 to almost 5,500 full-time and part-time positions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We must always aspire to an education system which includes children with special needs in every aspect of mainstream education and provide them with every assistance needed to ensure they receive the best possible education. In some cases, there is a need for special assistants in class while in other cases a separate special need might arise. It is encouraging that the number of special <Col N="1289" />needs classes has increased from 350 in 1998 to over 500 today.</P>
    <P>It must be remembered that children with special needs are just like others. They have likes and dislikes, hopes and dreams. They should have the opportunity to make these dreams a reality. This Bill will assist schools, parents and children with special needs to realise these dreams. The Bill provides for a structure that will ensure all children with special needs receive every assistance to enable them to learn. These children are entitled to these services but there must be a structure in place to ensure they receive their entitlements.</P>
    <P>The establishment of a national council for education is an essential component of the Bill, as the body will give effect to the Bill's provisions. The council, which will have a local area presence, will play a key role in the development and delivery of services for people with special needs. It will also have a research and advisory role and will establish expert groups to address aspects of special needs provision. It will establish a consultative forum to facilitate inputs from the educational partners and other interested bodies. The council will play an essential role in ensuring that service delivery is optimised.</P>
    <P>The Bill sets out a range of services that must be provided to special needs children as a right, including assessments, individual educational plans and support services, and provides for a process of mediation and appeals where these needs are not met. An important aspect of the Bill is the fact that parents will have a central role in the development of the child at every step of the process. The parents will always be consulted when drawing up the child's educational plan. They are at the heart of the assessment and planning process. They have a vital role in ensuring that the child's rights are upheld at every stage of their education.</P>
    <P>The Bill gives parents the power to appeal to an independent appeals board against any statement or description they believe is inadequate to meet their child's needs or if they feel there has been a failure to implement their child's educational plan. This aspect of the Bill is essential as it provides a bottom up approach to the provision of special needs education. It is essential that the rights and entitlements of special needs students are not dictated to the parents, who know their child's needs better than anybody.</P>
    <P>The crucial aspect of the Education for Persons with Disabilities Bill is that it establishes a duty on the school, the State and on the newly established national council for education to ensure the equality and fair treatment of all children. The implementation of educational plans will require the investment of significant resources in special education. There will be a statutory duty on the Departments of Education and Science and Health and Children to make these resources available. The Bill emphasises the constitutional duty of the State to ensure that all children receive the same educational opportunities. This <Col N="1290" />is most important. For too long children with special needs have been invisible. They have been put at the back of the class and forgotten. They have not received their constitutional right to an education.</P>
    <P>Since 1977, the Government has made quantum leaps in meeting the rights of those in need of special education. It has improved funding and resources. This Bill takes the next essential step in guaranteeing these rights. As a result of this Bill, Ireland will enjoy an education system which gives children with disabilities the same opportunity for development through education as is given to other children. It will, perhaps, lead to the realisation of the hopes and dreams of many children in the future.</P>
    <P>I take this opportunity to praise the voluntary agencies which have worked to provide for the educational needs of children in my area, the Galway Association and the Brothers of Charity. We cannot forget the parents of children with disabilities who have been educating their children in their homes and, in some cases, travelling long distances with them to educational facilities. They have worked extremely hard and are to be commended.</P>

      <P>I welcome this important legislation. It is an advance for people with disabilities. It has been long awaited and I hope the Minister will take on board the many representations from disabled people who have made constructive proposals for the improvement of the Bill.</P>
      <P>I share many of the concerns about the Bill, especially with regard to definitions. The definition of educational disability is too narrow and, on the face of it, excludes people with conditions such as dyslexia, attention deficit disorder and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. I urge the Minister to address this deficiency, recognising the broad consensus that the definition needs to be widened. As my colleague, Deputy Crowe, pointed out previously in this debate, the definition should be the same as that in the Education Act 1998, the Employment Equality Act 1998 and the Equal Status Act 2000.</P>
      <P>Children with ADHD have special needs in the education system and it is essential that resources are made available so they can be assisted at the earliest stage possible. Early diagnosis and specialised education can make a huge difference. Failure to provide for their essential needs leaves these children and their families marred for life, with serious consequences on an individual and social level.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My second major concern is the mode of assessment outlined in the legislation. The fundamental problem is the lack of resources to carry out the number of assessments needed. Indeed, <Col N="1291" />one can say the fundamental flaw in the legislation is that it is based on the Government's willingness to pay. The National Educational Psychological Service, NEPS, has just over 120 psychologists to serve nearly 2,000 of the State's primary schools, leaving 1,000 schools without a service. Even with the Department's final tally of 200 psychologists, at which it will then consider NEPS fully staffed, there will be a relatively small number of psychologists dealing with a huge number of assessments.</P>
    <P>At present, 57% of schools in the north-west region are not covered by NEPS. This includes my constituency of Cavan-Monaghan. The figures are even worse for the mid-west. While the vast majority of schools on the east coast are covered by NEPS, other parts of the country lag far behind.</P>
    <P>Schools without NEPS coverage can use the scheme funded by the Department for the commissioning of individual psychological assessments from private practitioners. Under the scheme, it is the obligation of the principal to find a psychologist willing to carry out the assessment. Bearing in mind the workloads of many psychologists, it could be months before a slot is open or accessible. The principal is restricted to a panel of approved psychologists in making the selection. The approved panel contains 137 names. None is from Cavan, Monaghan, Leitrim or Carlow, there is one from Kilkenny and one from Laois. There is a mere handful in other counties while almost 50, over one third of the approved psychologists, are based in Dublin which already enjoys the best NEPS coverage.</P>
    <P>There are other flaws in the scheme. A school is restricted to a certain number of assessments per year, roughly based on one assessment for every 50 pupils. If a school uses its allocation of assessments in a year, what options are open to it if a child with learning difficulties is then identified? Are the child and his or her parents expected to wait a year for the next or new allocation?</P>
    <P>The Bill requires an assessment to be carried out within three months after it is requested by the principal, the health board or the council. However, in some areas there are waiting lists longer than three months. I know that in some cases the waiting lists run for years. A three month delay between a psychological assessment of a child and its delivery represents a whole school term. That is before the formulation of the education plan has taken place, which adds at least another month. A child will be waiting at least a whole school term for a decision to be made. This is unacceptable. We all recognise in the cases brought to our attention in our respective constituencies and regions that this issue must be urgently addressed.</P>
    <P>I want to make a point about section 7 which deals with the preparation of an education plan by the council if requested by the health board or <Col N="1292" />a principal. In this case, the special education needs organiser convenes a group of persons to prepare such a plan. If the council is responsible for creating an education plan, it can consult a psychologist employed by the Minister or the NEPS or a person determined by the special needs organiser to have sufficient expertise in psychology. The term &ldquo;sufficient expertise&rdquo; is a little vague. In the absence of a definition of the term &ldquo;psychologist&rdquo;, a person who might not have the appropriate qualifications could be put on such a team. Is the special needs organiser in a position to make this judgment? Given that so much depends on it, why should we settle for an opinion less than the best available?</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister addresses these concerns on Committee Stage. I also hope that, through constructive engagement, a much improved Bill will emerge to the benefit of all the sectors identified.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaddyMcHughIND" hpid="Mr. McHugh Mr. McHugh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McHugh</NameTxt>
      <P>I am grateful for the opportunity to contribute to this debate. The Bill is a fine piece of work. On reading it and the explanatory memorandum, one could be forgiven for thinking that those with disabilities would not see another bad day in terms of their education. The Bill seeks to provide a statutory framework within which the education of children and people with special educational needs can be enforced in law. That sounds great because it seems to cover the situation adequately. However, it does not. Although the Bill's provisions seem fine, the reality will be different when the Bill is enacted.</P>
      <P>All parents of children and young adults with a learning disability do not have the wherewithal, resources, strength or tenacity required to fight the system, to fight for their rights and, if necessary, to go to court to win that fight. There are certain provisions in the Bill which are not crystal clear and must be fought because they will not deliver a proper education for people with disabilities. I am sure the Minister knows the reality faced by parents and guardians of children and young adults with disabilities. In fairness to him, I recognise his concern and interest in this area. I know he wants to improve the situation but fear he is hamstrung by a lack of resources. People must fight on a daily basis the system put in place by the protectors of the State, traditionally known as the island of saints and scholars. They must take their fight to the streets, as they did last week in Athlone, to reinforce their arguments and secure the rights for their children enshrined in the Constitution but which have not been delivered.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Will the Bill change anything? I fear it will not. I want to give the House an example of an experience of a constituent whose school had applied for special educational support services. The child was assessed by a qualified psychologist who deemed that she met the criteria for resource teaching support as set out in Circular 08/02. However, when the application, with the psychologist's report, was forwarded to the Department, <Col N="1293" />it was again assessed by the Department and the child was deemed not to meet the criteria as set down in the circular. That is a classic case of experts differing and the education of a person with disabilities dying.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McHugh</NameTxt>
      <P>When the Bill is enacted, will there be any changes to such a situation? The two professionals with equal qualifications will still be in the system and arrive at different conclusions about the needs of the same person. What will the Bill do to correct this? It provides a statutory framework within which the education of this child is guaranteed as a right enforceable in law. However, as I pointed out, it will not bestow rights on the child because psychologists, acting on behalf of the Department, believe she does not qualify, although a professional outside the Department says she does. How will the Bill deal with this? It allows for a person to go to court after an appeal. However, this child is eight years of age and her parents do not have the human and financial resources to go through the trauma of a court case. The child and others like her continue to suffer as a result of their rights being denied.</P>
      <P>The organisation, All Children Together, has serious misgivings about the Bill. It fears that it will deprive parents of a choice in selecting a school for their child with special needs, that it will pave the way for the creation of many more special classes in designated schools and that the situation of students with disabilities approaching their 18th birthday will be reviewed. That is not the case for children who do not have a disability. I want to read part of the response of All Children Together to the Bill because it fully encapsulates the wishes and desires of parents of children and young adults with disabilities. It states:</P>
      <P>We would hope that in the real interests of children with educational disabilities, this Bill will be amended and that the necessary supports and services to enable these students receive an effective education will be provided as an enforceable right. We would hope that in the spirit of true partnership the role of the parent in all decisions relating to the education of their child with a disability will be recognised and authenticated. Where it is the parents' wish to have their child with an educational disability educated in a truly inclusive system of education, this decision must be recognised and upheld and the necessary resources and supports and services must be provided to the child in that system. Unnecessary obstacles must not be put in the way of parents trying to secure an effective education for their child with an educational disability. Life is difficult enough for students with disabilities and their parents. This Bill should not make it even harder.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CiaranCuffeGP" hpid="Mr. Cuffe Mr. Cuffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cuffe</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Bill and I am grateful for the opportunity to speak on it. My colleague, <Col N="1294" />Deputy Gogarty, has already expressed his concerns about it from an educational perspective. However, I am concerned about it from a rights-based perspective. When discussing disability, it is imperative to focus on two issues &ndash; equality of opportunity to participate and equality of opportunity to access. I will refer to these two key issues in the context of our international obligations as signatories of three important international instruments.</P>
      <P>It is important to note that Ireland has been playing a major role in steering the international community towards developing the human rights agenda for persons with disabilities and lobbied for the establishment of a specific human rights treaty for persons with disabilities. In 1989 Ireland ratified the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights and the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. The State thus has an obligation to adhere to international human rights standards. This means that when the UN Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights makes general comments, it is considered appropriate to take them on board.</P>
      <P>Articles 13 and 14 of the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights deal with education. Article 13 states: &ldquo;Education shall enable all persons to participate effectively in a free society&rdquo;. The committee elaborated on these rights in General Comment 13, which states, &ldquo;Since everyone has the right to the satisfaction of their &lsquo;basic learning needs' as understood by the World Declaration, the right to fundamental education is not confined to those &lsquo;who have not received or completed the whole period of their primary education'&nbsp;&rdquo;. Ultimately, this means that &ldquo;the right to fundamental education extends to all those who have not yet satisfied their &lsquo;basic learning needs'&nbsp;&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Fundamental education does not have a gender and is not confined to youth. The Title of the Bill incorporates this concept but inside it is a very different story. The Bill is riddled with the term &ldquo;child&rdquo; instead of &ldquo;student&rdquo;. To add insult to injury, there is a cut-off point after the age of 18 years. Is the Minister considering changing the Title to reflect what is actually contained in the Bill? Better still, will he consider keeping the Title and amending the Bill in order that it credits such a title? Education is a lifelong process and to deny the right of those over 18 years to continue this process is to deny their right to education and diminish their chances of having equal access to and participation in the education system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The human rights committee reiterates this when referring to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights in its General Comment 18, which states: &ldquo;The principle of equality sometimes requires States parties to take affirmative action in order to diminish or eliminate conditions which cause or help to perpetuate discrimination prohibited by the Covenant.&rdquo;  I ask the Minister to take affirmative action, address <Col N="1295" />the inequalities of access and participation which I have mentioned and allow all persons with disabilities to access their right to an education as stated in the Bill.</P>
    <P>The UN Convention on the Rights of the Child covers the rights of children with disabilities in Article 23:</P>
    <P>Recognizing the special needs of a disabled child . . . shall be provided free of charge, whenever possible, taking into account the financial resources of the parents or others caring for the child, and shall be designed to ensure that the disabled child has effective access to . . . education, training, health care services . . . and recreation opportunities.</P>
    <P>I wonder whether the Bill can meet such requirements when every provision is subject to resources and determined by the Minister for Finance. This is bound to cause complications in implementing it fully and poses the question of whether it actually facilitates a rights based approach. How can anything be rights-based if there is a price tag dangling from it?</P>
    <P>Another area of concern is equality of access and participation of parents and students in decisions about students' education. In 1997 the UN Committee on the Rights of the Child pointed to a number of areas that needed attention, one of which was the right of children with disabilities to participate fully in education. The committee recommended that a child should participate in any decision making process concerning his or her education. This recommendation should be highlighted to an even greater extent in the Bill. Parents and students should be encouraged to take a more proactive role in the participatory process from start to finish, incorporating any decisions taken through all stages of the implementation of the Bill.</P>
    <P>I have other reservations about the Bill. It is common knowledge that resources in this area are stretched to their limits. How will the Minister tackle the practicalities of the Bill such as making schools fully accessible? Location is another consideration. The council recommends that a student attend a particular school. Will the geographical location of schools affect the possibility of full access? For example, will school buses be provided? Educational assessments should take place at the beginning of the academic school year to ensure students receive the full benefit of their plans throughout the school year. If for some reason students do not meet the goals of their plans within that time, they should be able to attend summer school to catch up in order that they may be reunited with their classmates in the autumn.</P>
    <P>One obvious omission from the Bill is that there is no mention of advocacy. I appeal to the Minister to incorporate this important ingredient. He should reflect on the system in place in the USA, which is a good example of how things should be done. We must learn from the Amer<Col N="1296" />icans in the area of disability rights. I look forward to the modification of the Bill to deal with the concerns of the Green Party.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MarieHoctorFF" hpid="Ms Hoctor Ms Hoctor">
      <NameTxt>Ms Hoctor</NameTxt>
      <P>As a member of the Joint Committee on Education and Science, I welcome the opportunity of addressing the House on this important Bill. I will begin, however, with a story.</P>
      <P>He started as a performer and gave many concerts as a young boy but the noise that started in his head became worse and worse until eventually he realised he was losing his hearing. He used to be able to talk but now he found that the best way of communicating was to write in a journal. As his hearing became weaker and weaker, his doctor recommended that he move away from the urban setting and live for some time in the countryside to renew his spirit. While there, he decided that he would no longer perform but compose music instead. At 27, he became completely deaf and started to compose music seriously. In attempting to do so effectively he cut off the legs of the piano in order that he could feel its vibrations. His sound and soul became one. The year was 1801 and his name was Ludwig van Beethoven. His music became immortalised and is enjoyed to this day by music-lovers throughout the world. Against the odds, as his deafness increased so did his capacity for writing great music.</P>
      <P>The Bill provides a statutory framework to guarantee education services for people with disabilities. I mentioned Beethoven because the problems of those who, like him, have struggled against the odds through the years are addressed once and for all in the Bill. It is our duty, as legislators, to help people with disabilities in their attempts to make sense of their world. They will now be recognised in a supportive educational environment which will help in their preparation for life.</P>
      <P>On 31 July the Joint Committee on Education and Science agreed to advertise for submissions from various organisations and bodies which had already declared their interest in the Bill. We received 51 submissions, 40 consisting of oral presentations as well as written. It was clear in our meetings with the various bodies that wide and diverse needs would have to be addressed in the Bill. During our meetings with some of the parents' groups we identified clearly the different levels of disability from mild to profound. We considered the child who was confined to bed almost all of the time and in need of nursing care as well as the child with Down's syndrome who aspired to complete the leaving certificate applied, as many had done. We also considered children with deafness and those with dyslexia who saw this as a disability and felt they were held back in their learning experience. Many needs and interests were dealt with during the meetings.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The definition of &ldquo;child&rdquo; was of particular concern to many of those who made submissions. According to the Bill, a child is a person of not <Col N="1297" />less than three years of age and not more than 18. This caused some concerns about the issue of early intervention and the responsibility of the health boards in the early stages of the child's life and once he or she reached 18 years.</P>

      <P>The issue of the age bracket, which is clearly outlined in the Bill, was of concern. While the health board's remit applies again when the child with a disability reaches the age of 18, which I welcome, to my knowledge that has not been proven to be a difficulty for any child who wishes to undertake junior certificate, leaving certificate or leaving certificate applied level. In all cases the health boards, the Department of Education and Science and the Department of Health and Children should work more closely than they have in the past in terms of children in schools. I will elaborate on that aspect later in my contribution.</P>
      <P>On the same point, I refer specifically to St. Anne's in Roscrea which is experiencing a difficulty with the provision of speech therapy and psychological services by the health board. That matter must be addressed urgently by the Mid-Western Health Board. My colleague, the Minister for Defence, Deputy Michael Smith, who is in the Chamber, is aware of the needs which have to be addressed.</P>
      <P>I welcome the fact that the role of parents is highly accentuated in the Bill. Parents are central to the planning of the future of their child's education because they are the first educators. Deputy McHugh referred earlier to the group known as All Children Together, ACT. On reading the submission from this newly formed group, which only came together last July, I was disappointed to see that it called the Bill mean-spirited. It was by far the most negative group in terms of its written submission but on meeting its members in the committee I was pleased to hear that they recognised the many positive aspects of the Bill. That is to be welcomed.</P>
      <P>I support this group in its request for the ultimate participation, where possible, of parents in all aspects of assessment of needs for children with disabilities. It is only right that parents have access to reports, assessment records etc. without having to seek them. I hope the Minister will address in the coming days the issue of accessibility of all reports by parents without the need to make a request for them. They should be made available to parents at all times.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I also welcome the composition of the new national council for special education which I understand will have a chairperson and ten ordinary members. I ask that parents be adequately <Col N="1298" />represented on this council. Some of the parents' groups have asked that a parent of a child with a learning disability be represented on the council as well as a parent of a child with a lesser form of disability. In that way people who are living with these problems will be represented and their needs addressed on the council which, ultimately, will be the body responsible for implementing the spirit of the Bill.</P>
    <P>The question of integration of the child into the classroom was one of the common denominators in many of the submissions we received. Integration is a question of rights, it is rights-based. We must examine the rights of the child with a disability but also the rights of children who are able-bodied. The provisions in the Bill go a long way towards addressing what is best for the child with a disability as well as those who are without disability in the classroom.</P>
    <P>The word &ldquo;alongside&rdquo; is mentioned in that section also. We will hear more of that because much searching must be done, and obviously there must be consultation at all times with the parents, on the integration of the child in the classroom in terms of whether it is best for that child to remain in the room while education is proceeding with the teacher or to leave the classroom. I would welcome the Minister's final comments on that section.</P>
    <P>The role of the principal is one about which I am concerned. The principal is a person who must be multi-skilled. Many principals are teaching as well as administering in schools but under the Bill a good deal of responsibility rests on the shoulders of the principal. They must prepare the education plan in conjunction with the special educational needs organiser and proper training must be put in place for all this area to be co-ordinated. I am talking about the principal, the teachers in the classrooms, the special needs assistants and the resource teachers. As a teacher, I am aware that many of my colleagues are undergoing training as resource teachers but it involves travelling long distances to Dublin. They are not financed adequately in terms of subsistence to stay overnight at Dublin city rates and much of that money comes from their own pockets. The Minister should seek to have the special needs organisers ex-quota so that they will not be absorbed into the current teaching record. I intend to raise the role of the principal again on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>I welcome the provision of an autism unit, recently announced by the Minister, for Boher national school, Ballina, County Tipperary. It is indicative of the spirit of the Government that this unit was provided in co-operation with the parents, the principal and her staff at the school. It is a reflection of the spirit of the Bill that we are providing early intervention which will mean that at an early stage children are enabled to participate fully in the life of the school and the greater life of the community.</P>
    <P>It is important that not alone will this be a Bill for education for persons with disabilities but also <Col N="1299" />for those without a disability. It is important that able-bodied children in the classroom give every opportunity to learn to the child with a disability. Young people, as we know, often have a tendency to engage in bullying and it is important that at an early stage all children learn about disabilities and how to interact properly with these children without diminishing in any way the worth of the person. That is something we can consider in the future.</P>
    <P>I welcome the fact that all school starters who have been identified as needing it are provided with special needs assistance at this stage of the year. Many children were provided with it in the past but many are still waiting for sanction from the Department. I plead with the Minister that this be addressed immediately.</P>

It behoves us as legislators to look after their needs on this occasion, having failed in the past in terms of the introduction of the Bill before the last election, and ensure that they are enabled to become innovative people and be fully integrated into society.</P>

      <P>I am amused by some of the comments being exchanged here between our two friendly Deputies from Tipperary. I am grateful to Deputy Hoctor for giving of her time in the House to speak on this matter. I am glad to see that, rather than running out of comments to make, she has a good deal to say and is making a great contribution to this Dáil, of which she is a new Member.</P>
      <P>It is instructive to note the annual Estimates process in which both the Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Dempsey, and the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Martin, have won out in terms of the Cabinet battle to ensure that resources are dedicated to both health and education in the forthcoming budget for the year ahead. It is important that these two areas have been singled out by the Cabinet in its collective wisdom for increased resources rather than further cutbacks. It is important to remember that these are the two areas about which people are most vexed and interested.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The people for whom I work in my constituency are extremely focused on education, in particular special education. We are all acutely aware of the difficulties faced by parents who have children with special needs and the difficulties they <Col N="1300" />have faced to date winning the right to a proper and full education for their children. It has been a huge and difficult battle for them. I have been part of some of those battles on a case-by-case basis. I fully understand the sense of frustration those parents have experienced trying to wheedle from the Administration their due right and entitlement to an education. An education is dear to the heart of the people.</P>
    <P>This Bill is long overdue and I congratulate the Minister on bringing it forward. It is interesting that this Bill is coming before the House at a time when we are being told Exchequer finances are straitened. It is important we send a signal to children with special needs and their parents that this Government is prepared to make a caring commitment to them and to the entitlements which are their due. It is a strong and positive signal that things are not entirely bad in our economy and that we are passing legislation which will not only extend the rights of those children and their parents, but will also add to the resourcing of schools and the people who have to deal with disadvantage. That is a positive signal about where we are as a State and a nation. Up to several years ago we simply could not have afforded to do this and we, as Deputies, had to soldier on with the frustrations of parents and the complete failure of the education system to deal with these people properly. Now we at least have a platform on which to do that. Of course, resources are not thick on the ground and there will be difficulties rolling out resources, but at least now the central platform, the legislative framework, is in place.</P>
    <P>I welcome a number of items in this legislation which parents will also welcome. The fact there is a measurable three-month limit on an assessment is important. Time after time I have seen cases where parents have had to wait too long to have their rights and those of their children vindicated. The fact an assessment must be done in a three-month timeframe is an important guarantee to parents and children. The idea of a principal of a school drawing up an individual education plan for somebody who has been through the assessment process is positive. Again, there is a tight time limit on that and it must happen within one month which is welcome. Despite the collective and individual frustration these people have experienced over the years, at least now there is a solid timeframe within which action must take place and rights must be vindicated. That is a good way to go about this issue.</P>
    <P>I am deeply impressed by the Minister's commitment to the constitutional rights-based approach which he has taken. Section 12 refers to the constitutional duty of the State as regards the provision of education on a fair basis to people with disabilities or with special learning difficulties. That is a marvellous improvement and is exactly in line with what many in the general disabilities area have been calling for. I note that this rights-based approach has been a key demand of Rehab and many other groups over the last few years when the rights of people with disabilities <Col N="1301" />have become controversial and emotive. When one reads section 12, one sees that is the approach the Minister has taken. That is a welcome development and one which in years to come will be applauded as a genuine attempt to reform and radically improve the rights and conditions for those faced with learning difficulties of one kind or another.</P>
    <P>I also welcome the setting up of the national council for special education. An interim board has been appointed and a chief executive is in place. I hope in the next few months or so we will see the full board take up its full duties and roles as regards the Bill. That is something which is welcome. I do not believe anybody in this House could be too critical of this Bill which is enabling legislation that will have far-reaching consequences for people and the way they are treated in our education system. I am glad the Minister has made a strong commitment to ensure that schools are no longer allowed to prevent people who wish to attend a particular school from attending. There are schools which simply do not want to take on the difficulty and pressure of coping with children with special needs. I am glad that is specifically prevented in this legislation. There has been a tendency in many of our schools, not only in respect of those with disabilities, towards cherry-picking in pupil enrolment. That is deplorable and wrong and against the egalitarian ethos of our Republic.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. English</NameTxt>
      <P>Nobody in this House could put their hand on their heart and say they do not welcome this Bill. On behalf of the many citizens with disabilities, I thank my colleague from Meath, the Minister for Education and Science, for his efforts in this field. However, I ask him to go one step closer to a perfect system, if one exists. This is the Minister's chance to be remembered in history not just for fine words but, more importantly, for an education system which, when we get it right, will be the envy of many and copied by countries worldwide. What better way to have a fitting end to the Year of People with Disabilities and after hosting the Special Olympics?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I acknowledge the huge step forward this Bill constitutes in terms of our education system. However, in its present form, this legislation has one basic flaw &ndash; it refers to the Minister for Finance and the Department of Finance and the fact that funding is not guaranteed on a statutory basis. Bunreacht na hÉireann, as pointed out by the many groups which do such Trojan voluntary work in this area, is the only way to guarantee that each child gets the education he or she needs and deserves but, as usual, this Government believes it knows better despite all the advice given to it. When he introduced this Bill, the Minister for Education and Science told us about the amount of money being spent providing special services in schools. He went on to outline the number of resource teachers for which his Department has provided funding. There has <Col N="1302" />been quite an increase but, while not wishing to sound cheap or arrogant, all I have to say to that is, &ldquo;So what&rdquo;. All he is doing is pointing out the number of people who have fallen through the system over the years without any help. That is nothing about which to boast. We are just playing catch up.</P>
    <P>No matter what the Minister for Finance has to say, even if all of us in this House were to leave politics aside and think with our hearts, we know that all children are entitled to an education. What would be wrong with spending more on them? For once, if only for the sake of renewing public confidence in us, can we do the right thing rather than pretending to do so? Where is the benchmarking which guarantees them a quality or quantity of service to which they are entitled, free from monetary considerations? Are they not entitled to it as much as those of us who sit in this House or the teachers who teach them? This is clearly not the case.</P>
    <P>Disability in this country often guarantees a lower quality of life and fewer opportunities resulting in poverty. That is wrong and where the flaw lies in this legislation. There is no guaranteed standard of education or guaranteed finance. My memory is not that short. This Bill is being introduced by the same Government which is about caring and sharing and which fought decent people tooth and nail through the courts to stop it, on behalf of the people, providing these services on a statutory basis. Again, the big flaw in this fine legislation is that it does not really matter about all the good intentions in the Bill, how many appeal boards there are or who sits on them when at the end of the day, the Minister for Finance can shout &ldquo;Stop&rdquo; because of a lack of funding. We should wake up. When is there ever sufficient funding in any Department? Maybe it is only in our dreams. If my colleagues on the Government benches were truthful with me, or the public, they would say this is the real agenda behind the Bill, namely, to stop the State giving a blank cheque to the Department of Education and Science to secure a certain level of education for all our children whatever their creed or colour or physical well-being. There will not be a blank cheque but a level of funding will be determined by an accountant or the Minister for Finance. This is a Minister for Finance who has said to ministerial colleagues in the past, when dealing with other problems, &ldquo;I know what the problem is. Here is the solution. I have X number of pounds to deal with the problem, so I will give it to your Department. Say thanks now and run off like the good little boy or girl you are.&rdquo;  The Minister for Health and Children was treated in this way last year. I can hear the Minister for Finance saying, &ldquo;This is not my problem any more. Remember to spend the money wisely because, I repeat, it is not my problem any more. If there is not enough money to go around, then go and rob Peter and pay Paul because I do not care. I have to balance my books and the old euro will only go so far.&rdquo;  I can also hear him saying, &ldquo;It must <Col N="1303" />be the Minister's fault that the problem still exists because I gave him the money to deal with it.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The old blame game works every time and the Bill will not prevent it happening again. However, it will not wash this time. That is a wonderful way to run a business or family budget but education is one of the very few issues where the finance must match the problem, not the other way around. Accountants do not always make good teachers; neither will throwing money willy-nilly at a problem solve it. Holding expensive reviews to see where the money went is too late. A preconceived standard of education can be reached by nearly all children at a price affordable to us all if we are committed to it through the Constitution and tax system. Education is a right, not a privilege. Taxpayers who have a problem with this should take up residence offshore with the rest of the tax dodgers, apologise for the fact that they are human and remember that there are no pockets in a shroud.</P>
    <P>I believe in good fiscal and monetary policies. A low taxation society will encourage prosperity. A waste of taxpayer's money is simply that, a waste. However, there are three main areas where taxpayer's money must be spent wisely in order to prove, without any reasonable doubt, that this is a democracy, that we have civil liberties, invest in our own prosperity and are, in some way, civilised. These are: defence of the person against physical attack by others; the health and welfare of all in our nation; and the education of all to a degree that will secure survival and give opportunities. These rights can and should be secured under the Constitution. It would take new thinking which is one step further than this Bill is prepared to go.</P>
    <P>The general taxpaying community are good, if given the chance. If they can see value for money, they will agree with us on this. It will take a baseline tax figure to pay for it but so what? Let us follow this through. There is no point in writing a policy down in nice words. We must back it up with money.</P>
    <P>If our education system was guaranteed to reach a certain standard for all in all sectors of the community, would we have 15 years olds running around the streets of Limerick or Dublin with semi-automatic weapons dispensing drugs to other 15 year olds in socially deprived areas? Would we have long-term unemployed? Would our criminal justice system for young and old be at breaking point and would all this be costing a fortune? Would I have queues in my office every weekend of people who have been waiting two years to have their children's disabilities diagnosed? </P>
    <P>We all know the answer to this problem, despite what the Department of Finance might say. It is to write into the Constitution the right of every child, whether he or she has a disability, to an education that will ensure his or her future in the modern world.</P>
    <P>What are we do to at this stage? As a start, let <Col N="1304" />us accept the Bill with the amendments proposed by my colleague, Deputy Enright, on behalf of Fine Gael. This would only be a start because it will take time to secure personnel for teaching and other roles to make this constitutional amendment that can and must work. Let us stop thinking that any less will do. It will not.</P>
    <P>This is not an excuse to do nothing for years to come. We need a timetable and budget for change. Members of this House have a collective responsibility to secure the futures of all, especially those who cannot speak or secure a future for themselves without our help. Those who require this help require it now or as soon as possible. There is no way around this unless, like the ostrich, we bury our heads in the sand and hope the problem will go away.</P>
    <P>Let us take the Bill as a good start but commit to changing the Constitution in a short time in order that Members of this House will not have to talk about this same issue again or read about it in the national press day in and day out. People with disabilities have enough problems without us giving them more by putting a carrot in front of them when we all know, because of the Government's mismanagement of the public finances, they may never reach it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMoloney" hpid="Mr. Moloney Mr. Moloney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moloney</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to share my time with Deputy O'Connor. I welcome the opportunity to speak on this Bill which I am glad to see come before the House.</P>
      <P>This country has a proud tradition of placing great importance on education. We have built our success on continued investment in education. Since the formation of the State Governments have realised that if the people are to succeed, we must attain a high standard of education. Education is what will give tomorrow's generation the ability to do what our generation often could not.</P>
      <P>Any independent observer will agree that this policy has borne fruit. A strong investment in education has been one aspect of Government policy that has remained constant. It has also been Government policy to make education as widely available as possible. Irish education has been criticised for its exclusivity. Education should not be for the privileged few but for every citizen. This is the reason I support the Bill. Though the intent was indicated, it has not always been possible to provide an acceptable standard of education for those with disabilities. We could not be sure that the framework we had in place to provide the best standard of education for those with physical or mental disabilities was available. Throughout the country some were inevitably falling through the cracks in the education system. Although efforts were made by statutory and voluntary bodies to include them, they did not always receive the type and form of education that would best suit them. Education was available but it was often not the type of education which would suit people with disabilities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In County Laois a number of students were not receiving the care and attention they needed and <Col N="1305" />not getting the education to which they were entitled. They might have benefited from mixing with the general student population. Others who needed specialist or individual attention were placed with a class of other students who also demanded attention and had educational needs of their own. This was having a detrimental effect on the education of all those involved. Thankfully, the Bill addresses this problem. The Government has recognised the small flaws in the current system and this legislation will go a long way to seal the cracks. It places the education of children with special educational needs as an enforceable right and complements the provisions already in place to these ends in the Constitution.</P>
    <P>I welcome the role the Bill gives to parents. It is essential that they should have the right to decide what is best for the education of their children. By placing the decision-making ability in their hands and providing them with the assurance that they will be consulted about all educational matters at every step along the way the Bill safeguards their role in the education of their children. It ensures those who really have the child's best interests at heart are given a central role in their education.</P>
    <P>We do not want to develop a system whereby the educational authorities are in a position to make decisions regarding a particular child on the basis of the level or form of the disability from which they suffer. When it comes to education, it is essential that every child is treated as an individual, that each case is examined on its merits and that the views of all those concerned are taken into account. We do not want to see a blanket educational policy for all. The needs of every child differ. Therefore, the educational policy and system adopted should be able to adapt to these differences. We should have a degree of leeway in the educational plan. The Bill ensures this right which can only be a positive development.</P>
    <P>I also welcome some of the provisions contained in the Bill to help recognise educational disabilities and general educational difficulties at an early stage. While certain physical and mental disabilities may pose obvious educational difficulties, this is not always the case. Sometimes the problem can be difficult to spot and until it has been spotted, it cannot be treated.</P>
    <P>The prime example of this is dyslexia. Although there are many different forms of dyslexia, perhaps it is best explained as a learning difficulty that makes it hard for people to read, write and spell correctly. This can be difficult to diagnose, especially considering the various degrees of dyslexia from which any given child could suffer. Considering that studies would suggest that between 6% and 8% of people suffer from some form of dyslexia, one can appreciate just how widespread this problem is and how difficult it must be for parents, teachers and other educational authorities to both recognise and deal with it.</P>
    <P>Section 4 of the Bill plays a vital part. As well as empowering a health board to carry out an <Col N="1306" />assessment on a child whom the board believes has or is likely to suffer from an educational disability, it also contains other measures that deal extensively with the issue of assessment. Although the primary responsibility for assessment will fall to the national council for special education, parents will have the power to ask for their children to be assessed if they feel they may have an educational disability. This assessment will then be carried out by the NCSE or the relevant health board.</P>
    <P>The provision that this assessment must be carried out within three months must be welcomed, as it should ensure that if there is a problem, it will be recognised as soon as possible. Once the problem has been recognised an educational plan can be properly drawn up to deal with it.</P>
    <P>I also welcome the proposals contained within section 3. It is important that while we recognise children with disabilities, we should not go to extremes in dealing with the problem. Not all children with educational disabilities would benefit from being given special educational treatment. Some would flourish and develop more inside the ordinary school and education system. By placing the emphasis on the school to make all practicable efforts to assist a child who is not benefiting from the regular education programme, and to do this outside the special education programme of the school, we should have the safeguards in place to prevent such an occurrence.</P>
    <P>Equally we must make sure that while we are providing the best possible education for students with educational disabilities, this is not at the expense of other students around them. They too have a right to a full education. Unfortunately, in some cases at least, this education could be disrupted if a child with special educational needs takes up too much of the teacher's time. Such outcomes would have a negative effect on the child in question, the teacher and the rest of the students in that class.</P>
    <P>I reiterate my support for this Bill. It will provide the best possible education for those who suffer from educational disabilities and will lead to their getting the most out of our educational system and their lives. Education is the key that unlocks the world at large. In this year of the disabled, when we should be doing all we can to integrate and involve those with disabilities in society, to improve their standing and remove the obstacles in their way, addressing problems in education has to be a priority. It is at school at a young age that these obstacles are first put before those with disabilities. Hopefully this Bill will help eliminate those obstacles and ease the path before them.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieOConnorFF" hpid="Mr. O'Connor Mr. O'Connor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Connor</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Moloney for sharing time with me and compliment him on his fine address. While I take his point that given this is the year for people with disabilities we should recognise the issue in a special way, I always make the point that special years should not just <Col N="1307" />be about one year. It is important that we do as the Government has recently done and reiterate our strong support for those in our communities who need that special attention. I commend the Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Dempsey, on his work in this area and for the commitments he has made.</P>
      <P>Since I became a Deputy 18 months ago, I have often spoken on educational matters and have fought in the House, with the Department and in the party rooms for educational facilities in my constituency of Dublin South-West and Tallaght in particular. On an occasion like this, we should recognise that people with disabilities require our special attention. Whatever about ongoing campaigns, which I support, it is right that we support the Bill, which I strongly commend to the House.</P>
      <P>It is essential that equal educational opportunities are available to all our young people. As a community, we must ensure that all children are given the opportunity to give expression to their private hopes and dreams and not in a well-meaning yet at times patronising way. I am aware that the rights of people with special needs to equal treatment are already provided for in legislation such as in the Equal Status Act and the Education Acts. However, this Bill goes much further by providing for a structure that will guarantee the rights of children to the greatest possible extent and also ensures that parents are central to their child's development in every step of the process.</P>
      <P>This Bill outlines the range of services that must be provided, including assessments, individual education plans and support services. It also provides for processes of mediation and appeals where these needs are not met. This level of attention to the individual needs of young people is a key part of both their development and our responsibility to meet their needs. I noted that there is a general welcome for the Bill from many sectors. There are views and observations that I hope will be brought forward on Committee Stage and, where possible, the Minister will accommodate them.</P>
      <P>This legislation will have an impact on the day-to-day lifestyles of many in our communities. It is vital that as legislators, we extend the provisions of this Bill as far as possible to meet the needs of people with disabilities. I acknowledge the correspondence all Deputies receive from the various organisations in this area. It is a good example of democracy and it is important these groups understand that we read what is sent to us and understand the problems. I read my correspondence every day. I commend them for this work.</P>
      <P>The Bill establishes the national council for special education and I welcome this. I wish this body well and trust that its members will be as proactive as possible in meeting its goals and objectives.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have supported the Government's policies over the past six years to provide inclusive education for as many children with educational diffi<Col N="1308" />culties as is practicable. The education of children with special educational needs alongside those without such needs has an inclusive effect and acts as a catalyst for better understanding and support from the community at large. Whether one represents Cork, Limerick, Galway or Tallaght one will come across the same issues. Did I mention Limerick?</P>
    <Speaker pid="JanOSullivan" hpid="Ms O'Sullivan Ms O'Sullivan">

    <Speaker pid="CharlieOConnorFF" hpid="Mr. O'Connor Mr. O'Connor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Connor</NameTxt>
      <P>I am happy to mention Tallaght. Throughout our communities we see the same problems and it is right that we listen to them and represent the people.</P>
      <P>I noted the statistics presented by the Minister. I repeat some of them as they demonstrate how far we have come in recent years. In October 1998, the Government decided that all primary school children with disabilities would have an automatic entitlement to a response to their needs. This led directly to an increase of special resource teachers catering for children in ordinary schools from 104 to more than 2,300. I understand the number of full-time and part-time special needs assistants in the system also increased from less than 300 to almost 5,500 in the same period. In September 1999, the learning support teacher service was extended to every primary and post-primary school in the State. The number of learning support teachers in primary schools has grown from 1,242 in September 1997 to 1,531 today. Since then, pupil-teacher ratios in special schools and classes have been reduced to meet the recommendations of the special education committee.</P>
      <P>No doubt there are many who will say this is not enough. Look how far we have come and the progress which will continue with the enactment of this important Bill. The level of need involved in a number of cases may require placement in a special class attached to a mainstream school. The number of special classes has increased from 350 in 1998 to more than 500 currently. Each class is dedicated to a disability category and operates a significantly reduced pupil-teacher ratio. Pupils attending these classes also attract specially increased capitation grants. The inclusion of pupils with special needs in mainstream schools is not always possible, and staff and parents must be congratulated for their commitment to special schools dedicated to disability groups. It is not easy and they do a great job.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I refer to the Minister's example. Since October 1998 more than 120 dedicated special classes have been established to meet the needs of children with autism. With a maximum class size of six and the support of a teacher and two special needs assistants, the classes recognise the emotional needs of autistic children. A nationwide pre-school service and education programme to extend the school year for children with autism has also been developed in the past <Col N="1309" />year. This demonstrates the Minister's commitment in the area and acts as a template for the development of other similar specialised groups.</P>
    <P>This is the European year of people with disabilities and many people concerned about disability services have contacted public representatives. I applaud them but, given that there always will be need, the Minister and the Department are responding. As a Government backbencher, I am never afraid to recognise need or to demonstrate support for my community and its needs but there has been a great deal of progress, which should be acknowledged. While it will never be enough, there has been good progress. The Minister recently highlighted his support for learning support and resource teachers, special needs assistants, part-time tuition services, special transport escorts, equipment, classes, schools and structural provision.</P>
    <P>This legislation is timely and will be supported throughout local communities. It is important that an ongoing commitment is made to the sector and I commend the Minister for doing so. The Bill is a necessary element in the development of a sector of our community, which is strongly entitled to the benefits of a suitable education. I support the Bill and look forward to making a contribution on Committee Stage. I commend it to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanNeville" hpid="Mr. Neville Mr. Neville">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Neville</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to contribute to this important debate. Every child can be educated to a certain level but each has different qualities and traits, which should be developed to the maximum. Unfortunately, heretofore, many of those who were labelled &ldquo;disabled&rdquo; did not have the opportunity to fulfil their educational potential. While I welcome the legislation, the shortage of resource teachers and special needs assistants throughout the State must be highlighted. There is an urgency to create new posts so that professionals are available to those who need them. Resource teachers in my constituency must cover three schools. They concentrate on numeracy skills because they do not have the time to address literacy skills as well and they cannot ensure those who need to develop such skills obtain the necessary help. Many schools request that resource teachers should be given more time in each school to help children with disabilities because teachers spend a great deal of their time driving from school to school. The Minister has identified the need for more educational psychologists to ensure children are properly assessed. How can their needs be determined without proper assessment?</P>

    <P>I refer to a number of issues, which I would like the Minister to examine prior to Committee Stage. The phrase &ldquo;educational disability&rdquo; is used throughout the Bill. &ldquo;Disability&rdquo; creates a negative image and terms such as &ldquo;individual learning requirements&rdquo; or &ldquo;individual learning needs&rdquo; should be used. Learning disability should not be expressed as a negative quality. Special needs can also be looked upon as the provision of some<Col N="1310" />thing that is not typically provided in mainstream schools so that a child can benefit fully from his or her education. This applies to children with mild needs and those with profound and multiple learning disabilities. Everybody has different abilities and qualities and the opportunity to develop and assess them is more important than reflecting on people's lack of ability.</P>
    <P>The terminology used conveys our attitude towards different issues and if we refer negatively to a group of people, it means we have a negative attitude towards them but if more positive language is used and the qualities and abilities of these people are identified, we will have a different attitude. The Bill is based on negative opinion of the worth and functioning of young people with extra learning needs, and phrases such as &ldquo;restriction in capacity&rdquo; would be more appropriate. A number of conditions requiring extra educational input are temporary, for example, when a child is undergoing a long convalescence following a severe accident or illness or is awaiting medical help to alleviate a physical condition relating to his or her ears or eyes, and the use of appropriate and acceptable language in the legislation is of the utmost importance.</P>
    <P>The Bill will need to stand the test of time and when analysed in years to come it should read as informed legislation, embracing an ethos of equality and disability rights. I refer to section 2(<i>b</i>), which relates to integrated education. Who assesses the inconsistency in the education of children with disabilities and how will it be expressed formally? Parents of typically developing children need to have a formal means for registering their concern if there is a child in the class with special needs whose presence may be perceived to be detrimental to the education of all the children in the class.</P>
    <P>Section 3(1) provides for the preparation of education plans by schools and refers to &ldquo;such measures as are practicable&rdquo; in regard to guidelines for children. How will schools record the measures taken? To whom will they be held accountable? The formal designation of alert status for children with special needs before an assessment is conducted would be a useful first step in getting the process under way as a proactive move rather than a later reactive response.</P>
    <P>How long after identification should a child be looked at again by the principal and the decision taken to go for assessment? Who pays for it? Will the assessors be swamped by referrals from principals who want extra resources? How will this be managed and controlled? Is there the potential for the system to get clogged up by the weight of referrals and put to unnecessary expense in processing inappropriate ones? Clear and direct instructions to principals are needed in the first place, with an immediate response advisory panel available to them when considering making a referral. Such an initial step would save time and resources.</P>
    <P>If a school is expected to draw up an education plan for an individual causing concern, what pro<Col N="1311" />cedures are in place if it does not have the expertise to do so? Not every school will have such expertise. There are many schools with a very small complement of staff who may not be conversant with modern developments in the area of special needs. There remain many two teacher and one teacher schools, though most have two, three or four teachers. Will these smaller schools have the expertise required from them in the Bill? What criteria will be given to school principals to determine if someone should be assessed, or does the principal decide that, having five or six slow learners, he or she may as well have them all assessed? We are not criticising but asking the question as to how this will operate.</P>
    <P>Regarding section 5(1)(<i>b</i>) and the drawing up of guidelines, this refers to the importance of adhering to the principle that categories are based on educational needs, not medical diagnosis. The medical model is still in place in the United Kingdom and widely believed to be outdated and obstructive. Attaching rates of resources to medical diagnosis is often wasteful. A child with a specific medical condition may attract more money than he or she really needs, and denies it to another whose needs are more hidden, particularly a behavioural difficulty. One could have a child with a serious physical illness assessed as having very high needs, yet one could also have a child with extreme attention deficit disorder or some other condition who medically might not be so perceived because many medical people do not believe attention deficit disorder exists. There are still some psychiatrists who will claim that disorder is the result of bad parenting. I draw the attention of the Minister to those hidden needs which involve psychological or even social difficulties which impact just as much as the medical model.</P>
    <P>Section 9(3) refers to the appeals board which will be appointed by the Minister. Concern has been expressed about its independence. The Minister might elaborate on its formation. Most cases brought to tribunals in the United Kingdom are settled in favour of the parent, which implies that the panels are independent. It is vital that the appeals board is seen to be made up of credible members and that it acts in the interests of the pupil, without influence from the Department. Perhaps there should be a timescale for activating and finalising the appeals board plan.</P>
    <P>Section 5 seems to imply that the principal of a school could take a quick, cheap and inappropriate route by gathering together a very small group to do the assessment, people who may not be properly qualified to do the job. Could the principal alone carry out an assessment? Section 5 states the assistants or persons may include various categories but it is the principal who decides who will assess the pupil. One could have a situation where the principal alone could decide that he or she was the best person to assess a pupil.</P>
    <P>Section 6 deals with the difficult question of who pays for the resources. There is a blurred <Col N="1312" />distinction between what is seen as the responsibility of the Department of Health and Children and that of the Department of Education and Science. For example, a special supportive chair for a pupil may help a child with posture difficulties and scoliosis but also enable him or her to access and manipulate educational materials. In a situation where cash is finite there is potential for many disputes. The two Departments need an environment in which to work co-operatively as partners rather than as adversaries in deciding on the payment for resources.</P>
    <P>Section 9 refers to the board of management, which some schools do not have. Subsection (3) reads: &ldquo;Where a school is designated under <i>subsection (1), </i>in respect of a particular child, the board of management of that school may, within 4 weeks from the date that the school is informed of the designation, appeal to the Appeals Board&rdquo;. If there no board of management, what is the situation?</P>
    <P>
      <i>Subsection (5) </i>notes that, &ldquo;On the hearing of an appeal under <i>subsection (3),</i> the burden of proving that a school does not have adequate resources to enable it to meet the needs of the school concerned shall be on the board of management of that school.&rdquo;  The education of other children in the school needs to be considered in this regard. The school may have resources for the incoming child who has a difficulty but the effect on others may in some cases be detrimental. While the resources must be available for the incoming child, one must also ensure there is not a reduction in the level of education, or opportunity for education, for those children already in the school.</P>
    <P>Section 14 deals with planning for future educational needs. Planning for such needs should start at the age of 14 years. Individuals with responsibility for the handover to adult services and third level education should attend the annual review of the action plan relating to children over 14 years in order to facilitate a smooth transition from second level schools to third level of whatever adult services are being accessed.</P>
    <P>In section 14(3)(<i>a</i>) and (<i>b</i>) the question arises as to what happens to the assessments carried out in the final 12 months of a pupil's school education. They need to pave the way for a smooth transition to identifiable destinations. These may include local careers advisers, supported job schemes, further study, and adult training facilities. There should be a group with different skills making various contributions to the overall assessment in the last year before a person with a learning difficulty moves on to further education, or even employment after completing second level.</P>
    <P>Section 18(1) deals with implementation of the report. As in the case of the Children Act, the biggest issue involved is one of cost. Many of the provisions in that Act have not been implemented because of the investment required. We still do not have a children's ombudsman nearly four years after the Bill was enacted. We <Col N="1313" />are told it will come on stream next year. I hope that is true because it is an important aspect of that legislation.</P>
    <P>Other provisions of the Children Act, such as those dealing with interviewing delinquent children and involving parents and others in the system, are at an early stage of implementation. It is easy to enact legislation but it is pointless doing so if we do not provide the resources for its implementation.</P>
    <P>The implementation report is a huge undertaking which requires a sound framework and infrastructure to make it effective. Training for staff and parents is essential. Does the Minister have any views on how that will be done? What procedures will be put in place? What training opportunities will be provided for parents and the staff coming on stream? The more effective the training, the less dependent are children and parents on experts whose services cost a great deal for parents and the Department of Education and Science and are availed of by relatively few children. The aim is to provide a quality service for all. Perhaps the Minister will deal with the cost and timescale involved in full implementation of this Bill. Approximately four years ago the question was asked as to how many sections of Acts passed since the foundation of the State have not been implemented because a ministerial order was not made, and the reply given was that it would be too expensive to collate that information.</P>
    <P>Section 18(1)(<i>g</i>) states: &ldquo;to ensure that a continuum of special educational provision is available as required in relation to each type of disability;&rdquo;. We must be careful not to categorise children as having &ldquo;types of disability&rdquo;. We should use the term, &ldquo;groups of children with special needs&rdquo;. That refers to what I said earlier about concentrating on the positive rather than the negative. We should refer to those concerned as &ldquo;children with special needs&rdquo;. Technically speaking, in the English language, they have types of disabilities, but that sends out a negative message. The term &ldquo;children with special needs&rdquo; has a different effect on language and consequently on attitudes towards them.</P>
    <P>The interim period of five years before the Bill is fully implemented is of grave concern. There are many ways the situation on the ground for children and parents can be improved during that time, involving moderate cost but having a highly significant impact. For example, regional appointees for school consortia could have immediate effect in providing widespread training for staff and parents. A range of different options can be examined in that regard. Staff and parents cannot be trained without the required expertise. The cost involved in training them will not be ongoing because they will obtain skills to contribute to the development of the children.</P>

      <P>I welcome the Bill and congratulate the Minister on introducing it at this time. It has been long awaited. This legislation is <Col N="1314" />important to many people. Those with disabilities and special needs must be enabled to reach their full potential. There is a change in thinking. In the past, people with special needs were looked upon as having a problem and, in some case, as being the problem, and as a result were often locked away, imprisoned and hidden. That was wrong and inhumane. We have moved beyond that and now recognise that it is not the person who has the problem, rather it is society and the environment which we construct. This legislation and the disabilities Bill will challenge us to examine how we can change the environment to allow people to reach their full potential.</P>
      <P>The Education for Persons with Disabilities Bill 2003 provides, in the main, for children under 18 years of age. The definition of &ldquo;child&rdquo; is a person of not more than 18 years of age. I suggest that in this instance we should move that age upwards. In many cases children with disability cannot reach their full potential by the time they reach 18 years. It often takes them longer to learn and develop. The Minister should change that provision. Inserting an age limit is problematic.</P>
      <P>The Minister needs to insert into the Bill a section which puts in place an advocacy practice for parents. Many parents do not know where to turn when they discover their child has a disability. They need advice and guidance. Such a service is provided in other countries by way of an advocate who accompanies parents, who are nervous about officialdom, when meeting teachers, principals and psychologists. The Minister should consider this matter carefully and, perhaps, introduce an amendment on Committee Stage to make provision for such a service.</P>
      <P>The best time to intervene is when the disability is first identified. This is especially true in regard to autism. Much of the Bill deals with what happens in schools, but we also need to look at what happens in pre-schools. Training for pre-school teachers who may identify a need is important. The Bill contains no reference to training for teachers, which is very important, at pre-school or secondary level to assist them in identifying children with special needs. That is a major fault in the Bill and the Minister should try to incorporate a provision for such training.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The education committee held a number of meetings on this Bill, which will place a great deal of pressure and responsibility on school principals. The Education (Welfare) Act added to the workload of principals, as did the Education Act. Section 3(1) states: &ldquo;Where the principal of a school is of the opinion that a student in the school is not benefiting from the education programme provided in the school to children who do not have special educational needs to the extent that would be expected of the student, he or she shall take such measures as are practicable to meet the educational needs of the student.&rdquo;  I suggest that principals need support and training to reach that opinion. We must put some measure in place so that principals are not left in the lurch or vulnerable. They need support. I know that the <Col N="1315" />special needs organisers will be there and will, one hopes, support principals.</P>
    <P>The role of special needs organisers as opposed to principals must be more clearly outlined, something that is not done in the Bill. Section 3(2) states: &ldquo;the principal, after consultation with parents, shall arrange for an assessment of the student to be carried out&rdquo;. Does &ldquo;consultation with parents&rdquo; mean &ldquo;permission of the parents&rdquo;? If the parents refuse, can the principal still go ahead? We need clarity on that as it is not clear in the Bill. Is the permission of parents absolutely required?</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy)</NameTxt>
      <P>Many factors have an impact on competitiveness in the economy. Those include fiscal policy, income developments, competition and regulatory frameworks, infrastructure and labour market policies. There is also the overriding consideration that we are a small, open economy which is highly integrated into the global economy through our strong trade and investment links. Therefore, economic conditions in Ireland are largely determined by our ability to supply goods and services to our major trading partners.</P>
      <P>I would naturally be concerned at any slippage in our competitive position. That is why we have consistently been pursuing policies designed to strengthen the economy's competitiveness and thereby its capacity to resume trend growth in more favourable international conditions. Those policies include: the effective management and control of growth in public spending so that it does not add to inflationary pressure; increasing competition in certain sectors of our economy; and continuing to build on the work of the anti-inflation group, which has targeted sources of domestic inflationary pressure. As an economy, we also need to ensure that we limit wage increases to those set out in Sustaining Progress if we are to be in a position to compete in global markets.</P>
      <P>I am confident that those policies are appropriate to sustain non-inflationary economic growth, high levels of employment and conditions in which investment and enterprise can flourish, thereby supporting our competitiveness.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Has the Minister examined his <Col N="1316" />own conscience under the headings which he enunciates as key to Irish competitiveness? Let us take the control of public spending growth. Since 2000, has public spending not grown by over 50%, three times the rate of growth in the Minister's tax base? He advocates an anti-inflation policy. In the past 12 months, has almost 90% of the inflation that we have experienced not come directly from the Government sector, not exclusively from him in indirect taxes, but also from the various State agencies which have secured massive increases in their charges, far ahead of those that apply in the private sector, where price squeezes are experienced?</P>
      <P>Does the Minister not agree that in technology availability we now rank 38th and are behind every single new entrant to the EU? Is that not undermining our capacity to continue to attract important strategic investment to Ireland? Is it not the case that Government policy on broadband, insurance, inflation and waste management is the key to securing long-term competitiveness? In all those areas, we have been found seriously wanting.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>The specific question concerned the slide in Ireland's competitive ranking. I assume the Deputy was referring to the document recently issued by the World Economic Forum. It is not too clear how that analysis was arrived at, and I can go into that in some detail if the Deputy likes. Regarding the matters he raised in his supplementary question, the main purpose of the national development plan is to ensure that we maintain and improve our competitive position &ndash; that was commented on last week by the Economic and Social Research Institute, ESRI.</P>
      <P>The reason that we are spending so much on infrastructure in the areas of which the Deputy speaks is to ensure that we maintain our competitive position. I certainly agree that we increased public spending by fairly substantial amounts in the years between 1997 and 2002. That was possible owing to the success of the economy and the enormous resources at our disposal. We used them to good effect. In the past two years, we have brought current and capital spending to a sustainable level, in line with the new economic situation. In 2001, the growth in public and capital spending was in the order of 22% over the previous year. In 2002, that was down to 14%, and this year the growth is 7%. That is in line with the new economic reality.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister not agree that, while he might put a spin on the experience of the past two or three years, that is very different from the view of the majority of the public, this objective assessment shows that our competitiveness has slid from fourth in the world to 30th, and is falling rapidly? Many of the areas of weakness concern confidence in public institutions and the ability to use money to good effect. I do not wish to encroach on Deputy Burton's next question, but does the evidence not suggest that poor <Col N="1317" />cost control, project selection and management and vast overruns are the litany of our experience? We are now the third highest spenders on health in the European Union and we must have one of the worst public services for those who need care. How can the Minister say that we are getting it right?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>The competitiveness index about which the Deputy speaks is produced by the World Economic Forum. In its analysis, we have moved from 23rd to 30th on the growth competitiveness index, but on the business competitiveness index we have moved from 20th to 21st. That seems to be based on the replies and perceptions of those interviewed. I will make a few points. If the survey applied to all other countries, I suppose we could judge that people thought that. However, we are not aware of the detailed analysis regarding the Irish situation. On the website, only five countries' reports have hitherto been published, namely, Finland, the USA, Sweden, Denmark and Taiwan.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy says, the report takes into account several issues, and I will quote only some. The perception of Government waste deteriorated drastically, marked with lower scores for public trust in politicians. Ireland was ranked 57 there. For the extent of distorting Government subsidies, Ireland was ranked 32. The quality of public institutions was the worst across the board, with the most notable declines evident in the assessment in the independence of the Judiciary and favouritism in the decisions of Government officials. For the former, we were ranked 26 and for the latter 40. I leave it open to Deputy Bruton whether he would think the same about those two categories of public perception. I do not think he would, and neither would I. This type of survey is based on replies and people's perceptions. In the Irish context, it is carried out on behalf of the World Economic Forum by the economics department of UCC. While I do not wish to understate or overstate matters, people should treat it with a certain degree of caution, which is why I have given those two examples.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 2 and 3 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have noted the broadly positive conclusions <Col N="1318" />of the ESRI evaluation of the national development plan, NDP, regarding achievement of strategic objectives and its macro-economic impact. The evaluation concludes that the strategy underpinning the plan is as valid today as it was when the plan was launched. As regards plan objectives, the evaluation indicates that the NDP has made significant progress towards its objectives of continuing sustainable national economic and employment growth and of consolidating and improving Ireland's economic competitiveness. It further concludes that the plan will have a sustainable positive effect on the productive capacity of the economy in the long-term.</P>
    <P>On macro-economic impact, the ESRI report finds that NDP expenditure over the period between 2000 and 2002 raised the level of GNP by over 7% above what it would have been in 2002, and in the long run the level of GNP will be about 3% higher. That represents a real rate of return on NDP investment of about 14%. That is an exceptional economic performance by any standards.</P>
    <P>At sectoral level, I note the prioritisation the ESRI accords to infrastructural investment. That the Government concurs with this prioritisation is shown by the fact that, over the first four years of the plan, the Exchequer has provided almost &euro;1 billion more for economic and social infrastructure than was originally committed. I note the ESRI endorsement of the relative priority the Government has accorded to areas such as education and training, RTDI and child care. Although the ESRI evaluation is purely advisory, it will be an input into the Government's ongoing consideration of its investment priorities. As Deputies will appreciate, the Government's consideration of such priorities has to take account of a number of factors, including value for money and the economic impact of investment. The ESRI report contains much useful guidance in the latter regard.</P>
    <P>I accept that the evaluation contains criticisms of cost over-runs and deficient management of infrastructural projects and programmes. It points to the need to properly evaluate projects. I accept that we must strive to ensure the best value for money in the planning and evaluation of infrastructural projects. My Department is revising the capital appraisal guidelines for public sector capital projects and the revised guidelines will be issued shortly to Departments and public agencies. The existing guidelines, which remain in place, set out guidance in relation to the evaluation, planning and execution of capital projects.</P>
    <P>I stress that the onus for the proper appraisal and management of capital projects rests with the implementing agencies. In the context of the revised guidelines and otherwise, my Department will strive to impress on Departments and implementing agencies the need for best practice in the evaluation and execution of capital projects. I favour, in principle, a multi-annual system of financial envelopes for capital investment, recommended by the ESRI. This would facilitate <Col N="1319" />more efficient project and programme management by giving more certainty in respect of the availability of resources over a number of years.</P>
    <P>I have also been asked about the impact of the plan on regional development. I note the ESRI's conclusion that regional imbalances would probably be greater than they are today if it were not for the policies implemented under the national development plan. I accept that the BMW region is behind the indicative target for infrastructural investment, as set out in the published plan. This reflects the fact that infrastructure gridlock and bottlenecks are most severe in the southern and eastern region, especially in the greater Dublin area. Priority has had to be accorded to major projects in the region for this reason.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB" hpid="Ms Burton Ms Burton">
      <NameTxt>Ms Burton</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad that the Minister acknowledges the deficiencies pointed out to the Government in such trenchant terms by the ESRI. Can he explain to the House the reason the national development plan has failed to upgrade the country's competitive position? We have heard that Ireland has dropped from 23rd to 30th position on the World Economic Forum's competitiveness index. We are almost at the bottom of the table. The national plan should be providing improved roads and communications and for better research and development. Is the Minister aware of the despair in universities and colleges which want such institutions to be the driving force behind the knowledge economy of the future? Is the Government's approach to cuts so short-sighted that it is putting at risk private funding for research at universities and other third level institutions such as that offered by Mr. Chuck Feeney's Atlantic Philanthropies?</P>
      <P>In his sixth year in office can the Minister excuse his failure to put in place a single public infrastructural project which could obtain funding from the national pensions reserve fund? Can he explain how the PPP process has abjectly lost the confidence of the private sector? We have heard over several months that the process is his favourite means of delivering infrastructure. Mr. Michael Somers of the National Treasury Management Agency has pointed out on many occasions that the Government can borrow at the rate of 4.5%, whereas banks and PPPs want a return of 14% or 15%. Despite the offer from the Government, the private sector has lost hope in respect of PPP initiatives.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Does the Minister agree that the national development plan seems doomed to failure under almost every heading? This argument seems particularly valid when one considers that the Minister for Transport, Deputy Brennan, the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Cullen, the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Martin, and the Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources, Deputy Dermot Ahern, have criticised the review. Is the Minister saying he accepts the review? Does he side with the Taoiseach who <Col N="1320" />said there were good and bad elements to it? Does he side with his four ministerial colleagues who have trenchantly rejected the review's detailed criticism of their stewardship of their Departments and the Minister's stewardship of the economy? Can he answer these questions?</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Deputy agree with her colleague, Deputy O'Sullivan, who criticised the ESRI report's recommendations in respect of education? There is nothing unusual about the fact that Ministers have been critical of recommendations made about specific policy areas. I have said the ESRI evaluation is worthwhile and useful as a basis for the Government's future consideration of attitudes. I have said I take on board the criticism of the ESRI which wants the Government to take on board some policy initiatives that no Government would be willing to adopt. I do not think that a Labour Party Government would accept some of the ESRI's recommendations, for example, that mortgage interest relief and film relief be abolished, that congestion charges and road tolls be introduced and that the amount spent on capital projects such as hospitals be reduced. I would be interested to hear the Labour Party advocate its support for these proposals.</P>

      <P>My Cabinet colleagues have mentioned some of the recommendations that will not be adopted but nobody in the House would advocate their adoption. When I mentioned the index produced by the World Economic Forum in my response to the previous question, I argued that a certain element of caution should apply when assessing the forum's conclusions. I remind the House that over 100 countries are assessed by the World Economic Forum. It is not the case that just 20 or 30 are involved.</P>
      <P>Deputy Burton mentioned areas such as third level education. The amount being spent by this Administration in terms of capital expenditure is about 5% of gross national product, twice that in other European countries. One is seeing and will continue to see major improvements in the country's infrastructure. Anyone who has driven to Belfast in recent months will have noticed the great improvements made in the road as far as Dundalk. One can see major infrastructural projects in all parts of the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have pointed out on many occasions that there is nothing to prevent the national pensions reserve fund from investing in any project, provided that the commissioners are satisfied as to the potential of such an investment. Some public private partnerships such as the Kilcock-Kinnegad bypass in County Kildare are being undertaken. The Deputy also mentioned the rates of borrowing for PPPs. With every other Minister for Finance who has ever been in this House, I know that the State will always be able to borrow <Col N="1321" />at a lower rate than anybody else. This is true regardless of the size of the institution or company involved. A state grounded on sound economic principles will always be able to borrow at a lower level. There are other reasons the State should pursue PPPs, as I have alluded to on many occasions.</P>

      <P>It is interesting that the Minister answered Questions Nos. 2 and 3 together, despite the fact that the thrust of the questions is quite different. I accept that the last part of his reply addressed the question that I posed to him. The ESRI report states there has been a mild positive impact on balanced regional development. In other words, matters will get worse if nothing is done &ndash; big deal. Is the Minister aware that one of the four stated objectives of the national development plan was the achievement of balanced regional development? He has informed the House today that expenditure on national primary roads in the BMW region is a little behind the stated target. It is not a &ldquo;little&rdquo; behind, however. Is the Minister not aware that expenditure on national primary roads in the BMW region is almost 50% behind? Expenditure on such roads in the southern and eastern region is almost 50% ahead of schedule.</P>
      <P>Is the Minister not aware that the pattern of the last national development plan is being continued? The gap is widening. Does he not accept that unless major strategic changes are made to the way we dole out resources to the BMW region under the national development plan, the gap will continue to widen? Is he not aware that the GDP figures concerning the BMW region and the southern and eastern region show that the gap is widening and that the employment figures of IDA Ireland and Enterprise Ireland show that from 1996 to 2002, 50,000 extra jobs were created in the south and east while only 4,000 were created in the BMW region?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept that national development plan expenditure is behind the indicative target for the BMW region. However, the previous Fianna Fáil-Progressive Democrats Administration decided to divide the country into two regions. This was not accepted by all parties in the House but it was a good decision. Its purpose was to attract a higher level of EU funding for the Objective One region, which is the BMW region. It has worked well.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Much of the money spent in recent years has been spent in the southern and eastern regions, on projects such as the port tunnel and the roads in the eastern region. Over the period of the plan, I hope the spending on the BMW region will <Col N="1322" />reach the targets set out in the plan. However, the ESRI stated in its evaluation &ndash; the Deputy alluded to this &ndash; that notwithstanding the imbalance in spending, the imbalance would have been greater without investment in the plan.</P>
    <P>Furthermore, in the period 2000 to 2003, there have been some very positive economic indicators concerning the balance between the BMW and the southern and eastern region. For example, employment growth in the BMW region was double that of the southern and eastern region in the period 2000 to 2003. The latest figures for 2000 show that the BMW region has converged towards the EU average <i>per capita</i> GVA figure of 82%. Unemployment in the BMW region is only 1% higher than in the southern and eastern region, notwithstanding historical and structural differences. There was virtual parity in population growth rates in the BMW and southern and eastern regions in the period 1996 to 2006. Therefore, while I accept we have not been able to achieve the indicative investment targets in the first two years of the plan, as pointed out in the ESRI evaluation, I hope we will be able to redress this in the coming years.</P>

      <P>I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that there are subsidiaries of eight Irish financial institutions operating in either the Isle of Man or the Channel Islands. It is known that two further financial institutions closed their Isle of Man operations in recent years. However, it is not possible to state the total number of individual account holders in any particular financial institution.</P>
      <P>There are three investigations ongoing at present and arising from these and other unprompted voluntary disclosures, the Revenue Commissioners have, to date, collected in excess of &euro;118 million from persons holding funds offshore. The Revenue Commissioners will be examining all Irish financial institutions which have or have had subsidiaries operating in offshore jurisdictions with a view to establishing the identity of Irish residents holding funds in such subsidiaries in these jurisdictions.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister share my anger that subsidiaries of Irish financial institutions appear to be used to facilitate wholesale tax evasion? Does he agree that in the case of the Isle of Man alone, the money involved, according to newspaper reports, amounts to &euro;4 billion? This is only one of the potential offshore locations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The financial institutions may state that these subsidiaries have no legal obligation to the Irish <Col N="1323" />Revenue Commissioners, but does the Minister accept that this is good enough? It appears that employees of the financial institutions were actively facilitating the opening of offshore accounts and that their bonuses appeared to be dependent on their success in doing so? Will the Minister indicate whether he believes there is a case for the financial institutions to answer in regard to the facilitation of tax evasion? Does he believe there is a need for Irish law to be changed in some way so the parent companies would have a greater responsibility to ensure that revenue is not being abused and stashed away in this fashion?</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy referred to a figure of &euro;4 billion as allegedly being held offshore in accounts in the Isle of Man. I presume he is referring to a KPMG study of 1999, which mentioned such a figure. The Revenue Commissioners are not in a position to state what the total amount held offshore may be and how much it relates to tax evasion.</P>
      <P>It is not illegal to hold an offshore account and there may be a legitimate commercial reason for the maintenance of such an account. In addition, an individual or resident in the State may not be ordinarily resident or domiciled in the State and therefore would only be taxable to the extent that income was remitted to the State. However, the results of Revenue Commissioners inquiries to date indicate that a considerable number of these accounts may have been opened for the purpose of evading tax.</P>
      <P>As the chairman of the Revenue Commissioners stated in a recent appearance before the Committee of Public Accounts, almost all the positive developments regarding revenue collection in this area can be attributed to the changes to the powers of the Revenue Commissioner that I introduced in the Finance Act 1999. Offshore accounts are held in subsidiaries of Irish institutions which are located abroad and may not be amenable to High Court orders, but the Revenue Commissioners have used their powers under the 1999 Act to address the particular scores they have. As I pointed out, they are currently investigating three Irish financial institutions and, over a period of time, will investigate all the others that are involved.</P>

      <P>I accept what the Minister is saying and, although I was not spokesperson on finance when the legislation was introduced, I am sure he introduced commendable provisions. However, do we still not have financial institutions that appear to be actively promoting and facilitating tax evasion? Furthermore, it seems the Revenue Commissioners are not in a position to prosecute any of these financial institutions. Is this not indicative of a serious breakdown in confidence on the part of the State in financial institutions? What is the Minister's view on the way offshore accounts are being used? What are the <Col N="1324" />lessons for public policy? What will the Minister say to the financial institutions about the terribly alarming findings when he next has an opportunity to meet them?</P>

      <P>By coincidence, I will be in the company of bankers tonight because I will address the Institute of Bankers at its annual dinner, as I have done for some years. It is only fair to point out that the changes introduced in the Finance Act 1999 have enabled the Revenue Commissioners to undertake the investigations in which they are engaged. Other replies to parliamentary questions tabled today give examples of a quite substantial sum of money collected in one such operation. The powers given to the Revenue Commissioners are working. There are eight Irish financial institutions operating in either the Isle of Man or the Channel Islands and it is known that two others closed their Isle of Man operations in recent years. All these will be investigated by the Revenue Commissioners in due course using their existing powers. If further powers are needed in this area &ndash; I have not been asked to provide for such powers by the Revenue Commissioners &ndash; I will consider them.</P>
      <P>On the general question raised by the Deputy, aiding or abetting tax evasion by officers of financial institutions is a criminal offence and has been for some time. The Revenue Commissioners will take that into account in assessing whether charges should be brought. It has always been an offence to aid and abet in the area of tax evasion.</P>

      <P>I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that their offshore assets group has begun an extensive investigation into the use, for the purposes of tax evasion, of offshore bank accounts and trusts by Irish residents. These investigations are at an early stage and the commissioners advise me that they are not yet in a position to establish the total amount held offshore in respect of the cases which have reached settlement as the funds in respect of which these tax settlements were made would have been deposited or held abroad over different periods. Understandably, the immediate focus of the commissioners is on their current investigations but they will, in due course, carry out whatever analysis is possible of tax settlements to obtain an esti<Col N="1325" />mate of the funds held abroad for the purposes of tax evasion.</P>
      <P>The offshore assets group of the Revenue Commissioners has been examining the operation of offshore accounts since the autumn of 2001 and three financial institutions are currently under inquiry with regard to the offshore activities of their subsidiaries. Arising from these investigations and other voluntary disclosures, the commissioners have to date collected in excess of &euro;118 million from persons holding funds offshore.</P>
      <P>The Revenue Commissioners will examine all financial institutions which have or have had subsidiaries operating in offshore jurisdictions with a view to establishing the identity of residents holding funds in these jurisdictions. The investigations, while seeking to establish the identity of residents holding offshore accounts, are also focusing on the institutions' compliance with general tax law and their obligations under the Finance Acts 1992 and 1995 to report to Revenue where they facilitated the opening of an offshore account or the sale of a material interest in an offshore fund.</P>
      <P>The chairman of the Revenue Commissioners recently stated before the Committee of Public Accounts that Revenue would pursue the issue of aiding and abetting tax evasion where evidence emerged that this had occurred. The commissioners are also committed to including aiding and abetting as a prominent feature in all future prosecution programmes.</P>

      <P>In the light of this disclosure, will the Minister withdraw the stupid remark he made on RTE some time ago in which he dismissed any suggestion that tax avoidance and evasion were </P>
      <P>chronic diseases among certain sections of society? Will he also acknowledge that there was and is a substantial pot of gold which has avoided tax and that collecting the rest of it is essential if we are to repair our creaking education and health services on behalf of compliant taxpayers? </P>
      <P>Will the Minister accept that low taxes on income bring a requirement and obligation for all to pay and do not mean that some do not have to pay, which appears to be what many, particularly the rich and wealthy, believe? Will he acknowledge that he, his party and the Progressive Democrats were wrong to suggest there was not widespread tax evasion?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Were all the offshore schemes the product of bank clerks in Caherciveen, Blanchardstown and elsewhere? What does the Minister propose to do with regard to the ethical and moral responsibility of the banking institutions for schemes which facilitated widespread tax avoidance and, in particular, evasion by citizens? Does he propose, for instance, to retain or perhaps even extend the levy on the financial institutions which derived major advantages from the reduction in corporation tax? <Col N="1326" />The schemes cannot have been dreamed up by bank clerks working at counters around the country. They were paid incentives and bonuses and led by the nose by the leadership of the institutions for which they worked.</P>
    <P>When the Minister breaks bread with the banks tonight, as he stated he intends to do, will he say &ldquo;shame&rdquo; to them for robbing and facilitating the robbery of much needed money from our health and education services by somehow &ndash; perhaps by means of osmosis given that, legally, they have nothing to do with it &ndash; spiriting away tens of millions of pounds?

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>The majority of taxpayers and business people are compliant in their tax affairs. I suggest that the level of compliance has increased during the past decade. Anecdotally and from observation, I estimate that the level of tax evasion, on which nobody can put a figure, is much lower than it was ten, 20 and 30 years ago. There have been examples of serious tax evasion in recent years and going back 20, 30, 40 and 50 years. New powers have been given to the Revenue Commissioners and the attitude to tax compliance is much different in 2003 than it was, say, in 1963 or 1973.</P>
      <P>With regard to the Deputy's questions on the financial institutions, as I stated in my reply to Deputy Richard Bruton, it was and remains an offence to aid and abet tax evasion. I am sure the Deputy's reference to a levy concerned the additional stamp duty I introduced in last year's budget for the financial institutions. This will apply in 2003, 2004 and 2005.</P>

      <P>Under the Comptroller and Auditor General (Amendment) Act 1993, individual Accounting Officers are responsible for economy and efficiency in their organisations and the maintenance of systems, procedures and practices for the purpose of evaluating effectiveness. Thus, Accounting Officers must take account of the lessons arising from the various forms of evaluation conducted on programmes and activities coming within their remit, including: the expenditure reviews which the Departments and Offices carry out under the terms of the expenditure review initiative; evaluations conducted by or on behalf of the NDP-CSF evaluation unit, which has responsibilities in respect of evaluation of the national development plan; and the annual reports and any value for money reports of the Comptroller and Auditor General and any reports by the Committee of Public Accounts thereon.</P>
      <P>In addition, recommendations contained in the various evaluation reports are taken into account by spending Departments and the Department of Finance in the resource allocation decisions which arise in the context of the annual Estimates process. The process of evaluation by the Comptroller and Auditor General and scrutiny by the Committee of Public Accounts is taken very seriously by Accounting Officers and my Department. In addition, where specific recommendations are made by the Committee of Public Accounts in its reports, the Minister for Finance responds to them in his reply entitled, The Minute of the Minister for Finance on the Report of the Committee of Public Accounts. These formal responses are prepared by the Department of Finance in consultation with the Departments concerned and, as well as being sent to the Committee of Public Accounts, the minute is referred as a Department of Finance circular to all Accounting Officers.</P>
      <P>On foot of a recommendation of the working group on the accountability of Secretaries General and Accounting Officers published by the Government last January, my Department is finalising a document highlighting the most important issues identified in recent reports of the Comptroller and Auditor General and the Committee of Public Accounts. This document will be circulated to all Accounting Officers before the end of the year.</P>

      <P>While I welcome the circulation of the document, I wish to address the question <Col N="1328" />of whether any lessons are being learned. Specifically, to bring the matter home to roost, I raise the case of the Punchestown project which was approved within two months. The Minister approved funding of 100% within seven days. It doubled in cost and the Minister again approved it within 14 days. Is the Minister aware that the Comptroller and Auditor General has expressed concern that no cost benefit analysis was done of the project before it was approved, it did not follow the Department of Finance guidelines, there was no independent technical advice, no research on the needs, no projections of the running costs or the revenue of the project, no quantification of the benefits, no other providers who might have offered were asked to offer an alternative and the project was not even referred to the legal adviser of the Department of Agriculture and Food?</P>
      <P>Does the Minister not agree that if he was involved so closely in approving, with rapid turnaround, a project which breached every rule in the book, it undermines his attempt to lecture other Accounting Officers as to how they should conduct themselves?</P>

      <P>The Minister expresses confidence in the management of the various Departments. Is he not alarmed at what has happened with the scheme arranged with the religious orders to deal with indemnity for child abuse? That is a huge cost facing the taxpayer. The Minister's former colleague, Deputy Woods, went AWOL and in a court case today, arising out of proceedings initiated in 1999, the State took full liability. Is the Minister offering that as an example of good management? In any country in the world, the Government responsible for such a scheme would be severely rebuked. There is another example in Cork, the astonishing saga of the Cork School of Music. Is the Minister not concerned that something which was due to cost &euro;30 million now has a price tag of up to &euro;300 million attached to it?</P>

      <P>Has the Minister any concept of the astonishment and anger among the public about the Comptroller and Auditor General's report in which he draws attention to the Punchestown Racecourse project? How does the Minister respond to the finding of the Comptroller and Auditor General that the conditions governing the State's financial support were covered only by an exchange of letters and had not been referred to the Department of Agriculture and Food's legal advisers to ensure that they were properly constructed and legally sound? The Minister must answer to this House and be accountable to it. It is not good enough to say that this issue is being addressed in a committee <Col N="1329" />of one or both Houses of the Oireachtas. It is a scandal that a centre that will cater to a sporting sector which is swimming in wealth has such a commitment from the Government, and the Minister personally, while other sporting and voluntary organisations are competing for a limited fund under the sports capital programme and are being ignored.</P>

Would the Minister agree with the official from the Department of Finance that decision-making within the Department of Agriculture and Food was the result of the strategic management initiative, which allows the Department to make decisions of this nature without further recourse to the Department of Finance regardless of how far the cost of a project goes above its original cost? In addition, the Punchestown project was approved without a feasibility study being conducted by the Department on the need for such a centre or any business plan being supplied by Punchestown Racecourse or the trustees of the fund that controls the racecourse, the Kildare Hunt. Does the Minister accept that this is the right way to allocate public money?</P>

The Minister is responsible for ensuring we have a system of financial accountability and prudence that works, yet in this case he paid no attention to the fact that his guidelines were not observed.

      <P>Deputy Burton asked about the residential institutions redress scheme. That has also been the subject of debate in the Committee of Public Accounts. The committee has not finalised its deliberations on it and is due to revisit the subject. She also asked about the Cork School of Music. On account of the projected cost rising from the initial figure of &euro;30 million to a considerably higher amount, the Cork School of Music project has not gone ahead. The Department of Finance has not sanctioned it because the cost figure has increased substantially.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Ó Caoláin asked about the legal advisers in the Department of Agriculture and Food. The Deputy will have been able to put these questions at the meeting of the Committee of Public Accounts. I am not sure if he is a member but Deputy Boyle is, and these questions will have been put to the Accounting Officer of the Department of Agriculture and Food. The sports capital programme, during my term as Minister <Col N="1330" />for Finance, has been increased from a very low figure to a cumulative amount, over five years, of over &euro;200 million. Examples of the benefits of the sports capital programme are seen the length and breadth of the country and, indeed, in Cork city and county.</P>
    <P>Deputy Boyle asked a question relating to the strategic management initiative. I do not know what the Department's official said to the committee. I am sure it was pointed out that up to recent years everything was so tightly controlled in the Department that the management of other Departments had no power to do anything. Each year Deputies and Ministers came to the House to complain about micro management in the Department of Finance. Under the strategic management initiative the Departments are allowed to get on with the job. They are given an allocation, subject to certain rules which must be obeyed, and it is up to them to manage their projects. Deputies who served in Government previously will be aware of the stringency with which the Department of Finance operated. In the 1960s and 1970s, Departments could do virtually nothing. Under the strategic management initiative more discretion is allowed to Departments so the initiative has been good in that respect.</P>
    <P>Deputy Bruton asked about financial accountability. The Punchestown centre is a welcome facility for the country. It is used for many events. The Department of Agriculture and Food had wanted the centre for a considerable amount of time and I am satisfied that it will be of considerable benefit not only to the immediate hinterland but to the country.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is essentially saying that if he has a political preference for something, these procedures do not matter a damn. Surely the Department would, at a minimum, have a checklist if the cost of a project is to be double the forecast cost. Before the Minister would approve it, he would want to know if a cost benefit analysis had been carried out, if the Department's guidelines had been followed, if research had been conducted and if legal advisers had been consulted. None of those questions was asked by either the Minister or his Department. He cannot say to the House that he is presiding over good financial management if that is what is happening.</P>

      <P>I announced last December that there would be a reduction of 5,000 in authorised numbers in the public service over the next three years. I have made it clear on numerous occasions since that I want to avoid or minimise the effect on front line staff providing a service for the public and ensure essential services to the public are not affected. I consulted my ministerial colleagues on their contribution to the reduction in that context.</P>
      <P>The Government approved my proposals on the timing and distribution of 4,300 of the 5,000 reduction last June. The breakdown by sector is as follows: health sector &ndash; a total reduction of 600; education sector &ndash; a total reduction of 1,000; Civil Service &ndash; also a reduction of 1,000; the Garda Síochána &ndash; no reduction; the Defence Forces &ndash; a reduction of 400; local authorities &ndash; a reduction of 1,000 and a reduction of 300 in the non-commercial State-sponsored bodies. I recognise that additional possibilities of achieving reductions in numbers may emerge at a later stage. Accordingly, I intend to revisit this issue early in 2004 to see where the balance of 700 posts can be identified.</P>
      <P>The implementation of the reduction in individual organisations is a matter for the management of each organisation. In the context of the substantial increases in public service numbers in recent years, the reduction is small enough to be manageable without having a serious effect on service delivery. In keeping with the partnership approach to industrial relations in the public service, I encourage dialogue with staff representatives on the implementation of the reduction in individual organisations. The Government decision to reduce numbers by 5,000 was announced by me in my Budget Statement in December 2002 and accordingly known to all parties when the Sustaining Progress agreement was negotiated earlier this year.</P>

      <P>I ask the Minister to reply to my question. I remind him that this is only his third time to speak in the House since this session commenced. We do not get to meet him often or hear him give explanations. The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform indicated during the week that the 2,000 additional gardaí were back on the agenda. We know there is a dire shortage of gardaí and community gardaí throughout the country. How does the Minister reconcile the crisis in policing with his determination to cut the number of public service employees? If he is sticking to his agenda to cut the number of public service employees, does he agree with the Mini<Col N="1332" />ster for Justice, Equality and Law Reform that he will look at the requirement for 2,000 extra gardaí, as indicated this week?</P>

      <P>The question to which I have not heard any answer is how the Minister will ensure these cuts do not impact on public service delivery. How will he ensure they do not hit patients who need care, for example? I do not know what it is like in his constituency but in mine the home help service hours are being cut in half and day care and respite care services are unable to cope. These are front line services. It seems bureaucracy is being protected, while front line services are suffering. How will the Minister cut 4,300 or 5,000 jobs without affecting such services? How will he ensure such cuts come from administration overheads, not from front line services? Can he indicate how he will achieve this?</P>

      <P>In last year's Budget Statement I specifically said &ndash; it took a number of months to finalise it &ndash; that there would not be any effect on front line staff. It is up to each individual line manager in Departments and agencies to follow this policy. I have given an outline of where the figures come from. It is up to the particular organisations to do their job. There was a dramatic increase in the number of public servants between 1997 to 2002. The figure I gave on budget day was 280,000. There was an increase of 50,000 in the previous five years. It was one of the reasons for the substantial increase in current spending at the time which was necessary as extra staff were needed in the areas of health and education. The reduction will not affect front line services. Given the substantial increase in public service numbers in recent years, a reduction of 5,000 is not too much. It is a realistic figure which should be easily achieved.</P>

      <P>When the Minister says such cuts will not have any effect on front line services, I do not have any doubt that we could give him examples of where that is not the case for many affected in our constituencies. I cite one example of the day care centre in Cootehill, County Cavan. A new health centre was provided with a day care centre facility which has not yet been humanly resourced. It needs four people &ndash; a nurse administrator, a driver and two assistants &ndash; to provide daily care five days a week for the senior citizens in the town and its extensive hinterland.</P>

      <P>It would cater for 200 people in one week, yet the appointments have not been made. Voluntary groups such as the senior citizens' group in Cootehill and others which work to aid the needs of senior citizens in our community have been offered a turn of the key in the door in that they can access and use a health board facility without human resource assistance, while providing their own public liability insurance. When the Minister says it will not have an effect in such instances, that is not true because that is exactly what has happened. I appeal to him to ensure the situation I outlined, which is only one example and repeated elsewhere, as Deputy Richard Bruton said, is not allowed to continue and that the embargo on recruitment for front line services is lifted with immediate effect from the start of 2004. He must do this.</P>

      <P>Deputies may be slightly confused about the decision to reduce numbers in the public service with overall cost reductions in some agencies. There may be an overlap between some of them. The specific question relates to the reduction in the number of jobs in the public service. Line managers in various organisations may be taking steps to live within their budgets, which they should have taken some time ago. It may not be connected to the reduction in numbers. The reduction in numbers in the public service does not relate to front line staff. That was the Government's decision but it is up to each body <Col N="1334" />to do its job. The other reductions may have something to do with overall management or cost efficiencies with which managers must deal.</P>

      <P>Deputy Boyle asked if I believed in social capital. There has not been a Minister for Finance in the history of the State who did more about it. Instead of talking about it, I increased numbers in the public service, particularly in health and education, by 50,000 in the previous five years. I increased public spending twofold during the period in many of the areas to which the Deputy referred. The additional costs in health and education related mostly to people because that is what the services needed. I cannot lightly resist the allegation that I have done nothing about it. No Minister for Finance has ever increased public spending in these areas by as much as I have.</P>

      <P>I refer the Deputy to the annual reports on Ireland's participation in the Bretton Woods institutions and also to the World Bank website which explains in greater detail the use of funds by the International Development Association. By providing long-term loans at zero interest and grants for the poorest of the developing countries, the IDA helps build the human capital, policies, institutions and physical infrastructure these countries urgently need to achieve faster, environmentally sustainable growth. The IDA's goal is to reduce disparities across and within countries, especially in access to primary education, basic health and water supply and sanitation and bring more people into the mainstream by raising their productivity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While the bulk of IDA financing &ndash; more than 70% in the 2002 financial year &ndash; is for investment projects, the IDA also provides adjustment credits which help governments finance their <Col N="1335" />overall development expenditures, including teacher salaries, operations and maintenance of health centres, road rehabilitation and agricultural extension in the context of macro-economic and sectoral reform programs. To help governments introduce reform programmes the IDA advises on the best policies for attaining broad based economic growth and reducing the vulnerability of the poor to economic shocks.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Boyle</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for his answer and understand there is a Bill to come before the House which deals with this matter. Our contribution to the International Development Association counts towards our overall contribution to overseas development aid. The small amount of money in the current allocation needs to be measured against the Taoiseach's commitment to reaching the target of allocating 0.7% of GNP to overseas development aid by 2007. I acknowledge that &euro;100 million was allocated in last year's budget but we need to allocate between &euro;150 million and &euro;175 million in each succeeding budget to reach the target. I offer the Minister the opportunity of affirming that this commitment will be honoured.</P>

Ireland's contribution towards overseas development aid in terms of GNP was 0.41% from 2000 to 2003, considerably more than that of most of our European colleagues and the USA.

      <P>Will the Minister not engage in a critical debate with the IMF and World Bank institutions? While some of their policies, particularly those of the World Bank, have improved slightly in recent years, the IMF is responsible for extremely right wing, destructive economic policies which, especially in sub-Saharan Africa, have pauperised large areas. Is the Minister aware that Zambia, which followed the IMF advice of the mid to late 1980s, is now virtually destitute? Zimbabwe spent money on health and education according to the advice of the World Bank and the IMF but when the institutions called in their money this, with the effects of political corruption, caused the destitution of its economy. Do the Minister and his officials engage in dialogue with the institutions with a view to persuading them to address the real needs of poor people? It is not good enough simply to increase the amount of Irish aid if at the same time the IMF is practis<Col N="1336" />ing policies which are devastating large areas of the world, particularly in Africa.</P>

We have been putting across our point of view in the context of the Bretton Woods institutions and representatives from Ireland have publicly spoken at the last number of World Bank-IMF meetings outlining our position. There have been considerable changes in the operation of the institutions. I would not be foolish enough to say everything is perfect but they have taken on board a number of the concerns of people in Ireland and other countries.

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>I am satisfied with the transparency of the arrangements in place for public private partnership projects. As I said in a reply on 30 September 2003 to a similar question in this House, overall value for money in privately financed projects is assessed by comparing Exchequer cash flows under a more traditional procurement with the cash flows arising in the privately financed PPP tender. The private financing is an integral part of this assessment but one which is so significant it merits separate consideration. I established the National Development Finance Agency for this purpose. One of its functions is to advise on the optimal means of financing public investment projects. The NDFA brings financial expertise to this role and I have provided it with the necessary flexibility to carry out its functions and apply its professional judgment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A State authority can contract with the private <Col N="1337" />sector to build a facility while financing this itself at the cost of Government funds &ndash; currently about 4.3% for long-term money. That is the general test applied to the financing element of any alternative package. Alternatively, a State authority can seek an all-in package from the private sector which would include the design, construction and maintenance package and also a financing mechanism. In assessing whether such a package is good value for money many issues arise, including the comparative cost of funds, the degree of risk transfer, quality of product, maintenance quality and so on.</P>
    <P>I intend that any additional cost associated with private finance will only be incurred where the overall value for money assessment warrants it. The NDFA will assess all proposed private financing packages on a case-by-case basis. Where non-Exchequer funding is to be used and in the opinion of the authority the overall cost of the private financing package is excessive, taking into account risk transfer factors, it may offer NDFA financing in its place. It will be a matter for the relevant State authority directly concerned with a project to decide which package to accept after reflecting on NDFA advice. All PPP projects are subject to the normal rules of accountability and scrutiny, including audit by the Office of the Comptroller and Auditor General and accountability to this House via the Committee of Public Accounts and other relevant Dáil and joint Oireachtas committees.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">

      <P>The Minister will probably not agree with me that virtually 99% of defects in the management of public projects have fallen not on the funding side but in the areas of cost evaluation, project management and so on. Funding has not been a big problem. The reason I tabled this question, however, was the most unsatisfactory meeting with officials from the Department of Finance at the Joint Committee on Finance and the Public Service, during which it transpired that under no circumstances would any other comparator be made available to interested persons in the Oireachtas. There would be no opportunity for us to see whether, as the Minister says, the funding element of the package was competitive with the public borrowing alternative. How can the Minister say this will be perfectly transparent when officials of his Department have told the committee they will not reveal this part of the process? They offered very spurious grounds of confidentiality suggesting that open analysis would undermine the chance of the public getting good value and that it was much better to have secrecy to secure good value.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The history of secrecy versus open analysis yielding good value to the taxpayer is a sorry one and we do not have to look far to see that is the case. Will the Minister not think again about the transparency and the obligation of the National <Col N="1338" />Development Finance Agency and sponsors to produce some public indication, albeit aggregate, of the comparison that was made and how the two stack up against one another?</P>

      <P>The Deputy is asking the reason the public sector benchmark is confidential. It is my intention that it will remain confidential for a number of obvious reasons. There would be pressure to disclose the expected price to bidders and if I did so it would be a nonsense. I intend to keep it confidential for the following reasons: it incentivises competition; it is a key factor in encouraging innovation; it safeguards commercially sensitive information; it enables bidders to use professional expertise in identifying best approaches to delivering outputs; it encourages an approach to service delivery that spans traditional boundaries; it incentivises different improved design and service solutions to those contained in the public sector benchmark; it incentivises flexibility; and it focuses suppliers on re-engineering business to reduce costs.</P>

      <P>The presentation made by the Minister's officials to the Joint Committee on Finance and the Public Service included a flow chart with something like 20 steps that they have now included in their version of public private partnership. Looking at it &ndash; I am sure the Minister agrees as a fellow accountant &ndash; one can see that it will cost a fortune in terms of the services of accountants and legal advisers for the bidders. This is one of the reasons PPPs will be so horrendously expensive for the public purse. We are entitled to know why a PPP is considered more attractive in net terms. The Minister has told us the general reasons but the State can borrow 4.5%. Mr. Somers, who has an excellent record in financial management, has said there is no reason items such as schools and financial institutions should be built by PPP yet the Minister has decided, in the form of PPP he is opting for, to keep the full comparative costs hidden from the Dáil. Will the Minister have a change of heart and make the full comparative information available to the Dáil?</P>

      <P>The Deputy appears to be deliberately confusing two particular principles. It is not only Dr. Somers who stated that. I have said on many occasions in this House over a long period of years, and I repeat it now, that the State will always be in a position to borrow funds at a lower rate than any institution. That has been, is and will remain the position but the reasons for going down the PPP route in this country and other countries do not solely relate to the cost of funds. In the United Kingdom they can borrow at a very attractive rate&mdash;</P>

They definitely did their job when we allocated that project in that area, as the Deputy knows well, and some people are very sore about it.</P>

      <P>I am pleased to raise this important issue in the House and I look forward to hearing the Minister of State's reply. There is a great deal of concern among members of the community in Galbally due to the proposal to demolish the existing Garda station and replace it with a modern one. That might seem a contradiction in terms but I will elaborate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I warmly welcome the pilot scheme initiated by the Minister of State, Deputy Parlon. There is a great need to replace, to use the Minister's words, old RIC barracks that have become outdated and <Col N="1341" />unsuitable for the needs of the gardaí who operate in them and for the public in gaining access to them. The majority of the locations named by the Minister in the proposal require such action to take place.</P>
    <P>I am not sure whether it is a misconception or misinformation but there is a great deal of concern in Galbally because the existing Garda station is not an old RIC type station, it is a relatively modern building which has benefited from the investment of a good deal of State funding in recent years. It also has living accommodation for gardaí who can opt to reside there if they wish. It is not in a condition that warrants being demolished. If the station is not demolished, the proposed new station cannot be sited on the grounds of the existing station, and that is causing a great deal of concern. The people of Galbally, the community council and the local superintendent in Tipperary town are supportive of the view that this station should be dealt with on a different basis. The Minister might seriously consider doing that, given the welcome there is for his proposal to upgrade the other stations.</P>
    <P>None of us knows what the new modern Garda station will be like. It has been described as a hut, a box and in various other ways. I am of the opinion that it would not be suitable accommodation for gardaí. A holding cell would not be provided and while it may be a more modern office in terms of the administrative work done by gardaí, it would be a mistake to proceed along the lines the Minister is suggesting. I know the Minister is glad to have the opportunity to clarify the matter for me and I look forward to his response.</P>

      <P>I thank the Deputy for his question and appreciate the opportunity to clarify the issue.</P>
      <P>Following a recent survey carried out by the Commissioners of Public Works, in excess of 100 Garda stations have been deemed to be of poor quality and in need of major refurbishment. Many of these stations are dispersed throughout the country and consist mostly of older buildings now used as either one man stations or for a small number of hours each week. The cost of refurbishment would be very substantial and cannot be funded from existing resources. Various options have been considered to alleviate this problem. The Commissioners of Public Works consider that the best way forward is to engage in an equity exchange programme with the private sector.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The programme will involve the disposal to private developers of certain Garda stations which would need significant refurbishment to bring them to an acceptable standard, in exchange for alternative good quality premises which meet modern standards. These alternative <Col N="1342" />premises may be either newly built or may be existing buildings that satisfy Office of Public Works specifications and Garda requirements. One of the conditions of this scheme will be that no existing station will be closed or disposed of until a suitable replacement is ready for occupation. As a first step, it is intended to run a pilot scheme covering eight Garda stations clustered in the Tipperary-Limerick area. The Commissioners of Public Works have discussed these stations with the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform and are awaiting the final agreement of the Garda Commissioner.</P>
    <P>The commissioners are currently in the process of selecting a private agent to manage the pilot programme on their behalf. The agent will advise the commissioners on the commercial values of the stations concerned; organise the transfer of the properties; evaluate and make recommendations on proposals received from interested developers; and project-manage the entire pilot programme. The commissioners consider that the equity programme is an innovative way to release value from their portfolio to achieve the necessary objective of upgrading over 100 Garda stations in the most timely and cost efficient manner.</P>
    <P>The programme, which is being driven by the Office of Public Works in consultation with the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform and the Garda authorities, is additional to the ongoing Garda maintenance programme and will be of benefit to the gardaí, the local communities and the State. The programme does not involve the closure of any of the Garda stations involved. It is an essential element of the programme that none of the stations involved is closed until the replacement is ready for occupation.</P>
    <P>The pilot programme includes Galbally Garda station, County Limerick. This is a two storey building with occupied married quarters located on the edge of the village. The recent survey indicates that the building requires major refurbishment. Renovation work is required to all areas, including general building works, electrics, heating system and fire security. The estimated cost is in excess of &euro;100,000.</P>
    <P>Any new building will be built to the exact specifications of both the Garda authorities and Office of Public Works. If living quarters are required by the gardaí, they will be provided. There will be no reduction in the level of Garda operations in Galbally as a result of the programme.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryUpton" hpid="Dr. Upton Dr. Upton">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Upton</NameTxt>
      <P>As far back as 1974 it was proposed by the Department of Education and Science that the award of art teacher certificate on the results of the technical schools examinations in art be abolished. However, arising from an almost unbe<Col N="1343" />lievable level of incompetence, mismanagement and mistakes, the system persisted and has yet to be finally resolved.</P>
      <P>In October 1999, in a letter to the Department of Education and Science, one of my constituents set out clearly the case that she had been making over many years. In effect, she was admitted to a course, sat the appropriate examinations and passed the teacher qualifying course. It was a reasonable assumption on her part that she was entitled to be considered qualified. However, in a reply to her, the then Minister stated that her assumption had pre-supposed that anyone who was admitted to such a course met all the requirements of entry. The Minister admits that human error had a part to play in the 1972 case. He admits that colleges admitted students and that his Department was not involved on the interview board. In effect, what the Minister was saying was that a mistake was made by the college or Department and that the applicant was to be punished for this mistake.</P>
      <P>The consequences of these mistakes for the teachers of art at the time was that they were considered to be unqualified and did not qualify for permanent appointment or for advancement on the incremental salary scale. There was bungling in the management of the recording of results and in the placing of advertisements in national newspapers to allow potential candidates to apply for additional courses and there was failure to attach examinations to any particular course or curriculum, failure to provide a syllabus for the principles of teaching of art and failure to communicate results to students in a structured way.</P>
      <P>It is of some note that Ciaran Benson, an expert in this area, stated in his book <i>The Place of Art in Irish Education </i>as follows:</P>
      <P>Until recently the strangest anomaly in Irish teacher training must have been the Technical School examinations. Examinations could be taken by anyone who paid the examination fee. Examinations could be taken in any order &ndash; advanced examinations before intermediate examinations.</P>
      <P>Others in the professional area had similar views.</P>
      <P>The response of the Department was to offer to provide a course in Sligo in 1977. The course was not provided and a further three years elapsed without progress. A later promise to hold another course was also broken. The litany of farce continued, with contradictions, inequalities and failure on the part of the Department to provide or structure any reasonable offer to people trapped in this quandary. The people who have been trapped in the quagmire of bungling and bureaucracy are surely now entitled to a full inquiry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is useful to note, in the context of freedom of <Col N="1344" />information, that a document from a Department official dated November 2001 notes the following</P>
    <P>There is no doubt that the situation as portrayed was less than adequate in some cases, e.g. the recording of results, the absence of a definite syllabus in the principles of teaching art before 1975, the delay in responding to articulated needs in the late 70s, the conflicting demands stated for entrance to the proposed course in 1981 to overcome the problems associated with existing requirements needed to qualify under memo v31 and the fact that such a course was not provided then or in subsequent years. This was the responsibility of the key personnel involved at that time and the department should apologise for this.</P>
    <P>This debate does not need further airing. The wrong that has been done to these teachers should be rectified and due recognition should be given to those who suffered for many years because of the bungling of the Department. The net outcome is that these people could not be made permanent and were not on an incremental scale. They have suffered for many years as a result.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am replying on behalf of my colleague, the Minister for Education and Science. The issue raised by the Deputy relates to a relatively small number of teachers of art who have been employed in the system for a significant number of years and whose traditional route to full qualification as art teachers was through the Department of Education and Science's technical schools examination system. The final technical schools examination in art was held in 1988.</P>
      <P>To enable such teachers, who had attempted to qualify as second level teachers of art through the technical schools examinations system but who had failed to do so, gain suitable recognised qualifications, the Department of Education and Science arranged for the provision of a one year course by the National College of Art and Design in the 2001-02 academic year. This course was repeated in the 2002-03 academic year.</P>
      <P>Any teacher who successfully completed the courses in question is recognised as fully qualified and may be appointed in a permanent capacity to a post as a teacher of art and paid at the appropriate point on the incremental salary scale for teachers. Prior to making the course in question available, the teachers concerned were deemed unqualified and did not qualify for permanent appointment or for advancement on the incremental salary scale.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the teachers in question have relevant non-teaching experience, they may qualify for the award of incremental credit in respect of such experience. Applications for the award of such credit should be submitted to the relevant <Col N="1345" />vocational education committee, in the case of vocational teachers, or to the Department of Education and Science in Athlone in the case of teachers employed in the voluntary secondary, community or comprehensive school sectors.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Education and Science is aware that some of the teachers in question, who completed the courses organised in 2001-02 and 2002-03 and were accorded recognition as a result, continue to have concerns regarding the recognition of their service prior to the availability of these courses. The Department of Education and Science is currently considering this issue.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure the Minister has been inundated by his constituents in Kildare who work in the film industry, as I have by mine. I understand other public representatives have also been contacted. We are not talking about the blockbuster type films but about painters, designers, carpenters, part-time workers, editors and people who have been employed in the film industry over recent years. It would be a shame if this industry was undermined by the scrapping of section 481 of the 1997 Act, as the Minister indicated in the last budget. Time is running out for decisions to be made on this matter and I am sure the Minister has been lobbied strongly on it.</P>
      <P>There is no doubt the statistics speak for themselves given the amount of money generated in the economy since the section's introduction and the amount of employment generated which runs to the thousands and is increasing all the time. I read in today's newspapers and yesterday the Joint Committee on Finance and the Public Service heard the concerns of the Department of Finance about tax evasion and the use of tax havens and loopholes in taxation legislation. The figure given for non-compliance was 6.4%. This means a compliance rate of 94.6%, which is good. If there has been abuse in the system it should not be difficult to eliminate the loopholes. The benefits of this exemption will far outweigh any abuse that may have taken place.</P>
      <P>The best gauge of this benefit is the flood of letters from people throughout the country saying that they have been employed only since the tax exemption was introduced. Before the exemption was introduced the film industry generated only &euro;10 million annually. It now generates more than &euro;200 million annually and employs between 5,000 and 6,000 on a full-time basis and many more on a part-time basis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not like to see tax relief given unnecessarily. In my constituency there are urban renewal tax exemption schemes which should have been abolished a couple of years ago. There is massive development in Smithfield, for example, where developers receive a 100% tax write-off. This <Col N="1346" />development is investment driven whereas it should be related to the housing needs of the community.</P>
    <P>In the area of tax relief for film production there is a low level of non-compliance and a massive level of employment and income for the Exchequer. It would be a shame to do away with this provision. I hope the Minister will rethink his proposal.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>As the House is probably aware, tax relief for the film industry was first introduced in 1984 under the business expansion scheme and has continued in various forms for the past 19 years. This makes it one of the longest running sector specific taxes in the economy and has seen an Exchequer contribution in terms of tax foregone in the order of &euro;265 million in the past ten years alone. This relief has continued over time against a backdrop of the widening of the tax base and the reduction of rates generally. The termination of this relief is part of a larger package to maintain our low income and corporation tax rates. As I said in my budget speech last year, reliefs narrow the tax base &ndash; a widened tax base is the price that must be paid to keep tax rates low and this is a price worth paying. Therefore, all tax reliefs must be kept under review.</P>
      <P>In that context I announced in the budget that a number of reliefs across a range of sectors, including film relief, would not be extended beyond 31 December 2004. These reliefs include the urban renewal scheme, the town renewal scheme, the scheme of relief for the construction of multi-storey car parks, the rural renewal scheme, the living over the shop scheme, the park and ride scheme, the student accommodation scheme and the relief for expenditure incurred on certain buildings used for third level educational purposes. In addition, in the budget and Finance Act 2003 I also announced a termination date for the special capital allowances regimes for hotels and holiday cottages, subject to transitional provisions which provided for the continued availability of the regime until 31 December 2004 for certain pipeline projects.</P>
      <P>No one is arguing that these reliefs have not been of benefit. Special reliefs have played an important role in many areas and in the development of many business sectors. However, the key value in such reliefs is in kick-starting such developments rather than providing ongoing support on a permanent basis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While there may be a case for maintaining each of these reliefs the case for broadening the tax base and keeping tax rates low is even stronger. These reliefs have generally been availed of by high earners to reduce their effective income tax rate, a fact confirmed by the latest report on high earners by the Revenue Commissioners. It is also worth mentioning that the ESRI, in its mid-term evaluation of the NDP, acknowledged that the <Col N="1347" />film industry has received substantial support through the tax system and that having provided incentives for the infant industry total public provision should be much less generous from now on.</P>
    <P>The after-tax rate of return for the investor in film production for a low risk investment was estimated by Indecon Economic Consultants in 1998 to be in the order of 24% on cash outlay. With the fall in personal income tax rates form 46% to 42%, the return, based on this model, is in the order of approximately 7% to 13.5% depending on the precise financing arrangements. However, it still represents one of the best post-tax returns on the market at the moment for a one year investment. The investor has the added assurance of pre-sales agreements and indemnity bonds when the decision to invest is being taken.</P>
    <P>My attention has been drawn to the fact that many other countries such as the UK, Canada and Australia have tax incentives and other forms of State aid for film production. However, all these countries have higher corporation tax rates than our rate of 12.5%. If these countries adopted our approach of maintaining a low corporation tax rate as a means to encourage enterprise and stimulate employment it is not likely that they would also be in a position to retain a wide range of sectoral specific reliefs such as tax incentives for film production over the long-term. Having low tax rates and a plethora of reliefs simultaneously is not a long-term viable option. It is widely acknowledged that low tax rates have been a critical factor in our present high employment situation.</P>
    <P>  I am aware of the views of many in the film sector that have been expressed, either directly to me by way of representations or indirectly through the media, with regard to the economic and social impacts of the termination of this relief in December 2004. The Minister for Arts, Sport and Tourism has recently forwarded to me a copy of a study reviewing the relief that was commissioned jointly by his Department and the Irish Film Board. I have asked officials of my Department to examine this study. However, as things stand the position with regard to the 31 December 2004 termination date for this relief remains unchanged.</P>

      <P>Recently, when Deputy Finian McGrath and I were standing at the gate of Leinster House awaiting the return of Deputy Joe Higgins from prison we were approached by a family with a young adult son who were picketing the Dáil. They were at their wits end. They had gone through every possible avenue in an attempt to get a day placement for their son and had totally failed. They had approached various public <Col N="1348" />representatives but nothing had happened. In despair they approached Deputy McGrath and myself at the gate and asked us to help.</P>
      <P>We tabled parliamentary questions following that encounter and the reply to my question was as follows:</P>
      <P>Responsibility for the provision of services to persons with an intellectual disability and those with autism in the Dublin region rests with the Eastern Regional Health Authority. Therefore, my Department has asked the chief executive office of the authority to investigate the matter raised by the Deputy and reply to him directly.</P>
      <P>Needless to say, it will be some time before I get the standard reply from the Eastern Regional Health Authority but nothing will happen for the young person.</P>
      <P>By coincidence, a number of other parents of young adults in similar circumstances contacted me. I refer to correspondence I received from some because they had been to the Eastern Regional Health Authority, had investigated the whole issue and had come up with nothing. My correspondents have a son, now 17 years old, who will be leaving a special school in June of next year. For the past two years the parents have been endeavouring to find a suitable service for his needs as a young autistic adult. He is mildly autistic, requiring a workshop facility or social programme but not residential care. The response the parents have received from the local services has been slow and, so far, negative. It has been established that they are outside the catchment area of St. Michael's House in Glasnevin, which would have the most suitable facilities for him. The director of services of the Daughters of Charity in the Navan Road, which covers the city area and where they live, has indicated that lack of resources prevents them from extending their services.</P>
      <P>The Daughters of Charity say that, as an agency, they are in recent months in receipt of numerous referrals of individuals with a diagnosis of autism-PDD. During 2002, the ERHA completed a review of services for persons with autism spectrum disorder in the region. The recommendations of the report set out the range and direction for service development in coming years. The Daughters of Charity have been in contact with the regional chief executive in relation to this and assured that one of the goals of the report is the development of autism specific services within intellectual disability services to ensure those clients with both an intellectual disability and ASD are properly supported. However, there is no apparent evidence of action of any sort being taken on the reports, other than the assurance that the authority &ldquo;intends&rdquo; to establish a regional implementation committee.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The dilemma of the parents is outlined in their letter to me. The Daughters of Charity have no <Col N="1349" />extra funds and cannot accept their son in June until the ERHA takes action on the report. If it intends to establish a committee first, they wonder how long it will take for appropriate services to be made available to their son. They point out that autistic persons do not like change and need good preparation for changes to be successful. There is nothing for their son and they envisage him staying at home all day with nothing to do and losing the confidence and skills he has acquired during his time in the special school. They emphasise that there seems to be no sense of urgency on the part of the health board. They have asked me to investigate the progress so far of the ERHA in its establishment of a regional committee and finish by asking what is the future for their son and the many other autistic young adults in our society. They ask this question in absolute despair.</P>

      <P>As the Deputy is aware, I have some understanding of the services of the ERHA and the highest regard for the chief executive officer of the authority, Mr. Michael Lyons, and would be somewhat surprised and dismayed if a positive response did not follow within a short time, rather than weeks.

Since 1997, my Department has allocated significant levels of funding across the disability sector.

In <Col N="1350" />July 2003 additional revenue and capital funding totalling &euro;50 million was made available to services for people with disabilities. Included in this figure was additional revenue funding of &euro;20 million in 2003, with a full year cost in 2004 of &euro;30 million. In addition, &euro;15 million was made available to services for persons with an intellectual disability and those with autism to meet costs associated with emergency residential placements during 2003, the provision of day services, in particular, for young adults who have just left school, and some enhancement of the health related support services for children.</P>

      <P>Furthermore, &euro;5 million was made available for services for people with physical or sensory disabilities to meet service pressures as identified by the Eastern Regional Health Authority in consultation with other relevant agencies.</P>
      <P>My Department has allocated capital funding of &euro;30 million to the Eastern Regional Health Authority and the health boards in respect of minor capital works in services for people with disabilities. This funding will allow the authority and the health boards to address areas such as the backlog of maintenance, refurbishment, re-equipping, replacement of vehicles used within the services or works related to fire precautions and health and safety issues. The provision of the revenue funding, in particular, for services for persons with an intellectual disability and those with autism will provide around 175 emergency places and over 600 day places. Additional revenue funding amounting to &euro;6.571 million, with a full year cost of &euro;11.362 million in 2004, was allocated to the authority for the provision of emergency residential placements and new day places.</P>
      <P>The funding for additional day places, with particular emphasis on meeting the needs of young adults who left school in June 2003, amounts to &euro;1.571 million in 2003, with a full year cost in 2004 of &euro;4.712 million. This should enable the Eastern Regional Health Authority to put in place around 240 new places across the region. The authority is in the process of completing the arrangements with the area health boards and other services providers in bringing the new services on stream. I understand from the Northern Area Health Board that 88 new places are being provided in north Dublin city and county. We can give the Deputy information about these places should he want it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 10, 11, 76 and 82 together.</P>
      <P>As I have already indicated in my replies to Priority Questions Nos. 2 and 3, I have noted the broadly positive conclusions of the ESRI mid-term review of the national development plan. The evaluation finds that the overall strategy remains valid and that significant progress has been made towards the plan objectives in relation to maintaining sustainable national economic and employment growth. The report states that investment under the NDP 2000-03 will add 3% to GNP growth which is equal to a rate of return of 14%. In addition, the evaluation concludes that the NDP will have a sustainable positive effect on competitiveness and the productive capacity of the economy in the long-term.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The evaluation also generally endorses the investment priorities of the Government in implementing the plan particularly in areas such as infrastructure, education and training, research and development and child care. It generally recommends that these should be the priority areas for the remainder of the plan. The evaluation also pinpoints areas where the ESRI believes that lower priority is warranted. It also <Col N="1354" />proposed a number of policy changes in areas which span a number of Ministerial policies.</P>
    <P>The ESRI evaluation whilst purely advisory will be an input into ongoing Government consideration of investment priorities. As Deputies will appreciate, Government consideration of investment priorities has to take account of a number of factors including the value for money and economic impact of the investment. The ESRI report contains much useful guidance in the latter regard.</P>
    <P>As regards regional development I acknowledge that the Border, midlands and west regions are behind the indicative target for infrastructural investment set out in the plan as published. This reflects the fact that the infrastructure gridlock and bottlenecks are most severe in the southern and eastern regions, especially in the greater Dublin area and that priority has had to be accorded to major projects in this region.</P>
    <P>In relation to my Department's response to the evaluation I would point out my Department does not have direct responsibility for the various investment programmes under the plan. More generally, my Department is concerned at the findings of the evaluation on cost overruns and deficient management of infrastructure projects and programmes. My Department is currently revising the capital appraisal guidelines for public sector capital projects and the revised guidelines will issue shortly to Departments and public agencies. The existing guidelines do of course remain in place and set out guidance in relation to the evaluation, planning and execution of capital projects. I must stress that the onus for proper appraisal and management of capital projects rests with the implementing agencies. My Department will however, strive both in the context of the revised guidelines and otherwise to impress on Departments and implementing agencies the need for best practice in regard to evaluation and execution of capital projects.</P>

      <P>Yes. The national procurement policy unit of my Department is reviewing public procurement procedures in relevant areas of the public service in the context of the roll-out of the strategy for the implementation of e-procurement in the Irish public sector approved by the Government in April 2002. The strategy contained a high-level analysis of the benefits arising from the adoption of better procurement procedures and practices and anticipated that significant savings could be realised during implementation of the strategy with further annual savings accruing thereafter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Since the publication of the report work has been ongoing on sectoral procurement strategies <Col N="1355" />for the health and local authority areas with seed funding from the e-procurement initiatives fund, EIF, administered by my Department. A senior procurement specialist, seconded to the national public procurement policy unit from the Australian public sector, has been assigned to progress sustainable procurement management reform in four key areas: organisational capacity building; training and education; procurement aggregation; and e-procurement.</P>
    <P>The objective of procurement management reform is a sustainable change in the way that we organise our procurement effort in the public sector over the long-term and the realisation of the potential to achieve significant savings for the Exchequer and the taxpayer.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 13 and 99 together.</P>
      <P>The parallel benchmarking process for the craft workers and the related non-nursing and the general operative grades is not yet complete. However, the full year annual Exchequer cost of benchmarking including the cost of the parallel process for craft workers and related grades as currently estimated would be about &euro;1.2 billion by the time it is fully paid. The cost of benchmarking, including the craft workers and general operative processes, in the local authorities will be about &euro;114 million in a full year. The local authorities will have to meet this cost from their own resources. The financing of local authorities is in the first instance a matter for the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government and his Department and allocations from the local government fund to local authorities is a matter for him.</P>
      <P>It would be inappropriate to express the cost of benchmarking per household. Benchmarking, like other costs, will be met from the resource available to the Government which includes income tax and corporation tax as well as capital taxes and indirect taxes and any borrowing the Government may undertake.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1356" />I am confident that over the period of Sustaining Progress the quality of public services will improve. There has been a period of stable industrial relations with no disruptions to the public service such as we have had in the recent past and I expect this to continue. In addition, there will be improvements to taxpayers through achievement of modernisation objectives over the life of the agreement. The public will get good value for money from the public service pay increases, not just in the short-term but also continuing into the future. The longer term benefits of the benchmarking system will be that it will force public service pay determination away from the old, illogical relativities based system and be based on a better system more closely tied to the private sector.</P>
    <P>However, I have said in the past, if the agreement is not adhered to then the money will not be paid. It is incumbent on all parties to the process to fulfil their objectives. The Government will fulfil its side of the bargain and the unions must ensure that they fulfil their side.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy)</NameTxt>
      <P>The issue of the Tobin tax has been considered in a number of fora, including the informal ECOFIN meeting at Liege on 22 September 2001. The Belgian Presidency indicated that it wished to pursue the matter in the context of a general study to be carried out by the Commission on the issue of globalisation. However, it would be fair to say that most Finance Ministers, myself included, continue to have reservations about the Tobin tax proposal, and believed that it was not clear that a further examination of the issue by the Commission would ensure that satisfactory answers would be given to the many real questions concerning the tax including: the difficulties relating to practical implementation of the tax; its doubtful effect on short-term speculative capital movements; its conflict with the basic tenet of free capital movement in the EU; its disproportionate effect on small business and consumers; the probability that the tax would simply drive participants into other, non-taxable, alternatives; and the negative impact on liquidity in the foreign exchange market.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Nevertheless, at a formal ECOFIN meeting on 16 October 2001, it was agreed that the Commission would carry out a study on globalisation and that this study would examine the arguments for and against a Tobin tax. This study, Responses to the Challenges of Globalisation, was published on 14 February 2002. On the matter of the Tobin tax, the study concluded that while as a source of additional revenue a currency transaction tax may look appealing, its feasibility is, however, not demonstrated. There have been <Col N="1357" />no further developments at EU level with regard to the possible introduction of the Tobin tax.</P>
    <P>I am informed that as the EU Commission has not presented a formal proposal in relation to the Tobin tax, there has therefore been no formal discussions at the General Affairs and External Relations Council, GAERC, on this issue. It may be the case however that some Ministers may have mentioned the Tobin tax in the context of the Council's discussions on the finance for development issue. However, the Council has not reached any decisions or adopted any conclusions on this matter.</P>
    <P>I remain unconvinced of the feasibility of such a tax.</P>

      <P>I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that their new large case division became fully operational on 1 November 2003. Its objective is to ensure the highest possible level of compliance in relation to all taxes and duties by the largest corporate groups and professional partnerships and by the wealthiest individuals in Ireland. The division will deal with approximately 320 corporate groups and professional partnerships with turnover in excess of &euro;125 million per annum and with approximately 250 individuals with net assets in excess of &euro;50 million. The division will also deal with the entire financial services industry because of the specialist nature of their business. The division will also have two specialist units dealing with the direct and indirect taxes dimensions of tax avoidance.</P>
      <P>Virtually every area of interaction between Revenue and these large taxpayers will be managed by the division. It will deal with income and corporate taxes, value added tax, customs and excises and capital taxes. This will allow for a total overview of each taxpayer's affairs and will facilitate the more effective management of compliance.</P>
      <P>The division will be divided into 12 business units, nine of which will focus on the major business sectors in the Irish economy with one concentrating on high wealth individuals and the remaining two on tax avoidance. This specialisation will allow for research into the specific risks to revenues in various economic sectors, for the growth of understanding of business within Revenue and for targeted training of staff.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Compliance will be managed through the interaction of risk-driven audit and investigation programmes with technical support and service for the large taxpayers. Technical support will, in part, have the objective of influencing the taxpayers to adopt high compliance practices. The <Col N="1358" />division is establishing contact with senior management of the large businesses in its case base in an attempt to put in place in these businesses agreed frameworks of good compliance practice and a tax compliance ethic as a key element of good corporate governance.</P>
    <P>Large case divisions are a feature of the structures of almost all advanced tax administrations and the Irish model has taken on board many of the experiences of these administrations.</P>

      <P>The Estimates are presented by me to Dáil Éireann in accordance with the Standing Orders of the Dáil in the year to which they relate. I normally present the pre-budget or Abridged Estimates to Dáil Éireann about two weeks before budget day. The post-budget or Revised Estimates are normally presented to the Dáil within eight weeks of the start of the fiscal year to which they relate. Once the Revised Estimates are presented to the Dáil and referred to the relevant committees, it is a matter for each committee to decide when the Estimates should be considered.</P>
      <P>My Department is currently chairing an interdepartmental steering committee and working group on a pilot project which is examining ways of improving the links between departmental strategy statements, business planning and resource allocation and performance measurement with a view to producing a co-ordinated business-budget plan at the outset of a year and an annual report and accounts at the end of the year. Spending Departments involved in the pilot project are the Departments of Agriculture and Food, Social and Family Affairs and Transport. The results of this pilot will be evaluated and consideration will be given as to whether this approach should be mainstreamed across other Departments. If it is considered that the pilot project should be further developed and mainstreamed, I will bring proposals to Government and to the Public Accounts Committee &ndash; which has a duty under Dáil Standing Orders to consider any significant changes to the format of the Estimates.</P>

      <P>I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that, based on the 2002 annual returns furnished by all qualifying savings managers, the total number of active accounts at 31 December 2002 was 1,143,418 and the average monthly subscription at that date was &euro;158.00.</P>
      <P>It is not possible to give a definitive answer as to the eventual cost of the scheme as it is subject to a number of variables such as where participants die, withdraw from the scheme or vary their monthly contributions. If the current average monthly payment based on subscriptions to the scheme to 30 September 2003 continues for the full year, the annual cost in 2003 would be approximately &euro;530 million. This, however, is not a conclusive figure, and the final figure may be different than that, if account holders change their monthly contributions.</P>
      <P>I am aware of various suggestions made by different commentators on the post SSIA situation. Any such new initiatives would obviously have Exchequer implications and would need to be carefully considered. The specific goal of the SSIA scheme is to encourage people to save over a period of at least five years.  Its effect has been to stimulate such savings over varying income ranges and has been used extensively by many low income earners. It has been a success in those terms.</P>

      <P>I understand that the particular matter referred to by the Comptroller and Auditor General in his report earlier this year relates to the failure to pay fines imposed in summary cases in the District Court for the non-filing of tax returns. Since 1998, the <Col N="1360" />Revenue Commissioners have been substantially increasing the numbers of such prosecutions as part of their ongoing strategy to increase tax compliance. Approximately 1,000 convictions were obtained in 2002 and fines totalling approximately &euro;1 million were imposed by the courts in such cases.</P>
      <P>The collection of fines is the responsibility of the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform. Fines are imposed by the courts and, if a fine remains unpaid, the court issues a warrant to the Garda Síochána which is responsible for the execution of that warrant.</P>
      <P>It would be a matter of concern to the Revenue Commissioners that delays in collection of fines could have a negative effect on their compliance programme and I understand that they will be discussing this issue with the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform to see what improvements can be made.</P>

There is a likelihood of some small underspend.</P>
      <P>It is too early at this stage to be definitive. Capital expenditure is especially susceptible to timing factors and it normally accelerates in the final quarter of the year.</P>

      <P>In response to a parliamentary question on 30 September 2003, I stated that I had been informed by the Revenue Commissioners that a first round of negotiations for a protocol to amend certain provisions of the Ireland-Portugal Double Taxation Convention was held between the relevant <Col N="1361" />Irish and Portuguese tax officials in Lisbon on 19 &ndash; 21 May 2003. The Revenue Commissioners have now informed me that a second round of negotiations is likely to be held before the end of this year but dates have not yet been finalised.</P>
      <P>I should also explain that section 69 of the Finance Act 2003 contains an amendment to Irish domestic law which imposes a charge to capital gains tax on an individual in respect of a deemed disposal of certain assets on the last day of the last year of assessment for which the individual is taxable in the State, prior to becoming taxable elsewhere, where the individual disposes of these assets while resident outside the State and returns to the State within five years. I announced this anti-avoidance measure in my 2003 budget on 4 December 2002 with effect from that date.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 21, 32, 62, 81, 101 and 109 together.</P>
      <P>Tax relief for the film industry was first introduced in 1984 under the business expansion scheme and has continued in various forms for the past 19 years. This makes it one of the longest running sector specific tax reliefs in the economy and has seen an Exchequer contribution in terms of tax foregone of the order of some &euro;265 million in the past ten years alone. It should be noted that this relief has continued over time against a backdrop of the widening of the tax base and the reduction of rates generally. In the budget for 2003, I referred to the generally accepted principle that such reliefs narrow the tax base and that a widened tax base is the price that must be paid to retain the current low tax rates. Consequently, all tax reliefs must be subject to ongoing review. In that context, I announced in the budget that a number of these reliefs across a range of sectors including film relief would not be extended beyond 31 December 2004. It should be pointed out that my decision to announce a termination date of 31 December 2004 for this relief was made primarily for the reasons already outlined above rather than as a result of specific instances of abuse.</P>
      <P>I am aware of the views of many in the film sector that have been expressed either directly to me by way of representations or indirectly through the media, with regard to the economic and social impacts of the termination of this relief in December 2004. The Minister for Arts, Sports and Tourism has recently forwarded to me a copy of a study reviewing the relief that was commissioned jointly by his Department and the Irish Film Board. I have asked officials from my Department to examine this study. However, as things stand, the position with regard to the 31 December 2004 termination date for this relief remains unchanged.</P>

      <P>I assume that the Deputy is referring here to the Central Statistics Office trade release, which measures the price of traded goods. The price of exports, which has no direct impact on inflation, has fallen by 6% for the first seven months of this year in comparison with the same period last year. The year on year change in the price of imports for the first seven months of this year has fallen by 4.7% in <Col N="1363" />comparison with the same period last year. This fall in the price of imports has a positive effect on Irish inflation.</P>
      <P>Inflation has fallen from more than 5% at the start of the year to 2.9% in September, as a result of the sustained strength of the euro and other favourable developments, including falling import prices and mortgage interest rates and easing services sector inflation. My Department forecast in the economic review and outlook published last August, that inflation would average 3.6% this year. A revised forecast will be published on budget day. This forecast will, as usual, be based on the technical assumption of unchanged interest and exchange rates.</P>

Section 26 of the Act provides that the new Irish Financial Services Regulatory Authority is required to promote the best interests of users of financial services in a way that is consistent with the orderly and proper functioning of financial markets and the orderly and prudent supervision of providers of those services.</P>
      <P>I expect to publish a second Bill during the current Dáil session that will provide for a statutory financial services ombudsman whose mandate will include complaints in relation to insurance. This will implement MIAB recommendation 27.</P>
      <P>As regards MIAB recommendation 58, the stamp duty on certain non-life insurance policies is a significant source of general revenue to the Exchequer and, as I already stated in response to previous parliamentary questions, I have no plans to abolish or ring-fence this duty.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy)</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy will be aware, the figures referred to by the Comptroller and Auditor General are extracted from a study carried out by the Revenue Commissioners in 2002 on the effective tax rates for high earning individuals based on the tax year 1999-2000. A similar study was undertaken in 1997.</P>
      <P>One of the conclusions drawn from the 1997 study was that the use of capital allowances on the expenditure on buildings in tax designated areas and on hotels was one of the main methods of reducing the tax bills of high earners to very low levels. Subsequently, in the budget for 1998, I capped the amount of annual capital allowances on such buildings that could be off-set against non-rental income and, in the case of hotels throughout most of the country, I abolished in total the capital allowances against non-rental income.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy will be aware, the 2002 study indicates an increase in the effective tax rate of high earners in 1999-2000 compared with earlier years. However, it is clear that some high earners continue to achieve substantial reductions in their tax liability as a result of certain tax reliefs. The study indicates that property based capital allowances continue to be the chief instrument used by high-income earners to reduce their taxable income by substantial amounts. It is also clear that the 1998 changes were not fully in effect by 1999-2000. Accordingly, in the budget for 2003, I abolished capital allowances for investment in registered holiday homes and reduced capital allowances for hotels to the rate applying generally to industrial buildings. I also indicated that a range of tax incentives would not be extended beyond their end-2004 termination date. All these measures will reduce the opportunities for very high earners to pay relatively low effective rates of tax.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the other hand, as I said during my 2003 Budget Statement and on many other occasions on the record, I am a supporter of properly <Col N="1366" />focused, clearly defined and specific reliefs which can encourage the development of goods and services, including public services, which might otherwise not be provided or, where provided, are too little or too late. I have introduced a number of such schemes which have been welcomed. However, it is the case that in providing some incentives for good public policy reasons, they also allow higher earners to reduce their tax paid to varying degrees. This is one of the factors that must be taken into account in reviewing such reliefs. I assure the Deputy that all tax incentive schemes are kept under review, especially in the context of the annual budget and Finance Bill process.</P>

      <P>The rules of the Stability and Growth Pact were discussed by the Economic and Financial Affairs (ECOFIN) Council in March 2003. No changes were made but some recommendations regarding the effective application of the Stability and Growth Pact were agreed. The main recommendations in this regard were, that the economic cycle should be taken into account when assessing com<Col N="1367" />pliance; euro area member states with deficits exceeding the close to balance or in surplus requirement must improve their cyclically-adjusted budgetary position; member states should avoid pro-cyclical policies; and fourth, greater attention to be paid to analysing the long-term sustainability of public finances and greater emphasis will be placed on reducing debt levels and the quality of public finances. The Government supports the Stability and Growth Pact as the basis of stable public finances in the EU. I have made clear on a number of occasions that I would support changes to the pact which would give greater recognition to member states with debt levels below the 60% reference rate especially where such member states have pressing needs for capital investment. This proposal has been discussed by the relevant EU bodies but has not been proceeded with. I will continue to set out my views on the matter as appropriate in the context of future ministerial level meetings.</P>

      <P>I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that 452 cases were subject to investigation arising from the Clerical Medical Insurance-NIB inquiry. To date, Revenue has collected &euro;47.12 million in tax, interest and penalties as a result of the investigations. This is made up of &euro;42.27 million paid in relation to 281 settled cases and &euro;4.85 million in respect of payments on account in cases still under investigation. I understand that 98 cases were finalised with no additional liability arising and that 73 cases are progressing towards finality. Of these, 15 involve relatively small sums and are unlikely to involve significant liability.</P>
      <P>Three cases were prosecuted this year with fines being imposed in two of them and a suspended sentence imposed in the other. The individuals concerned have also settled their tax affairs and paid the outstanding tax, together with interest and penalties. A further case is currently under investigation with a view to prosecution.</P>
      <P>Aggregate results of the ongoing investigations have been published each year since 1998 in the annual reports of the Revenue Commissioners. Individual details of settlements have also been published where the provisions of section 1086 of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 applied.</P>

      <P>I should firstly explain that charities and non-profit groups are exempt from VAT under the EU sixth VAT directive. This means that they do not charge VAT on their services and cannot recover VAT incurred on goods and services that they purchase. Essentially, only VAT registered businesses which charge VAT are able to recover VAT. I am aware of the recent report commissioned by the Irish Charities Tax Reform Group which outlines the VAT incurred by charities as part of their day to day activities. I point out that, as is indicated in the report, Government subventions to affected organisations cover a significant element of the VAT incurred.</P>
      <P>In my view, the cost of providing funding equivalent to VAT paid would be potentially more expensive than is outlined in the report. There would be pressure to extend such a scheme to charities not represented by the ICTRG and to other not-for-profit organisations. Such a system could encourage registration as charities by other organisations to benefit from such funding. Charities already benefit from considerable and generous tax reliefs. I have no plans to introduce a mechanism to provide additional funding to charities equivalent to the VAT paid by them.</P>

There are Ansbacher type arrangements and there are other cases involving offshore funds and deposits.</P>
      <P>Revenue has advised that the review team has inquired into 289 cases to date and 53 of these cases have concluded settlements with Revenue. The 289 cases, taking account of spouses and connected companies, consist of 300 names. The 289 cases are made up of 179 cases listed on the High Court inspectors report and 110 similar cases discovered by Revenue or listed on the authorised officer's report.</P>
      <P>A total of 211 cases have been under active investigation. The remaining cases consist of 62 non-resident persons, including 17 former Irish residents, 12 individuals who claimed the 1993 amnesty provisions and four cases with insufficient identity information.</P>

Of the balance of 28 cases, 21 were settled on payments amounting to &euro;6.86 million, included above, five had no additional liability and two were covered by the 1993 amnesty provisions. </P>
    <P>Revenue is making extensive use of its legislative powers to seek books, records, documents and information in the cases being investigated. Where appropriate, prosecutions will be considered but these will depend on the level of evidence available.</P>
    <P>Revenue has made five successful applications to the High Court for the production by financial institutions and third parties of books, records and other documentation which are relevant to liabilities of Ansbacher account holders. Some 150,000 documents have been received under the terms of the High Court orders. Advanced investigative computer software is used in controlling and managing the documentation.</P>
    <P>Revenue made an application under section 11 of the Companies Act 1990 for a copy of the High Court inspectors' report which was made available to Revenue on 6 July 2002. The information in this report has been carefully considered as regards the tax liabilities of the persons concerned. In addition, Revenue has made a further application to the High Court for access to the supporting papers to the High Court inspectors' report. The matter was heard by the High Court on 26, 27 and 28 November 2002 and judgment is reserved. Revenue has informed me that the investigations are time-consuming and complex and are likely to continue for some time to come.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy)</NameTxt>
      <P>In accordance with the principles underlying the strategic management initiative, my Department has been for some time pursuing an active policy of maximum delegation to Departments. On large capital programmes, responsibility for individual projects is, therefore, generally delegated to the relevant Department.</P>
      <P>The role of my Department is to set out a clear framework on the management of capital investment. Departments are expected in managing capital projects to comply with my Department's Guidelines for the Appraisal and Management of Capital Expenditure Proposals in the Public Sector. These guidelines provide for a four-stage process &ndash; appraisal (preliminary and detailed), planning, implementation and post project review.</P>
      <P>The appraisal stage aims to provide a basis for a decision on whether to approve a project in principle. This stage includes an assessment of uncertainty and risk.</P>
      <P>The planning stage involves the establishment of a project management structure, preparation of a design brief, detailed planning and design of the project and a review of costings. If changes are proposed to the project in the course of the planning stage, the guidelines make it clear that the cost implications should be fully appraised and the approval of the sanctioning authority sought before proceeding. On receipt of a tender price and other relevant information, the case for proceeding with the proposal is again subject to review. Where it is proposed, following such reappraisal, to go ahead with a project at a price higher than that originally proposed, a decision will again be required by the sanctioning authority to proceed.</P>
      <P>The implementation stage begins once the final approval for the award of a contract has been secured. If adverse developments occur, including unforeseen cost increases, which call into question the desirability or viability of the project, the sponsoring agency should consider necessary measures to rectify the situation. Where, despite these measures, increased costs are likely to arise, the approval of the sanctioning authority for the extra expenditure has to be obtained before any commitment is made to accept cost increases. The viability of the project given the changed circumstances should also be reported on.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1374" />Following the completion of a project, there is the post-project review stage. Such a review is recommended to evaluate both the project outturn and the effectiveness of appraisal and management procedures and to learn lessons.</P>
    <P>The steps outlined in the existing guidelines provide sufficient guidance to Departments and agencies for the re-evaluation of projects at key points in the decision making process. However, as I have previously indicated, my Department is in the process of reviewing these guidelines as part of wider consideration being given to improving arrangements for the management of capital programmes involving the possible introduction of multi-annual capital envelopes. I envisage that consideration will be given in that context as to how the guidelines might be improved to better address the issue of cost overruns on projects highlighted in evaluations of the NDP and elsewhere. One element of this will be the question of including in annual Estimates and appropriation accounts suitable information on variances between original approved budgets and projected or final outturns.</P>

      <P>I understand from the National Development Finance Agency that the costs incurred since 1 January 2003 and charged to the administration budget of the National Treasury Management Agency amount to &euro;600,000 approximately. These comprise salaries and a share of the NTMA's overhead costs. The total number of staff employed by the NTMA assigned to NDFA work is five.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Since 1 January 2003 State authorities are obliged by law to seek the advice of the agency on the best financing approach for all capital projects of a certain value, currently &euro;20 million, including PPPs. The role of the NDFA is to assist <Col N="1375" />State authorities: in evaluating financial risks and costs of infrastructure projects and facilitating them in availing of the best financial package for each project; in assessing optimal financing as between a private or PPP financial package, or Exchequer or NDF funding for infrastructure projects; in raising finance for projects, including certain PPPs, where this would be more cost effective than private funding and, in respect of conventionally procured capital projects, where there are clear benefits off-setting any increased cost of agency funding over Exchequer funding; and in creating special purpose companies &ndash; SPCs &ndash; that can raise project finance with guarantees, securitise revenue from projects with user-charging and receive land or other property assigned or transferred from State authorities for use in financing infrastructure projects.</P>
    <P>The NDFA is currently working on a range of projects at stages ranging from feasibility to the early phases of procurement. It is early days yet in the life of the agency, but it is already proving to be an invaluable resource to State authorities involved in the procurement of capital infrastructure projects. The benefits that the NDFA can bring to the financing of capital infrastructure projects are considerable and include: value for money through ensuring that non-Exchequer finance is sourced on a cost-effective basis; the application of commercial standards to public procurement projects; underpinning the PPP approach to public service provision; and centralising expertise and avoiding use of expensive consultants across public agencies.</P>
    <P>As the Deputy may be aware, the agency, in accordance with the provisions of the National Development Finance Agency Act 2002, will be furnishing to me at the end of each financial year a report of its activities during that year. The first such report will be due in 2004. I look forward to receiving and, in turn, making it available to each House of the Oireachtas.</P>

      <P>I understand that the Information Commissioner's office adopted new working procedures in April 2002 for dealing with both review applications &ndash; appeals &ndash; and historical review cases. All review cases received from that time would be dealt with immediately while cases received prior to 1 April 2002 would be processed alongside current cases. At that stage, in April 2002, the commissioner envisaged that the arrears cases would be dealt with over a three-year period. I understand that this arrangement worked quite well initially but <Col N="1376" />has now been affected by a significant increase in new review applications being received in the course of this year, 2003, and the office is now re-considering its targets on clearing arrears cases. The commissioner's office is currently preparing a statement of strategy for the three year period 2004 &ndash; 2006 in which it will develop new business plans to address, <i>inter alia,</i> the issue of the backlog of pre-April 2002 cases.</P>
      <P>I am informed by the Office of the Information Commissioner that there were 912 accepted review applications on hands on 31 October 2003, while a further 70 review applications were at screening stage awaiting a decision as to whether they constitute valid applications. By comparison, there were 602 accepted review applications &ndash; appeals &ndash; on hands at 31 December 2002 with a further 47 cases at screening stage. This increase of approximately 50% in the &ldquo;on hands&rdquo; figure occurred despite an increase of approximately 25% in the rate of completion of cases in 2003 compared with 2002; it is a direct consequence of a significant increase in the level of review applications to the commissioner in 2003. In the ten-month period to 31 October 2003, the commissioner has accepted 868 cases for review; during the same ten-month period in 2002, the commissioner accepted only 626 cases for review.</P>
      <P>At present, the commissioner is dealing with current applications as well as with older cases, including some applications received in 2000. Any average figure would, therefore, need to be treated with caution. Figures are not currently available as to the average time taken to conclude reviews &ndash; appeals. However, the commissioner hopes to be able to give fuller details of case completion timescales in her annual report for 2003.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 45 and 106 together.</P>
      <P>This Government has established a climate which has allowed the Irish economy to flourish. In the decade up to 2001, Ireland achieved one of the best economic performances in the world.</P>
      <P>In the last 18 months, growth in Ireland has slowed, mainly due to the prolonged slowdown in the international economy. However, indicators show that a recovery, particularly in the US, has begun.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The challenge now is to pursue policies which will safeguard Ireland's competitiveness so as to ensure we will benefit fully from the international economic recovery as it develops. In assessing our <Col N="1377" />economic prospects going forward we must deal with the realities of the current economic environment and in this regard, there are a number of key facts that we must both acknowledge and respond to. First, Ireland is part of a monetary union where the overriding policy objective is for a low inflation environment of about 2% or less per annum. Second, international competition is exerting downward pressure on goods prices and is likely to continue to do so for some time to come. Third, we are one of the most open economies in the world. Finally, international competition for jobs and investment is becoming much more intense all the time. These are facts and realities with which we must live and I will take full account of them in framing the forthcoming budget.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy)</NameTxt>
      <P>There are already in place a number of tax incentives to support residential property purchases by first-time buyers. All owner-occupiers, including first-time buyers, are generally exempt from stamp duty on new houses where the property is 125 sq. m. or less. In addition, there is more favourable stamp treatment for first-time buyers of second-hand houses up to &euro;381,000 as compared to other purchasers. First-time buyers in common with other owner-occupiers are also not subject to capital gains tax on the gain from the disposal of their main residence. First-time buyers also qualify for tax relief on mortgage interest payments and the Deputy will recall that in budget 2003, I increased the annual ceiling on mortgage interest payments by first-time buyers who qualify for relief from &euro;3,175/&euro;6,350 &ndash; single/married or widowed &ndash; to &euro;4,000/&euro;8,000 &ndash; single/married or widowed. In addition, the period of time in which the higher amount of relief may be claimed was increased from five to seven years. First-time buyers who started to claim tax relief in respect of mortgage interest in the tax year 1998/99 or later stand to benefit from the new arrangements.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The housing market is a complex and dynamic one and demands continual monitoring and adjustments to address changing circumstances. In view of the record increases in housing completions in recent years, I consider that the tax incentives available at present for the purchase of residential property represent the optimal mix and are adequately balanced in the light of the current state of the housing market. Any pro<Col N="1378" />posals to alter this position will be considered as part of the normal review of existing reliefs in the context of the 2004 budget and Finance Bill cycle. In this context, I undertook in the Seanad debate on the Finance Bill 2003 to examine a proposal suggested to me whereby potential first-time buyers would receive tax credits in respect of savings made within a special scheme solely for the purchase of their first home.</P>

Apart from September 2003, when there was a small decrease, there has been an increase in the numbers of audits finalised in each month during 2003 compared to 2002. The figures do not take account of a project to audit returns received in respect of the recipients of share options. A total of 4,022 of such audits were carried out in 2002, resulting in a total audit figure for 2002 of 15,951. Between January 2003 and May 2003, when the project was completed, a total of 1,015 share option audits were carried out.

    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy)</NameTxt>
      <P>Authorised Revenue officers are empowered to make an application to a judge of the High Court seeking an order requiring financial institutions to supply names, addresses and other relevant information concerning account holders who may have held bogus non-resident deposit accounts. Such applications are made under section 908 of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997, as amended by the Finance Act 1999. I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that information supplied by the financial institutions under section 908 orders will be the principal basis of identifying bogus non-resident account holders who did not avail of the voluntary disclosure scheme in 2001. This inquiry work commenced on the 16 November 2001.</P>
      <P>I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that 18 applications for orders under section 908 have been made and have been granted. When one includes institutions which have been taken over or amalgamated with other institutions, these orders seek information in respect of accounts in 26 financial institutions. No further applications for such orders are pending in the non-resident account inquiries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Information that is being supplied by deposit takers under court orders is becoming available on a phased basis and very large volumes of information have already been reported to Revenue. Inquiry work on the examination of the first batch of taxpayers commenced on 11 October 2002. Further general issues of inquiry letters were made in January, May, July and September and October 2003. These general inquiry letter issues relate to 76,000 non-resident accounts that had Irish addresses connected to them. To date 149,000 inquiry letters have been issued to taxpayers in respect of these non-resident accounts. The next general inquiry letter issue is scheduled to take place within the next few months and it is <Col N="1380" />expected that this represents the last significant tranche of letters.</P>
    <P>While it is clear that Revenue is facing a long programme of investigations the Revenue Commissioners have informed me that they are satisfied that significant progress has been made in this final phase of the investigations. Since 15 November 2001 payments of &euro;240 million have been made to Revenue by taxpayers who held bogus non-resident accounts. This is in addition to the &euro;227 million paid as a result of the 15 November 2001 voluntary disclosure scheme and the &euro;220 million in DIRT tax, interest and penalties paid by financial institutions.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy)</NameTxt>
      <P>The purpose of the tax clearance schemes is to ensure that persons, who derive an economic benefit from a licence or permit to conduct certain activities in the State or from the receipt of public contracts, and/or receive certain grants, subsidies and other payments from the State, and/or hold certain public offices as specified in the Standards in Public Offices Act 2001, are in compliance with their tax obligations. The following is a general outline of the scheme and I am arranging for full details of the scope and nature of the various schemes to be forwarded to the Deputy by Revenue.</P>
      <P>In the case of persons receiving economic benefit or in receipt of a grant or other payments the taxes covered are income tax, corporation tax, capital gains tax and value added tax. In the case of public office holders, as well as these taxes, capital acquisitions tax is also covered.</P>
      <P>A tax clearance certificate will be issued by the Revenue Commissioners to a person whose tax affairs are up to date. This means that the person: has paid all relevant taxes, interest and penalties known to be due or agreed a payment schedule; and has delivered all required tax returns.</P>
      <P>Where an applicant for tax clearance fails to meet the criteria mentioned, a formal notification of refusal will be issued to the applicant. This notification will set out the reasons for refusal of the tax clearance certificate. Provisions are made in the Standards in Public Office Act for the issue of an application statement in certain circumstances where a decision is pending or where a refusal is being appealed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It should, of course, be noted that tax clearance certificates are issued by the Revenue Commissioners at a particular point in time. They are, and can only be, based upon the information <Col N="1381" />known to Revenue at that time, supported by a declaration from the taxpayer.</P>
    <P>The schemes and activities which require tax clearance are diverse and the scope of tax clearance has been considerably extended over the years. This is demonstrated by the fact that some 58,652 tax clearance certificates were issued by Revenue in 2002. Qualifications to certificates are a matter for legislation and the various schemes involved are kept under review. Any changes which arise would be included in the relevant legislation.</P>
    <P>The operation of the schemes is also kept under review by the Revenue Commissioners. In their statement of strategy 2003-2005, published in February of this year, the Revenue Commissioners have set compliance with tax and customs legislation as their primary goal. I am advised by the Commissioners that the tax clearance schemes have played an important part in improving tax compliance and will continue to have a valuable role in Revenue's compliance strategies.</P>
    <P>Finally, as part of their strategy of promoting on-line business initiatives, Revenue has recently developed the facility to enable applicants to apply for tax clearance via the Revenue's website <i>www.revenue.ie</i></P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 54 and 59 together.</P>
      <P>The Government decided to reduce authorised numbers in the public service by 5,000 by the end of 2005 and on the distribution of 4,300 of these posts between sectors. I intend to revisit the issue early in 2004 to see where the balance of 700 posts can be identified.</P>
      <P>Authorised numbers will have been reduced by a total of 1,073 posts by the end of 2003. This will be followed by a further reduction of 1,479 posts in 2004 giving a total reduction of 2,552 by the end of 2004. This total does not include any of the balance of 700 posts.</P>
      <P>The 2,552 total will be made up of 400 posts in the Health sector, 550 in the Education sector, another 550 in the Civil Service, 220 in the Defence Forces, 667 in the local authorities and 165 in non-commercial State-sponsored bodies.</P>
      <P>I have already stated that I intend that the reduction should be distributed appropriately across all grades and levels. The reduction will be achieved through natural wastage and it is up to each individual public sector manager to work within the parameters outlined to them. Essential services to the public will not be affected.</P>
      <P>Pending the finalisation of the allocation, by grade and number, of the staffing reductions at organisational level, it is not possible to quantify the savings which will result from the reductions in public service employment levels. The final financial allocations to be agreed for 2004 will reflect the anticipated reduced staffing levels across the public service.</P>

      <P>The flat rate refund to VAT unregistered farmers is examined every year in the context of the budget. It is not, however, customary for me to comment on any possible changes which may arise in the context of the forthcoming budget.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1384" />I would say that the flat rate addition is a simple administrative system to compensate VAT unregistered farmers for the VAT they incur as part of their farming activities. The flat rate figure takes account, on a regular basis, of changes in the VAT rate. Under EU VAT law, the adjustment of the flat rate can only be made on the basis of retrospective macroeconomic data for the previous three years. This is based on statistics for agricultural production and agricultural inputs and the deductible VAT content of such inputs. The amount of the flat rate is arrived at by calculating the VAT payable on agricultural inputs as a percentage of agricultural sales. A rate is calculated for each year and the actual rate for any year is based on the average of the previous three years.</P>
    <P>The flat rate is not intended as an aid or assistance to the agricultural sector. I am satisfied the current rate reflects a fair compensation for VAT incurred by farmers and should not affect their business decisions.</P>

      <P>As the Deputy will be aware, and following on my Budget Statement regarding carbon energy taxation last December, I published a carbon energy tax consultation paper, prepared by my Department, on 31 July of this year. This consultation paper was designed to facilitate discussions on the introduction and design of the carbon energy tax while recognising that there are divergent views on the issue. Submissions in response to the paper were invited from interested parties to be received in this Department by 30 September 2003, but extra time has been given where requested by organisations to complete their submissions. To date, 117 submissions have been received by my Department in response to the carbon taxation consultation paper.</P>
      <P>The Government has already decided in principle on the introduction of a carbon energy tax. The decision on the precise details of such a tax will be informed through the consultation process currently under way. The current step in this process is the examination of submissions received in the Department. All relevant issues, including the effect of carbon energy tax on those on low incomes, will be taken into account in the consideration of the proposal.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">

      <P>Tax reliefs are widespread throughout the tax system and are found under all tax headings including income tax, corporation tax, capital taxes and indirect taxes. These are mechanisms within the tax code which are designed to meet a specific need within the economy or society in general by encouraging and incentivising certain behaviours or reducing particular costs incurred by the tax paying public.</P>
      <P>Tax reliefs represent a significant overall cost to the Exchequer. However, there are difficulties in providing information on a number of individual tax reliefs and incentives. The identification of the costs of individual schemes is not always possible as the details may only be captured in aggregate form on tax returns. For example, this is the case on capital allowance information which is currently aggregated in tax returns under three broad headings of plant and machinery, industrial buildings and other. Where income is exempt, it is not always a requirement that it be included in tax returns and no information on the costs of such reliefs would therefore be available from that source. I should mention however, that in Finance Act 2003, I introduced a requirement that the profits, gains and losses arising from stallion fees, occupation of certain woodlands and stud greyhound fees must be included in the annual return of income even though the income or gains are exempt.</P>
      <P>My Department is working closely with the Office of the Revenue Commissioners to identify mechanisms for enhancing the level of information captured in respect of tax reliefs, in particular the amount being claimed and details of the number of individuals availing of the various schemes. However, I should point out that it is necessary to balance the needs of the Exchequer for statistical information with the desire to minimise as far as possible the administrative burden placed on individual taxpayers and on the business community.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy)</NameTxt>
      <P>The National Pensions Reserve Fund is managed by commissioners who are independent of Government. They control and manage the fund with discretionary authority to determine and implement an investment strategy for the fund. This investment strategy is based on a commercial investment mandate with the objective of securing the optimal return over the long-term, having regard <Col N="1386" />to the purpose of the fund as set out in section 18(1) of the National Pensions Reserve Fund Act 2000, and the payment requirements of the fund as provided for under section 20 of the Act, provided the level of risk to the moneys held or invested is acceptable to the commission.</P>
      <P>These features of the Act are similar to the trustee arrangements which exist in private pension funds. Along with the statutory prohibition on draw-downs from the fund prior to 2025, they insulate the fund from day to day pressures on Government and enable the commission to take a long-term view. This is essential if the purpose for which the fund was established, to meet as much as possible of the cost to the Exchequer of pension payments from the year 2025 until at least the year 2055, is to be achieved.</P>
      <P>In light of the provisions of the National Pensions Reserve Fund Act 2000 that I have just set out, I do not regularly ask the commission for detailed reports on short-term investment returns. The fund's investment strategy is a matter for the commission and I have no say in it. It is my strong view that regular discussions between me and the commission on its investment strategy and the resultant short-term gains and losses, which may in any event never be realised, would seriously interfere with the long-term focus which must attach to a fund which will not start to make significant disbursements for more than 30 years.</P>
      <P>The provisional market value of the fund at 18 July 2003, the latest date for which figures have been published by the commission, was &euro;8.392 billion. This represented a return for the year to that point of 5.2% and a reduction in the loss of capital to the fund from &euro;737 million at end 2002 to &euro;323 million. This capital loss is a net figure which takes account of investment income in both the temporary holding fund and the fund itself, and also of gains in the bond portion of the fund offset by declines in the value of equities.</P>

      <P>Implementation of the new EU procurement directive is scheduled for the end of this year. This directive includes provision for framework agreements for the first time. These are agreements with multiple qualifying suppliers which set out terms and conditions under which specific purchases can be made during the period of the agreement.

    <P>To prepare for the new directive, an inter-<Col N="1387" />agency group of specialists from across the public service has been set up to examine and develop methods of information technology procurement based on frameworks. The framework agreements which will emerge during 2004 from this project will focus on items such as PCs, servers, laptops, operating systems, commonly used software, printers and associated consumables and it is intended that they will run for a period of two to three years. A key objective is to achieve a reduction in the time, costs and specialist staff effort currently associated with EU-type procurements for information technology goods and services, and also to get significantly better value from aggregating demand across public service agencies.</P>

      <P>The amount of compensation payable to an investor under the investor compensation scheme is limited to 90% of the amount lost, subject to a maximum pay-out of &euro;20,000. This amount is in line with the obligations imposed under the relevant EU directive, and is generally consistent with the levels of payment available in most other EU member states.</P>
      <P>The scheme is funded by contributions from firms which are authorised to conduct investment services. When the scheme was established on 1 August 1998, the compensation fund had no resources of its own. It was hoped that it would have several years in which to accumulate funds from its contributors before it would be called upon to deal with a failing firm. Unfortunately, that was not the case and the scheme has been called upon to deal with three failures. In addition to the annual contributions levied on member firms, it has been necessary to collect a top-up from certain participating firms to maintain the resources of the scheme.</P>
      <P>Many of the contributing firms are small scale undertakings and one must strike a fair balance between the interests of investor protection on the one hand and those of the well managed and compliant firms which are being called upon to meet the cost of failed entities on the other.</P>
      <P>While, like the Deputy, I would like to see investors' losses from failed stockbroking or investment firms minimised or even eliminated, one must have regard to the burden this would impose on other compliant firms. In all the circumstances, I do not propose to raise the level of compensation payable under the investor compensation scheme at this time.</P>

      <P>I presume that Deputy Deasy is referring to tax expenditures and tax reliefs but not to those which are considered inherent to the tax system, such as personal tax credits for income tax.</P>
      <P>Tax expenditures and reliefs are spread throughout the tax system and are found under all tax headings, including income tax, corporation tax, capital taxes and indirect taxes. These are incentives within the tax code which are designed to meet a specific need within the economy or society in general by encouraging and incentivising certain behaviours or reducing particular costs on the part of the tax paying public. They take a number of forms and have different and sometimes several objectives.</P>
      <P>As I said in the budget for 2003, I am a supporter of properly focused, clearly defined, specific reliefs which can encourage the development of goods and services, including public services, which might otherwise not be provided, or where provided are too little too late. However, as I also said, reliefs narrow the tax base. A widened tax base is the price that must be paid to keep tax rates low and all tax reliefs must therefore be subject to ongoing review. Accordingly, in the budget I indicated that a range of reliefs would not be extended beyond their end-2004 termination date.</P>
      <P>There are difficulties in providing costs for some reliefs mainly due to the simplification of the tax returns process and the resulting aggregated nature of the information gathered. My Department is working closely with the Office of the Revenue Commissioners to consider mechanisms to enhance the level of information captured in respect of tax reliefs in order to facilitate work on evaluation and review. In addressing this requirement, I am conscious of the need to balance the needs of the Exchequer with the desire to minimise as far as possible the administrative burden on taxpayers in general and on the business community. I will be reviewing all tax expenditures and tax reliefs in the context of the forthcoming budget.</P>

      <P>There are many factors which impact on competitiveness in the economy. These include fiscal policy, income developments, competition and regulatory frameworks, infrastructure and labour market policies. There is also the overriding consideration that we are a small open economy which is highly integrated into the global economy through our strong trade and investment links. Therefore, economic conditions in Ireland are largely determined by our ability to supply goods and services to our major trading partners.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are a number of publications which provide information on Ireland's competitive position including those of the National Competitiveness Council which reports to the Taoiseach. I am also aware that there are various measures of competitiveness which attract media comment <Col N="1390" />from time to time. However, while I would naturally be concerned at any slippage in Ireland's competitiveness, I am also mindful for example of the 2003 IMF report which commended the Irish authorities &ldquo;for their exemplary track record of sound economic policies, which have resulted in a dynamic, open and robust economy &ndash; with growth notably above the EU average over the past decade &ndash; and resilience to external shocks.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>However, we cannot rest on our laurels. That is why we have consistently been pursuing policies designed to strengthen the economy's competitiveness and thereby its capacity to resume trend growth in more favourable international conditions. By the same token, the current social partnership agreement, Sustaining Progress, reiterates that the ongoing renewal of competitiveness, both within the domestic economy and internationally, is central to our overall macroeconomic policy of sustaining non-inflationary economic growth and high levels of employment. The agreement sets out competitiveness enhancing actions under a broad range of policy headings. A second progress report on Sustaining Progress was recently laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas.</P>

      <P>The existing EU Programme for Peace and Reconciliation &ndash; known as PEACE II &ndash; is a unique EU funded programme for all Northern Ireland and the Border region &ndash; the six counties of Cavan, Donegal, Leitrim, Louth, Monaghan, and Sligo.</P>
      <P>PEACE II aims to help Northern Ireland become a peaceful and stable society and to promote reconciliation in Northern Ireland and the Border region. The programme runs from 2000 to 2004 and will provide around &euro;707 million for projects, of which &euro;141 million will be spent in the Border region. The EU contribution is &euro;531 million. The programme represents a continuation of PEACE I that covered the period 1995 to 1999 to which the EU contributed &euro;500 million.</P>
      <P>The financial support provided by PEACE I and PEACE II has been of enormous benefit in underpinning the peace process in Ireland. Indeed, the PEACE programmes and the Good Friday Agreement share the same core principles of partnership, inclusion and cross-Border co-operation.

Looking to the future, I believe that PEACE, with its bottom-up approach and its focus of peace-building and reconciliation, will continue to have a key role to play.</P>
      <P>My Department, in consultation with the Department of Foreign Affairs and the Department of the Taoiseach, is considering the options available with regard to the follow-up to PEACE II.</P>

      <P>I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that returns of income from patents are not captured in such a way as to provide a basis for compiling the information sought by the Deputy. Patent income is aggregated in the Revenue Commissioners' records with other forms of income and cannot be distinguished without conducting an extensive investigation of those records.</P>
      <P>There are difficulties in providing costs for some reliefs mainly due to the simplification of the tax returns process and the resulting aggregated nature of the information gathered. My Department is working closely with the Office of the Revenue Commissioners to consider mechanisms to enhance the level of information captured in respect of tax reliefs to facilitate work on evaluation and review. In addressing this requirement, I am of course conscious of the need to balance the needs of the Exchequer with the desire to minimise as far as possible the administrative burden on taxpayers in general and on the business community.</P>

      <P>As the Deputy is aware, Ireland has always supported the principle of decision making by unanimity in taxation matters. The draft EU constitutional treaty presented by the Convention on the Future of Europe to the European Council includes changes to the tax articles which would mean that if tax measures in the indirect and corporation tax areas relate to tax fraud-evasion and administrative co-operation, the Council could agree unanimously to decide on these matters by qualified majority voting. Taxation remains a key issue for Ireland in the context of the negotiations currently under way at the Intergovernmental Conference on a new EU constitutional treaty and we will continue to oppose any move from unanimity in taxation matters.</P>
      <P>In recent months I met a number of my EU Finance Minister colleagues. I also met accession countries' Finance Ministers. I have taken the opportunity at these meetings and on other occasions, such as ECOFIN meetings, when the opportunity presents, to make known our views.

      <P>In January 2003, the Economic and Financial Affairs, ECOFIN, Council decided that there was an excessive deficit in Germany in 2002 and set a deadline of May 2003 for the German authorities to take corrective measures amounting to 1% of GDP. While corrective measures were taken, it now seems likely that Germany will again breach the 3% limit in both 2003 and 2004. The next steps in respect of the German excessive deficit will be discussed at future ECOFIN Council meetings.</P>
      <P>The ECOFIN Council decided in June 2003 that there was an excessive deficit in France for the year 2002 and issued a recommendation which, <i>inter alia,</i> set a deadline of 3 October 2003 for France to take corrective action, with a view to correcting the excessive deficit by 2004. In its budget of 25 September 2003, the French Government announced certain measures, which would have the effect of correcting the excessive deficit by 2005. The next step in the excessive deficit procedure will involve an assessment by the Council of whether France has taken effective action, as required under the recommendation of June 2003, and of whether to issue a notice to France further specifying the measures it must take to ensure that the situation is addressed. The question of imposing financial sanctions against either France or Germany has not arisen for consideration by the Council.</P>
      <P>My position on these matters is straightforward. The Government supports the pact as the basis for sound public finances in the EU. The rules of the pact have to be enforced properly. It is incumbent upon all member states to do all they can to live up to their obligations under the pact. Equally, the scope for flexibility within the pact should be availed of in cases where a member state is making earnest efforts to correct an excessive deficit. From our discussions at Council level I am satisfied that both France and Germany remain committed to meeting their obligations under the pact.</P>

      <P>Tax relief for the film industry was first introduced in 1984 under the business expansion scheme and has continued in various forms for the past 19 years. This makes it one of the longest running sector specific tax reliefs in the economy and has seen an Exchequer contribution in terms of tax foregone of the order of some &euro;265 million in the past ten years alone. It should be noted that this relief has continued over time against a backdrop of the widening of the tax base and the reduction of rates generally. In Budget 2003 I referred to the generally accepted principle that such reliefs narrow the tax base and that a widened tax base is the price that must be paid to retain the current low tax rates. Consequently, all tax reliefs must be subject to ongoing review. In that context, I announced in the budget that a number of these reliefs across a range of sectors including film relief would not be extended beyond 31 December 2004.</P>
      <P>The tax relief for investment in films was never open-ended as regards duration. Its aim was to develop an Irish film industry and was never intended as an annual subsidy. Consequently, it has only applied for specific periods since its inception. In contrast, the exemption for stallion stud fees, which was introduced in 1969, never had a termination date. It was one of the few tax incentives or reliefs which the Commission on Taxation, in its report of 1984 on the role of incentives, did not recommend for abolition. An estimated 25,000 people are now employed in the wider bloodstock sector. In the Finance Act 2003 I provided for the return of information of profits and losses from the activities relating to this incentive as well as from woodlands and greyhound stud fees. When this information is available it will allow for the costs and benefits of these reliefs to be reviewed.</P>

Furthermore, the number of FOI requests being made over time should not in itself be regarded as an indicator that public bodies are releasing more or less information. Many public bodies have sought to minimise the need for members of the public to have recourse to FOI by publishing as much information as possible and by making information available through administrative access arrangements. It can be expected that public bodies will become more proficient in this area as they gain experience.</P>

      <P>As the Deputy may be aware, the residence rules were last updated in the 1994 Finance Act following a comprehensive review of the matter by the Revenue Commissioners and my Department. Prior to this, the rules were based on a mixture of statutory provisions, old case law and Revenue administrative practice, which was an unsatisfactory situation. The new residence rules set out in the 1994 Finance Act both simplified and clarified the whole area and were generally welcomed.</P>
      <P>All income earned in the State is normally taxable here. Therefore, if an individual is employed in the State, tax is paid here on his/her employment income. If an individual is resident in another State, that person is then taxable in the other State but gets credit for any tax paid in the State on such Irish income.</P>
      <P>Under Finance Act 1994 rules, a person is regarded as resident in the State for tax purposes in a tax year if he or she spends: 183 days in the State in that year; or 280 days in aggregate in that tax year and the preceding tax year. An individual who is present in the State for 30 days or less in a tax year will not be treated as resident for that year unless he or she elects to be resident. In addition, a day will only count if the individual is present in the State at the end of the day.</P>

    <P>Section 69 of the Finance Act 2003 contains an amendment to Irish domestic law which imposes a charge to capital gains tax on an individual in respect of a deemed disposal of certain assets on the last day of the last year of assessment for which the individual is taxable in the State, prior to becoming taxable elsewhere, where the individual disposes of these assets while resident outside the State and returns to the State within five years. I announced this anti-avoidance measure in Budget 2003 on 4 December 2002, with effect <Col N="1398" />from that date. I have no plans to further review the tax laws in regard to residency status.</P>

      <P>The total number of whole-time equivalent, WTE, staff currently employed in the public private partnership unit of my Department stands at 5.5 compared with eight at end 2001 and ten at end 2002. Of these, three are assigned whole-time to PPP work and another five share their time 50-50 between the PPP unit and the national public procurement unit, which was amalgamated with the PPP unit earlier this year. The related annual salary costs are: 2003 &ndash;&euro;350,000; 2002 &ndash;&euro;570,000; and 2001 &ndash;&euro;420,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The number of staff assigned to the PPP unit at any one time reflects the nature of work demands. In 2001 the work of the unit concentrated on the development of the initial pilot projects, PPP market development, arrangements for PPP training, the development with the social partners of the framework for PPPs under the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness and the preparation of a comprehensive review of structures. Staff numbers rose in 2002 because of the demands of preparing and processing two significant items of legislation, the State Authorities (Public Private Partnership Arrangements) Act and the National Development Finance Agency Act, the development of the communications strategy and the roll-out of PPP regional seminars with the social partners. This year most of the staff are involved in the preparation of the detailed guidance on PPPs and the ongoing work of the interdepartmental group and the public private advisory group &ndash; chaired by the director <Col N="1399" />of the unit &ndash; and of various working groups and committees on which the unit is represented. I anticipate that numbers of staff in the unit will be reduced next year as the programme of guidance is completed and the activities of the unit diminish.</P>
    <P>In addition to the salary costs mentioned, the other principal cost relates to the retention of specialist outside experts for once-off specific assignments. The relevant spend on this in 2001 was &euro;17,332, in 2002 it was &euro;403,566 and the estimate outturn for 2003 is &euro;8,591. As in the case of staff, this expenditure will be largely concluded in 2004.</P>
    <P>The European technical assistance programme covers the cost of two staff. In 2003, approximately &euro;113,000 will be financed from TAP sources.</P>

      <P>The overall national programme for the Irish Presidency of the EU of January to June 2004 is being drawn up by the Government at present and will be published in December, shortly before the commencement of the Presidency. The period of the Presidency will be momentous in that it will mark a major step forward in the enlargement process, with ten new member states due to join the EU on 1 May 2004.</P>
      <P>The ECOFIN Council programme will form an important part of the overall national programme. I shall be chairing the six meetings of the ECOFIN Council &ndash; one each month &ndash; that will arise in the Presidency. My Department and I have been working on the ECOFIN Council programme for some time and will continue to do so up to the time of publication in December.</P>
      <P>It will be appreciated that the ECOFIN programme, besides having a distinctive Irish input, must also take into account the concerns of my fellow ministers from the other EU and accession states, the Commission and the Parliament. I will continue to have discussions with these important interests.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is already evident that among the priorities in the ECOFIN programme will be: ECOFIN's input to the Lisbon process and to the spring European Council to discuss that process, including the preparation of the ECOFIN Presidency's key issues paper &ndash; the Lisbon process aims, among other things, to have the EU become the most competitive and dynamic knowledge based economy in the world by 2010; continuing to ensure macro-economic stability and structural reform to underpin the anticipated recovery in the world economy, which will include examin<Col N="1400" />ation of the members states' programmes within the Stability and Growth Pact; integration of the ten acceding countries into the EU's economic policy co-ordination multilateral surveillance and Lisbon processes; the issue of the acceding countries' membership of the exchange rate mechanism, also known as ERM 2, which could arise after they become full member states on 1 May 2004 &ndash; these countries will be required to join the ERM 2 for a period prior to adopting the euro; preliminary consideration of future financing of the EU through the EU budget in the period after the current Agenda 2000 agreement ends &ndash; that is, from end-2006 onwards, including future regional policy in the EU; ongoing work on financial services legislation and other legislation; and, depending on progress in the current Italian Presidency, other issues that could arise are economic-financial aspects of the Intergovernmental Conference on a future constitution for the EU and the further development of the action for growth investment initiative launched by the Italian Presidency and due to be considered at the upcoming European Council in December.</P>
    <P>Overall, I am confident that the ECOFIN Council in the period of the Irish Presidency will make very substantial progress in pushing forward with the ambitious programme of work that I have outlined.</P>

      <P>In accordance with the Government's decision in 1999 to restructure community employment, CE, participation levels are gradually being reduced in line with a strategic shift in policy in favour of training and other more appropriate supports. As part of this restructuring, future participation in CE by an individual was capped at three years, effective from April 2000. This change was introduced to discourage repeated participation in CE and to encourage unemployed persons to avail of training-education options where possible, which are shown to have more successful progression outcomes for individuals.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The three-year cap was amended in August 2001 to allow particularly disadvantaged persons to remain on the programme for a further period. FÁS currently has discretion to offer up to 20% of the total number of CE participants a further period on the programme, on a case by case basis. Participants are considered for an extension if on reaching the end of their normal entitlements on CE they are likely to experience difficulty in getting employment due to due to their age, literacy <Col N="1401" />or numeracy problems or a lack of suitable jobs available locally.</P>
    <P>The CE programme is currently under review. An overall appraisal of active labour market programmes is being carried out under the aegis of the standing committee on the labour market, which is chaired by my Department. In addition, a cross-departmental senior officials group has been asked to consider options for the future of CE, taking account of the link with the provision of community services. FÁS is also currently completing an internal review of CE and the job initiative, JI, programme, which is well advanced and should be finalised shortly. A decision on the future eligibility criteria for these programmes will be taken when the current review process has been brought to a conclusion.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy)</NameTxt>
      <P>The claim referred to by the Deputy has been brought to my attention but I am not aware of any analysis that validates it. The ISC report, Modernising Public Procurement, published only last September makes no mention of such a figure and I have not heard any member of the commission endorsing the claim. Moreover nothing contained in the comprehensive report, Strategy for the Implementation of e-Procurement in the Irish Public Sector, published in April last year would support such a claim. The facts in relation to the Government's e-procurement strategy are as follows.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The strategy suggested that that there is potential for significant savings, possibly up to &euro;400 million, over the seven-year lifetime of the strategy with further savings, up to &euro;175 million per annum, thereafter. Since the publication of the report, work has been ongoing on the development of sectoral procurement strategies for the health and local authority areas assisted by seed funding from the e-procurement initiatives fund or EIF administered by my Department. A senior <Col N="1406" />procurement specialist, seconded to the national public procurement policy unit from the Australian public sector, has been assigned to progress sustainable procurement management reform in four key areas: organisational capacity building, training and education, procurement aggregation and e-procurement.</P>
    <P>The object of procurement management reform is a sustainable change in the way that we organise our procurement effort in the public sector over the long term and the realisation of the potential to achieve significant savings for the Exchequer and the taxpayer.</P>
    <P>The adoption of e-Procurement technologies in isolation from underlying reform of procurement processes and practices will yield little or no savings in a public sector context. Therefore, these are the priority areas for procurement management reform.</P>
    <P>An intensive training programme for civil and public servants from key Departments and sectors is under way. The course focuses on strategic management tools and techniques, including methods for the management of high value and high risk procurement and the techniques for developing strategies based on thorough demand and supply analysis.</P>
    <P>A series of procurement improvement projects are planned in relevant Departments/sectors, including Health and childcare, Education and Science, CMNR, Office of Public Works, SFA, Finance, Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Justice, Equality and Law Reform and Defence, over the coming year, each containing concrete actions for the delivery of significant savings. The first set of projects is currently under way in the health sector, Office of Public Works and the Department of Social and Family Affairs.</P>
    <P>An aggregation strategy is currently being developed and is scheduled to be completed by mid-December. The strategy will focus on key markets for aggregating public sector demand over the medium to longer term. Work has already started on the potential for aggregating public sector demand in the electricity market.</P>
    <P>In relation to the IT elements of the strategy, the focus is on supporting procurement reform with appropriate technology solutions. Work on common systems &ndash; e-tendering, e-catalogue and purchase cards &ndash; is progressing. Further enhancement of the e-tenders website to allow for, among other things, the electronic submission and receipt of tender documents is scheduled to be complete by spring 2004.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy)</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not possible to establish the precise tax receipts arising in respect to a dwelling costing &euro;300,000 as this would be dependent on various factors and assumptions. A number of taxes could apply, especially in the case of a new house. In the case of a new house, VAT applies at the reduced rate of 13.5% on its construction and is included in the final price of the property to the purchaser. <Col N="1408" />No VAT applies in respect of the purchase of a second-hand house.</P>
      <P>In the case of stamp duty, there is no stamp duty on the purchase of new residential property for owner-occupiers, including first-time buyers, where the dwelling is not greater than 125 sq. m. If a new dwelling is more than this size, stamp duty is charged on the site value or on one quarter of the full house value, whichever is the greater value, in the case of owner-occupiers, including first-time buyers, at the relevant rates. In the case of investors of new residential property, stamp duty at the rate of 5% is chargeable where the consideration is &euro;300,000.</P>
      <P>Regarding the transfer of a second-hand property costing &euro;300,000, a stamp duty rate of 5% applies except for first-time buyers where a reduced stamp duty rate of 3.75% applies. In addition to VAT and stamp duty, tax receipts in the form of income tax or corporation tax would arise on any tax adjusted profits made by the builder in the case of a new house. In addition, PAYE and PRSI would apply in the case of the employees involved in the construction of the house. Where the builder purchased the site from a landowner, both capital gains and stamp duty would also normally apply.</P>

      <P>Any shortfall in tax receipts this year will mean that the Exchequer will have to borrow more at the end of this year than would otherwise be the case. This situation underlines the need to keep public expenditure within projected limits. This is being achieved and as I stated in my comments on the end-September Exchequer returns, I expect overall expenditure to be broadly on target with any overruns on voted expenditure being offset by savings on non-voted current expenditure.</P>

      <P>The Disabled Drivers and Disabled Passengers (Tax Concessions) Regulations 1994 provide for relief from VRT and VAT on the purchase and adaptation of new or existing motor vehicles for the transportation of persons with disabilities, within certain parameters. The most important requirement for the relief is that the person with a disability meets the medical criteria specified in the regulations and is in possession of a primary medical certificate to that effect issued by the appropriate senior area medical officer who is an official of the local health board.</P>
      <P>I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners, who have responsibility for the administration of the disabled drivers and disabled passengers scheme, that they have no record of an application from the person concerned. I recommend that the person concerned should, as a first step, contact the local senior area medical officer with a view to obtaining the required certificate, if she has not already done so. The Revenue Commissioners are unable to consider an application for this relief without the issue of a primary medical certificate.</P>

      <P>In March 2002, the Dalai Lama wrote to EU Foreign Ministers, including myself, asking the EU to appoint an EU special representative to Tibet. In a joint response at that time, the EU Ministers were unanimously of the view that nominating an EU special representative would not achieve anything practical. This position has not changed, and it remains that our concerns regarding Tibet are most usefully expressed to the Chinese authorities directly.</P>
      <P>Our ongoing concerns regarding the protection of human rights in Tibet continue to be addressed, along with the general human rights situation in China, both bilaterally and within the framework of the EU-China human rights dialogue, as well as through appropriate action at the UN, including at the Commission on Human Rights.</P>
      <P>I am encouraged by China's first ever policy paper on the EU, published on 13 October 2003. This calls on EU representatives to visit Tibet and welcomes EU support for the economic, cultural, educational and social development of Tibet.</P>
      <P>The Government's position remains that the best way to achieve progress in relation to the situation in Tibet is through dialogue between the Government in Beijing and the Dalai Lama. In this regard I welcome the reports of positive dialogue between Chinese officials and a delegation of the Dalai Lama's envoys, when the latter visited China during the summer, following the change of leadership in China.</P>

      <P>All exports of arms from EU countries must already conform with the EU code of conduct on arms exports, which establishes criteria to control such exports of arms. Ireland was actively involved in the establishment of this politically binding code, which was adopted by the EU General Affairs Council in June 1998. The code lists the factors to be taken into account when deciding whether to allow an export of military goods, including respect for human rights and the internal situation in the country of final destination, as well as <Col N="1411" />the preservation of regional peace, security and stability.</P>
      <P>Discussions are ongoing in the Union on the possible reinforcement of the status of the code of conduct by its transformation into an EU common position, which would be legally binding. Ireland approves such a reinforcement of the code. This debate has intensified following the adoption on 23 June 2003 by the Council of a Common Position on arms brokering.</P>
      <P>I am aware of the initiative for a framework convention, proposing a legally binding agreement with core principles and mechanisms relating to international transfers of arms, which is being promoted by an international group of non-governmental organisations or NGOs. I understand that a conference will be held later this month in Cambridge to consider a draft convention and that a further meeting is envisaged early next year. The question of the adoption of an international arms trade treaty will also be discussed soon, at working group level, within the EU. The text of a draft convention has been received by my Department and is currently under consideration.</P>

      <P>If the Deputy is seeking a legal view on the liability of the Department and the State for physical and verbal abuse of children in day schools then I do not consider that it would not be appropriate for me to provide that. More generally I point out to the Deputy that the system of education in day schools has long been very decentralised. While successive Ministers for Education determined such matters as curriculum, teacher qualifications and education quality, they did not become involved in the day-to-day operation of schools. In particular, Department personnel did not become involved in matters relating to discipline in schools, nor could it ever have been practical for them to do so. The rules for national schools provided for the use of corporal punishment but only to a limited extent and never in a situation which could amount to abuse. Corporal punishment was abolished in 1982. The implementation of the rules was a matter for the principal and the management authorities of the school.</P>

      <P>The PLC review was commissioned by my Department to examine the sector and make recommendations as necessary regarding the organisational, support, development, technical and administrative structures and resources required in schools with large scale PLC provision. The final report was completed in April 2003.</P>
      <P>The recommendations in the report are wide-ranging and encompass proposals that extend beyond PLC provision, including issues which impact on the shaping of structures for the delivery of further and adult education into the future and on other sectors of the education system. My Department is currently engaged in discussions with management and staff interests with regard to the recommendations.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources (Mr. D. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no proposals at present to reduce the number of fisheries boards. The Deputy will no doubt be aware, however, that the report of the independent Estimates review committee to the Minister for Finance indicated in respect of the fisheries boards that &ldquo;there would seem to be scope for rationalising the existing structures of the central and regional fisheries boards&rdquo; and questioned &ldquo;whether the existing arrangements represent the most efficient means by which the functions in question can be discharged&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>My Department recently sought tenders from suitably qualified consultants to undertake a review of the inland fisheries sector in Ireland. These tenders are currently being assessed and I expect to announce a decision shortly on the consultants chosen to undertake this task.</P>
      <P>I intend that this review would not just look at the central and regional fisheries boards but would be a root and branch examination of my Department's and the Government's involvement in the governance of the sector as well as the involvement of other State agencies including the Marine Institute, BIM, the ESB, Dúchas, the EPA and Fáilte Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The consultants will be required to evaluate the adequacy of the current model for the governance of the inland fisheries sector; to define the current relationship between the Government, the Department(s) and the inland fisheries sector and suggest new more effective models; and to recommend a structure which will contribute to <Col N="1417" />the optimum development of the inland fisheries resource in Ireland.</P>
    <P>I expect the review will appraise and recommend management and ownership options including, for example, enhanced private sector involvement. I believe the review needs to be imaginative in examining proposals, which might include the transfer of non-essential core activities away from the inland fisheries management.</P>
    <P>The review is to be completed in two stages over six months from commissioning. It is expected that stage one will be completed by the end of January 2004. The review team will be expected to consult widely with the affected stakeholders and I have ensured that arrangements are in place to provide for a partnership approach to any restructuring of the organisations involved.</P>

Up to mid-October, the inquiry had heard 56 hospital and non-hospital witnesses at oral hearings and had accumulated almost 3,500 pages of transcripts of oral evidence. While there is no legal obligation on hospitals to co-operate, the chairman has informed me that the inquiry's non-statutory nature has not significantly hampered its substantive work.

      <P>The health strategy, Quality and Fairness &ndash; A Health System for You, provides for the development of a nationally standardised approach to measurement of patient satisfaction and customer services strategies. The Eastern Regional Health Authority is currently preparing a Framework Document on patient advocacy, and my Department is being kept informed of its development. The Framework Document will address the advocacy issues highlighted by support groups during the consultation process which has been undertaken in the preparation of the document. At present, a number of hospitals across the health system employ staff who are designated to deal with the complaints and other advocacy issues on behalf of patients and their families. The individual titles and job descriptions of these positions vary depending on the individual hospitals. In the eastern region, each of the area health boards has appointed a director of complaints and appeals. The Eastern Regional Health Authority has also advised my Department that one of the major voluntary hospitals in the region has appointed a patient advocate, and that this post has been filled at administrative grade six. The hospital drew up its own terms of reference and job description in respect of the post. My Department also funds a number of voluntary organisations which support patients by being advocates on their behalf in respect of their care in the health system.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>Entitlement to health services in Ireland is primarily based on residency and means rather than income. Under the Health Act, 1970, determination of eligibility for medical cards is the responsibility of the chief executive officer of the appropriate health board. Other than for persons aged 70 years and over who are automatically entitled to a medical card, medical cards are issued to persons who, in the opinion of the chief executive officer, are unable to provide general practitioner medical and surgical services for themselves and their dependants without undue hardship.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Income guidelines are drawn up by the chief executive officers to assist in the determination of a person's eligibility and these are revised annually in line with the consumer price index. However, the guidelines are not statutorily binding and even though a person's income exceeds the guidelines a medical card may still be awarded if the chief executive officer considers that his or her medical needs or other circum<Col N="1423" />stances would justify this. It is open to all persons to apply to the chief executive officer of the appropriate health board for health services if they are unable to provide these services for themselves or their dependants without hardship.</P>
    <P>Persons aged 16 to 25, including students, who are financially dependent on their parents are entitled to a medical card if their parents are medical card holders. Those who are dependants of non-medical card holders are not normally entitled to a medical card except where they have an entitlement under EU regulations or where they are in receipt of a disability allowance. Students who are financially independent of their parents are entitled to apply for a medical card in their own right and are assessed on the same criteria as all other applicants.</P>
    <P>The decision on whether a person is regarded as a dependant or as being financially independent is made by the chief executive officer of the health board on the basis of the circumstances of each individual case. The current medical card income guideline issued by the chief executive officers of the health boards or authority for a single person, aged under 66 years who lives with family, is &euro;123 per week. It should be remembered that health board chief executive officers have discretion in the issuing of medical cards and also that a range of income sources are excluded by the health boards when assessing medical card eligibility. Many allowances such as carer's allowance, child benefit, domiciliary care allowance, family income supplement and foster care allowance are all disregarded when determining a person's eligibility. Given these factors, and the discretionary powers of the chief executive officers, having an income that exceeds the guidelines does not mean that a person will not be eligible for a medical card, and a medical card may still be awarded if the chief executive officer considers that a person's medical needs or other circumstances would justify this.</P>

      <P>As the Deputy is aware, 515 was the figure published in the national intellectual disability database for 2002. The number of persons with an intellectual disability accommodated in psychiatric hospitals in May 2003 was 438. Between 1999 and 2002 additional revenue funding of &euro;10.476 million and &euro;27.4 million capital funding was allocated to the programme to provide more appropriate care settings for persons with an intellectual disability and those with autism accommodated in psychiatric hospitals, those accommodated in de-designated units, which were formally designated as part of the psychiatric services, and others who moved some years ago from psychiatric hospitals to alternative accommodation which is now unsuitable for their needs.</P>
      <P>Of the &euro;15 million capital funding recently allocated to the services for people with an intellectual disability or autism, &euro;985,000 was specifically allocated to a number of the psychiatric hospitals in which people with an intellectual disability or autism are accommodated. This funding will allow the Eastern Regional Health Authority and the health boards to address such areas as the backlog of maintenance, refurbishment, re-equipping, replacement of vehicles used within the services or works related to fire precautions and health and safety issues.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is specific mention of the programme to transfer persons with an intellectual disability or autism from psychiatric hospitals and other inappropriate placements, in the health strategy, with a stated objective to complete the programme as soon as possible and no later than 2006. My Department continues to work with the relevant health boards and the Eastern Regional Health Authority to put in place a range of alternative accommodation, including purpose built facilities, <Col N="1425" />community-based housing and the refurbishment of some existing accommodation.</P>
    <P>The Deputy will appreciate that I cannot, at this stage, give specific commitments on levels of expenditure in 2004 for any particular service as these matters will be decided as part of the discussions on the Estimates and budget for that year between my Department and the Department of Finance.</P>

      <P>The taxi hardship panel was an independent three person panel established to report in general terms on the nature and extent of extreme personal financial hardship that may have been experienced by individual taxi licence holders arising from loss of income as a direct result of the liberalisation of the taxi market. The panel has completed its investigation and has published its findings. The report of the taxi hardship panel recommends the establishment of a scheme to provide payments to individual taxi licence holders who fall into one of six categories that the panel assessed as having suffered extreme personal financial hardship arising from taxi liberalisation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I have explained previously in the House, based on legal precedent, there can be no legal <Col N="1426" />duty on the State to compensate taxi licence holders in relation to open market licence values that may have existed prior to liberalisation. Any payments to be made on foot of these recommendations will not represent compensation but rather compassionate payments in respect of extreme personal financial hardship.</P>
    <P>Area Development Management Limited (ADM) has been engaged to administer and manage a scheme to implement the recommendations of the taxi hardship panel report. ADM will issue application forms this week to persons who made submissions to the taxi hardship panel. An advertisement will also be published in the national newspapers, advising of the availability of the application form. ADM will commence assessing applications as soon as application forms are returned. I expect the assessment process will get under way this month and that the first payments under the process will be made before the end of the year. Payments will be made on the basis of the parameters set out in the taxi hardship panel report. It is not possible at this stage to estimate the number of people who will qualify for payment.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 156 and 157 together. I have been informed by the Garda authorities that there are no stations in County Carlow or County Wicklow that have one way glass systems installed for use by victims and witnesses. There are no plans to install such systems in Garda stations. A witness in a formal identification parade may identify a suspect by means of numbers rather than by physical touching. The object is to provide the witness with an opportunity to view the parade and make an independent evaluation and/or identification.</P>

      <P>There are 417 prisoners serving sentences for the crimes listed in the following table which are readily identifiable as public order type offences. The number of persons serving a sentence for each offence is also included in the table. A significant number of the prisoners included in this table are also serving sentences for other non-public order offences. Similarly, a considerable number are serving sentences for more than one of the offences listed below. For this reason the total number in the right column of the table substantially exceeds the figure of 417 referred to above.</P>

    <P>For other offences, for example assault, it is impossible to ascertain whether there is a public <Col N="1433" />order dimension to a case without examining each instance individually. Such an exercise would be a time consuming and expensive operation and I could not allocate valuable resources to such work at this time.</P>
    <P>As regards previous convictions, a comprehensive information technology system, PRIS, contains detailed prisoner information and it commenced in each prison institution in 2001. It will improve over time as more data is entered into this system. It is anticipated that more detailed statistics will be available in the coming years. At present the Irish Prison Service can only provide information on offenders committed on sentence since the installation of PRIS. Consequently, any figures provided would be incomplete and therefore somewhat misleading.</P>

      <P>Part II of the Criminal Justice Act 1999 came into effect on 26 May 1999. Section 4 provides for the creation of a new offence related to the possession of drugs with a value of &euro;12,697 or more for the purpose of sale or supply. This crime is punishable by a sentence of up to life imprisonment.</P>
      <P>Section 5 provides that the court shall, in imposing sentence, specify a minimum period of imprisonment to be served of not less than ten years upon conviction for the offence. It also provides that a court is entitled to depart from the imposition of the minimum sentence where there are exceptional and specific circumstances relating to the offence, or the person convicted of the offence, that would make it unjust in all the circumstances to impose the minimum ten year sentence. Factors the court may have regard to in this respect include whether the person pleaded guilty. If this is the case the stage they indicated the intention to plead guilty and the circumstances in which the indication was given and whether the person materially assisted the investigation of the offence.</P>
      <P>I am informed by the Garda authorities that, according to their records, the number of persons convicted under section 15A of the Misuse of Drugs Act 1977-84 since it became law on 26 May 1999 is 276. Under this provision the number of persons who have received prison sentences of ten years or more to date is 12.</P>
      <P>The information available to me suggests two things. First, that the provision has resulted in a significant number of drug traffickers pleading guilty to serious drug trafficking offences. Second, it has resulted in the imposition of substantial sentences for such offences including the imposition of the minimum mandatory sentence of at least ten years in a number of cases.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1434" />My Department has commissioned a study of convictions for the new drug trafficking offence created by section 4 and I am awaiting the results. Preliminary indications from the study suggest that the main factors taken into account by the courts in situations where a sentence of less than ten years has been imposed are where the accused pleads guilty to the offence, co-operates with the prosecuting authorities, and materially assists the Garda Síochána with its investigations.</P>
    <P>The provisions under section 5 of the Criminal Justice Act 1999 is one of a number of legislative instruments designed to address the issue of national and international drug trafficking. As with other instruments the problem is constantly monitored to ensure that the appropriate measures are in place to address the issue.</P>

      <P>The provision, at considerable cost, of an extra 1,200 prison places in the past five years has largely addressed the issue of overcrowding that became a chronic problem for the prison system by the early 1990s. During the period 1992 to 1997 approximately one-fifth of the sentenced population were on temporary release. Most of these persons had been released to make space for others starting prison sentences. Even with the increase in capacity since then, some accommodation difficulties still occur occasionally in prisons, most notably in the women's prison at Mountjoy, the Dóchas Centre.</P>
      <P>In the case of accommodation for adult male prisoners, pressures are largely addressed through the regular transfer of inmates to prisons outside Dublin, especially Castlerea Prison and the Midlands Prison. The issue is not totally one of matching the global prisoner population to a global figure for beds or cells. A number of factors must be taken into account including the prisoner's age, gender, the nature of the offence, location, security and whether they are on remand or sentenced.</P>
      <P>An Agreed Programme for Government gives a commitment to continue the modernisation of prisons and to the provision of sufficient places to avoid serious overcrowding in the future.</P>

      <P>The provision of an extra 1,200 prison places in the past five years has largely <Col N="1435" />addressed the issue of overcrowding that was a chronic problem for the prison system. Work remains to be done on the prison facilities at Mountjoy, Portlaoise, and Cork prisons. With many prisoners being committed annually on long sentences, the prospect of increasing numbers of long stay prisoners will be an issue. It is not simply one of matching the global prisoner population to a global figure for beds or cells. A number of factors must be taken into account including the prisoner's age, gender, the nature of the offence, location, security and whether they are on remand or sentenced.</P>
      <P>An Agreed Programme for Government gives a commitment to continue the modernisation of prisons and to the provision of sufficient places to avoid serious overcrowding and the reopening of the revolving door.</P>
      <P>Early next year a new wing will provide Limerick Prison with 100 spaces. The Department of Finance has approved a tender for a new wing at Portlaoise Prison and is expected to issue in January 2004. This measure will replace the prison's C block which is in a poor state.</P>
      <P>There are two options available for the replacement of outdated prisoner accommodation at Mountjoy Prison. The first option will redevelop the prison on the existing site, involving the demolition and reconstruction of existing buildings. The second option will relocate the prison to a greenfield site. Exploration of the economics and feasibility of these options is ongoing. It is not possible to say when a decision will be made on the options available. The possibility of acquiring suitable lands in the Dublin area and surrounding counties will have a major bearing in deciding on which option to pursue.</P>

      <P>My Department has been actively engaged with the Society for the Irish Motor Industry, the Irish Motor Vehicle Recyclers Association, the Metal Recyclers Association of Ireland and other stakeholders with a view to developing a producer responsibility initiative to implement the European Parliament and Council Directive 2000/53/EC on end-of-life vehicles.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Necessary enabling provisions to facilitate the implementation of the directive have been incorporated in the Protection of the Environment Act 2003. Part VA of the Waste Management Act 1996, as inserted by section 44 of the Protection of the Environment Act 2003, explicitly provides for: producer responsibility for the free deposit of ELVs at authorised treatment facilities for appropriate treatment and recovery in line with the directive requirements; the mandatory deposit of ELVs by their registered owners at authorised <Col N="1436" />treatment facilities for appropriate treatment and recovery; and the issue of certificates of destruction in respect of ELVs deposited at authorised treatment facilities for scrapping.</P>
    <P>Part VA of the Waste Management Act 1996, as recently amended, further provides: details relating to the issue of certificates of destruction by authorised treatment facilities shall be notified to, and recorded on, the national vehicle file; and vehicles deposited at authorised treatment facilities for appropriate treatment and recovery, and in respect of which certificates of destruction have issued, shall not be subsequently registered, licensed, used in a public place or exported.</P>
    <P>These provisions are intended to ensure that a full traceability system is in place so that ELVs cannot subsequently be reused once deposited for scrapping.</P>
    <P>On foot of the enactment of the necessary enabling provisions, my Department continues to engage with the relevant stakeholder groups on the detailed mechanisms for the operation of the free ELV take-back arrangements required by the directive, including how such arrangements will be funded. Such detailed mechanisms will be provided for in regulations. I intend to implement the proposed ELV take-back scheme by means of a PRI. This would involve the establishment of a collective industry based company similar to the Repak model that operates for the recovery and recycling of packaging waste. In accordance with the usual arrangements for PRIs responsibility for funding the free take-back scheme would fall to the motor industry. The timing of the commencement of free ELV take-back is dependent on the conclusion of the discussions with the relevant stakeholder groups. These discussions will be concluded as soon as possible to facilitate early implementation of the proposed ELV take-back system and the other ancillary elements associated with it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government (Mr. N. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>It was not considered appropriate to initiate a scheme of multiannual funding for the implementation of the accommodation related costs of the integrated homeless strategy in 2002 in the light of the difficulty of establishing a realistic baseline expenditure figure for the services recommended for development under the strategy. Since then the requirements of the sector have been assessed on an annual basis and funding has been allocated. This has resulted in a significant increase in the level of funding from &euro;12.5 million in 1999 to &euro;50 million this year. The increase has effectively ensured the continued <Col N="1437" />funding at local authority level of approved projects as well as the establishment of new projects.</P>
      <P>The need for greater security of funding on the part of service providers is acknowledged. Among the initiatives being taken in this context is the establishment, in the Dublin area, of a system of three year contracts between the statutory and voluntary agencies. The possibility of introducing a similar system will be pursued with other local authorities and the issue of multiannual funding will be kept under continuing review.</P>

His conclusions are based on the limited monitoring that was possible in the circumstances under which it was undertaken.</P>
      <P>Subsequent scientific investigations were carried out into the welfare of deer used for carted stag hunting. These developments provided a basis for discussions with the club and for its development of a hunting code of conduct, in consultation with officials of the then Department of Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands and of the Department of Agriculture and Food. At the conclusion of this process in September 1999, the Department of Agriculture and Food indicated to the then Department of Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands its satisfaction with the code of conduct that the club submitted in support of its licence application.</P>
      <P>Subsequent licences issued to the club include a condition it should carry out hunts in accordance with its approved code of practice.

It is intended to incorporate the revised manual in technical guidance document H on part H &ndash; drainage and waste water disposal &ndash; of the national building regulations.</P>

      <P>The Government approved the use of electronic voting and counting at the European and local elections in June 2004 following its successful use in a number of constituencies at the general election and at the Nice referendum in 2002. The purpose of the new system is to modernise the electoral system that has generally remained unchanged for over 100 years. Cost is an important factor but it was not the sole determinant factor for introducing the system. It is intended to make it easier for electors to vote, to eliminate spoilt votes except if they arise in the postal and special voter categories, to improve the accuracy of vote counting and to provide more efficiency in electoral administration.</P>
      <P>Final figures on the comparative cost of a national poll carried out manually and electronically will not be available until late next year. When comparing costs it is necessary to note factors such as the increasing size of the electorate, days of the week on which polling and vote counting are held, polling hours, number of polls held on the same day and increasing labour costs. The Government considered these factors when reaching its decision.</P>
      <P>The initial cost of acquiring the system as a capital asset that requires no regular maintenance between polls was taken into consideration. Substantial savings will arise with each poll held. For example, it is anticipated that the number of staff required for vote counting will decrease by at least 75% and the number of ballot papers requiring printing will reduce from around three million to about 30,000. Other efficiencies will arise from the use of the system. Consultants were not engaged to assess comparative costs.</P>

      <P>Clearly defined plans are in place for emergencies for which my <Col N="1441" />Department, local authorities and agencies under my Department's aegis have lead responsibility.</P>
      <P>The Government has in place a national emergency plan for nuclear accidents that is regularly updated. My Department has the lead role in its implementation through the Emergency Response Co-ordination Committee that includes representatives of other Departments and the Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland. The committee is tasked with responding to any major incident that could result in a significant release of radioactivity.</P>
      <P>Last year my Department published an information booklet entitled National Planning for Nuclear Emergencies. It sets out the principal features of the national emergency plan for nuclear accidents. An Information leaflet summarising the main elements of the booklet was distributed to every household here.</P>
      <P>A Government task force on emergency planning is chaired by my colleague, the Minister for Defence. It co-ordinates the work of Departments and agencies with key roles in emergency planning. I refer the Deputy to the reply given by the Minister for Defence to Questions Nos. 83, 121 and 122 on 2 April. The Government task force seeks to ensure that emergency planning challenges are addressed, responses to possible threats are developed and appropriate co-ordination of response arrangements are in place. Recently my Department and the City and County Managers Association formed a sub-committee under existing Department-CCMA structures to act as an interface and forum on local authority emergency planning issues. It provides a vital link between the local and national structures.</P>
      <P>In the context of creating public awareness about the emergency preparedness of central and local government, my Department reminded local authorities in April that it was important that information about local emergency plans be available to the public to ensure confidence in a local emergency response. City and county managers were asked to ensure that information on local emergency plans was publicised through council offices, libraries and council websites, including out of hours emergency contact numbers for local authority services. Arrangements have been put in place to have staff in each authority available to deal with queries from the public during office hours and to ensure that such queries are directed to designated staff.</P>
      <P>In the case of extreme weather conditions local authorities are reminded by my Department on an annual basis of the necessity to revise and update, as necessary, their contingency plans for dealing with the consequences of severe weather conditions. Local authorities have been provided with detailed guidance in my Department's Memorandum on Maintenance of Essential Services in Severe Weather Conditions issued in November 2000.</P>
      <P>The national SARS response was developed primarily by my colleague, the Minister for Health and Children. He was assisted by an interdepartmental co-ordination group on which my Department was represented.</P>

      <P>Child benefit is payable in respect of all children up to the age of 16 years and continues to be paid in respect of children up to age 19 who are in full-time education, or who have a physical or mental disability.</P>
      <P>According to figures collected under the quarterly national household survey by the Central Statistics Office for the final quarter of 2002, there were an estimated 116,700 students aged 19 to 22 years. Extending child benefit to this category would, therefore, cost in the region of &euro;185 million per annum.</P>
      <P>The policy of the Government over the past number of years has been to substantially increase the amount spent on child benefit for all families. The Government's commitment to this policy is reflected in the substantial resources invested in the child benefit scheme since 1997.</P>
      <P>It is recognised that there is a need to target resources at persons on low incomes with children in third level. For this reason, entitlement to child dependant allowance has been extended to age 22 from October 2003 where the parent of a full-time third level student has been in receipt of a short-term social welfare payment for six months or more. This measure is estimated to cost &euro;630,000 in a full year. Short-term schemes include such payments as unemployment benefit and assistance, disability benefit and supplementary welfare allowance. The provision already applies to recipients of long-term payments.</P>

      <P>Under the terms of the supplementary welfare allowance scheme, which is administered on behalf of my Department by the regional health boards, payment of a weekly or monthly supplement may be made in respect of rent to eligible people in the State whose means are insufficient to meet their accommodation needs.</P>
      <P>Rent supplements are subject to a means test and are normally calculated to ensure that a person, after the payment of rent, has an income equal to the rate of supplementary welfare allowance appropriate to his or her family circumstances, less a minimum contribution of &euro;12 which recipients are required to pay from their own resources.</P>
      <P>The South Western Area Health Board was contacted on behalf of the individual in question and has advised that she had been assessed for rent supplement as a single parent with one child. I understand that the person concerned gave birth to her second child some weeks ago. In view of the change in her circumstances, the rate of rent supplement payable has been reviewed to take account of her new family composition.</P>
      <P>In the course of the review an error was discovered in the calculation of the amount of rent supplement paid for the period June 2003 to October 2003. Maintenance payments of &euro;30 per week were not taken into account in the means test thus giving rise to an overpayment of rent supplement. The health board does not propose to seek recovery of this overpayment in view of the circumstances of the case.</P>
      <P>The correct amount of rent supplement is scheduled to go into payment on 24 November 2003. My Department will carry out a review of her one-parent family payment in view of the change in her circumstances. The level of rent supplement payable may fall to be revised in the light of the outcome of this review.</P>
