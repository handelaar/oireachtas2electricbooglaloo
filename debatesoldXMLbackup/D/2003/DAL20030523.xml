    <Title>Official Languages Bill 2002  [  Seanad ]  : Second Stage (Resumed).</Title>
    <P>Question again proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="DamienEnglishFG" hpid="Mr. English Mr. English">
      <NameTxt>Mr. English</NameTxt>
      <P>I referred yesterday to how long this Bill is in the pipeline and I am disappointed it does not reflect the multicultural aspect of modern Ireland. Irish and English are the official languages of the State and it is the Government's responsibility to help ensure everyone who achieves residency in the country has both an oral and written command of one or both languages as part of an asylum application. They should also have an oral and written knowledge of our laws and customs. That would be one of the main aspects of an official languages Bill to me and it would be a significant help to everyone. It would help immigrants to settle and blend in and make it easier for many people to accept them.</P>
      <P>Our language and customs took thousands of years to develop and it is only right that our laws should reflect that. Without drilling them down other people's throats or making them feel inferior about their cultures, it is the job of the House to ensure the laws of the land reflect our core beliefs and values and to protect our language and customs, which have been handed down to us by past generations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Again during this session of the Dáil, I cannot help but refer to cutbacks. I am in favour of the Bill but I find it hard to accept legislation that will have no real funds to enforce it. It seems to be a worrying trend in the House for a Minister to justify his or her existence by putting laws on the Statute Book but I fear those laws are without teeth. Has the Minister carried out any costings for this legislation? How much will implementing the legislation cost and will it offer value for money? The figures are not there to prove that. I wonder how much value we will get from this because on the past record of the Government <Col N="802" />we have not had value for money and that is worrying.</P>
    <P>Bringing forward laws without teeth is a cynical, dangerous exercise because it brings the law into disrepute. It gives the message that the law is only to be obeyed if it is deemed important on the day. Sadly, this sentiment seems to run right through the Administration, from failing to properly implement the life-saving penalty points system, which clearly needs more gardaí to make it work, right across the board to motoring offences and tax evasion. We know the Revenue Commissioners are undermanned while the health boards are overmanned in administration and undermanned in frontline staff. The Revenue makes money for the State and what happens? Health boards spend or waste it. That is our little country.</P>
    <P>It does not make much sense but that sums up the Government: there is no sense involved, just self-preservation. The Government has developed a name for trying to make itself look good by attempting to solve all problems on paper without enforcing policy, thus undermining the power of the House. I would be the first to defend the purpose of government but that is hard to do. There is nothing in the Bill which suggests it will exist other than in name only. There seems to be no real funding from the Department of Finance to back it up and while I hope that is not the case, I fear it is. If I am right, this has been another waste of scarce and valuable Dáil time and taxpayers' money.</P>

      <P>Ba mhaith liom fáilte a chur roimh an mBille seo. Mar a dúirt an t-Aire inné, seo ceann des na rudaí is tábhachtaí a deineadh don nGaeilge le fada an lá. D'fhéadfaí a rá nach bfhuil sin deacair mar ní mórán atá déanta ar son na Gaeilge ó thaobh dlí de le fada. Ach, tosach maith leath na hoibre agus is tosach maith é seo.</P>
      <P>Tá éigcinnteacht i roinnt áiteanna san mBille agus tá cupla ceist agam a d'fhéadfadh an t-Aire freagra a thabhairt orthu nuair a bheidh sé ag labhairt ag deireadh na díospóireachta.</P>
      <P>Tá a fhios againn go raibh a lán conspóide ann na blianta ó shin ar fud na Gaeltachta mar gheall ar stádas na Gaeilge agus mar gheall ar stádas an dátheangachais. Briseadh comharthaí bóithre agus sráideanna agus caitheadh isteach in aibhneacha iad. Tá an t-am sin thart anois. Tá borradh agus forbairt tagtha ar an nGaeilge leis na blianta anois. Ba cheart creidiúint a thabhairt do eagrais cosúil le Conradh na Gaeilge as ucht an obair a rinne siad. Rinne Bord na Gaeilge sár oibre agus tá súil agam go ndéanfaidh Foras na Gaeilge an obair chéanna.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Tá a fhios againn an sár obair atá déanta ag scoileanna cosúil le Scoil Móibhí agus Scoil Chaitríona, i mo dháilcheantair féin, scoileanna atá ann leis na blianta fada. Ba mhaith liom tréaslú, chomh maith, le Scoil an tSeachtar Laoch i mBa<Col N="803" />ile Munna. Is beag duine a cheap go bhféadfadh aon chóras oideachais borradh a thabhairt don Ghaeilge in áit cosúil le Baile Munna mar tá a fhios ag gach éinne gur áit í a bhfuil sé deacair aon obair a dhéanamh inti. Ach tá sár obair déanta ag Míne Bean Uí Chribín, Dónal Ó Loinsigh agus ag daoine mar iad. Cuireann sé gliondar orm dul isteach ins na scoileanna sin anois agus an Ghaeilge a cloisint iontu. Scoil eile is ea Gaelscoil Cholmcille. Tá brón orm, faraor, nach bhfuil foirgneamh ag an scoil sin. Tá sí lonnaithe faoi láthair i halla chlub sacair i mo dháilcheantair agus ba cheart cúnamh a thabhairt di chun suíomh a cheannach.</P>
    <P>Tá sár obair déanta freisin ag na naíonraí agus b'fhearr cabhair a thabhairt dóibhmar níl cabhair fhairsing go leor á fáil acu. Is íontach an chabhair gur féidir a thabhairt do ghrúpa trí dheontas &euro;1,000 a thabhairt chun ranganna a chur ar bun do pháistí óga. Sin bunchloch chóras maith Gaelscolaíochta in aon áit.</P>
    <P>Tá sár obair déanta freisin ag Comhaltas Ceoltóirí Éireann chun cultúr na Gaeilge agus cultúr na tíre a chur romhainn. Reachtálann Cumann Lúthchleas Gael comórtas SCÓR. B'fhéidir go bhfuil an comórtas sin imithe i léig le déanaí ach bhí mé ag éisteacht maidin inné le huachtarán Chumann Lúthchleas Gael agus dúirt sé go bhfuil suas le 75% de chlubanna i gcontaetha áirithe páirteach ins an gcomórtas sin agus go bhfuil an figiúir chomh híseal le 10% i gcontaetha eile. B'fhéidir go bhféadfadh Roinn an Aire cabhair a thabhairt don chomórtas sin. Níl a fhios agam an bhfuil comórtas díospóireachta Ghael-Linn ar siúl fós ach bhíodh tionchar an-mhor aige ar chaighdeán na Gaeilge ins na meánscoileanna i mBaile Átha Cliath a bhfuil aithne agam orthu.</P>
    <P>Tá cuid mhaith suime ag na meáin cumarsáide i gcúrsaí na Gaeilge. Cuireann <i>The Irish Times</i> béim ar chúrsaí na Gaeilge le laethúil, go minic, agus go seachtainiúil ar a laghad. Leathnaíonn an leath-leathanach seachtainiúil an díospóireacht ar chúrsaí Gaeilge. Mar an gcéanna, tá cabhair an-mhaith tugtha ag Raidió na Gaeltachta agus ag teilifís na Gaeilge do dheimhniú agus leathnú na Gaeilge ag na daoine sin, cosúil liom féin, nach bhfuil líofacht na Gaeilge chomh maith sin acu. Ach is é Radio na Life an ghrúpa meáin i mBaile Átha Cliath is mó tionchar ar chúrsaí Gaeilge. Tá grúpa éisteoirí ag an stáisiún sin a bhfuil suim acu sa Ghaeilge agus a bhfuil adhmanna na Gaeilge á gcur chun cinn acu.</P>
    <P>Ar an dtaobh eile den scéal níl mórán tacaíochta á thabhairt ag RTE. Ní bheinn sásta leis an tacaíocht atá á thabhairt ag na stáisiúin sin do chúrsaí Gaeilge. Níor chualas focal Gaeilge ariamh ar TV3. An mbeidh aon chumhacht ag an mBille seo chun cur in iúl do ghrúpaí mar TV3, Today FM agus ar uile, go bhfuil dualgas orthu cláracha Gaeilge a chur ar fáil. Ba cheart go <Col N="804" />mbeadh béim ar an public service remit atá ag na stáisiúin sin, má tá a leithéid acu.</P>
    <P>Is é atá ar intinn san mBille seo ná cumhacht a thabhairt don Aire chun dréacht scéim a ullmhú ag na comhlachtaí sin san earnáil phoiblí. Cuirim fáilte leis sin. Tá adhmanna an Bhille réadúil go leor. Ní dóigh liom féin go n-athróidh cúis na Gaeilge go mór nuair a reachtálfar an Bille seo but we will achieve much with little steps. Tá plean sa mBille chun straitéis a cur le chéile ar feadh tréimhse trí bliain i ngach comhlucht poiblí. Thógfadh sé an am sin ar ghrúpa plean a chur i gcrích.</P>
    <P>Tá ceachtanna gur féidir a fhoghlaim faoi láthair. Dá gcuirfí comhfhreagras ag comhairlí cosúil le Bárdas Átha Cliath trí Ghaeilge d'fhaighfí freagra ar ais trí Ghaeilge. Ní thiocfadh an freagra ar ais go scioptha ach thiocfadh sé. Molaim bainisteoir na cathrach, John Fitzgerald, agus na hoifigigh Gaeilge atá ag an mbárdas as an obair atá déanta acu chun rudaí beaga a chur chun cinn. Tá treoir ins na hoifigí, cuirtear fáilte roimh comhfhreagras i nGaeilge agus tá comharthaí dátheangacha timpeall na háite. Ba cheart go mbeadh a leithéid á dhéanamh go forleathan ach níl a fhios agam an bhfuil sé.</P>
    <P>Cuireann an córas ceard oideachais díomá orm uaireanta. Cuireann cuid des na coistí béim ar leathnú na Gaeilge, cosúil le Tiobrad Árainn ag Labhairt, ach tá coistí eile timpeall na tíre agus is beag cabhair a thugann siad don Ghaeilge. An bhfuil cumhacht ag an Aire cur ina luí orthu san go bhfuil dualgas orthu plean a chur le chéile agus a chur i gcrích.</P>
    <P>Ní maith liom an coincheap sin go mbeidh cigire ag cur scrúdú ar gach chomhlucht poibli agus ag gearradh píonóis orthu. B'fhéidir go bhfuil sin riachtanach ach bheadh sé i bhfad níos fearr dá mbeadh nascadh ann den carrot and stick approach. Níor mhaith an rud é a dhul ar ais go dtí an cultúr a bhí ann nuair a thosaigh mé ag teagasc, leis an chigire ag teacht isteach agus ag déanamh comháirimh ar an méid ama a chaith duine ag múineadh na Gaeilge agus ábhar eile. Ní theastaíonn go dtiocfadh an cultúr sin ar ais. Tá súil nach agam bhfuil sin ar intinn an Aire nó an Rialtais a dhéanamh.</P>
    <P>Níl mórán daoine sásta le caighdeán múinteoireachta na Gaeilge sna bunscoileanna anois. Conas is féidir teanga a mhúineadh ó cheithre bhliain d'aois go dtí 12 bhliain d'aois agus ansin tagann daltaí amach ag deireadh an thréimhse sin agus is beag eolas atá acu ar an teanga labhartha? Tá fadhb againn agus caithfimid díriú uirthi. Níl mé cinnte go bhfuil módhanna múinteoireachta don Ghaeilge chomh nua-aimseartha le múineadh na Fraincíse ná na Spáinníse agus a leithéid. Ba cheart go mbeadh múineadh na Gaeilge ar an leibhéal céanna le múineadh aon teanga eile mar is í an daratheanga í do fhormhór na ndaoine.</P>
    <P>Ní féidir bheith ró-chriticiúil ar na múinteoirí ach tá ceist le cur agus gá le freagra a fháil cén <Col N="805" />fáth go bhfuil caighdeán na Gaeilge chomh híseal sin ag formhór na ndaoine. Tá baint ag an chuid is mó againn anseo leis an mhúinteoireacht agus rinne muid iarracht Gaeilge a mhúineadh. An bhféadfaimís lámh a chur ar ár gcroí agus a rá go raibh muid sásta leis an chaighdeán a bhí ag na daltaí ag deireadh na mblianta sin? Ní raibh mé sásta riamh leis.</P>
    <P>Conas is féidir le caighdeán an-ard a bheith ag Gaelscoil Bhaile Munna nó Scoil Lorcáin agus ni féidir an caighdeán céanna a aimsiú i scoileanna eile? Is féidir a rá go bhfoghlaimíonn siad achan ábhar trí Ghaeilge. B'fhéidir gur fearr, má theastaíonn uainn borradh a thabhairt don Ghaeilge, béim a thabhairt ar scolaíocht lán-Ghaeilge.</P>
    <P>Bhí scéim fiontair as Gaeilge i DCU agus níor cheap aon duine go mbeadh cohort scolairí le fáil le staidéar ollscoile a dhéanamh trí Ghaeilge. Tharla sé, áfach, mar thóg uachtarán na hollscoile ag an am, Danny O'Hare, suim sa chúrsa agus bhí foireann bhreá aige a dhírigh isteach ar chúrsa a chur ar fáil i gcomhoibriú leis an Roinn Oideachais agus Eolaíochta agus an Higher Education Authority . An bhfuil aon seans ann go bhféadfadh cúrsaí cosúil leis sin a chur a fáil sna hinstitiúidí teicneolaíochta nó sna hollscoileanna eile? Chabhródh sin le cás na Gaeilge.</P>
    <P>Tá mé sásta go dteastaíonn ón Aire Bille a chur romhainn a bheidh iontach tábhachtach don Gaeilge. Nuair a bheidh sé ag labhairt ag deireadh na Céime, b'fhéidir go bhfreagróidh sé na ceisteanna a chuir Conradh na Gaeilge. Deir lucht an chonartha faoin Bhille gur cheart dúinn a chinntiú go mbeidh seirbhísí Gaeilge ó chomhlachtaí poiblí gan cheist sa Ghaeltacht, go mbeidh an Gaeltacht mar aon riaracháin a riarfaí trí Ghaeilge agus go bhfaighfear freagra i nGaeilge ar chomhfhreagras Ghaeilge chuig comhlacht poiblí. Is amhlaidh atá cúrsaí le comhfhreagas Gaeilge chuig an Aontas Eorpach. Ba mhaith leis an chonradh go mbeadh comhsheasamh ag an Ghaeilge leis an Bhéarla ar fhoirmeacha, ar fhógraí agus i seirbhísí idirghníomhacha na comhlachtaí poiblí faoi mar atá cúrsaí i dtíortha dátheangacha eile.</P>
    <P>Más féidir freagra a thabhairt do na ceisteanna sin agus na cinn eile a cuireadh, beidh mé an-sásta. Molaim an Bille seo agus tréaslaím leis an Aire.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TonyGregory" hpid="Mr. Gregory Mr. Gregory">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gregory</NameTxt>
      <P>Cuirim fáilte roimh roinnt rudaí áirithe i mBille na dTeangacha Oifígiúla. Níl mé ag cur in iúl nach bhfuil laige ag baint leis an Bhille seo. Cén Bille a tháinig riamh os comhair an Tí seo nach raibh laige ag baint leis? Níl mé ag rá nach bhfuil Bille i bhfad níos láidre ag teastáil ag an bpointe seo agus i bhfad níos mó infheistiú airgid in éineacht leis. Níl aon dabht ach go bhfuil.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Is é seo, áfach, an chéad Bhille dá leithéid a theacht os ár gcomhair, Bille ara bhfuil gach duine a thugann tacaíocht don teanga náisiúnta ag feitheamh le fada an lá. Cuirim fáilte roimhe <Col N="806" />toisc go dtugann sé an seans aitheantas agus stádas oifigiúil nach raibh ann ar chor ar bith don Ghaeilge go dtí seo a chur ar fáil.</P>
    <P>In alt 20(4), tá an chuid is tábhachtaí den Bhille sa mhéid is go mbunófaí oifig chomisinéir na dteangacha oifigiúla, coimisinéar a bheidh neamhspleách i gcomhlíonadh a aidhmeanna agus is í Uachtarán na hÉireann a cheapfaidh an duine mar choimisinéar. Ba chóir go mbeadh an post nua seo rí-thábhachtach ó thaobh stádas na teanga náisiúnta a cosaint agus a feabhsú ins na blianta os ár gcomhair amach.</P>
    <P>Tá dóchas agam go mbeidh sé mar aidhm ag an gcoimisinéir caighdeán a bhaint amach in Éirinn a bheadh ar chomh-chéim le córas Cheanada. Níl aon dabht ná go bhfuil obair mhór le déanamh chun a leithéid a bhaint amach ach níl fáth ar bith nár chóir don Rialtas agus don choimisinéir an cuspóir sin a chur rompu agus a bhaint amach má tá siad dáiríre ar chor bith ar an gceist seo.</P>
    <P>Tá eagraíochtaí sa tír seo atá ag troid agus ag déanamh sár oibre don chultúr Gaeilge agus don Ghaeilge le fada. Go minic bíonn siad ag snámh in aghaidh an easa. Creideann roinnt des na heagraíochtaí sin go bhfuil sé riachtanach an Bille seo a láidriú agus a fheabhsú le leasaithe éagsúla. Níl sé i gceist agam na leasaithe sin a gcur os comhair an Tí ag an bpointe seo ach iarraim ar an Aire féachaint go cúramach ar na leasaithe éagsúla atá á mholadh ag na heagraíochtaí sin agus, mar a dúirt an Teachta Carey, ar moltaí Chonradh na Gaeilge go háirithe. Iarraim air go ndéanfaidh sé féin agus a chomhairleoirí a ndícheall glacadh leis an oiread agus is féidir acu ionas go mbeidh seans go mbeidh aontacht ag baint leis an iarracht nua seo cothram na féinne a chinntiú don Ghaeilge sa tír seo agus nach mbeidh sé le rá ag aon duine, más féidir sin a bhaint amach, gur cailleadh an deis Bille éifeachtach a chur tríd an Dáil .</P>
    <P>Tá i bhfad níos mó i gceist le teanga ná meán cumarsáide. Is í an nasc is bríomhaire idir dhaoine í. Is súil eile ar an saol gach uile teanga. Múnlaíonn sí meon aigne an chainteora agus saibhríonn sí ár gcomh-oidhreacht dhaonna. Sa lá atá inniu ann is teanga faoi bhrú gach teanga nach bhfuiltear á húsáid go forleathan i ngnóthaí oifigiúla agus ins na seirbhísí poiblí. Caithimid ar fad a admháil gur eisceacht í seirbhís phoiblí as Gaeilge, fiú sa Ghaeltacht. Is gá pleanáil agus reachtaíocht a bheith ar fáil chun é seo a leigheas, reachtaíocht a chinnteoidh, ar an gcéad dul síos, go mbeidh seirbhísí Gaeilge ar fáil ó chomhluchtaí poiblí gan cheist sa Ghaeltacht agus go mbeadh an Ghaeltacht mar aonad riaracháin a riarfaí trí Ghaeilge. Caithimid a chinntiú go mbeadh comh-sheasamh ag an nGaeilge leis an mBéarla ar fhoirmeacha, ar fhográin, ar fhógrái agus i seirbhísí idir-ghníomhacha na gcomhluchtaí poiblí, faoi mar atá cúrsaí i dtíortha dátheangacha eile.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="807" />Níl sé soiléir domsa go dtugann an Bille, mar atá anseo, aghaidh orthu siúd. Tugtar le fios, le heaspa seirbhísí poiblí as Gaeilge agus an Ghaeilge a bheith dúnta amach <i>de facto </i>ón saol poiblí in Éirinn, nach bhfuil mórán áit don Ghaeilge in Éirinn na haoise seo. Is beag spreagadh a thugann sé sin don té a bhfuil Gaeilge aige nó aici í a thabhairt ar aghaidh dá gclann agus is beag spreagadh a thugann sé don té nach bhfuil Gaeilge aige nó aici dul leis an teanga náisiúnta. Má ghlacann tú leis gur dlú-chuid dár bhféiniúlacht í an Ghaeilge, go bhfuil sí lárnach do shain-mhíniú chultúrtha an Éireannachais, is cóir tacú le roinnt mhaith leasaithe atá curtha os ár gcomhair amach cheana féin ag eagraíochtaí Gaeilge chun todhchaí na Gaeilge mar theanga bheo agus mar theanga phobail a chinntiú.</P>
    <P>Is minic agus is fada muid ag éisteacht le gearáin faoi easpa téacsleabhar Gaeilge i scoileanna na Gaeltachta agus i scoileanna lán-Ghaeilge taobh amuigh des na ceantair Gaeltachta. Bhíos, breis agus 20 bliain ó shin, ag múineadh i scoil lán-Ghaeilge i mBaile Átha Cliath, scoil a bhí faoi stiúradh bhráthair uasail dhíograsaigh a rinne éacht chun oideachas trí Ghaeilge a cur ar fáil agus gach uile gné de chultúr na Gaeilge a spreagadh agus a mhúnlú, agus d'éirigh thar barr leis. Ach chuir sé as domsa i gcónaí go raibh mise ag múineadh stair na hÉireann as Gaeilge i scoil lán-Ghaeilge le téacsleabhair Béarla. Cloisim anois, ní hamháin go bhfuil easpa téacsleabhar Gaeilge ann ach go bhfuil easpa múinteorí le Gaeilge i meánscoileanna ins na Gaeltachtaí. Tá a leithéid do-chreidte i dtír a thugann cosaint bhunreachtúil don teanga náisiúnta. Ní easpa múinteoirí le Gaeilge amháin atá i gceist ach easpa dhaoine proifisiúnta éagsúla eile le Gaeilge ins na Gaeltachtaí. Bheadh i bhfad níos mó eolais ag an Aire faoi na nithe seo nár mar atá agamsa ach cloisim nach bhfuil aon pleanálaí l le Gaeilge ag déileáil leis an bpobal in oifig pleanála Chomhairle Chontae na Gaillimhe, agus í buailte le ceann des na Gaeltachtaí is mó sa tír agus ag plé le muintir na Gaeltachta gach uile lá. Níl rialacha na Cúirte Dúiche ar fáil i nGaeilge. Conas a d'fhéadfaí cás cúirte a chlos i nGaeilge? Tá teipthe ar dhaoine ceadúnas tiomána Gaeilge a fháil de bhrí nach raibh foirmeacha le Gaeilge ar fáil. Ní haon íonadh go bhfuil na Gaeltachtaí ag dul i léig.</P>
    <P>Tá súil agam go bhfuil athrú bunúsach ag teacht leis an mBille seo. In ainneoin na deacrachtaí ar fad cuireann sé íonadh orm an dul chun cinn atá bainte amach ag na Gaelscoileanna. Tá trí chinn i mo dháilcheantair-se i gceartlár Bhaile Átha Cliath, dhá cheann i lár na cathrach i Sráid Mhaolbhríde ar láthair an Roinn Oideachais agus Eolaíochta agus i gCearnóg Parnell agus an tríú cheann i gCabhrach, i gceantair lucht oibre, atá ag feitheamh le fada ar fhoirgneamh buan. Tá na páistí siúd ag obair i seomraí réamhdhéanta ach leanann siad ar aghaidh le sár-mhúinteoirí agus le <Col N="808" />tacaíocht íontach ó phobal Chabhrach. Nach bhfuil sé soiléir go bhfuil sé ri-thábhachtach féachaint chuige go mbeadh foirgneamh buan le gach áis ag Gaelscoil Chabhrach? An bhfuil mórán céille bheith ag plé an Bhille seo sa gcomhthéacs sin agus páistí óga i bpríomhchathair na hÉireann ag iarraidh oideachais Ghaelaigh a fháil agus gan ann ach botháin in áit scoile.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MartinFerrisSF" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>I and my party welcome this Bill. I regret that I cannot make my contribution as Gaeilge. I came through an educational system which did not equip me to speak the language fluently. Like many other Deputies and people of my age, I had a negative experience of the teaching of Irish in our schools. Corporal punishment was the norm and tragically for many young people of that era Ireland became synonymous with punishment. The brutal attempt to force children to learn the language had the opposite effect for many of us and created a resistance to embracing something that we all should love. That affected a generation, most of whom later in life recognised what they had been deprived of by this flawed educational system.</P>
      <P>Many young people had a different experience when they encountered teachers who had a genuine interest in, and love of, the language. That transferred itself to the pupils of that era, who benefited accordingly. For too long the State relied totally on the education system for the revival of Irish. A much more comprehensive approach is now needed. Irish must be given its place in every walk of life. I welcome the Bill and commend the Minister for steering it to this point. He has a strong personal commitment to the Irish language and the Gaeltacht, as well as to the islands off our coast. Perhaps if that commitment were more widely shared by decision-makers, we would have a far stronger Bill. We would certainly have had it much earlier.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Bill is about rights, and it must be said that no nation or group of people ever achieved their rights without struggle. Despite the fact that the 1937 Constitution describes Irish as the first language of the Irish people, Irish-speakers have had to fight for their rights in every decade since its adoption. The State let them down at every turn. Grass-roots campaigners have led the way. Without a campaign of protest and lobbying by Gaeltacht communities and lovers of the Irish language outside the Gaeltacht, we would not have had Raidió na Gaeltachta or TG4. At this juncture, I would like to commend their role both in developing the language, and creating an awareness, love and identification thereof. Over the last few months TG4 in particular &ndash; on occasion I have tuned in to watch Gaelic games from past decades &ndash; has had an influence on people who do not speak the language but have a certain understanding of it. I bring Deputies' <Col N="809" />attention to the fact that all correspondence and dealings with Kerry County Council are in Irish and English. If other county councils are not adopting that policy, I recommend it to them as another way of giving recognition to our language, politically as well as through local government.</P>
    <P>The great gaelscoileanna movement did not come about because of a Government initiative but because communities the length and breadth of Ireland wanted their children educated through Irish. The State did not provide, so they had to provide for themselves. They began mainly in rough and ready accommodation and had to lobby the Department of Education and Science for recognition. Some of those schools are still operating in dreadful conditions, but the State eventually had to recognise and support them, and their now being a thriving part of the education system is a great sign of hope. I would also like to mention the role of the GAA in many areas of the country in promoting the language and making facilities available. In this city, I am very familiar with Naomh Fionnbarra over in Cabra and its role in bringing the Irish language to young people.</P>
    <P>I commend the Irish language organisations which campaigned over many years for legislation such as this. They did a tremendous amount of work, and I know from my colleagues who are working on the details of the Bill for Committee Stage that their input has been important in improving it. There are serious weaknesses in the Bill, which my colleagues, Deputies Aengus Ó Snodaigh and Caoimhghín Ó Caoláin, have identified. We must see the rights of Irish-speakers in the Gaeltacht and outside copper-fastenend to a greater extent than in this Bill. There is real concern that section 32 may obstruct citizens from using the courts to vindicate their rights when a public body does not carry out its duty to them under it. There is also a concern that there may be a delay in the Bill's implementation. I urge the Minister to give serious consideration to all amendments on Committee Stage and take them on board in a spirit of co-operation. Such a spirit exists throughout this House towards this Bill in terms of Members' contributions and a desire to see the Bill passed.</P>
    <P>At the start of the last century there was a great spirit of co-operation among Irish people about the revival of the Irish language. At the end of the 1800s there was a revival of the language, Gaelic games through the GAA, and Irish culture in general. That ran parallel to the struggle for independence. Sadly, that unity was broken in the cause of independence, and the Irish language suffered accordingly. We must revive that sense of common purpose in the cause of our national language. There is goodwill right across Irish society towards the Irish language, including among people such as myself who are not Irish-<Col N="810" />speakers but have a love for it and try to encourage their children to avail of their education through the medium of Irish.</P>
    <P>We must also mention the plight of the Irish language in the Six Counties. Tribute must be paid to the tremendous work of the Irish language community in the North. Despite discrimination and, in many cases, persecution of the language by the British authorities, they have made the language blossom in their communities. In particular, one must recognise the role played by those, in the 1930s, 1940s and 1950s, who effectively took their lives in their hands to promote the language in the Six Counties. People kept it alive and now we see the end result. The Irish language is thriving in many communities throughout the Six Counties, and that is a testimony to all who worked so hard to keep it alive and maintain that sense of identity in their communities. They have also put the language on the political agenda in the peace process. Legislation such as this is also needed in the Six Counties so that we can have the rights of Irish speakers protected on an all-Ireland basis.</P>
    <P>A recent study has shown that several different languages in the world are declining faster than the planet's wildlife, primarily as a result of colonisation and exploitation. Many languages have died out over the past 200 years, and many more are on their way out. That is a terrible tragedy as, when a language dies, a whole culture built up over many centuries also dies. Our forefathers did a tremendous job keeping the Irish language alive in terribly difficult circumstances, and we must not allow it to decline. We must promote it as best we can and ensure that it becomes the first language of our people. The Irish language is our national identity.</P>

      <P>I welcome this very important Bill seeking to restore our native language. I commend the Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs, Deputy Ó Cuív, and our spokesperson, Deputy Fergus O'Dowd, on their commitment to the Irish language. I only have the cúpla focal, although I would like to have much more. However, just as in Deputy Ferris's case, in both the national and primary schools which I attended it was not sexy. Now, however, it is becoming a very sexy language. Everyone is trying to learn it, as one sees in the gaelscoileanna cropping up all over the country. That initiative came not from the Government but from local communities which came together to try to restore the Irish language.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are three gaelscoileanna in County Wexford &ndash; in Wexford town, Enniscorthy and Gorey, the last of which started only within the last two or three years. Without wishing to bring politics into the Bill, one must see the conditions that teaching staff and pupils endure in the gaelscoileanna, especially that in Wexford town, which <Col N="811" />received a promising letter by the previous Government, which was subsequently reneged on. We heard enough about that earlier this week. If we are to restore the Irish language, the gaelscoileanna should be given proper facilities to carry out teaching. We must ensure that the Irish language is restored not simply in the west &ndash; Galway, Clare, Cork, Kerry and Donegal &ndash; but right across the country in the more rural parts of other counties such as Wexford, Wicklow, Carlow or any of those in the south-east. If we do not teach our native language to our youth, it will be totally forgotten in some parts of the country.</P>
    <P>We should commend the media, including TG4, <i>Foinse</i> and RTE, on the manner in which they carry out their role in regard to restoring the Irish language. I would like to be able to read <i>Foinse,</i> a very important newspaper and one of the few which is fully Irish language, from cover to cover. However, I can only try to understand the articles through the photographs. I commend <i>Foinse</i> on its work and it is good to see that one of its reporters is always in the Oireachtas and reporting on Dáil debates. I also commend TG4 and, in the same way that I look at the photographs in <i>Foinse,</i> I read the subtitles on TG4 when looking at &ldquo;Ros na Rún&rdquo; or other programmes. However, it is unfortunate that programmes such as &ldquo;Ros na Rún&rdquo; are made in the west but not in other parts of Ireland. It might encourage the use of Irish if programmes were made in County Wexford or in other counties.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Dowd pointed out to the House that it may have been the economic climate in Ireland which led to the decline of the language. People had to emigrate after the Famine and native speakers had to leave their native land, leaving a small number behind. It is only now that the language is beginning to get back on its feet. I hope it is increasingly promoted.</P>
    <P>For whatever reason, many of our people are not fluent in Irish, as the Minister mentioned. However, they feel, as I do, the same ownership of the language as fluent speakers. I have ownership of the language in the same way as the Minister, Deputy Ó Cuív, and Deputies O'Dowd and Ferris. We all own the language and it is good to hear it spoken. When I hear people speaking Irish in a shop in County Kerry, I do not know what they are saying. They could be talking about me or otherwise.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonOCuiv" hpid="Éamon Ó Cuív Éamon Ó Cuív">
      <NameTxt>Éamon Ó Cuív</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaulKehoeFG" hpid="Mr. Kehoe Mr. Kehoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kehoe</NameTxt>
      <P>Nonetheless, it is great to hear them speak the language. It is important that Irish is well preserved in all parts of Ireland. It is good to note the number of Departments which will be influenced by the Bill. We too easily forget our native language. When I was going to school, Irish was a tough language to learn and it was not <Col N="812" />the done thing at that time. However, I hope the measures in the Bill will be implemented. With regard to the Gaelscoileanna, the Minister should ensure that proper funding is put into teaching because the language must be taught in the schools if it is to be preserved.</P>
      <P>Our native language is often used in the context of the activities of the GAA. It is great to see the continuation of Scór na nÓg, an event I took part in at junior and senior level at a younger age. It is good that the language and our culture is preserved within the GAA, which organises Irish recitations, solo singing and other events in which the Irish language must be used. In a recent Tops of the Town event in Wexford, Irish had to be used as part of a scene for over five minutes. That encourages the use of the language, especially among the young, which is important so that the language is not forgotten. Irish is mainly spoken in the west, in counties Cork, Kerry, Galway and Donegal. We must try to persuade the people to restore it to other parts of the country.</P>
      <P>It is good to note the Minister's commitment to the Bill and I am delighted that all parties support it. I am sure that Deputies O'Dowd, Ferris and others will be making amendments to the Bill, and I hope the Minister gives them due consideration to get the best possible use from the Bill. There are amendments which I will be discussing with Deputy O'Dowd. I ask the Minister to support the amendments and to ensure that the Bill is brought into force as soon as possible and not left on a shelf, though I accept that there is a three-year timescale for implementation of the Bill's provisions.</P>
      <P>I know of the Minister's commitment to the language and that he is a fluent Irish speaker. It is the everyday language he uses in his constituency. That commitment will ensure that the Bill is implemented, and in the right way. My party may be on the other side of the House in less than three years and it may be our job to implement the Bill.</P>

      <P>I welcome the debate on the Official Languages Bill 2002. This debate is about our language and culture, and about equality, respect and citizens' rights. I fully support the Irish language movement in its heroic efforts to save and develop our language. I commend and salute the efforts of the movement, its magnificent defence of our language and its deep respect and understanding of other languages and cultures in Ireland and abroad. The vision of the Irish language movement is one of openness, respect and diversity, and is one of the Ireland of the future and the Ireland to which I want to belong.</P>
      <P>However, this progressive view of Ireland does not always get fair representation in our national media. The Irish language movement has to put up with the labelling brigade in Irish society, which seems hostile to the Irish language. These people should be dealt with head-on. They are in education, the media and the cultural and economic sectors of society and they appear to have an attitude to our language which smacks of racism and lack of respect for equality.</P>
      <P>I pay tribute also to TG4 for its excellent work on this front, although I admit that most of my viewing involves the coverage of GAA matches, which is excellent. The work of TG4 is objective, professional, cultural and, most importantly, balanced and fair. Seo cothrom na féinne do gach duine. We could do with some of that cothrom na féinne from the mainstream media, but sin scéal eile agus díospóireacht eile.</P>
      <P>I also thank and pay tribute to the Gaelscoileanna and the magnificent work they do. However, I must sound a word of caution. They must not let people box them in or let them away with the elitist term that crops up every now and again in the national media. In other words, they should broaden their base and ensure that pupils from all sections of society are welcome in their schools. That is an essential part of any educational strategy. The vast majority of them do that but it is something of which we have to be conscious.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I pay tribute to schools like Scoil Cholmchille and Scoil Neasáin, which are located in my constituency. I have always supported those schools both here in the Dáil and on Dublin City Council. <Col N="814" />They are doing an excellent job with the pupils, and I thank the parents and teachers for their magnificent work. Go raibh míle maith agaibh go léir.</P>
    <P>Ag an am céanna, tá daoine eile cosúil le Liam Ó Cuinneagáin in Oideas Gael i nGleann Cholmchille i dTír Chonaill ag déanamh mórán oibre le daoine ó Éirinn agus ó thíortha eile. Tá lucht an oidis ag múineadh na Gaeilge agus bíonn a lán ceol agus craic ann freisin. Tá ar an Rialtas éisteacht leis na daoine sin &ndash; tá a lán nósanna acu agus sin an tslí ar aghaidh.</P>
    <P>Liam Ó Cuinneagáin introduced radical new ideas on the teaching of Irish to children in disadvantaged schools over 50 years ago. I had the privilege and honour of working with Liam on this issue and saw the fresh, radical approach he brought to the poorest schools in society. According to the Combat Poverty Agency report, some of those schools were among the worst 33 in the country in terms of economic disadvantage, yet they came up with radical ideas which were based on activities. The approach has to be activity based and the oral language must come first.</P>
    <P>These types of strategies must be introduced nationally and the pressure has to be taken off teachers in terms of text books and grammar. We must concentrate on the oral language and have children speaking Irish before we even think about introducing books. There are examples of that good practice in many of our schools and these should be used to assist all our pupils.</P>
    <P>There is massive support for the language but we need to harness that more effectively and efficiently. We should also use the new inter-culturalism that exists today as a way of learning about languages and language teaching. Many teachers talk about the way non-national pupils adopt to learning a language. They appear to have no difficulty in learning Irish, nor do they carry baggage in that regard, unlike our own children.</P>
    <P>It was said years ago that if someone was learning two languages it would damage their study of mathematics or English reading. That is a myth and our non-national pupils have proved that. They have come here without English and learned the language, and they have also got very involved in Irish language classes. I have met children who have developed very high standards of Irish. Learning languages is good for pupils and learning one's own Irish language is good for the country. There is need for further research on this issue as there is great potential for developing new ideas and programmes.</P>
    <P>I pay tribute to the many Irish language teachers who have worked hard in this area. They have also been to the forefront in terms of the whole inter-culturalism debate, anti-racist policies and, more importantly, the implementation of those policies. They have shown leadership and <Col N="815" />vision and they have made their mark on society. I commend them.</P>
    <P>Many teachers in disadvantaged schools have done great work in developing a more inclusive community and more inclusive schools. Some of the poorest schools in the State have been to the forefront in developing Irish language programmes suitable for their pupils while, at the same time, taking radical and creative steps to assist their non-national students. This is the Ireland we should all be working towards building for the future.</P>
    <P>Section 9 provides that public bodies have a duty to ensure that persons can communicate with and receive services from them in either of the official languages, subject to a scheme under section 15. This is a constant thorn in the side of many Irish language speakers and activists. I urge the Minister to recognise that and ensure that respect and equality are always at the top of the agenda. There are many talented Irish language speakers who must be recruited into our public services. Irish language speakers have rights and those rights must always be respected. We have to end immediately the practice of spending a few hours or days finding a civil servant with Irish to resolve a problem for a constituent or a taxpayer. We have to deal with these issues head-on. Putting them on the long finger is not an option.</P>
    <P>Section 10 states that public bodies have a duty to ensure that the official languages are used on signage, stationery and advertisements. This is an important section as it sends out a strong message that is based on respect for our language and culture while ensuring fairness and equality. This section of the legislation should be implemented in a caring and professional way.</P>
    <P>I strongly welcome section 21 which provides for the establishment of the office of official languages commissioner and the fact that he or she will be independent. We have great respect for independence in this House. It is important that the commissioner is independent, objective and respectful of citizens' rights. The commissioner can also be a thorn in the side of the political, social, cultural and economic establishment. This appointment is healthy for the Irish language but also for democracy. Section 31 provides that the commissioner will prepare an annual report on his or her activities which will be laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas. That will give the office more teeth and credibility, and is also in the public interest. It is all about accountability.</P>
    <P>Under section 32 the powers of the Ombudsman remain unaffected by the provisions of the Act. I welcome that section. Reference was made earlier to teaching methods and some valid criticisms were made by Deputy Ferris and others in that regard. We have made mistakes in the past in terms of teaching but we now have young, radical, creative teachers with great experience who are <Col N="816" />going into our primary schools with a love of their language. We should listen to their ideas and strategies. Again, the emphasis has to be on the oral language and enjoying learning the language at an early stage.</P>
    <P>Our language must be valued as an important asset of Irish life but we appear to be moving away from it. With the advent of the Celtic tiger and rampant consumerism, we have forgotten about this valuable jewel. I am talking particularly about the cultural side. When we consider that people travel from America and Japan to Glencolumbcille to learn the Irish language and get involved in cultural events, we can see the massive potential in that. People from different traditions and religions meet there and in the tradition of Tone and Connolly, get involved in learning the Irish language. There is a message in that for us in terms of the development of such a valuable resource. From an economic point of view, it makes common sense. Something as valuable as the Irish language should be linked to tourism plans. All tourism and development plans should include a section on the Irish language, which has the potential to attract thousands of tourists. One need only listen to visitors from the United States or Japan relate their positive experiences of meeting Irish speakers in Connemara, Donegal, west Kerry and other parts of the country to realise this.</P>
    <P>We need to move away from the notion <i>à la</i> the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform of having continental style cafés on our streets and instead look towards our culture and history which we should value and cherish. Tourists come here because we are different. Let us respect this difference and do our best to accommodate diversity. We need to market this angle of our society more aggressively. I call on those involved in the tourism industry to take note of the significant potential this area holds.</P>
    <P>History shows that Connolly-ites have always been strong supporters of the Irish language. As an old-fashioned Connolly-ite, I am glad to be associated with the language and would like, in a small way, to represent that tradition in this debate.</P>
    <P>I have learned a great deal from previous contributions to this debate but we have much more to learn. On a broader level, the Irish language is also a civil liberties issue. Many friends of mine who speak the language do not feel they receive equal respect in our society or many areas of our economic and social life. We must respect the civil liberties of Irish speakers. I question the sincerity of those who claim to be interested in civil liberties but are unwilling to support and advocate the protection of Irish language activists.</P>
    <P>I will support the progressive amendments which will be tabled on the legislation and ask the Minister to listen carefully to contributions and accept the proposals made therein.</P>

      <P>De réir Theidil Fhada an Bhille, tá an Ghaeilge á cur chun cinn chun críoch oifigiúil ins an Stát agus chomh maith leis sin tá cothramaíocht á chur i bhfeidhm maidir leis an dá theanga oifigiúil, an Béarla agus an Ghaeilge. Measaim go n-aontódh formhór na ndaoine leis na bunspriocanna úd. Ba bhreá liom dá mbeadh díospóireacht i bhfad níos leithne agus níos doimhne maidir le húsáid agus stad na Gaeilge ins an Stát faoi mar atá i láthair na huaire, is é sin an Ghaeilge faoi mar atá imeasc ghnáth daoine, i measc lucht labhartha na Gaeilge agus ins na réigiúin Gaeltachta, agus faoi cad atá i ndán don Ghaeilge mar theanga labhartha agus mar theanga chultúrtha agus liteartha.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Creidimidne atá i mbun feachtasaíochta polaitíochta ar bhonn sóisíalach agus Marxach gurb iad na coinníolacha eacnamaíochta, go mórmhór, a mhúnlaíonn bunsmaointe nó coinsias na ndao<Col N="818" />ine agus a fhágann rian láidir ar an sochaí. Is de bharr na coinníolacha eacnamaíochta agus polaitíochta a bhí i réimeas i stair na tíre seo go bhfuil an Béarla mar theanga an tromlaigh ins an Stát agus ar oileán na hÉireann go ginearálta. Tháinig na coinníolacha úd i réimeas de bharr an impiriúlachais Bhreatanaigh agus de bharr an ról a d'imir an t-impiriúlachas i stair na tíre seo. Is cinnte gur deineadh géar leanúint ar chultúr agus ar theanga na nGael ach is brú eacnamaíochta is mó a thug an Béarla mar theanga an tromlaigh ins an tír seo. Gan dabht, bhí tionchar mór ag an imirce ar an scéal chomh maith, i measc lucht labhartha na Gaeilge. Is cuimhin liom é seo ó mo m'áit dhúchais féin nuair a bhí mé i mo leanbh. D'fhás an meon nárbh aon mhaith an Ghaeilge dos na daoine óga a mbeadh orthu imeacht ós na Gaeltachtaí ar fud na hÉireann go háiteacha nach raibh an Ghaeilge mar an teanga labhartha nó go mbeadh orthu imeacht as an tír ar fad go dtí Sasana, na Stáit Aontaithe, Ceanada, an Astráil, an Nua Shéalainn nó mar sin. Ar ndóigh, bhí bonn leis an smaoineamh úd. I bhfad ó shin nuair a chuaigh ár ndaoine thar lear agus gan Gaeilge acu bhí sé an-dheacair dóibh. Ach, tá sé tragóideach go ndeachaigh an meon sin in i bhfeidhm ar dhaoine ins an tslí inar tharla, gur ligeadh an Ghaeilge féin le sruth agus an Béarla amháin a cuireadh ina háit.</P>
    <P>An freagra atá ar an ndeacracht sin ná an dátheangachas a chothú. Is é sin go mbeadh úinéireacht ar an teanga i measc na ndaoine agus, leis sin, ar an saibhreas a thiocfadh le teanga na Gaeilge ó thaobh cúrsaí litríochta, filíochta, amhránaíochta agus a leithéid de. Tá sé tragóideach chomh maith go n-imíonn tuismitheoirí óga as an nGaeltacht le pósadh nó chun obair a fháil agus nach labhrann siad an teanga lena gcuid leanaí. Is cailliúint mhór dos na leanaí í sin, ní hamháin ó thaobh an chultúir agus a leithéid de, ach más rud é go dtéann leanbh ar scoil agus é nó í dátheangach beidh buntáiste i bhfad níos láidre ag an leanbh úd ag foghlaim teangacha eile an domhain. Bíonn solúbthacht áirithe in aigne an linbh atá dátheangach ón gcliabhán. Ba cheart go ndéanfaí beart éigin dearfach faoi sin chun obair spreagtha a thabhairt do dhaoine ó bhunús Gaeltachta agus dóibh atá lonnaithe taobh amuigh den Ghaeltacht ach tá sé ar intinn acu go spreagfaidís an dátheangachas ó thús.</P>
    <P>Ní aontódh mo chairde sna heagraíochta Gaelainne liom ach ní chreidim go mbeidh an Ghaelainn arís mar phríomhtheanga labhartha tromlaigh na tíre seo de bharr na coinníollacha eacnamaíochta, cultútha, cumarsáide agus domhanda atá ag brú isteach orainn i láthair na huaire agus atá ag múnladh saoil agus meoin na tíre go mór. I measc mionlach tábhachtach, beidh an Ghaelainn i gcónaí mar theanga tábhachtach dóibh agus beidh an cultúr a bhaineann léi an-thábhachtach dóibh ó thaobh cúrsaí litríochta, fil<Col N="819" />íochta agus amhránaíochta agus an cultúr go ginearálta de.</P>
    <P>I bhfad níos leithne ná an grúpa úd go bhfuil an Ghaelainn ar thoil acu, bheadh éileamh leathan i gcónaí ag daoine ar thuiscint ar an dteanga, don eolas bunúsach a bheith acu ar an dteanga. Ní hé go dteastódh uathu, nó b'fhéidir nach bhféadfaidís, bheith líofa amach is amach i labhairt na Gaelainne ach go mbeadh tuiscint bunúsach acu. Tóg gné dár saol chomh simplí le logainmneacha na tíre, tá sé cinnte go dtugann tuiscint ar an Ghaelainn eolas i bhfad níos daingne ar phréamacha na tíre agus an sochaí. Dá bharr sin amháin, is fiú do dhream an-leathan dár ndaoine go mbeadh ar a laghad buneolas acu ar an dteanga.</P>
    <P>Caithfimid cuimhniú go bhfuil daoine sa tír seo nach bhfuil an Ghaelainn acu agus nach bhfuil suim acu an Ghaelainn a bheith acu. Ar an oileán tá 1 milliún a tháinig ó phréamacha difriúla ar fad ón bpréamh Ceilteach &ndash; leis na céadta blianta tháinig siad ó Alban nó ó Shasana agus ní raibh baint acu leis an Ghaelainn. Ní cheart go mbeadh meon ag lucht labhartha na Gaelainne ag caitheamh anuas ar an gcuid sin dár ndaoine mar is Éireannaigh iad, tá an cultúr atá acu siúd chomh bunúsach is atá an Ghaelainn do dhaoine eile. Sin an fáth a chaithfidh an dá theanga ar an oileán seo bheith ar chomhchéim i gcónaí agus go mbeadh an meas ag gach dream ar an dream eile cé acu teanga is túisce a labhrann siad, nó más rud é nach bhfuil aon tuiscint ag dream áirithe ar an dteanga. Tá dhá theanga náisiúnta sa tír seo &ndash; an Béarla agus an Ghaelainn &ndash; agus is le meas ar an chultúr a bhaineann leo, agus le meas ar na daoine a labhrann pé acu teanga a féidir linn dul chun cinn ar bhonn mhaith.</P>
    <P>Ó thaobh an Bhille féin, tá mé buíoch de na daoine agus na heagraíochtaí a bhí i dteagmháil liom féin agus le Teachtaí Dála eile. Tá an-díospóireacht le déanamh fós ar chuid de na haltanna sa Bhille. Má thógaimid alt 6, cearta teanga san Oireachtas féin, ba cheart go dtabharfaí leasú chun cinn chun an t-alt sin a dhéanamh níos leithne agus níos ginearálta ná mar atá sé i láthair na huaire mar tá sé ro-chúng. Ba cheart go mbeidh sé de cheart ag duine ar bith a mbeidh baint aige nó aici le cúrsaí Oireachtais úsáid a bhaint as an Ghaelainn. Ba cheart an t-alt sin a leathnú.</P>
    <P>Ó thaobh tuarisc na Dála ar RTE, ní fheadar an bhfuil mé cruinn air seo mar ní fheicim &ldquo;Oireachtas Report&rdquo; gach oíche, ach níor chuala mé riamh díospóireacht, nó cuid de, istigh anseo as Gaelainn.</P>

      <P>Caithfear tabhairt faoi sin. Bhí deifir chomh mór sin orm ar maidin nach raibh am agam féachaint an bhfuil an clár ar siúl anocht toisc go bhfuil an Dáil ina shuí Dé hAoine. Ba cheart go gcuirfidís tuairisc amach nuair a bheadh daoine ann a labhair as Béarla agus as Gaelainn. Tá súil agam nach gcuirfidh siad amach na Teachtaí a labhair as Béarla amháin agus dream a thabhairt do lucht labhartha na Gaelainne. Ba cheart go ndéanfaí sé mar ghnáthrud go mbeadh fotheidil i mBéarla ar an scáthlán nuair atá daoine ag labhairt as Gaelainn san Oireachtas. Tá sin thar a bheith fusa a dhéanamh, tá TG4 ar fheabhas le fotheidil, agus caithfidh RTE an rud céanna a dhéanamh agus molaim dó sin a dhéanamh ag tosnú le clár na hoíche anocht.</P>
      <P>Baineann an Bille go mór le Rannóga agus comhlachtaí Stáit agus an prionsabal gur cheart go bhféadfadh aon saoránach a ghnó nó a gnó a dhéanamh as Gaelainn más mithid leis nó léi agus gan stró ar bith a bheith ag baint leis sin. Aontaím amach is amach leis an bprionsabal úd.</P>
      <P>Caithfimid smaoineamh níos mó ar na céimeanna atá leagtha amach ins an mBille chun dréachtscéimeanna a bheth glactha i rannóga Stáit nó i gcomhluchtaí poiblí. Tá na céimeanna an-chasta i mórán slite agus b'fhéidir go bhféadfaí an obair sin a dhéanamh níos tapúla ná mar atá sé leagtha síos i láthair na huaire. Nuair a thiocfaidh an Bille ar ais ar Chéim an Choiste tá súil agam go ndéanfar soiléiriú ar an scéal úd. Tá jab mór oibre le déanamh leis na Rannóga agus na comhluchtaí poiblí.</P>
      <P>Beidh an Bille an-thábhacht ins an nGaeltacht féin. Tá brú uafásach ar na Gaeltachtaí agus ar lucht labhartha na teanga iontu. Tá an-dheacrachtaí ag tuismitheoirí ins an nGaeltacht gur mhaith leo go mbeadh an Ghaeilge á labhairt ag a cuid leanaí, de bharr an bhrú atá ag teacht ó na meáin cumarsáide agus a leithéid. I ndáiríre, níl leigheas air sin ach iarracht a dhéanamh na meáin cumarsáide Gaeilge a chothú.</P>
      <P>Tá cupla leasú gur cheart a cur chun cinn maidir le húsáid na Gaeilge ins an nGaeltacht. Tá sé do-chreidte go bhféadfadh breithimh a bheith ag suí i nGaeltacht nó taobh leis agus gan an Ghaeilge acu. Is cinnte gur féidir le duine dul isteach agus aistriúchán a fháil ach níl sé sin maith go leor. Aon chúirt atá ag suí ins an nGaeltacht ba cheart go mbeadh an Ghaeilge ag an mbreitheamh, ag na hoifigigh, ag na cláraitheoirí agus a leithéid. Ba cheart go mbeadh sé uathoibritheach go bhféadfadh duine dul isteach agus gnó a dhéanamh trí Ghaeilge nó trí Bhéarla. Ní aontaím leis an smaoineamh a chuir duine éigin ar aghaidh nár cheart go mbeadh Béarla ar bith ins na cúirteanna ins an nGaeltacht. Ach is cinnte gur cheart go mbeadh an Ghaeilge go líofa acu siúd atá ag déanamh eagraíochta ar na cúirteanna ann.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>Ba mhaith liom cúpla focal a rá. I could probably only add the <i>Ár nAthair</i> after that. I am delighted to see this Bill before the House. My own Irish is weak but I have a great love of the language and all my children were educated through Irish. One of the things I would like to do when I have the time after I leave this House is to spend more time learning the language. I love the sound and antiquity of the language. The greetings used by people on the street in the past, Dia dhuit and Dia is Muire dhuit, remind us of some of the things we are quick to jettison and bring us back to the spiritual sense of the language rather than the materialism of everyday life.</P>
      <P>I was struck by the story I heard about the Pope when he visited Drogheda. He started the mass with the words &ldquo;In ainm an Athar agus an Mhic agus an Spioraid Naoimh&rdquo;. One fellow at the back of the crowd of about one million turned to the fellow beside him and said &ldquo;Begob Mick, he's going to say the whole thing in Polish&rdquo;. It is good that we can make a joke like that. There was a time when we were too sensitive about the language. Now we have become more confident about it. I hope this continues.</P>
      <P>In my experience of working in the European Union &ndash; I was European Affairs Minister and am now chairman of the Oireachtas committee on European Affairs &ndash; I have observed people speaking their own language and others. That gives me the impetus to see the importance of protecting our language.</P>
      <P>I welcome this Bill. I hope funding is available for it and that it will be fully implemented. One thing I find fault with, and I do not direct this at the Minister of the day or anybody else, is that for many years we have not got any extra all-Irish secondary schools in Dublin. This goes back to when I was chairman of the Committee of Public Accounts from 1987 to 1993. Every time the Secretary of the Department of Education or the Secretary of the Department of the Gaeltacht appeared at the committee I would ask them when we would have more all-Irish secondary schools in Dublin.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If we are serious about saving the language it is in Dublin that it will be saved. I connect that deliberately to what I have to say about the European Union. Parents travelling throughout Europe see other citizens of the EU speaking their own languages. They return here encouraged to keep the Irish language for their children. The explosion of Gaelscoileanna in Dublin shows that parents are voting with their feet. They do want their children educated through Irish but what happens at the end of primary school is what happened to my own children. The choice is to go to Coláiste Íosagáin or Coláiste Eoin on Stillorgan road or perhaps out to Tallaght. There are not enough all-Irish secondary schools avail<Col N="822" />able. I used to ask about this year in and year out but always got the same poor response.</P>
    <P>There was a college available in my own constituency on the canal between Crumlin and Harold's Cross bridge, Coláiste Caoimhghín. It was ideally located on a triangle half-way between Stillorgan and Tallaght where there are already Irish secondary schools. I campaigned hard to get that college acquired as a premises for an all-Irish secondary school but had no luck.</P>
    <P>If we are serious about wanting to use the language in courts, parliament and public offices then let us be serious about creating the opportunity for people to learn the language. Pupils finishing at the primary level Gaelscoileanna should not have to leave it behind them there. The opportunity will best be provided by acquiring premises in Dublin for all-Irish secondary schools. A lot of effort goes into the Gaeltacht and I support that but if the Minister really wants to champion the Irish language he should do so here in Dublin.</P>
    <P>There is a ready-made audience here. People no longer have the hang-ups they had years ago about the language when they felt they had to leave it behind as soon as they left school. People now want the language. A lot of people like me regret they do not have the command of Irish they would like. They want that for their children. The Minister should not just bring in an official languages Bill that puts legislation on the statute books and requires public servants to have Irish. He must give the public the opportunity to use Irish also by making available to them the opportunity to learn Irish.</P>
    <P>There are people in the House like myself who would be prepared to do more of our work through the first language particularly as chairman of a committee. Will the Minister consider providing an intensive language course for Members, not an-hour-a-week course but one where people would go off for a few weeks, to equip them to conduct the business of the House and committees, in some part at least, through Irish. If this course was aimed at the technical language used in committees and the Houses it would be all the better. I would certainly be interested in such a course which would be useful and a good thing to do.</P>
    <P>I have a few comments to make on Raidio na Gaeltachta and TG4. I like to listen to Raidio na Gaeltachta in the car. I find the music relaxing and can follow some of the language. I pay particular tribute to TG4, not just for its Irish language programmes but for its imagination. It forced onto the agenda the opportunity to record and transmit the work of committees in this House. The station has made a great effort in that direction and should be encouraged.</P>
    <P>I particularly like to see TG4's documentaries and am obliged to it for a video of a recent one on the Second World War made in the first language. I watched it and was very impressed. I rang <Col N="823" />TG4 and they very kindly supplied me with a copy of it. The talk over in the first language is really excellent, and that sort of thing should be encouraged. A lot of people would be very happy to see more of those programmes and TG4 should be encouraged. It has shown imagination. When one rings TG4 with one's cúpla focal, they will try to converse in Irish and English. There is no hang up about that, which is a very good and welcome thing. I pay tribute to TG4 and express my thanks to the station.</P>
    <P>There is one other point I wish to make in keeping with the spirit of this language. I notice in parts of Dublin in particular &ndash; and I think this may also be a problem in other places &ndash; that a lot of street names are going up in the English language only. That should not be accepted and local authorities should be reminded of their duty to put up signs in both languages. I have no wish to assimilate anybody. The important thing is integration and respecting different traditions. If people want to put up a sign in just one language &ndash; English or whatever &ndash; that is a matter for themselves and I respect their right to do so, but this is meant to be a bilingual community. Irish is the first official language and we should remind local authorities, county managers, chairmen of authorities and mayors that it is expected that street names and road signs going up in new estates go up in both languages.</P>
    <P>It can be very confusing where there are signs up in two languages to have Bluebell Road or whatever written in English in one corner and then a different Irish translation somewhere else on the same road. That should not be accepted either. Somebody should put a bit of care into this. One of my daughters worked a bit on this in a local authority but I am not making the point on her behalf or anybody else's. I am making it on my own behalf. I really do think that these little details are important.</P>
    <P>I am glad of the opportunity to say a few words on this Bill. It is a good day's work but let us not just now put this on the Statute Book and leave it there. Let us look at how we might actually expand opportunities for the public to gain a command of the language and use it. I have never felt such a readiness amongst the public to do this. There really is a will there and the best starting place would be more all-Irish speaking secondary schools for Dublin.</P>

      <P>Tá áthas orm bheith anseo inniu le labhairt ar an Bhille thábhachtach seo. Tá brón orm nach mbeidh mé in ann a chaint as Gaeilge go hiomlán. Tá ranganna Gaeilge ar siúl san Oireachtas anois agus b'fhéidir, i gceann cúpla mí, beidh mé in ann sin a dhéanamh.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Many other speakers have talked about the difficulty of the Irish education experience and the fact that after being taught to many people for 14 <Col N="824" />years, Irish is not a living language used by people who participate in the education system. I spent ten years in that system, one mitigating factor being that I was born in the United States. Outside of that, I ran out of excuses. My father was a native Irish speaker as Arainn Mhór i dTír Chonaill and I have many direct relations still living on the island. The only thing I can say in my defence in this context is that Gaeilge Tír Chonaill is probably the least comprehensible form of Irish in existence.</P>
    <P>My mother, born in Cork, was educated entirely as Gaeilge. Given that family background and the educational background, the fact that I am unable to converse fully in Irish is not only a personal loss but says something about how the language has been treasured in reality.</P>
    <P>In bringing this Bill forward the Minister is making a sincere attempt to correct a lot of those inadequacies, and in that he should be supported. It is important that a clear message comes from this House in its practices as to how the language can be better cherished. Last Tuesday I hosted a visit from Coláiste Daibhíd in my constituency. I had the privilege of being on the board of management of the college for a number of years. While there are materials available about the workings of both Houses of the Oireachtas as Gaeilge, it strikes me that a lot more can be done. There are no interpretation facilities for full running commentaries in the visitors' gallery. The video in the new visitors' centre may exist but the option was not given of an Irish version. Even in this House, simultaneous translation should be an active, all-day running procedure, not just a translation of people speaking as Gaeilge for people who do not understand the language.</P>
    <P>It is important that we get those things right. I have heard some of the contributions here which expressed wariness at the expense that would involve and noting that it would take money from other funding headings that people might consider more important. Obviously there are competing demands in our society at the moment but we should be wary of putting a price on protecting, enhancing and cherishing our cultural identity. I know the Minister is certainly thinking along those lines.</P>
    <P>Part of the reason the Irish language is not spoken more readily, despite the fact that most people have quite an extensive foclóir, is because there is almost an implicit intimidation by many who can speak Irish fluently of those who cannot. This is not intended but the impression goes out that if one cannot speak Irish properly one should not speak it at all. That is the type of message that should be challenged if we want to encourage the use of Irish in any way in our society. There is goodwill out there and it can be tapped quite readily with the right imaginative response.</P>
    <P>The other thing that needs to be done is the exercise of decoupling. Having responsibility for <Col N="825" />rural affairs, I know the Minister would be aware of how sensitive that subject is at the moment. In the context of Irish culture, however, the impression has gone out that Irish culture is a package and that it is about the language, the music and the dancing. However, the reality does not reflect that. These cultural elements can look after themselves. Where TG4 has been particularly successful is in putting Irish into a modern context that is vibrant and alive and reflects modern Irish society, which is not always about the céilithe at the crossroads or the playing of certain types of sports.</P>
    <P>In my father's home of Aran Mór, the sport of choice is not Gaelic games but soccer. The music of choice is not the seisiún but country and western. If we can put forward the idea that Irish is a vibrant language that exists in different contexts then we will be well on the way towards promoting its use as an active language.</P>
    <P>The reverse is also true. Last night I was at a social occasion meeting a friend in a local pub. He was part of a set dancing group and they were obviously cherishing the culture of Irish dancing but they did not associate it with the need to promote the Irish language. The same is true of Irish music.</P>
    <P>The other aspect we need to look at in terms of promoting the use of the Irish language through Bills such as this is where multilingual societies have used legislation effectively to bring about the maximum use and protection of the languages that were deemed to be minority in usage, if not, as in our case, constitutionally. The best examples are Canada and Belgium. I know the Minister has gone through a long consultation process but there are still elements in the Bill that can be tweaked through amendments and I hope the Minister will be open to accepting such amendments. In general terms, the Minister should be congratulated on getting a Bill to this point in the legislative process. I am sure he will find the Opposition co-operative in terms of the intent and end effect of the Bill. I hope that on Committee Stage the Minister will be similarly open to considering the types of amendments Members suggested and which many organisations outside this House are promoting and proposing. In that respect, I am aware the Minister has been open to accepting some such changes.</P>
    <P>I wish to refer to the effect this House can have on promoting the language and ensuring it is used to a greater extent. We need to consider the way in which we structure the business of the House to ensure that debates, including Committee Stage debates, have an element timewise or in other respects to provide for the use of the Irish language. That is a point Deputy Higgins made in his contribution.</P>
    <P>I congratulate the work of the Government Chief Whip, which is not something I tend to do often, in putting together the programme of Irish <Col N="826" />classes for Members. I believe that 81 Members have participated in the system of classes available in recent weeks. The standards of those participating range from Members who have no Irish, to those who need to refresh their Irish, to those who want to bring their Irish, which is a fairly good standard, up to the highest standard. This is the type of support Members need to make sure that this House actively reflects what is a constitutional responsibility for us, as it should be for the members of the Civil Service whom I mentioned, in reflecting the constitutional status of Gaelige. Any role my party can play in that regard is one we would be happy to play.</P>

Tá brú ag teacht ar an gcoláiste seo anois agus é scaipthe. Tá an meánscoil lonnaithe i gCearnóg Parnell agus an bunscoil ar Bhóthar na hUaimhe. Níl sé sin go maith mar caithfear leanúnachas a bheith ann idir bhunscoil agus meánscoil. Níl an fhadhbh seo faoi chúram an Aire ach tá súil agam go ndabharfaidh an t-Aire Oideachais agus Eolaíochta deis don scoil seo teacht le chéile arís ar champas amháin.</P>
      <P>Sin an áit a fuair mé mo chuid Gaeilge cé go bhfuil sí beagáinín gioblach anois. Éistim le Raidió na Gaeltachta agus breathnaím ar TG4 agus tá siadsan ag cur snas arís ar mo chuid Gaeilge. Tá an-jab á dhéanamh ag an dá chomhlucht sin chun an Ghaeilge a cothú ins an tír. Tá cláracha den scoth á gcur amach ag TG4, rud nach bhfuil le fáil ar RTE. Tá mé ag smaoineamh ar Hector Ó hEoghagáin agus é ag dul timpeall an domhain agus ar an súil ghéar a chuireann sé ar thíortha eile. Fuair mé a lán pléisiúir as na cláracha sin.</P>
      <P>Bhí an Teachta Gay Mitchell ag caint mar gheall ar an easpa meánscoileanna sa chathair seo. Tá an chuid is mó de dhaonra na tíre lonnaithe ar chósta oirthear na hÉireann. Tá naíonraí agus bunscoileanna Gaeilge le fáil ach is beag meánscoil atá sa chathair. Nuair a théitear go dtí an tríú leibhéal ní múintear aon chúrsa trí Ghaeilge taobh amuigh de chúrsaí Gaeilge féin, ach amháin gur féidir eacnamaíocht a dhéanamh trí Ghaeilge i DCU. Má tá oideachas tríú leibhéil trí Ghaeilge ag teastáil ó mac léinn caithfidh sé dul siar go Gaillimh. Níl mé ag caitheamh anuas ar Ghaillimh. Is cathair ársa álainn í.

      <Col N="827" />Nuair a bhíos óg bhí mé in ann Gaeilge a labhairt go fliúirseach ach d'imigh sí de réir ama. Dá bhrí sin, caithfidh mé leanúint ar aghaidh i mBéarla.</P>
    <P>This Bill presents us with an opportunity to examine the degree to which we can use Irish, the first national language, in the course of our business in the House, which is something we should do. We should examine the progress of the development, retention and evolution of the language in the intervening years since the foundation of the State. We should examine the issues that have improved the prospects of the language and those which have not, a point to which several Members referred.</P>
    <P>One of the greatest obstacle to the development of the use of Irish and other languages is a certain amount of exclusivity or a degree of snobbery, to the effect, that if one was not in a position to be as flúirseach as was deemed to be necessary, one was considered to be an inferior human being and not a sufficiently good enough Irish person. I reject that. That attitude has been totally counterproductive. It has set a ringfence that is unnecessary, debilitating and is not in the interests of the pursuit of the generation of the language in the future.</P>
    <P>The question as to whether one is was forced or encouraged to do something is a critical issue in this context. It is preferable if we are encouraged, at our own discretion as opposed to feeling we are being coerced, to use the language in the course of going into a shop or in conducting business in this House. We should learn from our past masters the cognisance that has been gained in this area, if we want to learn from that. Members should learn from the attitude to the use of language from their visits to other countries, whether on holiday or for other purposes, to establish whether we find it preferable to be encouraged to converse in the language of the country concerned or to use our own language. Some countries give a distinct impression that one is welcome to converse in either language, but some give a distinct impression that one is not welcome to converse in any language other than the language of the country concerned. It is as simple as that in terms of how we should promote the use of our first language in this country.</P>
    <P>I would like to congratulate a number of people on the work they have done. TnaG has done a tremendous amount of work in promoting the language, removing that exclusivity and introducing a series of programmes, which the viewer can watch from a totally different interest point of view and at the same time achieve an improvement in his or her knowledge of and ability to use the Irish language. People such as Micheál Ó Muircheartaigh have done great work in this regard over the years and they have used bilingualism in their work to very good effect.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="828" />There are occasions where the use of the first official language has been more appropriate in certain circumstances in attempting to describe a particular situation. For instance, one could describe the Government's efforts to date in terms of the economy but I will not go into that now. I can think of one or two expressions as Gaeilge that would adequately encompass their present lack of progress in that area but I will be a very good boy and I will not use them.</P>
    <P>It is no harm to listen to what the younger generation has to say about the Irish language. I belong to a somewhat older generation. My most interesting introduction to the Irish language as part of a culture as opposed to something that was forced upon me was <i>Ó Pheann an </i>Phiarsaigh agus Paraic Máire Bán. Bhí sé sin na blianta ó shin. At that stage in my life I was beginning to develop an interest in the folklore and the story that was behind the language. Previous to that, I was merely learning the language as a means of ensuring for many reasons that I was able to manifest some degree of proficiency.</P>
    <P>I wish to mention the role of broadcasters. It may be unfair to mention specific people but Micheál and Donncha Ó Dulaing have used the language very effectively. Other people are encouraged by such broadcasters to revert to bilingualism when they wish. When I was a child the most intimidating aspect of the language was to be near somebody like an t-Ollamh Micheál Mac Schnuslechaun when one immediately recognised that one was in the presence of a greater person than oneself. This is not intended to be a reflection on anybody's name but the very name suggested to me as a youngster that I was in the presence of a great one and that any contribution made by me will be a very minor one. It is important to consider how to encourage the new generation to use the language to their benefit and to the benefit of the language and the culture of the country. We should recognise that we have a duty to deliver to the next generation the language, traditions and culture as best we can and intact if possible. We have a duty to learn from the mistakes of the past and to leave behind the type of exclusivity and snobbery that I experienced as being associated with the language. We must recognise the efforts of those who wish to use the language and assure them that they are as good as everyone else.</P>
    <P>In the past, there was a custom among certain Ministers of answering questions in the House in a language other than the language in which the question was asked. I am glad that has changed because in my view that was the ultimate attempt at snobbery. It is good manners to answer a question in the language in which it is asked, and bilingualism after that is fine. It could be regarded as an attempt to pull a stroke or two &ndash; I know that the Minister opposite would never think of doing anything like that.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="829" />I am concerned about some aspects of the Bill, as I would of any Bill. There are financial implications to this Bill. I am afraid that at present, there would be serious implications for any Bill and its effectiveness or otherwise. I worry about the financial implications in the present climate. The Minister is shaking his head but I am not so sure.</P>
    <P>The Bill proposes the setting up of a separate unit within the Department. I think that is a good idea but I hope it will not be a replication of some of the things that have been done in the health and education services whereby an expert unit of bureaucrats is established in a cocoon within the system so that they can advise. The Minister is indicating that will not be the case and I hope that is so.</P>
    <P>The office of the official languages commissioner will be the specialist office, but there is a commissioner for everything nowadays, apart from EU Commissioners. Recently I heard a debate between a commissioner and the head of a semi-State body in which the commissioner and the body in question did not agree on a solution to the problem. I hope that type of conflict will not develop as a result of the appointment of the commissioner. The ultimate responsibility in any situation such as this is with the Minister and must always rest with the Minister. I hope it does not mean in the future that replies to questions from Members of this House will be referred to the official languages commissioner. I hope that the Minister and his successors &ndash; I am sure Deputy O'Dowd will be in a position to carry out that role in the future&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;will carry on in that same vein. I am tired of repeating in this House that there should be no attempt by Ministers from any side of the political divide to avoid the opportunity of answering a question no matter how difficult it is. That lesson should have been learned in this House over the past ten or 12 years in particular. It is an opportunity for the Minister to protect both his or her staff and office when asked a question on a particular issue which is pertinent to or within the aegis of the Minister's Department.</P>
      <P>There is a growing tendency in this House to push all difficult questions to one side, to avoid answering them at all if possible and to give responsibility for the answer to somebody who is not accountable to the House. We then wonder why things go wrong and why there is a need for tribunals of inquiry. We are moving away from parliamentary accountability towards delegation to authorities that are not accountable to this House and to the people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I know that the Minister sitting opposite agrees with me. I encourage Ministers and Ministers in <Col N="830" />waiting on this side of the House to think very carefully about their responsibilities. I recall sitting on the opposite side of the House when an awkward question was put and the civil servant dealing with it identified it as a time bomb or a hand grenade with the pin pulled. There was panic but I felt there should be no such panic and that we should answer the question as it was, with no backing away from it. I just answered the question. If it is difficult to answer, so be it, but let us answer the question and deal with it. If we start back-pedalling away from such situations it will become a culture here and in all State institutions. They will all take that route. That is the worst possible thing that can happen to a democracy, as slowly but surely one becomes defensive and nobody becomes responsible. Those who are not elected can always say something is not their responsibility even though they have been given that responsibility. The Minister agrees with my views and he should spread that culture to other Departments if he can. I assure him a great need for such a culture has existed for a long time. I will deal with this issue in greater detail at a future stage.</P>
    <P>Deputy Boyle referred to the cailíní ag damhsa ag an gcros-bhóthar agus na buachaillí ag imirt, and that is the grand old folklore of the Irish language &ndash; the Minister's ancestor would not mind my paraphrase. That was glorious in the past but we are in a different era now with different requirements. There are different, competing demands now and that is why the voices of newer Members should be taken into account.</P>
    <P>There are many gaelscoileanna throughout the country and they are doing a tremendous job. They are encouraging the growth of the language and safeguarding it in many communities, urban and rural. However, every gaelscoil in my constituency is in temporary accommodation and the other schools are the same &ndash; almost every one of them has a string of prefabs alongside them. It is very difficult to tell the younger generation that while we feel one thing about what should be done, this is what we are actually doing. That is not the Minister's responsibility but if we are to instil the importance of our language, culture and heritage as well as education itself in the younger generation, we should think seriously about how we spend our money on the facilities that will help those areas to flourish. If we do not do so, that generation is likely to be critical of us and ask what we mean. In those circumstances they would be right to be critical. It is fine to build national stadia and buy Government jets with gold taps. It is great to see and we will be able to wow sheikhs at oil meetings. Is it better to have a bigger jet with bigger tyres, plusher seats, a hotter jacuzzi and a hot tub if possible? That will impress other Prime Ministers.</P>

      <P>Those are all very impressive but people are asking about our priorities regarding the language, health, education and law and order. We have to get our priorities right. It would not be a bad idea to suggest that gaelscoileanna and other schools would be in a reasonable condition in the not too distant future. It is not fair to have children learning in temporary school accommodation for their entire school lives, going through primary and secondary level in the same way. That is neither necessary nor desirable.</P>
      <P>This is not the Minister's problem but the end of the general election seemed to coincide with a downturn in the economy we had not heard about before the election. Whether we like it, the country enjoyed an economic climate for the previous five years which other countries envied. Either we were deluding ourselves in that period or it actually happened &ndash; there is no use in blaming 11 September for what happened after the general election, as 11 September did not cause that election.</P>

      <P>One must use examples to illustrate adequately the likely impact of a Bill and that is what I am doing. I may be straying on to sensitive ground but I am not doing so deliberately. Going back to what I said earlier, the public likes to see us leading and giving graphic illustration of examples when we do. They expect us to give an example and to go with that example. They tend to become cynical when we appear less than serious in our intent. Mar fhocal scor, tá an-áthas orm a bheith in ann cúpla focal a rá ar an mBille.

      <P>Tá áthas orm seans a bheith agam cupla focal a rá ar an mBille tábhachtach seo. Chuaigh mise ar scoil i gColáiste Mhuire, ina rinneamar gach ábhar as Gaeilge, agus Laidin ina measc. Dá mbeadh timpeallacht ann a bhí níos tacúla don nGaeilge agus a mheall daoine chun an Ghaeilge a húsáid bheadh Gaeilge níos liofa agamsa agus ag mórán daoine eile.</P>
      <P>I appreciate the opportunity to speak as I was one of the people who had the good fortune to attend a school where we studied all our subjects through Irish. That included Latin, history, geography, mathematics and everything else. Unfortunately the environment of the time was not one which encouraged students to promote the language or to be enthusiastic or involved in it. It was seen as something of a burden.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="832" />At third level, in University College Galway, I studied science, including physics and chemistry, through Irish. In that sense I am like the Minister, who also studied through Irish.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Upton</NameTxt>
      <P>I must visit the Gaeltacht area the Minister represents and brush up on my Irish, given how líofa he is. The environment of the time was one which discouraged Irish and we saw it as something of a penalty and difficulty. If one was not particularly fluent it was more difficult to comprehend one's subject through Irish, which turned people off to a certain extent. However, that environment has changed and it is important to continue to promote that change of environment and to encourage the use of Irish. Gaelscoileanna are cropping up with great frequency, in particular in Dublin &ndash; there are two in my constituency &ndash; and parents are very anxious for their children to study all their subjects through Irish. The level of encouragement and the commitment is quite different. Irish is now seen very definitely as part of our culture about which we are positive and encouraging rather than making it difficult and awkward for people.</P>
      <P>I welcome the broad thrust of the Bill. Promotion of the Irish language for official purposes is clearly important, for instance in court proceedings. A number of cases occurred where the accused or the defendant was only able to speak through Irish and that generated a number of difficulties. I support the general thrust of the Bill. I would like to see Irish promoted to a greater extent by Members of the Oireachtas and I welcome the opportunities provided recently to enable us to brush up on our Irish.</P>

      <P>Gabhaim buíochas leis na Teachtaí ar fad a labhair ar an mBille seo. Bhí díospóireacht úsáideach agus dearfach againn. Ba mhaith liom go bhfeicfí an Bille mar pháirt de phróiseas níos mó de chéimeanna atá glactha leis an Ghaeilge a choinneáil i lár shaol na hÉireann.</P>
      <P>Aontaím go mór leis an moladh a tugadh anseo do na meáin cumarsáide Gaeilge. Ta TG4, gan bheith i bhfad ar an saol, ag tabhairt na Gaeilge isteach i ngach uile theach in Éirinn. Tá sé tar éis bheith glic agus seiftiúil. An rud ba ghlice a rinne sé ná &ldquo;All Ireland Gold&rdquo; a thaispeáint mar duine ar bith nach raibh aeróg acu an t-am sin, chaill sé mórán atá anois le feiceáil arís. Molaim Raidió na Gaeltachta. Tá sé se ag trealamh ar feadh na blianta agus ní thuigtear an méid daoine taobh amuigh den Ghaeltacht nach bhfuil Gaeilge an-líofa acu, daoine ar nós an Teachta Gay Mitchell, a éisteann leis an stáisiún sin.

      <Col N="833" />Ní fhéadfainn seasamh anseo inniu, áfach, gan a rá go bhfuil díoma an tsaoil orm go bhfuil an dream is mó a fhaigheann airgead an phobail as craoladh poiblí a dhéanamh ar son mhuintir na hÉireann faillíoch agus neamhairdeach nuair a thagann sé chun ceist na Gaeilge. Chuir sé uafás agus alltacht orm aréir ag breathnú ar &ldquo;Oireachtas Report&rdquo; nuair nach raibh tagairt ar bith do rud ar bith a dúradh sa Teach seo ar Bhille a bhí tábhachtach. Pléadh coistí agus bhí Riar na hOibre sa dá Theach ann ach shílfeadh duine nach raibh an Bille seo a phlé sa Dáil, Bille atá lárnach do shaol chuile duine sa tír. Feictear domsa gur faillí sa ghnó phoiblí agus an dualgas poiblí atá ar RTE nár craoladh aon chuid den díospóireacht bríomhar seo.</P>
    <P>Ní chuimhin liom, ó tháinig mé isteach sa Teach, go raibh díospóireacht ar bith faoin nGaeilge gur labhair an oiread sin Teachtaí ann i nGaeilge agus i mBéarla agus gur taispeánadh an oiread sin speise ann. Tá go leor leor pointí an-mhaith déanta. Ba bhreá liom go mbeadh i bhfad níos mó ná ceithre uair a chloig ann chun iad a fhreagairt. Bhí éagsúlacht tuairimí sa Dáil agus is rud iontach sláintiúil sin mar dá mbeimís ar aon tuairim amháin, bheadh sin míshláinitiúil. Chuir mé in aghaidh ariamh an tuairim go gcaithfeadh chuile duine bheith ar aon tuairim faoin nGaeilge, nach bhféadamís díospóireacht iomlán, nadúrtha a bheith againn fúithi mar a bheadh faoi rud ar bith eile.</P>
    <P>One of the things I tried to do when we talked about the Bill initially was to make it an official languages Bill. I wanted to send a clear message that it was not a question of displacing English, which I do not think needs any great protection either in this country or worldwide, but of encouraging the use of Irish as a general medium and of giving it much greater official prominence in public life. That is why it is a Bille na dTeangacha Oifigiúla seachas a Bille na Gaeilge. I was very interested in what was said about non-nationals who have come to live here.</P>
    <P>Féadfaidís leis an neart atá acu sa dátheangachas ceachtanna a mhúineadh chugainn. I bhformhór tíortha an domhain, sé an gnáthrud ná dátheangachas ar a laghad. Bhí mé ar chuairt san Aifric Theasc le gairid, agus i measc na daoine dubha, ní amháin go raibh dhá nó trí nó ceithre theanga acu, cuid acu bhí sé agus seacht gcinn de theangacha acu. Taispeánann sin bua theangaidh go mba bhreá liomsa, le daoine sa Teach seo agus le go leor daoine san Eorap a bheith acu. Is maith an scéal é go bhfuil siad sa tír agus go dtaispeánann siad do dhaoine nach gcaithfear teanga amháin a chailliúnt le teanga eile a bheith le duine.</P>
    <P>Thug mise tacaíocht agus ómós don dream ó Thuaidh nuair a bhí siad ag iarraidh an aisíneacht Ulster Scots a bhunadh mar chuid den Fhoras Teanga.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="834" />Tá go leor cainte déanta le dhá lá anuas ar ghaelscoileanna. Taispeánann an t-éileamh atá ar na gaelscoileanna an speis atá ag go leor de phobal na hÉireann, iad siúd agus Gaeilge acu agus iad siúd nach bhfuil sí acu, sa nGaeilge agus an fonn atá orthu go mbeidh Gaeilge ag a gcuid páistí. Ardaíonn sin ceist eile &ndash; mar duine a chuaigh ar scoil ina raibh an teagasc ar fad trí Bhéarla, agus rinne mé mo chuid ollscolaíochta trí Bhéarla freisin, ach ar éirigh liom Gaeilge mhaith a thabhairt liom &ndash; faoi mhúineadh na Gaeilge sna scoileanna nach gaelscoileanna iad. Creidim go bhfuil caighdeán múineadh na Gaeilge sna bunscoileanna i gcoitinne lagaithe go mór le 30 bliain anuas agus caithfimid breathnú as an nua ar cén bealach a mhúinimid an Ghaeilge sna gnáthscoileanna. Ní rud maith a bheadh ann, fiú dá mbeadh 10% den phobal ag dul i ngaelscoileanna, go ngéillfidh an Ghaeilge i 90% eile mar nach bhfuil an Ghaeilge do mhúineadh i gceart sna scoileanna sin. Cuireann seo iontas orm leis na deiseanna nua, físeáin agus leabhráin agus na rudaí nua ar fad gur amhlaidh a bheadh an scéal.</P>
    <P>Ba bhreá liom, agus bheadh sé sláintiúil, go mbeadh díospóireacht lá éigin sa Teach ar an Ghaeilge agus ar pholasaí Ghaeilge na tíre. Cuirfidh mé an cheist sin leis an bPríomh Aoire. Ba mhaith an rud go socrófaimís amach cén áit is ceart don Ghaeilge a bheith i saol na hÉireann. D'fhogair mé agus mé ag caint ag comóradh 50 bliain de Ghael Linn le déanaí, go bhfuil sé i gceist agam nuair a bheidh an Bille seo foilsithe, leabhrán a fhoilsiú a chuirfidh síos ar stair na Gaeilge, cé as a dtáinig sí, mar tá sin tábhbachtach ó tharla gur againne atá an teanga scríofa is sine san Eorap. Cuirfidh sé síos ar an stádas bunreachtúil atá ag an nGaeilge, an stádas atá aici ó Thuaidh ach go mór mór ag cur síos ar pholasaí an Rialtais i leith na Gaeilge. Bheadh ráiteas simplí, 20 nó 30 leathananch i nGaeilge agus i mBéarla, a dhéanfadh cur síos a bheadh soiléir don saol céard é polasaí an Stáit agus an Rialtais i leith na Gaeilge. Is cuid dínn an Ghaeilge.</P>
    <P>Deputy Gay Mitchell mentioned the curse of the two forms of the Irish language on name plates on the same street &ndash; total carelessness where one sees a síne fada on a consonant and a séimhiú on a vowel and other gobbledegook. This morning I announced the formation of a new coimisiún logainmneacha, which will take office at the beginning of June, and I nominated the members to that new coimisiún. The place names branch of the Department has the official responsibility under law to advise the Minister on official place names and the Minister, myself in this case, effects those by ministerial order.</P>
    <P>It is absolutely disgraceful that local authorities do no consult the commission on the correct forms of names, as they are obliged to do, and that they print the wrong forms on signs. When driving into Galway recently, I was appalled by a brand new sign for a national primary or secondary route. The legend on it reads &ldquo;An Gaillimh&rdquo;. If one were using &ldquo;An&rdquo;, the sign would read, &ldquo;An <Col N="835" />Ghaillimh&rdquo;, but the name of the place is &ldquo;Gaillimh&rdquo;. One would say &ldquo;muintir na Gaillimhe&rdquo; ceart go leor. I then drove on to a roundabout where I saw a sign which read, &ldquo;An Sligeach&rdquo;. Those signs should be taken down forthwith and disposed of. Tá ceann eile i gContae Mhuigheo agus Inis Mhic an Thír ar thaobh amháin den chomhartha agus Inis Mhic an Trír ar an dtaobh eile den chomhartha céanna. Is é an dara ceann atá ceart. Tá Glan Coiribe curtha ar chomhartha eile cé nach bhfuil a leithéid d'áit ann. Is mór an náire an rud atá ar bun, ach tiocfaidh mé chuige sin ar ball.</P>
    <P>Nuair a thosaigh mé ag obair ar an mBille seo bhí cur chuige simplí ann. Bhí orm glacadh leis gurb í an Ghaeilge an chéad teanga oifigiúil. Bhí orm glacadh leis go raibh, go bhfuil, agus go mbeidh, go ceann scatha ar a laghad, srianta leis an méid is féidir a dhéanamh de bharr go bhfuil líon na gcainteoirí líofa Gaeilge a bheadh in ann seirbhís éifeachtach trí mheán na Gaeilge a chur ar fáil teoranta. Bhí orm a shocrú go mbeadh rud ar bith ar chuirfí san mBille seo indéanta go praiticiúil agus go dáiríre.</P>
    <P>Bhí an Bille seo ag imeacht, ar leibhéal amháin, ón sean choincheap go gcaithfidh an Stát a bheith ann mar áisíneacht cur chun cinn na Gaeilge. Tá an Bille ag díriú go mór ar sheirbhís de árd chaighdeán a chur ar fáil don chustaiméir. Tá taithí agam ar an gceist seo. Ba mé an chéad Teachta Dála ariamh i nGaillimh a shocraigh go mbeadh gach uile dhuine san oifig dháilcheantar inniúil ar Ghaeilge a labhairt agus go mbeadh an Ghaeilge mar ghnáth theanga na hoifige. Rud spéisiúil a tharla, ná gur tharraing sé sin na Gaeilgeoirí isteach le gnoithe a dhéanamh liom. Thaispeáin sé sin domsa dá mbeadh an tseirbhís ar ard-chaighdeán, gan dua agus nádúrtha nach gcuirfeadh sé na Béarlóirí ón doras ach go dtarraingeodh sé na Gaeilgeoirí isteach leis an tseirbhís a úsáid agus le Gaeilge a úsáid leis. Sin atá i gceist go mór ó thaobh na Gaeltachta de leis an mBille seo.</P>
    <P>Cuireadh ceist cé mhéad a chosnóidh sé? Cosnóidh sé roinnt airgid le hoifig an choimisinéara a chur ar bun ach ní airgead an-mhór é. Beidh rannóg i mo Roinn ag teastáil leis na pleananna a réiteach. Taobh amuigh de sin ní cheart go mbeadh mórán costais ag baint le feidhmiú an Bhille seo do na Rannaí eile. Má táthar ag iarraidh seo a theisteáil níl le déanamh ach breathnú ar cheist amháin. Cén uair a thug aon Aire Airgeadais airgead breise don Roinn Ealaín Oidhreachta Gaeltachta agus Oileán nó don Roinn Gnóthaí Pobail, Tuaithe agus Gaeltachta nó aon Roinn eile ar nós é atá ag feidhmiú go dhátheangach agus atá ag comhlíonadh go leor de na forálach san mBille seo? Fós, bhíodar in ann bunáite an ruda atá i gceist san mBille seo a dhéanamh.</P>
    <P>An dtugtar airgead breise riaracháin do Údarás na Gaeltachta mar go gcaithfidh sé feidhmiú go dhátheangach gach uile lá? Ní tugtar, mar nuair a fostaíodh na daoine ann deineadh cinnte go rabhdar dátheangach. An gcosnaíonn sé aon air<Col N="836" />gead breise duine dhátheangach a chur i bpost nó duine aonteangach a chur i bpost? Nach polasaí earcaíochta atá i gceist ansin? Mar sin, má oibrítear é seo go stuama ní cheart go mbeadh mórán costas breise ann. Cén chostas breise, agus dílárnú ar bun ag Comhairle Chontae na Gaillimhe, a bheadh ar deichniúr a fhostú agus iad a chur siar go dtí an Cheathrú Rua le seirbhís a thabhairt do mhuintir Chonamara trí mheán na Gaeilge seachas an deichniúr céanna a bheith fostaithe i gcathair na Gaillimhe agus gan ach Béarla acu agus ag tabhairt an tseirbhís céanna trí Bhéarla? Mar sin, ní ceist costais ach ceist pleanáil, earcaíochta, cur chuige agus tola í. Aisteach go leor, ní chosnóidh sé seo mórán.</P>
    <P>Tá an cheart ag an Teachta Durkan agus aontaím go mór leis. Ní cheart do Airí a bheith de shíor ag tabhairt cumhachtaí uathu. Ní shin atá i gceist leis an mBille seo. Má tá casaoid amháin ag cuid des na heagraíochtaí Gaeilge is é go bhfuil an iomaraca cumhachta coinnithe ag an Aire. B'fhearr leo go mbeadh sé curtha sa bhun dlí, áit a mbeadh fadhb le cuid des na moltaí, nó go mbeadh sé tugtha don choimisinéir. Bheadh fadhb leis sin chomh maith. Caithfidh an bun smacht ó thaobh leagan amach na bpleananna de agus céard a bhéas iontu fanacht sa réimse pholaitiúil. Leis an bá atá sa Teach seo inniu agus inné don mBille seo, ní dóigh liom gur contúirt é sin a fhágáil i lámha na bpolaiteoirí.</P>
    <P>Céard é ról an choimisinéara? Nuair atá na pleananna déanta agus gach rud faoi réir, is é a ról déanamh cinnte go ndéanfar de réir toil an Oireachtais. Tá sé mar a bheadh an garda i gcúrsaí dlí. Ní bheadh sé ceart go mbeadh an t-Aire i mbun monaiteoireachta nó mar phóilín ag an mBille seo. Ba cheart go ndéanfar sin go neamhspleách. Is é ról an choimisinéara cearta an chustaiméara agus an tsaoránaigh a chosaint. Le cúnamh Dé anois, nuair a cuirfear na comharthaí seafóideacha seo suas ní bheidh le déanamh ach scríobh ag an gcoimisinéir agus a rá, &ldquo;A choimisinéir a chara, an bhfaca tú an rud atá déanta? Ní thagann sé leis na rialacháin go bhfuil sé seo curtha suas i nGaeilge nach dtagann leis an leagan oifigiúil. An bhféadfá rud éigin a dhéanamh faoi?&rdquo;. Ní bheidh le déanamh aige siúd ach, le cumhacht an choimisinéara, scríobh ag an údarás agus a rá go gcaithfear an rud a chur ina cheart. Nuair a bheidh sé sin déanta cupla uair aige nó aice ní bheidh air nó uirthi é a dhéanamh an dara uair. Má deirtear i bplean go mbeidh seirbhís trí Ghaeilge ar fáil nó má gheallann mór-eagraíocht Stáit nó Roinn Stáit go mbeidh líne eolais ar fáil agus duine le Gaeilge ar fáil ar an líne sin agus muna bhfuil sé ar fáil, is ag an gcoimisinéir a thiocfaidh duine le go ndéanfaidh seisean nó sise cinnte go mbeidh an tseirbhís ar fáil agus go gcuirfear an rud ina cheart.</P>
    <P>Tá ceisteanna árdaithe ag Conradh na Gaeilge agus glacaim leis, nuair a hardaíodh cuid de na ceisteanna seo nach raibh Céim na Tuarascála glactha sa tSeanad. Bhí se i gceist ariamh go mbeadh comhfhreagras i nGaeilge freagraithe i nGaeilge. Bhí ceist ann, ar cheist theiciniúil í, go <Col N="837" />rabhmar ag scrúdú arb fhearr é sin a dhéanamh sna rialacháin nó sa dlí. Tá sé curtha sa dlí anois agus tá an cheist sin, an fhad is a mbaineann sé liomsa, socraithe anois.</P>
    <P>Maidir le comhsheasamh a bheith ag an nGaeilge ar fhógraí, ar fhoirmeacha agus mar sin de, níl sé sásúil mar choincheap mar ní tír dhátheangach sa gciall atá i gceist i gCeanada atá anseo. Tá seo fíor ar dhá chúis. Tá i bhfad níos mó Frainciseoirí acu siúd mar chéatadán don phobal nár mar atá Gaeilgeoirí in Éirinn. Ach, aisteach go leor ní shin í an fíor-chúis. Is í an Ghaeilge chéad teanga oifigiúil sa tír seo agus i ngnoithe áirid ní bheidh aon Bhéarla ar chor ar bith ceadaithe. Tá soláthar san mBille so go gcaithfidh gach comhartha, fógrán agus mar sin de a bheith i nGaeilge amháin nó i nGaeilge agus i mBéarla.</P>
    <P>Neamhchosúil leis an rud a bheadh agat i gCeanada, níl éinne ag iarraidh go gcuirfimid comhartha suas a deir, An Dáil agus The House of Representatives ar chomh mhéid lena chéile nó An Taoiseach nó Oifig an Taoisigh agus go gcuirfimid Office of the Prime Minister. Tá sé ceart go gcuirfí comharthaí i bhFraincis agus i mBéarla i gCeanada mar tá an seasamh bunreachtúil difriúil ann. Bhí gá go gcuirfimis soláthar sa mBille go mbeadh Gaeilge amháin i gceist i gcásanna áirithe. Maidir le comhmhéid, tá an fhadhb céanna ann má chuirtear seo isteach sa reachtaíocht agus déanfar seo trí rialacháin. Ba mhaith liom go mbeadh an saoirse ann go mbeadh an Ghaeilge go mór chun tosaigh in ainmneacha oifigiúla. Nach mbeadh sé aisteach dá gcaithfeadh Údarás na Gaeltachta a sheoladh a chur i mBéarla nó go gcaithfeadh eagraíochtaí eile cosúil leis? Bhí nós ariamh anseo go raibh an seoladh mór i nGaeilge ar pháipéar na Dála agus beag i lúibíní i mBéarla agus ní drochnós a bhí ann. A mhalairt atá go leor de na comhlachtaí Stáit a dhéanamh ach tá mé a rá rud amháin anseo, agus tá mé cinnte go mbeidh sé déanta sula bhfágfaidh mise oifig le cúnamh Dé. I láthair na huaire le go leor Rannaí agus eagraíochtaí Stáit, chaithfeadh duine miocrascóp a fháil leis an leagan Gaeilge a léamh nó chaithfeadh sé dul a chuartú le féachaint cá bhfuil sé.</P>
    <P>Beidh ar a laghad comhmhéid i gceist ach ba mhaith liom go mbeadh an saoirse ann go mbeadh an Ghaeilge níos mó i gcuid mhaith cásanna. Sin an fáth nach bhfuil sin leagtha síos go sonrach istigh sa mBille ach gur féidir leis an Aire rialachán a dhéanamh ach go gcaithfidh sé bheith i nGaeilge agus i mBéarla, níl aon ghlacadh le Béarla amháin.</P>
    <P>Maidir le seirbhís sa nGaeltacht, agus aonad riaracháin a riarfaí trí Ghaeilge, aontaím leis an bprionsabal. Sin ceann de phríomhchúspóir an Bhille. An cheist atá ann áfach ná an bhfuil aon bhealach go praicticiúil sin a scríobh i gcúig nó sé líne i reachtaíocht. Is fearr an prionsabal a leagan síos go soiléir sa gcéad dul síos sa reachtaíocht agus tá sé leagtha síos. Ansin, é a thréisiú tuilleadh sna treoirlínte a bheidh réitithe agam a bhainfidh leis na pleananna agus déanamh cinnte go dtabharfaidh na pleananna aird do na <Col N="838" />treoirlínte a déarfas i nGaeltacht ar nós Conamara go gcaithfear réimse mór seirbhísí a chur ar fáil. Beidh fadhbanna módh ann sa Rinn i bPort Láirge, ní féidir liom bheith ag súil go mbeadh an tseirbhís céanna i gceist sa Rinn mar tá an Ghaeltacht níos lú ansin. Beidh dualgas ar an choimisinéar déanamh cinnte go gcuirfear rud ar bith atá sa bplean i bhfeidhm.</P>
    <P>Tá fadhb eile ara gcaithfimid aghaidh a thabhairt. Tá go leor daoine ag freastal ar an nGaeltacht i láthair na huaire agus ag obair sa nGaeltacht ar son an Stáit. Má comháiríonn duine chuile duine atá clúdaithe sa Bhille mar chomhlacht phoiblí, is dócha go bhfuil trían den phobal oibre ag obair san earnáil phoiblí. Tá go leor acu siúd nach bhfuil aon Ghaeilge acu ach ní féidir fáil réidh leo maidin amárach trí reachtaíocht a thabhairt isteach, is próiseas pleanáilte leanúnach atá i gceist agus is chuige sin go bhfuil an cur chuige áirithe i gceist.</P>
    <P>D'iarr an Teachta Ó Sé inné faoi Sustaining Progress. Sin ceann den na doiciméid go gcaithfear a chur a amach go dhátheangach. Ar an taobh eile den scéal, ní gá go mbeadh an Ghaeilge mar ábhar luaite ann mar ní faoin nGaeilge atá sé, cúrsaí páirtnéireacht atá i gceist. Tá go leor rudaí eile faoi chúrsaí chultúr nach bhfuil luaite ann. Mar sin, glacaim leis an chéadphointe agus tá súil agam go dtuigeann an Teachta an dara phointe atá mé ag déanamh.</P>
    <P>D'ardaigh an Teachta Carey go leor ceisteanna. Tá súil agam go bhfuil mé tar éis cuid acu a fhreagairt. Tá súil agam nach bhfeicfear an coimisinéar mar a d'fheictí fadó an cigire scoil ag feidhmiú ar son Stáit míthrócaireach ach go bhfeicfear é nó í mar chosantóir an phobail. Oibreoidh an choimisinéar ar éileamh an phobail &ndash; tiocfaidh an pobal chuige.</P>
    <P>Bhí ceist ann cén fáth a raibh soláthar sa mBille nach féidir dhul thar breithiúnas an choimisinéir agus dul chun na cúirteanna fáoi rudaí atá sna pleananna. An smaoineamh a bhí ann ná má bhí coimisinéar ann mar gharda, bhí sé ann le déanamh cinnte go gcuirfear seo i bhfeidhm, agus má tá muinín againn as an gcoimisinéar, ba cheart an gné sin den obair a fhágáil mar sin. Níl aon chosc ar éinne a dhul ag na cúirteanna mar atá an Bille anois faoi aon rud eile. Is féidir le duine dul chun na cúirte am ar bith lena gcearta bunreachtúla maidir leis an nGaeilge a chosaint.</P>
    <P>Glacaim leis an moladh a rinneadh maidir le dianchúrsa Ghaeilge a bheith ar fáil do bhaill den Teach seo a bhéimeodh ar an teanga teicniúil a bhíonn orainn úsáid sa Teach seo. Tá cíall ag baint leis sin agus is féidir linn sin a scrúdú. Níl a fhios agam an féidir liom, mar Aire, mórán a dhéanamh faoi ach cinnte tá mé sásta breathnú ar an gceist.</P>
    <P>Luadh anseo ceist leasuithe. Is iad na Teachtaí a chuir síos na leasuithe agus mar sin ní fhéadfainn aon tagairt a dheanamh d'aon leasú mar níl aon leasú thíos i láthair na huaire. Tá a fhios agam go bhfuil leasuithe molta ag cuid de na heagraisí Gaeilge agus is ceist don bhFreasúra agus, go deimhin, don Rialtas breathnú ar na moltaí atá <Col N="839" />déanta acu agus a rá cé na leasuithe a chuirfimid chun cinn. Cuirfidh mé an-speis sna leasuithe atá curtha ar aghaidh agus is féidir liom dearbhú go mbeidh mé á scrúdú go cruinn.</P>
    <P>Beidh mé ag casadh leis na heagraisí Gaeilge Dé Luain seo chugainn agus le muintir na Gaeltachta. Is leo na heagraisí Gaeltachta. Agus mé ag plé leis na dreamanna sin, beidh mé ag tabhairt cluais éisteachta ach go gcaithfidh mé ómós a thabhairt don Teach seo agus a rá nach féidir liom cinneadh críochnúil a dhéanamh ar thada, gurb é an Teach seo a dhéanfaidh na cinnithe agus gur sinne mar Bhaill den Teach a dhéanfaidh na moltaí faoina leasuithe a cheapaimid ar cheart glacadh leo agus sinn ag deireadh an lae a votálann orthu. Éistfidh mé agus ní fhéadfainn cinneadh a dhéanamh ach oiread gan éisteacht le tuairimí Bhaill an Tí seo. Déanfaidh mé sin go fonnmhar. Má tá bealaí ann leis an mBille a fheabhsú, déanfaidh mé é.</P>
    <P>Ar an dtaobh eile den scéal, má chreidim gur fearr an leagan amach atá ann i láthair na huaire, ma chreidim gurb shin an rud is fearr a dhéanfaidh cúram sa gcás seo, seasfaidh mé leis an méid atá ann. Ní thabharfaidh mé aon reamhbhreithiúnas air seo, beidh intinn oscailte agam.</P>
    <P>I am sure that Opposition Deputies will table very interesting amendments covering many different issues. I hope that, given Members' experience in dealing with legislation in the precedence &ndash; chuala mé duine ag cur ceiste maidir leis an Aire Airgeadais &ndash; but we all know the consitutional position with regard to spending and the requirement to get finance sanction. However, I assure Deputies that I will listen to and examine carefully any amendments tabled. I am sure Deputies will do likewise in their amendments and that there will be lively interaction in the debate. We must do this in the context of the procedure for adopting legislation in this and the upper House. We must have regard to how it operates and fits together, and to why legislation is enacted in a certain way. Whatever we put into this Bill must be enforceable and doable. There is no point whatsoever in having legislation, no matter how desirable the end result, if its provisions are not achievable. We need to be realistic. I took a great risk in trying to make everything in this Bill achievable and realistic. To go beyond that point would do more damage to the Irish language than good. I thank all the Deputies who took part. I hope that those of them who are not líofa sa Ghaeilge will accept that it was important that I spoke mainly in Irish on this Bill. One of the difficulties &ndash; and perhaps we could examine the technology involved &ndash; is that the instant translation services are available only to people sitting in the Chamber or the press gallery. They are not available in people's offices, a problem with which we should be able to deal in the modern technological world in which we live. It is a pity, for it is a great inhibition on us all speaking Irish that, if there are ten Irish-speakers and one English-speaker present, we <Col N="840" />sometimes feel that we are leaving the non-Irish speaker out if he or she cannot understand. In the Chamber there are the earphones, but outside there are not.</P>
    <P>I assure all Deputies that I have enjoyed the debate over the last two days, for it showed one interesting fact. The representatives elected by the people broadly welcome this Bill, though there were differences of opinion. I was interested in Deputy English's view. I do not agree with him about two things he said, which I believe are wrong. This country is still one of the richest in the world, and we can afford to look after our culture. It is a great deal richer now than it ever was. It is only when one goes abroad that one realises how rich.</P>
    <P>I think he would accept that, if someone proposed to bulldoze Tara, Knowth, Dowth and all of the great wealth of the world-class archaeological sites in Meath, it would be a travesty of justice. Irish is the oldest written language in Europe that is still a current vernacular, a language that is a world treasure which we hold in trust, not only for the Irish people but for the people of the world, that is unique to this island and to us as a people as our native language. If we said that we would not, or could not, afford to take the small steps needed to ensure its survival, not only would we be doing a great disservice to the people of Ireland but we would be robbing the world of a culture and legacy left to us that are of world importance. In other words, another world heritage site, albeit a living, vibrant one, would disappear.</P>

      <P>I am glad to support this Bill. Is Bille iontach é seo. It is good and badly needed. It is well known that we have had a good run over the past few years, and that was very much built on our knowledge. However, the national development plan shows a commitment to building a knowledge-based economy &ndash; a good thing &ndash; and balanced regional development, which is important. We have the national spatial strategy to inform that. It is obvious that we were good at attracting industry, companies and so on to this country. The Science Foundation Ireland pamphlet, Built for Science, points out that more than 1,200 overseas companies have bases in Ireland, including leaders in engineering, technology, pharmaceuticals, and software design such as Abbott Laboratories, Dell, 3Com, Pfizer, ABB, Microsoft, Johnson &amp; Johnson, IBM, Pratt and Whitney, Wyeth Medica and Intel. It further points out that, as a member of the European Union, Ireland was recently named the most global nation in the world.</P>
      <P>This is interesting because it shows that we were successful in attracting foreign industry. By 2000, over 40% of Ireland's trade with the rest of the world was in research-intensive products and services. However, the funny thing about all that was that most of that research was not generated in Ireland but abroad. It was acknowledged that we had a technology deficit. Now we have competition from accession states such as Hungary and the Czech Republic. They have learned quickly that companies are attracted by low corporate tax rates, investment incentives and a high-quality workforce. These countries, not Ireland, are now attracting industry. We have to change our spots and be like Switzerland, using our talents to be at the races and ensure that we make progress from here on.</P>
      <P>I see this Bill as a step in that direction. It is about developing new models of excellence in research and innovation capability so that we can continue with such investment from outside Ireland and build on it. We have all these companies based here, and we must ensure that they stay and continue to help our economy generate more scientific knowledge. We need knowledge in many different ways, both at home and abroad, and I will come to that presently. It is a powerful progressive force, and it is interesting that there is major investment in research.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is also necessary. There are currently many calls on funding &ndash; that is a total understatement &ndash; but we must do this to retain our competitive advantage. It will help not only industries in Ireland and ourselves but the information, technology and learning centres. The main focus is on the new buzzword of biotechnology. It all boils down to the asset base we have in our people. It is about supporting them and advancing our scientific, cultural and technological ability. That goes right across the board and, when it comes to having people able to do research, we should as much as possible have our own people there, with our own indigenous focus. <Col N="842" />That involves maintaining standards in our schools and ensuring that they are encouraging people to study science subjects, in which there has been a worrying decrease. Every incentive should be provided to ensure that it happens.</P>
    <P>If we are to attract world-class research, we need to have our third level institutions properly supported. Great work has been done by Enterprise Ireland and so on. It is a matter of building on all that. Of course, there are now moves to start charging third-level fees, but anything that would detract from our educational base is not desirable. We must continue to attract people to take part in third level education and maintain our teaching standards, not just at third level, but at national school level.</P>
    <P>There must be proper monitoring of schools. Wherever the school may be, there is a need for monitoring to ensure that standards are maintained across the board. We must ensure that there are laboratories in schools, for there are many without them. We need proper libraries and a proper knowledge base allowing students access to science-based subjects. They must be encouraged to go ahead with such subjects, which must be seen to be relevant. Some of the biggest pharmaceutical companies in the world are based in Ireland. We almost have a monopoly on them. Allowing them to research in Ireland is keeping us on the right economic road. Investment in technology is welcome.</P>
    <P>However, while this serves us as a nation, much of the profit goes outside the country. We must ask ourselves who is served. We must use our brain-power to help ourselves. The saying down my way is &ldquo;God helps those who help themselves.&rdquo;  We must do that. We must use innovation and this Bill to cut through the bureaucracy of 11 health boards and Government Departments &ndash; in the context of the lack of co-ordination between them &ndash; to fast-track to a solution which will serve our needs. We must be innovative to find ways to avoid reports which simply tell us that another report is needed. We need to fast-track forward for effective solutions.</P>
    <P>I mentioned the national development plan, the commitment to balanced regional development and the national spatial strategy. If we help the regions, we help ourselves. However, should we support regions which are over-grown and where growth is not wanted? We do not seem committed to balanced regional development. A review of the national development plan would show that we are still developing Dublin and its hinterland. Half of the graduates from the west must go to Dublin to get their first job. The alarm bells are ringing at the CSO regarding the over-population of Dublin.</P>
    <P>There are problems in regard to increased population and everything that goes with it, including the explosion in car numbers. It is costing Dublin in hold-ups and costing people in terms of stress and heart disease, as they wait in traffic trying to get to and from work. At the same time, vast areas of the west need develop<Col N="843" />ment but also need infrastructure to allow that to happen. That infrastructure &ndash; proper roads and railways &ndash; is not being provided. There is no commitment to the west in the context of the current roads allocation or to a proper road or railway system into County Mayo which would promote regional development instead of central development around Dublin.</P>
    <P>We are depriving ourselves of a bright future by over-developing one part of the country to the detriment of others. It is interesting when one considers the figures. One would be better to have an ass and cart, something which may see a revival around Dublin. There may soon be a call to open the bus lanes to asses and carts because more progress around Dublin would be made in that way, and it would also do a lot for the animal population.</P>
    <P>The average car journey to the city now takes about an hour. Many people are travelling 100 miles per day and taking two to three hours just to get to and from work. The census shows that the population of the Dublin commuter area is almost half of our population of 3.9 million, and development reports suggest that will continue. The west lacks infrastructure and it is important it is brought there. Developing the regions will help Dublin too.</P>
    <P>With regard to innovation, there is provision in the Bill to promote development and assist the carrying out of oriented basic research in strategic areas of scientific endeavour that concern the future development and competitiveness of industry and enterprise in the State. The Bill also deals with other areas regarding economic and social benefits, long-term industrial competitiveness or environmentally sustainable development, as may be prescribed from time to time by the Minister. The Minister should direct that this innovation and research be used for the benefit of necessary, balanced regional development. Otherwise, the Bill does not make sense.</P>
    <P>In section 30, the Bill deals, as a primary object, with the promotion or development of new or improved industrial processes, methods or products and, in particular, such processes, methods or products that are likely either to involve the use or development of local materials, agricultural products or other natural resources to offer the prospect of expansion in existing industry, promotion of new industry and an increase in industrial employment, or to enhance the viability, competitiveness or strategic importance of existing industry in the State, and is carried out, wholly or mainly, in the State, and wholly or mainly sponsored by one or more industrial undertaking in the State.</P>
    <P>While it is time for proper innovation, it is time that such innovation was applied to things that really matter. An energy centre is needed in north County Mayo, where there is gas and wind power, and a power station connected to the national grid which needs to be connected to gas. What about providing support there instead of in <Col N="844" />Dublin? The spotlight should be put on the west, the most economically deprived area of the country. If the focus is put on the west, people will be encouraged to come west and the traffic problems in Dublin will be solved.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Eoin Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am delighted to speak on this important piece of legislation which is a small Bill in comparison to many we have passed through the House. However, it represents a hugely significant change in the basis of our industrial development policy. The concept which underlines all current European industrial development policy is innovation, namely, our ability to compete by changing how we do things or what we do, or by organising ourselves to do better what we have always done.</P>
      <P>We are an innovative people. Our economy has been shaped by the innovative ideas we have applied to industrial development. The establishment of IDA Ireland and Shannon Free Airport Development Company provided a model for similar initiatives in many other countries. I expect that this Bill will be regarded as an equally significant milestone in our economic development.</P>
      <P>We have been successful through the IDA and other agencies in developing our country as a major centre for manufacturing, pharmaceuticals, fine chemicals and electronics. This has happened as a result of a gradual process of skills evolution. Some 40 years ago, we were assembling components made elsewhere. As our skills and educational standards grew, we developed to the stage where we are now fully involved in all stages of high-tech manufacturing. However, we must keep developing our role as a high-tech nation. Standing still is not an option. The next stage is that we become the developers of a new generation of technologies, those on which future industries will depend.</P>
      <P>This strategy requires a major commitment to building our national research infrastructure. Research and development has been a sadly neglected aspect of our national infrastructure until very recent times. Our national spend on research and development has traditionally been negligible in comparison to many of our European partners. The Bill before us signals a fundamental change in our appreciation of the importance of research and development as an element of national infrastructure. In concert with other initiatives by the HEA, the IDA and Enterprise Ireland, it aims to put us firmly on the map as a research performer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The objective of Science Foundation Ireland as stated in section 7(1) is to create a standard of excellence in oriented basic research, and to significantly develop our capability to conduct research by attracting world class researchers to Ireland. These scientists will conduct the basic <Col N="845" />research on which future technologies will be built. As stated in section 7(3), these scientists will be particularly involved in biotechnology and information and communications technology. Such technologies are both relevant to our existing research skills and also to our current and potential industry base. However, technical innovation is more than good ideas. This Bill is part of the development of a wider system of economic development. It must be seen in the context of a wider plan to develop our national technological competence. This wider plan involves our universities and colleges, our industries and the agencies that support both. We are unusual in Europe in that our universities are major public research performers. Unlike almost all of our EU partners, we do not have national research institutes with the exception of Teagasc.</P>
    <P>Developing university competence through Science Foundation Ireland has many advantages but it also requires careful management. Our universities must develop their capability to recognise the good ideas that arise from this research and make them available for commercial use. We must also support the industries and entrepreneurs who wish to convert these developments into viable enterprises. We have made some good progress in this area but more needs to be done. There is still a widely held view in industry that universities are difficult to deal with in regard to research and intellectual property. They can demand high levels of equity from start-up companies and high rates of payment for licensed technologies.</P>
    <P>It goes without saying that universities and individual researchers deserve a reward for their part in new technology development but this reward must be fair and should not be a disincentive to those who wish to use the output of research. That would be entirely against the spirit with which the SFI funding has been provided. I urge the universities and Forfás, therefore, to implement a system that will ensure the efficient and equitable use of the output of the research funded by Science Foundation Ireland and other national agencies.</P>
    <P>One of the other issues we should consider is whether the industrial development agencies are organised appropriately for the new phase in our development. We are now reshaping our national infrastructure towards technology generation. This ambition should be reflected in the confidence of the boards of those agencies charged with making this change. Perhaps the Minister might keep this in mind in the re-appointment of boards of Enterprise Ireland and other agencies when they become vacant.</P>
    <P>The Bill is a significant step in developing our research competence. The technology infrastructure the Government is building through SFI and other initiatives will hugely develop the innovative capacity of our country. I confidently expect that future historians will see this change in economic strategy as a major development in our economic history.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="846" />The extent to which partners in academia and industry work effectively, not just in developing intellectual property but in subsequently commercially exploiting it for the benefit of the developers, the companies which have invested in it and the economy, is a key success factor. Investment in SFI and other research programmes has the potential to generate significant wealth for the economy but only if the fruits of research and development are commercially exploited. An integrated approach across the State agencies &ndash; Forfás, Enterprise Ireland, the IDA, Science Foundation Ireland &ndash; will be necessary to encourage commercial exploitation of research and development seeded here.</P>
    <P>On an international stage our universities, individually, are not that significant from a research and development perspective. Greater co-operation and collaboration is needed across the university sector to ensure they become world-class players. The tax system should be adjusted to support multinationals here to engage in research and development and support expansion of the indigenous SME sector. Our nearest neighbours and competitors for research and development projects, the United Kingdom, offer tax credits, as does Canada, Israel and other competitor countries. Our tax system is deficient in not offering research and development tax credits to companies and if we want many of the very large companies to remain here in the long-term, we must give them an incentive to do so.</P>
    <P>This is an excellent Bill which will have a significant impact on our industrial development in the years to come. I ask the House to contribute to our new national innovative spirit by supporting it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMoloney" hpid="Mr. Moloney Mr. Moloney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moloney</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Ryan for sharing his time and welcome the opportunity to say a few words about the Bill. A number of different factors have played a significant role in helping to generate the consistent economic growth we have enjoyed during the period of the Celtic tiger. Our membership of the European Union was an important factor but one of the most important factors was the level of technological advancement this country made over the past number of years. Having a technologically proficient and well educated population which could be easily trained meant that multinational firms from all parts of the world flocked here.</P>
      <P>The benefits those companies provided to this country continue to this very day, with hundreds of thousands of Irish workers being employed by non-domestic multinational companies. Times have moved on, however, and economic and technological trends change. That is the nature of the work in which they are involved. Technology depends on innovation and, as such, needs to continue to develop. It is that continuous development which gives it its edge.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With Ireland so dependent on technology, it is essential that we, as a nation, continue to develop with it and seek out new ways of developing it. <Col N="847" />We cannot afford to be satisfied with our current lot. If we stand still, we will be left behind. That is the reason the Bill is so important. We may not reap the benefits of its passing immediately but we will be in a position to gain advantage in the decades to come. For that reason I welcome the Bill and commend the thinking behind it.</P>
    <P>Science Foundation Ireland will allow us to do precisely that. The work of the body will position Ireland so that we will be ready not only to adapt to new technologies and innovations but, hopefully, lead that charge. The main function of the foundation will be to promote and develop world-class research capabilities in strategic areas of scientific endeavour and by concentrating on information and communications technologies, as well as the importance of biotechnology, we will be well positioned to deal with two of the hi-tech industries that are most likely to represent the largest areas of growth and development in the future.</P>
    <P>By placing greater emphasis on research and development we will help to alleviate some of the problems the economy is currently experiencing. We will be less vulnerable to global market changes as we have been and can be in the future. That is an issue we have to deal with in the current climate. We will be less production-orientated and so will be in a position to avoid some of the pitfalls that can arise.</P>
    <P>It is fair to say our economy is clearly suffering from the global economic downturn, and such initiatives have never been more important. This less than favourable external environment has tested our economic competitiveness and it is important to be aware that with the accession of the ten new member states into the EU, that competitiveness will be further tested in the future. It is clear, and our competitors are aware, that we are no longer a low-reach economy. Multinational companies will be able to find cheaper labour elsewhere &ndash; we are witnessing that particular trend in recent months &ndash; while at the same time benefiting from being inside the EU.</P>
    <P>With such hurdles in front of us the Government has taken the shrewd and extremely far-sighted approach encapsulated in the Bill. Science Foundation Ireland will allow us to reposition Irish industry, and with that Irish labour, further up the economic value chain. The best way to achieve such a feat is through awareness of the importance of knowledge creation and innovation. This will help to sustain and enhance the level of our competitiveness and will position us to supply services that few, if any, countries will be able to provide.</P>
    <P>We also need to increase Ireland's attractiveness as a location to carry out the work of research and development. This was the position outlined by the technology foresight study undertaken by the Irish Council for Science Technology and Innovation in 1998. Science Foundation Ireland also promises to do this, and much more, and has already had a degree of success in <Col N="848" />meeting these objectives since its establishment in 2000. This month we have seen the awarding of &euro;42 million to three new centres for science, engineering and technology, while last March the foundation selected nine distinguished scientists from around the world to receive the Walton visitor awards.</P>
    <P>Science Foundation Ireland's role is to ensure that Ireland not only adapts to new technologies and advances, but also leads the way. We are attracting top researchers and scientists who will help make this a reality and will soon see the benefits of this programme. Not only will we be kept better informed of technical innovation here, we will be leading in innovation.</P>
    <P>Under such circumstances it is not implausible to imagine that rather than being content to have foreign multinationals setting up and playing such a major role in our economy, Ireland may, in the not too distant future, become the home territory for advanced technological multinational corporations. That is a wish we could see realised. Irish companies and their technical innovations could lead the way and we could again blaze a trail which would make the Celtic tiger look like a growth blip. While this may be a long way off or even appear far-fetched to some given the current economic climate, the establishment of Science Foundation Ireland and the powers vested in it under the Bill will establish the conditions to do precisely this.</P>
    <P>How we fare in the future will depend on other factors. It must, however, be remembered that the seeds for future success are always planted in the present, which is what the Government is doing through this Bill. Provided it is properly nurtured, Science Foundation Ireland will help improve the economy in a manner which will ensure the entire country will be able to reap the fruits in the not too distant future. I welcome the Bill for the reasons I have outlined. It is important we meet the challenge now rather than wait. The Government has shown foresight in recognising that change is on the way. By fostering progress in research and development, promoting technological advances, securing further investment and giving encouragement, we can meet this challenge. I welcome the Bill and commend it to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DamienEnglishFG" hpid="Mr. English Mr. English">
      <NameTxt>Mr. English</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to speak to this Bill which is important for the future of the country. Its importance hit home to me this week with the announcement of job losses in my home town of Navan. Innovations such as this one are important in planning and safeguarding our future. No one will doubt the importance of creating a knowledge based economy or disagree that investing in excellence in basic research will help secure our future economic growth. Science Foundation Ireland will lead to much more industrial development.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Recent job losses in Navan are high on my agenda. I hope this Bill will help the town in future. I ask the Minister of State at the Depart<Col N="849" />ment of the Taoiseach, Deputy Hanafin, to relay the problems facing Navan, which I will spell out, to the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Harney, and request that she examines the serious problems affecting Navan and County Meath generally.</P>
    <P>This week a furniture factory in the town announced it will close in the coming weeks, while another factory, Case New Holland, one of the few located in the large, almost empty industrial park, announced the loss of 20 or 30 jobs. Navan and County Meath are vulnerable, particularly as many jobs in the region are tied to mining, carpet making and furniture factories. This Bill which covers areas such as innovation, new ideas and scientific research offers ways forward for towns such as Navan which are vulnerable due to their reliance on older industry sectors. I hope Science Foundation Ireland will help such towns by creating job opportunities.</P>
    <P>The Minister outlined the degree of expansion in our national industrial base and the large numbers of new jobs created in recent years. I understand she mentioned a figure of several hundred thousand new jobs being created in the past ten to 15 years, which I do not dispute and is welcome news. During this period, however, the industrial base of County Meath has not budged and remains extremely low. Thousands of houses have been built for commuters working throughout Dublin who are commuting to the capital's industrial base. Although these people have jobs, they have no life as they must travel for two or three hours every morning and evening. This is not good enough. Research is needed to find ways to develop new jobs in alternative locations throughout the country and help counties like Meath establish a proper industrial base which reflects their current populations</P>
    <P>County Meath which has a population of more than 130,000 has a rates base of less than &euro;9 million, whereas Fingal County Council has a rates base of &euro;30 million to &euro;40 million, which is a major difference. The reason for this is the size of the industrial base of both county council areas. Money is needed to develop the infrastructure of the county and quality of life for the new and longer established residents of County Meath.</P>
    <P>While I do not wish to stray too far from the contents of the Bill, lack of employment and a poor industrial base, if not improved, will have grave consequences for County Meath. Government policy is to blame. To allow massive housing development to continue without pumping money into the county at the same time constitutes poor planning, omits people from the planning process and is unfair to the county which helped solve the housing problem of Dublin. We are now suffering as a consequence. I ask the Minister of State to bring to the Minister the message that County Meath badly needs change. She should also direct Science Foundation Ireland to examine ways in which it could encourage research and investment in the county.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="850" />The lack of a spatial strategy for the past seven or eight years caused problems for County Meath and other counties around Dublin. Now that it has finally arrived seven or eight years late, the spatial strategy has failed to help solve the problem by omitting County Meath. The gateway towns leapfrogged Dunshaughlin, Navan and Kells and landed in Cavan and Monaghan. I ask that Science Foundation Ireland, which will direct Government policy on research, investment and other areas, take a broad view and examine the issue of resources for each of the counties to achieve a proper balance. County Meath has been left in limbo due to a lack of investment.</P>
    <P>Why am I so concerned about the spatial strategy? When it was published, the Taoiseach stated that all investment relating to transport, industry, health, education and other sectors would follow the guidelines laid down in the strategy. This is worrying for regions not covered by the strategy, regardless of the content of later Bills such as this. It is a matter of concern which needs to be corrected. I hope the Department will take a more balanced approach rather than pursuing exclusively the spatial strategy.</P>
    <P>To return to the Bill, research and development is the way to secure our future and that of our young people. We have done well during the past seven or eight years. The reasons for this are varied. The rainbow Government as well as the current Government played a significant role in this respect.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. English</NameTxt>
      <P>While I would not put it as strongly as claiming all the credit, the boom can be attributed to the foundations laid by the rainbow Government and other factors, all of which should be acknowledged. There is no point in Members on one side of the House claiming all the credit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Scientific knowledge is the key to where we go from here. We cannot sit back and ask why Ireland did not perform well. We have to continue to drive forward and push for innovation, new ideas, greater knowledge and so forth, which is the objective of the Bill in establishing Science Foundation Ireland. Even in bad economic times such as now, it is extremely important to invest taxpayers' money and the time of our experts in developing our future. The new foundation and similar boards provide a basis for strategies and have an important role in pushing forward this agenda. The composition and selection process <Col N="851" />for these boards is important, as is the monitoring of their performance. I will return to this issue.</P>
    <P>Many young people are worried about whether the country will provide future opportunities for them. Job security is no longer guaranteed. The right to free, third level education is in doubt. I hope the Minister will stand her ground on this issue. The Minister of State may not agree with her party colleague, the Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Noel Dempsey, on this issue which will have serious consequences. Initiatives such as the establishment of Science Foundation Ireland will be worthless if we decide to go down the road of bringing back third level fees. The booming economy was brought about by the education system. Many of those who helped create the Celtic tiger were educated at a time when parents had to pay fees, for which they suffered considerably. We cannot return to that because, if we do, it will make much of the work we are doing worthless.</P>
    <P>Young people of my age and those who are older are worried about the future of the country. There is a bad economic climate at present. Although we must try to be positive, we must also try to address people's concerns. The cost of living is constantly rising and people's quality of life is deteriorating. Support structures, such as child care and care for the elderly, are as important as this Bill. It is one thing to move forward and to put money into research, but if we do not improve people's lives, we will defeat the purpose of the Bill. We must have a general policy. It is the job of the Government and of the Opposition benches to put those fears to bed and to fuel confidence in our young people who helped to make the Celtic tiger. This Bill only covers one area, but more work is required. I hope our economic development remains high on the agenda. Spending money on research will help to deliver the results and the value for money we need.</P>
    <P>I agree with the goals of the Bill. A modern economy cannot exist without having the best facilities, services and technical support money can buy to back up Government industrial policy. Apart from securing our future, this Bill gives us an opportunity to change the way good people are selected for State boards, bodies and agencies. I am not saying they do not do a good job because that would be wrong. A good job is done, but it is time for change and reform. I am not saying that all State boards, bodies and agencies are fixed by political appointment. Good people have been chosen for the interim board, although they may be political appointees. That must be done when the board is set up on a statutory basis and appointments are made on a full-time basis.</P>
    <P>Many taxpayers view State bodies and agencies as a chance for the Government to give jobs to the friends of the party. It is important that the process is transparent.</P>

      <P>He can speak for himself; I am part of the new breed. While the rest of the country suffers from hospital bed closures and home help and other cutbacks, which are now the order of the day, life for the elite who work in association with the Government is better than normal. We have accepted pay rises, for example, without justification or results. I do not have any problem accepting a pay rise if there are results. We need to clarify for the people the hours we work and what we do during that time so they can understand why we are getting a pay rise.</P>
      <P>I am not saying that money can be saved by not appointing State boards. However, we and the taxpayers deserve to know what the money is being spent on and what has been achieved in terms of value for money. The House, the Minister and the Government must confront this issue. This Bill gives us the first chance in the new economic world, which we refer to as the world of cutbacks and broken promises, to be as transparent as possible and to ensure value for money. The appointment of the board should be transparent. We should move away from the idea of jobs for the boys and show the people that it is wrong. More work must be done for the betterment of everyone. The Government should take this on board. No one can argue about the need for the new board, but the appointment process must be examined. The process was right for the appointment of the interim board. While it will be all right if the same people are appointed on a full-time basis, we need experts.</P>
      <P>The Bill has many words, but it is short on goals. For too long Governments and Government agencies have taken credit for everything good, but they duck and dive when problems arise and blame outside factors, such as the downturn in the world economy, oil prices or men from Mars when they have failed to produce. Although this has happened over the years, it is particularly evident in the past year or two. It is time for that to change. There is a will in the House to change it if Departments and Ministers allow it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is common practice that high-ranking civil servants and others are asked to appear before committees of the House to answer questions on policy and spending commitments. However, the committees are at a disadvantage because they do not have a yardstick or a mission statement on which to judge performance. I ask for that to change. The Bill refers to an annual report at the end of each year. It is not much to ask all Departments and State bodies and agencies to produce a realistic set of objectives at the beginning of the <Col N="853" />year so that during the year, but particularly at the end of it, Members of the House may inquire, on behalf of the taxpayer, about the mission statement and what it achieved or nearly achieved and if the wrong people are doing the job. It would not be a witch hunt and I trust the House would be big enough to put personalities to one side when dealing with taxpayers' money. It is not the committee system which is not working. It has done a great job up to now. I think in particular of the late Jim Mitchell who was not afraid to try something new and who achieved great results. Inquiries and the way they are handled have been changed forever as a result of his work.</P>
    <P>We should not fear change, but embrace it and work with it. It is time for reform. This Bill and the appointment of the board gives us the chance to do that. Before each committee meeting dealing with a State or semi-State body or agency, each Member of the House who sits on that body should have an A4 sheet of paper, not a glossy booklet, which states that the agency or body will achieve certain things and will spend a certain amount of money to achieve that in any given year. That would make the job of the Members of the House easier and would save ridiculous time wasting. The members appointed to Science Foundation Ireland should be appointed by the House. The Bill refers to the Minister, the Minister for Education and Science and the Minister for Finance having a say in such appointments. What is wrong with the House appointing them? If they are the experts I am told they are, we should be involved in the process of appointing them.</P>
    <P>The Bill also refers to the fact that anyone who wishes to become involved in politics either at local or national level will be disqualified from the board. That suggests there may be people, who have not declared a political agenda, sitting on the board and using it as a stepping stone. That is not the way taxpayers' money should be spent. Although I would not discourage young and old people from becoming involved in politics, there is a time and a place for it. I ask the Minister to ensure that all potential applicants for these financially rewarding jobs appear before a Dáil committee where their political intentions could be put on the public record. I do not want to be misunderstood. Anyone who does a good job should be paid well. The cream should always rise to the top. However, underperformers should be sacked as they hold everyone back. We are talking about taxpayers' money and our economic future. They could explain to a committee of the House why they think they are qualified for the job and what they hope to achieve in 12 months. If that system works for the committee, there is no reason it cannot be extended to include others. The appointment of this board provides an opportunity to outline the way all boards should be appointed.</P>
    <P>The Government is the first to tell us how we must live within budgetary constraints, yet a large <Col N="854" />part of taxpayers' money is spent on Government services behind closed doors. That must change. There cannot be one law for pensioners and another law for Government advisers. They both receive taxpayers' money which must be accounted for.</P>
    <P>This Bill will open the door to great things. Deputy Eoin Ryan and other Members outlined their views on it. However, we must monitor it properly. We must consider how our money is spent and how people work for the State. I hope we will look back and say the Bill was an important part of Ireland in the 21st century.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach (Ms Hanafin)</NameTxt>
      <P>I chose to speak on this Bill because one of my responsibilities is the information society. In that context, I am keenly aware of the role Science Foundation Ireland is playing in transforming the economy into one where knowledge and innovation reign. When our economy is transformed, we can hope to gain the full social and economic benefits from the development of information and communications technology. There is a key link between the information society and Science Foundation Ireland. We are talking about new connections which challenge the traditional assumptions about what is possible and when it is possible. The advances in information and communications technology are transforming how we learn, how we do our business and how we deliver Government services. New systems are providing a vital enabling framework for progressive development in every area of society, whether it is society generally, education or industry. That information society will be built upon the foundations of research and innovation. The role of Science Foundation Ireland in laying these foundations is recognised in New Connections, the document outlining the Government strategy for realising the potential of the information society.</P>
      <P>It is interesting to see how the issue of changing the way we do business arises again and again no matter what age those involved are. This morning I presented prizes in CBS Monkstown for young businesses. The prize-winners were only 6th class students, 30 of whom raised &euro;25,000 for charity, while they were involved in the project. What struck me more this year over previous years I presented prizes was the increased use of technology, even at that young age. We must tap that resource and young people's knowledge and information. We must ensure that we can support it to ensure we can carry on and develop the type of economy we want.</P>
      <P>I should have said at the outset that I wish to share time with Deputy Kelly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanArdagh" hpid="Mr. Ardagh Mr. Ardagh">

      <NameTxt>Ms Hanafin</NameTxt>
      <P>It is evident from what we have said about the competitiveness of the Irish economy that it can be enhanced through greater <Col N="855" />economic activity arising from investment in research and technological development. This is crucial for our success and will underpin our attractiveness as a world-leading location for e-business and knowledge based economic activity. We recognise the need for the advanced science and technology base if we are to get ICT based investment and develop our skills and knowledge base.</P>
      <P>I meet a number of the top computer companies coming to this country. It is interesting to note that whereas we might have the manufacturing end of that market here the research and development area is in other countries. Recently I met with Steve Ballmer, the chief executive of Microsoft World. We spoke about attracting research and development to this country. Of course, Microsoft is looking at other countries also. The role Science Foundation Ireland is playing, and will continue to play, in heightening investment in projects will help to attract other major companies and that lucrative end of the business to Ireland.</P>
      <P>The funding provided for Science Foundation Ireland in the national development plan, which is substantial, will help Ireland become a world class research centre, particularly in ICT and biotechnology. The technology foresight fund of February 2000 will launch &euro;635 million over a seven year period and through that Science Foundation Ireland can ensure that we can reach our potential in this area.</P>
      <P>The higher education element is particularly important. Obviously we will only have a world class research community when we have highly trained and experienced research graduates and post-graduates. This must start at the bottom. It is a grave source of concern that fewer and fewer students are taking science subjects. There has been a particular reduction in the number of science students at second level which means there is no hope of subsequently getting them at third level. Funds to encourage schools where all first year students take science and the provision of extra equipment grants can be valuable. We also need to look at seconding into the schools people working directly in local industry in order to highlight the link between science and job opportunities. This should be developed.</P>
      <P>The task force on physical sciences has drawn attention to the amount of work that needs to be done in this area. Science Foundation Ireland has a role to play also. Its role will be more concentrated on third level and will encourage collaboration between the third level institutes and firms to ensure we can reap the full benefits there. Its website points out that building top class research teams between academia and industry is one of the most important steps any country can take in building a lasting indigenous research base and generating ideas, products and jobs based on knowledge. I hope we will not just wait until third level to do this but that we can also do it at first and second level.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="856" />The new centres for science, technology and engineering which are being funded by SFI give new and exciting opportunities for such collaborations. One of these, the digital enterprise research centre in NUIG, is working with Hewlett-Packard on the technologies that will underpin the next generation of the world wide web through developing semantic web technology. Such dynamic research interaction between the best human talent in industry and academia will ensure that we are well placed to provide the innovations that will drive my area of interest, which is the information society agenda, forward. Knowledge has the power to become a strong economic tool.</P>
    <P>Recently I was pleased to meet some of my own past pupils from Sion Hill who are working in the area of science research. It is interesting that 21% of researchers in Irish industry are women compared to 15% in other European countries. That is encouraging but we need to ensure that this number grows even more. Forfás is considering a review of this area and of the conditions and status of women in science and industry. If the proper interest in science is encouraged at school level and into third level, we will be able to attract people to continue at the higher level needed.</P>
    <P>The Young Scientists' exhibition has played a key role in encouraging young people's interest in the science area. While I was never a scientist, I participated in that exhibition fadó, fadó. It provides a great opportunity for young people to share and develop their ideas. It is a pity that recently the exhibition has had difficulty finding sponsors. I hope sufficient sponsorship will be found in order to ensure we encourage an interest at the lower levels of education in taking science further.</P>
    <P>Science Foundation Ireland has had a number of successes to date. It has only been in existence for three years but has had quite remarkable achievements. It has attracted some of the world's most prominent scientists to support our research community. It is helping to foster a dynamic research culture which will encourage our best scientific talent to stay in Ireland rather than build their research futures in the US. It is also helping us to move from a situation where our economic growth relies to a large extent on foreign direct investment and import technology to one where the basis for growth will arise to a greater extent from indigenous innovation.</P>
    <P>Top quality researchers and universities are pushing researchers to speak a language we can all understand which is something I admire. Last year I presented prizes at an award ceremony in UCD to young science students who made presentations about difficult, complicated research to a lay audience. That sort of effort encourages others. It ensures that people realise there is a direct link between science and society and our everyday lives, particularly in the context of developing our economy.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="857" />Our State investment will be well spent. That it is guided by an international merit review is welcome. This means we will get maximum value for ideas, innovations, industrial development and prosperity etc. The information society is moving forward at a great pace. It tends to focus on the use of technology and computers and the accessing of services but it is more than this. It is also about research and development. It is about increasing the number of our researchers, the building of capacity, the promotion of private investment, the creation of links between industry and education and ensuring we have an educated workforce which will enable us become the competitive country we want to be.</P>
    <P>Science Foundation Ireland is well positioned to do this. Its record over the past three years has proven this. By putting the foundation on a statutory footing we will enable it to go even further independently to develop Ireland as a powerful knowledge base. I wish the foundation well in its work.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PeterKellyFF" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill will establish Science Foundation Ireland on a statutory basis. After a decade of prosperity Ireland is no longer a low-wage economy and must make that transition to higher added-value products and services that allow us to sustain and grow incomes. Our competitiveness has suffered over the past few years. One of the ways of tackling this is to acknowledge the importance of research and development in sustaining and enhancing competitiveness.</P>
      <P>Science, technology, research and innovation are the key words of the future. SFI was set up initially under existing industrial development legislation as a subsidiary of Forfás. The purpose of the Bill is to establish the foundation as a separate legal entity. The programme for Government undertook to put SFI on a statutory basis. SFI's role is to establish Ireland as a centre of research excellence in strategic scientific areas related to economic development.</P>
      <P>SFI has been charged by the Government to invest in the scientific and engineering fields underpinning biotechnology and information and communications technology. This legislation establishing SFI on a statutory basis marks a milestone in the ongoing development and growth of first-rate scientific research in Ireland. In setting up SFI the Government committed to building an eco-system of world-class research in this country. By establishing the foundation on a statutory basis the Government is providing SFI with a solid foundation to ensure this commitment is achieved.</P>
      <P>SFI will help third level institutions recruit and retain scholars capable of building internationally significant research programmes in the fields that underpin biotechnology as well as information and communications technology. SFI will foster related programmes across all levels of Irish education so that students can learn more about the excitement in these fields and about why it is worth considering careers in them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="858" />SFI will encourage and join governmental, educational and industrial efforts that strengthen our scientific, engineering and entrepreneurial cultures and promote the resulting technological innovations throughout the world. Information and communications technology is the core of the knowledge society. Scientific and engineering research today requires the use of systems and processes that information and communications technology research has produced. Research in biotechnology could be as essential to social and industrial development in the future as physics and chemistry were after the Second World War.</P>
    <P>SFI offers the possibility of significantly enhancing our scientific, engineering and economic growth and becoming a vital partner in building a research system recognised and distinguished around the world for its excellence. Sustained economic growth and prosperity depends on establishing a culture of scientific and technological innovation, a high level of research and development and a globally-competitive, knowledge-based economy. Meeting this challenge will require us to make science and engineering careers attractive to students. We must provide incentives to encourage graduate students, post-doctoral researchers and no-tenured researchers to stay active in research and engineering in Ireland.</P>
    <P>SFI will work with Irish universities and institutes of technology to seek out and bring to Ireland researchers and research teams in science and engineering who are acknowledged as world leaders in their fields. Ireland is a relatively small country with a small population and has used its best talents to achieve significant results in the past ten years. It has used its size to provide agility, flexibility and adaptability, qualities much valued in this post-industrial age.</P>
    <P>Ireland can compete globally when its Departments, agencies, universities, institutes of technology and researchers all work together. SFI offers the prospect of acting as a catalyst for Ireland's future economic and social transformation into a knowledge-base economy in the same way that Enterprise Ireland and the IDA helped to support the development of the economy to its current level.</P>
    <P>Establishing SFI on a statutory basis is essential if we are to sustain this transformation, a transformation that, if maintained and exploited, will yield untold benefits for future generations of Irish society. I am happy to compliment the Government on recognising the importance of research and development. Everybody knows that this is the way forward. In the past number of years we have attracted different types of industry, and now is the time to lay a strong foundation in research and development.</P>
    <P>Everybody who is in business, who is competitive and who has vision knows that there is only one way forward and that is research and development. I welcome the Bill and commend it to the House. I look forward to a bright economic future for our country.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PaulKehoeFG" hpid="Mr. Kehoe Mr. Kehoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kehoe</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister and the Bill to the House. The Minister has outlined the background to the establishment of SFI from it small beginnings as a sub-division of Forfás in 2000. Establishing Science Foundation Ireland on a statutory basis is a radical but welcome departure as the country seeks to build a global knowledge-based economy.</P>
      <P>It is obvious, as the Minister has pointed out, that the reason for the establishment of SFI is that if Ireland is to maintain its recent economic success, it must continue to raise the level of excellence and quality of the industries located here. This is because Ireland can no longer compete on a cost basis with other, cheaper economies around the world. We can only compete on skills and quality. SFI will contribute to improving standards in both areas by attracting first-class researchers to live and work in Ireland.</P>
      <P>These researchers will also support the development of a thriving eco-system of world-class research in Ireland that will lead to new discoveries and innovations and also be attractive to industries which need these scarce skills. In using the budget allocated to SFI to attract a critical mass of excellent researchers to research laboratories and third level education institutions in Ireland, SFI offers Ireland the prospect of competing and winning in the global race for knowledge in both biotechnology and information and communications technology.</P>
      <P>In recruiting these leading researchers, SFI also aids efforts to continuously raise skill levels and competencies. This is a critical requirement if we are to have the personnel and skills required to meet the demands of the next phase of our country's development. The establishment of SFI complements similar departures in successively legislating for the establishment of the IDA and Enterprise Ireland, organisations which have played a major role in recent times in the development of the economy and society.</P>
      <P>SFI activities will be complementary to the work of the IDA and Enterprise Ireland in their efforts to move Irish companies up the value chain. The funding allocated to SFI is a vital component of the &euro;2.54 billion investment in research, technological development and innovation in the National Development Plan 2000-2006. The overall allocation to Science Foundation Ireland is &euro;635 million. Most knowledge-based economies and societies, such as Finland, which has a history and population similar to our own, are built around world-class research institutions, skills and abilities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Correctly exploited and utilised, innovation and world-class research can be harnessed to the benefit of future generations in Ireland. Accordingly, the establishment of the SFI and the funding allocated to it are an investment in the future growth of the economy. If we do not follow through on these investment requirements, we may fall behind in our efforts to establish Ireland as a leading player in the global knowledge based economy. I am impressed with the progress made <Col N="860" />to date by the SFI, which is still in its infancy, and I understand that by the end of March this year it had made financial investments amounting to around &euro;200 million.</P>
    <P>Dr. William Harris, director general of Science Foundation Ireland, realises that we are in a race to take a prominent position on the scientific map of the world. With a budget of &euro;635 million to make this happen and a compass in his hand, he is working out the co-ordinates and has been doing so for some time. He believes that Ireland's sustained economic growth and prosperity will depend on establishing a knowledge based economy, a high level of research and development and a culture of scientific and technological innovation. It is obvious that Dr. Harris realises our position and the competition with which we must deal. If we fail to attain the next level, our ability to compete will be greatly diminished.</P>
    <P>It is obvious that Dr. Harris has thought a great deal about economic and social change and takes the view that matters evolve and change over time and that few of them remain static for long. He believes that a country's greatest asset is its people and its educational system. In the past, people worried about coal, steam and big factories and never thought about people being more than machines. Ireland is a well educated nation and an economy which recognises that it is stuck between the US and Europe, an ideal position from which to compete. It has positioned itself through good relationships between the Government and the industrial sectors and has identified successful revenue and riches that will ultimately benefit the social structure.</P>
    <P>Dr. Harris also has rightly asserted that this century will be driven by the ability to have well educated people who can use information and knowledge. This is tempered by his experiences with the National Science Foundation in the US. He believes that the creation of an engine room or power source pumping out new talent and identifying new scientific, technological and industrial fields is critical for economic survival. This century will see an era that will create an empire of the mind as opposed to one built of copper and steel. All our systems have to work well. Government has to work well and cannot be centrally driven. Dr. Harris believes that we need a Government that is agile, a private sector that is entrepreneurial and a university system that is flexible and entrepreneurial. All these have to work together in the construction of the new empire of the mind. He believes that Ireland has the potential to compete at that level if it can get these piers to connect.</P>
    <P>Significantly, Dr. Harris has stated:</P>
    <P>Our role at SFI is to be a catalyst and make those things happen. In the US the National Science Foundation was established and was one of the principal government tools that helped shape the colleges and universities to create the research processes that are now the best in the world. It is that research system that <Col N="861" />has helped to fuel the industrial enterprise that still exists.</P>
    <P>It is good to know that Dr. Harris believes that the universities in this country are well prepared and that there are individuals here willing to promote things with a passion.</P>
    <P>Speaking at the IMI conference in Killarney in April 2002 he said:</P>
    <P>Allow me first to give you the brief on the Science Foundation Ireland. SFI has been charged by the Government to invest in the scientific and engineering fields underpinning bio-technology and information and communications technology. It is predicted that the market for bio-technology industries will rise to £250 billion by the year 2005 and support three million jobs in Europe. Research in bio-technology will affect health care, pharmaceuticals, environmental management, agriculture, green science, economic goods, and food and drink businesses. It includes fields such as DNA chips, genomics, bio-sensors, drug delivery and bio-remediation. The other area of SFI's investment is information and communications technology or ICT. This includes broadband, wireless and mobile transmission. It includes parallel processing systems, engineering for reliability of data transfer and wearable sensors. It also includes computer modelling, distributed networking, computer-based training and human language understanding.</P>
    <P>He further pointed out:</P>
    <P>Thanks to satellites and fibre optic cables, ideas leap among people almost like lightning. Nowadays, through a terminal, a satellite and a decent battery or a plug in the wall, ideas can jump from an island to anywhere and likewise attract. The only limit now is the worth of the idea, the intelligence that uses it and the innovation that it creates.</P>
    <P>We all believe that this country is well positioned to succeed in a knowledge driven economy, and again Dr. Harris believes that we have nurtured the wealth of talent available in our young population. It is good to know he believes we have taken advantage of having an English speaking population at a time when English is used to run world markets. We have also leveraged our free market democratic system, which promotes innovation and initiative. EU membership has been vitally important as well as the tax incentives that have helped to attract a decade's worth of multinational investment and encourage the development of a unique relationship with US companies. Equally important are the innovative State policies spearheaded by the Tánaiste's Department and Forfás. Successful industrial investment marketing efforts have been led by Enterprise Ireland and IDA Ireland.</P>
    <P>Dr. Harris argues that Ireland has another important advantage in terms of its size. Other sources of competitive advantage are rapidly drying up. Included here is the geographical position, <Col N="862" />which has been weakened by electronic commerce, reduced tariffs and lower barriers to foreign direct investment. The new technologies of the late 20th and early 21st centuries have shrunk the advantages that accrue to mere size. Ireland's small size should allow for efficiencies, partnerships and synergies not possible in larger countries.</P>
    <P>Dr. Harris correctly points out that what we do now will set the way in which we develop for at least a generation. Complacency, slow decision making and failure to keep pace with change have cost nations before. We must not let that happen. Due to the fact that we cannot afford to do everything at once, we need a national strategy. We should apply every possible resource at our disposal to build our education, research and technology base for speed, knowledge and competitiveness. The entire education system from primary level through postgraduate level is important as it is a systemic issue.</P>
    <P>In section 12, I notice something to which Members have referred in respect of previous legislation. I refer to the way Members have strictures placed upon them, an issue about which Deputy English spoke. Perhaps the Tánaiste will outline the rationale behind this? I echo what she said earlier in the week about recognising the importance of Science Foundation Ireland. I am delighted it is being established on a statutory basis under this Bill.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State, Deputy Hanafin, said that young people depend on computerised systems. I ask the Minister of State, Deputy Browne, to relay to the Tánaiste that it is of utmost importance that money is invested in education at primary, secondary and third levels. We are facing a future where it is essential to have research, innovation, new ideas and technology. People are dependent on technology. When Members walk into their offices the first thing they do is check their e-mails. I encourage the Tánaiste to invest in this area as much as possible. I welcome the Bill and hope it will help future generations. I commend the Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatCarey" hpid="Mr. Carey Mr. Carey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Carey</NameTxt>
      <P>Writing in <i>The Irish Times</i> this morning, the Tánaiste said, among other things, that Ireland's sustained economic growth and prosperity will depend upon establishing a culture of scientific and technological innovation, a high level of research and development and a globally competitive knowledge based economy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Bill, which underpins Science Foundation Ireland by statute, is probably one of the most significant Bills to come before this House in a long time. This agency has been operating as a sub-set of Forfás for some time. I took the opportunity of briefing myself again on the work of the agency. I read the papers given by Dr. Harris to the IMI last year and to the Bank of Ireland colloquium at another stage. He talked about his vision for research in Ireland. There is no doubt that any industrialised nation which has moved rapidly from a low-wage economy into a high-<Col N="863" />wage economy, needs a strong research base. I am around long enough in the educational sector to recall when researchers were only given the crumbs off the table when everybody else was looked after.</P>
    <P>I remember when I was chairman of the governing body of Dublin Institute of Technology that the acting director at the time, Michael O'Donnell, had to go from one company to another looking for £1,000 here, £5,000 there, for bits and pieces of research, whether for the engineering department in Bolton Street or the chemical engineering area in Kevin Street. I recall the breakthrough when Cathal Brugha Street set up its food research centre in the late 1980s. That was a time when it was impossible to persuade the Department of Education as it then was, of the worth of promoting research. We depended to a great extent on companies at what would be regarded today as the low end of the technology sector, using assembly-line work in particular. I recall listening to two people for whom I have a significant regard who were speaking separately on different occasions, Ed Walsh who was then president of the University of Limerick and Danny O'Hare who was president of DCU. They both spoke in terms of desperation about the impossibility of persuading anybody in Government at the time of the importance of investment in research. Quite frankly, it was only when the European Social Fund was found to be an important mechanism for obtaining funds for postgraduate work and latterly, postgraduate research, that we began to see any kind of progress in that area.</P>
    <P>Our industrial policy was in recent years grounded firmly in the ICT and pharmaceutical sectors. We are now reaping the rewards of that policy which was pursued by the previous and the current Government. Our colleagues in the other House raised many of the issues which we are discussing here and I read the Minister's response to them. It is important that significant amounts of money are invested into the high end of research. The Minister mentioned it in her closing speech at the end of Second Stage in the other House. She said that we must not go back to the stage of switching the tap on and off. There must be an uninterrupted policy of support for research otherwise that policy will not work. The postgraduate and postdoctorate researchers will go elsewhere &ndash; to the United States and to other parts of Europe. They will be given support through fellowships and from industry to carry on research. It is important that we continue to do the work which entices our graduates to stay here or to return if they have left, and also to encourage other non-Irish students to come and work here. We must broaden the knowledge base and ensure that research workers come to the country from abroad. That is part of the policy of Dr. Harris and his foundation.</P>
    <P>I wish to sound a note of caution. Universities are undertaking a lot of fine research in Trinity <Col N="864" />College, DCU, the University of Limerick and elsewhere. It would be folly in the extreme if we were to neglect the need for applied research in the institutes of technology sector. That is an area where there can be fine heads of research but without research assistants and technicians it is like building a table without legs. The Minister noted in her speech that turf wars can break out when money becomes available and people fail to see the big picture. It is not the first time there has been a turf war between the Department of Education and Science and the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment. It is important that sufficient resources are put into the institutes of technology to ensure that applied research is carried out.</P>
    <P>It may well be the case that if that were done, we would not see the constant demand from institutes of technology to be upgraded to university status. In a newspaper today, Professor Skilbeck's report is referred to on the question of whether Dublin Institute of Technology and WIT should be accorded university status. I am aware that this is an unpopular opinion but I firmly believe that Dublin Institute of Technology &ndash; and I am more familiar with Dublin Institute of Technology than with WIT &ndash; has a unique role to play in Irish education. It does not need to be labelled as a university in order that it can carry out high-end research and valuable teaching.</P>
    <P>I believe in the binary system of third level education. The strength of the third level sector has been a strong university sector and an equally strong non-university sector.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FinianMcGrath" hpid="Mr. F. McGrath Mr. F. McGrath">
      <NameTxt>Mr. F. McGrath</NameTxt>
      <P>What about fees?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatCarey" hpid="Mr. Carey Mr. Carey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Carey</NameTxt>
      <P>I will talk about fees in a moment if the Deputy wishes. The mistake made in the United Kingdom was when the binary system of third level education was all but abandoned. Every polytechnic became a university at a stroke of the Prime Minister, Mrs. Thatcher's, pen. There is a proliferation of some universities that simply have not achieved the level of academic excellence that is required from that sector.</P>
      <P>Our institutes of technology have a high level of academic excellence. I was a member of the National Council for Educational Awards for five or six years and I saw at first hand the work being done in those institutes. The Cork Institute of Technology drove the industrial policy in that area along with the microelectronics division of UCC. Athlone Institute of Technology has had a significant impact in its area as has the Dundalk Institute of Technology. I acknowledge that Deputy Keogh knows more about WIT than I do but I am aware of the significant advances made by WIT. Under the current and previous national development plans there has been a lot of investment in the institutes of technology sector.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Unless the opportunity for science education at primary and post-primary levels is provided, we will not have science students at third level. The new primary school curriculum places an empha<Col N="865" />sis on elementary science. There is at least one other teacher on the other side of the Chamber who, because of his rural roots, might remember that there were beakers and all sorts of other science gadgets in a cupboard in the school classroom. In the late 1950s&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan" hpid="Mr. Durkan Mr. Durkan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
      <P>No, I would not remember that far back.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatCarey" hpid="Mr. Carey Mr. Carey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Carey</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;emphasis was placed on elementary and rural science. It is a great pity that, with the evolution of the curriculum over the years, that was by and large abandoned. We moved then to environmental studies, which were fine but objectively did not add much to the body of education knowledge. It is a great pity that only in recent years has there been any pump-priming by way of grants to upgrade laboratories in post-primary schools. Unfortunately, as I said to a colleague earlier, many post-primary schools still use the same Bunsen burners we used when we were in school. That reflects our lack of investment in and support for science. The debate about the lack of students pursuing science is not unique to Ireland but it needs to be addressed.</P>
      <P>We must look at the reasons why physics and chemistry, in particular, have such a low take-up among post-primary students. One reason is the shortage of teachers specifically qualified to teach physics, chemistry and higher level mathematics. We need to think of ways to address that although I do not know if incentives for teachers would work. I was looking at programmes in the UK and US which adopt that approach and they seemed to work &ndash; an additional allowance is paid to teachers for qualifications in science subjects. I am not sure that is the way to go here but we should examine it.</P>
      <P>BITE, the Ballymun initiative for third level education is an attractive project and there is a good relationship between it and the RDS science council. Ballymun first year, junior certificate and senior cycle students receive grants of approximately &euro;1,000 per student to help them to study science; the grants are given to the school and then passed on to the students. That grant aid is supported provided the students go on to study science at third level. One swallow does not a summer make but I attended a graduation ceremony at Christmas and was impressed that 25 out of 40 graduates, more than half of whom were women, were studying science-related subjects. Whether that is a flash in the pan or can be replicated I do not know but it is worth looking at. Science in schools must be made interesting. The Young Scientists competition has done tremendous work in this area. I compliment Aer Lingus and Esat, the previous and current sponsors respectively.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The national development plan stated that the Government would support the establishment of a children's science centre and I hope that commitment stands. I visited such a centre on the west coast of America some years ago and it had <Col N="866" />an interactive children's science museum. It was packed with children of all ages engaging in experimental work which was exciting for them. It ranged from experiencing a simulated earthquake to solving murders using DNA and blood samples. There was also a virtual moon landing. We need to provide opportunities to young people to allow them to get excited about science and research.</P>
    <P>Last Friday week I met Professor Susan McKenna-Lawlor of NUI Maynooth at a function. She is an enthusiastic participant in the space technology programme. One would have to be a dreadfully sad person not to enjoy her retelling of her experiences in virtual space. If it were communicated in our schools that such activity is going on in Ireland and that we participate in such programmes, it would make science hugely attractive. The work in which Professor McKenna-Lawlor and others are involved should be better funded and broadcast more widely. Our involvement in the European space programme is limited enough but we are making a significant contribution to the programme through research.</P>
    <P>The work of innovation centres should also be promoted. I go back to my experience in the Dublin Innovation Centre associated with Dublin Institute of Technology and what happened when the Plassey Technology Park was set up in Limerick. It is history at this stage but that development and campus companies in universities and institutes of technology should form part of the body of research and apprenticeship which is available to students.</P>
    <P>Regarding the Bill, unless we are able to continue to invest significantly in high end research we will fall behind rapidly. I was looking at the list of Ireland's 100 top companies and while I did not have the chance to go through it in detail, of the top 50 I glanced at I would regard 20 as belonging to the sector we are talking about &ndash; one which would benefit greatly from resources. I refer to the communications technology, pharmaceuticals, biotechnology and food industries. We must continue to invest in order that we will remain at the leading edge. It was interesting to see some forward planning when the Taoiseach opened the WestPark development in Shannon Airport.</P>

People thought Citywest would be a series of warehouses in a <Col N="867" />field in west Dublin, conveniently placed there by the then Minister of State with responsibility for technology, who is the leader of the Labour Party. Of course that business park should have been located in the Blanchardstown area&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Carey</NameTxt>
      <P>We will rewrite that too.</P>
      <P>My point about WestPark is that it is important to plan ahead. While there is a downturn in the global economy at present, as surely as night follows day, that cycle will turn. We need to be ready to benefit from that. We played catch up for a long time in that we simply did not have the infrastructure. That is why, in many ways, I can be as critical as anybody opposite at our tardiness in promoting greater infrastructure, whether broadband or in other areas of IT. Unless we have the courage to go out on a limb and invest in high quality infrastructural services, we will be left behind. These companies will simply wind down their operations here until such time as they get an opportunity to go elsewhere.</P>
      <P>I welcome the news in today's newspapers regarding the decision by the Minister for Education and Science to invite the OECD to carry out a root and branch investigation of the Irish education system. Many of us are around long enough to remember that when Sean Lemass's Government was drawing up its policies for a new Ireland, it turned to the OECD and used the recommendations in its reports to develop a world-class education system and to lay the foundations for an enlightened industrial development policy for this country. It is now opportune for the Government to allow a serious examination to be undertaken of our education system to identify the gaps, to see how it is being delivered and whether it is targeting the correct groups.</P>
      <P>I was invited by Deputy Finian McGrath to comment on the fees issue. As I said elsewhere, I am one of those people who is in favour of the restoration of fees for high earners and those who can afford to pay them&mdash;</P>

      <P>The Bill is welcome. It is important we have an agency headed up by a person of world renown such as Dr. William Harris because credibility is important. Academic excellence is also important and this will be achieved by the enactment of the Industrial Development (Science Foundation Ireland) Bill.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FinianMcGrath" hpid="Mr. F. McGrath Mr. F. McGrath">
      <NameTxt>Mr. F. McGrath</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank you, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, for the opportunity to address the Industrial Development (Science Foundation Ireland) Bill. This debate is very appropriate and I welcome hearing the views of Members. I will, however, present a different view from that of the mainstream political parties.</P>
      <P>It is important we look at the purpose of the Bill. It provides for the establishment of a body to be known as Science Foundation Ireland which will be an agency of Forfás. The Bill also provides for the amendment of the Industrial Development Acts 1986 to 1998 and the Shannon Free Airport Development Company (Amendment) Act 1986. These amendments are merely concerned with the updating of certain grant instruments and related financial limits.</P>
      <P>If one looks closely at section 2, which contains definitions of terms used in the Bill, one will see that the new body, Science Foundation Ireland, is referred to in the Bill as &ldquo;the foundation&rdquo;. Earlier, a number of Deputies referred to Science Foundation Ireland, which is a good title, but I have a major concern with the term &ldquo;the foundation&rdquo; being used in the Bill. For many of us, foundations, particularly in the EU and America, are often associated with extreme right-wing groups. That term has negative connotations, particularly given the mood of Irish society which would have nothing in common with a lot of these foundations. It is essential when discussing this issue that we understand that the debate is about science and having a solid base for science. I would hate to think a group of private individuals could, in some way, misuse this organisation, or this term. However, I will be optimistic because I know most people feel the same way as I do, although I know there are people in the Government, particularly the Tánaiste, who have views which are similar to those of people like George Bush which would not be held by the average Irish person.</P>

    <P>Section 4 provides that expenses incurred by Ministers in the administration of this Bill shall be sanctioned by the Minister for Finance to be paid out of moneys to be provided by the Oireachtas. We have to be on our guard and be conscious of the hand of the Minister for Finance. We cannot allow a situation in which the Department of Finance could stifle growth and development in the economy, particularly in relation to <Col N="869" />science. This is something at which we will have to seriously look over the next couple of months. To develop the economy and the idea of science and research, we will have to ensure funding is provided. Sadly, I do not have confidence in the Minister for Finance at the moment. I also have major concerns about the Cabinet. We must be cautious about section 4 to ensure the moneys are provided by the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>On the broader Bill, we all accept that science is vital for the future economic development of the country and that it is the way forward. Twenty years ago science was not treated with the same respect and researchers were often dismissed as being very academic people locked away in laboratories involved in academic work. I never accepted that view, particularly in the education system. There are many new creative ideas in the primary school science curriculum. Let us not forget that, in the past, some primary school teachers were very effective in teaching children science in primary schools, long before the new or revised curriculum. I remember seeing many young children doing experiments. I pay tribute to those teachers who, 30 or 40 years ago, saw the future and had the initiative to develop these ideas.</P>
    <P>I saw this in practice recently in the north inner city school in which I taught before I was elected to the Dáil where a group of children were involved in a project making rockets and in experiments in science. The Taoiseach visited the school, Plas Mhuire boys national school in Dorset Street, on that particular day. The most interesting thing was that these young children had major literacy problems, yet all of a sudden their eyes were opened by science. It was part of the curriculum in which they shone. They were so good at building and launching their own rockets that we asked them to launch them for the Taoiseach. It was a tremendous day and I know the Taoiseach was impressed by the reaction of the pupils and by the innovation taking place in the school.</P>
    <P>In regard to the debate on science, the need for science graduates and to make this Bill a reality, we have to focus on second and third level students. Deputy Carey mentioned the question of fees. He is making a big mistake because we need to invest in education and support our students, science students in particular. We are having difficulty getting young people to do science courses and it is important that we do not put any obstacles in their way because science, as I said before, is for the future and it is the engine room of the economy.</P>
    <P>Not only should we realise the value of science but we should use it in the development of disadvantaged areas, particularly disadvantaged schools. A high percentage of our young students do not get the chance to do science in third level institutions, which we will have to face up to. Why are so many young, talented pupils from poor backgrounds not getting to third level? We have to target resources. There is no conflict of interest when one speaks about this and third level fees. <Col N="870" />We have to make the investment in pre-school, primary and secondary school projects and fund poor children. It is at this level that one begins to develop their interest in science and the future. We have also to ensure that children get an even break and get involved in projects.</P>
    <P>We have all studied the research on science and jobs in recent years. Many of the experts are now saying that we have taken our eye off the ball in terms of wealth creation and land and property. If one does not have science and planning of scientific development in the education service, one will not have trained staff and scientists to come up with new ideas for creating wealth. Land and property are no longer sufficient to create jobs; science is needed. I compliment people like David McWilliams from TV3 and <i>The Sunday Business Post,</i> who has written many provocative articles on the economy, looking to the future and looking for new ideas.</P>
    <P>We must also listen to young people, which we do not do enough. Young people come up with many wonderful scientific ideas. Recently, a constituent of mine came up with a fantastic idea relating to music. He went to all the different public bodies looking for funding and could not get it. I even raised the issue with the Minister, Deputy Harney, but nobody seemed to want to know and the doors were slammed. I do not accept this. If young people have ideas, particularly in respect of science and development, we have to listen to them, be creative and be open to their ideas.</P>
    <P>We should never lose sight of the fact that the yearly young scientist exhibition and the young scientist of the year awards serve as an example of our young talent. Every year, most parents, teachers and politicians look in awe when they see the high standard of the work of the students at the exhibition. They also look at the magnificent inventions. I pay tribute to the students' parents and teachers, particularly the teachers who do a lot of work outside school hours on some of the projects. Some of the projects are fantastic, really creative and have major jobs potential.</P>
    <P>Some months ago there was a row with the ASTI over wages but it is important that we pull back and say to those in the ASTI, the INTO and the TUI that they have done a magnificent job over the years. We need to ensure that teachers within those unions who have a special interest in our students and in science are valued. We need to protect them.</P>
    <P>There is also a downside to this legislation. We have to be conscious of the dangers of using science in a negative way. This leads to more significant moral and ethical questions. We saw the invention of nuclear power 30 or 40 years ago. We have taken a strong decision that we will not get involved with it and I am delighted to see other forms of energy being used around the country. However, the use of science in the generation of nuclear power was dangerous and we have seen it used in a negative way.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="871" />Section 7 sets out the functions of the foundation. The main function of the foundation is to promote and develop world-class research capability in strategic areas of scientific endeavour that concern economic and social benefit and long-term competitiveness. These areas include information and communications technologies and biotechnology. It is intended that the foundation will attract research teams and individual researchers of a world-class standard to carry out research in Ireland. This section is important because I like the idea of attracting world-class researchers. Before we do so, we must ensure that we use our own world-class researchers. We should welcome researchers from abroad but not lose sight of the fact that we have many talented people at home.</P>
    <P>Section 8 provides for the formation of the board of the foundation, its composition and numerical constitution &ndash; 12 members. For such an important development, is 12 members enough? I do not believe in huge committees and boards but we should consider having 15, 16 or 17 members to ensure that the board is representative and includes all strands of society, particularly the scientific strand. I hope there are representatives from organisations such as the teachers' unions. One has to ensure that there is a broad democratic flavour to the board because people will have more confidence in it.</P>
    <P>Section 10 provides for the five-year term of office of the chairperson of the board and eligibility for re-appointment. It is reasonable to have a chairperson for five years. It gives him or her time to settle in and ensures that the post will not be held for life. We will have to have constant, new, fresh ideas, particularly from scientific people. We need somebody fresh in the position of chairman.</P>
    <P>Section 11 provides for the procedures to be followed by the board in regard to chairmanship of meetings, voting and the number of members required in attendance for a quorum, which is five. This number is very low and I am concerned about this section. We need to have more people in attendance for a quorum.</P>
    <P>Section 13 provides for the appointment of a chief officer of the foundation to be known as the director general, and it outlines the term of office and the functions of the director general. It is essential that the right person be elected to this position and that he or she has vision and a top-quality scientific background. I am confident that we will not make the mistake of putting someone in the position without these capabilities.</P>
    <P>Section 15 provides for the establishment by the board of committees to assist and advise it regarding the performance of any of its functions and the rules governing such committees. Section 16 provides for the disclosure of interests by members of the board, committees of the board, staff of the foundation or any person engaged by the foundation. It is essential, when putting people on boards, that we have disclosure of <Col N="872" />interests to make sure there is no clash of interests. We need to restore the idea of ethics in politics and public life.</P>
    <P>Section 20 provides that staff seconded to the foundation from Forfás may, by order of the Minister, be transferred to and become staff of the foundation. It is healthy if people of high quality are moving around from different areas, helping, advising and coming up with new ideas.</P>
    <P>Section 21 provides the foundation with the authority to prepare a scheme or schemes of superannuation for its staff. It is essential that the staff have direct and positive consultation with the trade union movement and that they be given a decent wage to encourage people of a high standard.</P>
    <P>Section 22 provides that the foundation may engage consultants or advisers to assist it in the performance of its functions. Every time I hear the words, &ldquo;consultants or advisers&rdquo; a red light goes on in my head. I have a word of caution on this because I have seen consultants' reports which cost more money than the project. We have to look seriously at this idea. Research and professionalism are necessary but I want to focus on the question of public money. We are inclined to bring out reports, strategies and all sorts of things costing millions of euro, yet at the end of the day somebody comes up with a sensible idea and it is implemented. I question that provision in section 22.</P>
    <P>Section 23 provides that the foundation is obliged to prepare a strategy statement every five years, the first such statement to be prepared soon after the establishment day. A work programme must be prepared at the end of each year on the activities proposed for the following year. That is an example of good, sensible practice. It is necessary to plan and I like the idea of the five year plan. When I worked at an inner city school we tried a one year plan, then a five year plan to tackle literacy, children at risk and children with discipline problems. The five year plan was good but at the same time we were open to amendments and proposals. It is important that this foundation has a clear plan for the future.</P>
    <P>Section 24 provides that the foundation must submit to the Minister an annual report of its activities after the end of each financial year and specifically comment on the oriented base research being supported by the foundation. This is good practice and public service and it is common sense.</P>
    <P>I am somewhat concerned about section 26 because the language and terms here could be dangerous in the future, given recent developments, particularly by the Government. The section provides that the foundation may build, purchase or lease the relevant land and buildings required for its functions. It may also dispose of any land or premises which are surplus to its requirements. I hope this is not a door to selling off for its own sake, particularly when it comes to land that could be used properly in the interests of the public, rather than a few individuals. We <Col N="873" />have to be cautious about privatisation for its own sake, and if we have land that could be used to build houses we should not be afraid to sell it to our city councils.</P>
    <P>Sections 27 to 32 amend the provisions in the Industrial Development Act 1986 relating to employment and research grants and raises the threshold levels in respect of those grants. It also raises the threshold for equity provision, investment aids and training grants in this Act. These sections are very important, as is section 36. It amends the Industrial Development Act 1998 to allow staff members in any one of the bodies, Forfás, IDA Ireland, Enterprise Ireland, the NSAI or the foundation, to apply for vacancies in any other bodies. It is important that staff working in the sciences can rotate through different organisations.</P>
    <P>I welcome the debate and commend the contributions. Creative people working in the area of science will create wealth and jobs and ensure that we have a bright future. Let us hope that we all have the possibility of enjoying the wealth.</P>

      <P>I am glad to have an opportunity to comment on this Bill at this important time in the development of science and technology. It is useful to have the Bill and the debate focusing on these elements for a variety of reasons.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FinianMcGrath" hpid="Mr. F. McGrath Mr. F. McGrath">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with many of the remarks made by Deputy McGrath and other speakers about the need for primary and second level pupils, in particular primary, to focus on the sciences. It is important that they understand them at an early age and see them as a means whereby they can advance their interests and competence, and ultimately earn their livelihood which, like it or not, is the priority nowadays. I have some reservations about the foundation but they are not the same as Deputy McGrath's. The foundation will be successful and will serve a purpose if it is used as a crucible to bring together those with an aptitude and excellence in the sciences to concentrate on the areas that require attention at present. If it attracts people of high calibre and enables them to use their influence to spread the word throughout this jurisdiction it will raise our already high international standard and increase public awareness of this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That may be a long-winded way of approaching this Bill. In response to Deputy Carey, we lagged behind in the areas of science and technology, then in the 1990s we seemed to catch up because of decisions taken and investments made. We have slipped a bit again and I worry about our competitiveness in that area. Proposals are in hand and preparations and investments are being made to advance science and technology. However, this makes me uneasy because, for example, when mobile phone technology first arrived here everybody looked at it in awe. Then somebody decided that it was the technology of <Col N="874" />the future. People raised queries about masts and the health risks but it had the capacity to bypass the major investment in ground works previously incurred in development. It has become a significant instrument in enabling developing economies to catch up rapidly as opposed to having to wait as they did in the past.</P>
    <P>At that time we were well ahead of our neighbours in the United Kingdom in developing that technology but I am not so sure that we are ahead of them now. We should be because we have come through an era when it was possible to advance the sciences and technology because investors such as Intel and Hewlett-Packard and many others invested here and provided jobs. That investment had the effect of focusing on our competence, highlighting areas where we were capable and others where we were not. In some cases we were able to set in motion events that brought about a rapid improvement to facilitate and advance our competitiveness at an early stage.</P>
    <P>There are now clear indicators that this country is not competitive in industrial development for a variety of reasons connected with the construction, development and acquisition of sites and so on. This is a cause of serious concern and if we continue to price ourselves out of the market industries looking for a suitable location will go elsewhere. That would not be a good development from our point view and it is one we have already tried. We have advanced considerably and shown that we could develop well, efficiently and rapidly in this area. The deflation of the dot com bubble caused consternation and maybe lack of investment in this area, particularly in the past couple of years. The glitch in investment will not have an impact now but will be evident in five, seven or ten years' time.</P>
    <P>Maintaining an ongoing flow of investment into that area is critical and becoming more so as time passes. I recall a businessman saying to me about ten or 15 years ago that by now all major scientific, electronic and manufacturing investments would be in south-east Asia. I was quite surprised at the time and thought that he had inside information, which he probably did. He was wrong, but there are now indicators that it is more convenient for some industries with high technological requirements to locate in those areas. I do not agree with that for many reasons, primarily because it means that we must buy products back again.</P>
    <P>I know that a case can be made that we should not invest in the most basic technology. However, it is not a bad idea, at the same time, to advance the various stages in an area of industrial development to ensure that we have the basic core elements and the second and third stages as necessary. We must supply the investment funding to ensure that we have adequate back-up to our industry there. I am not sure if the Government is fully conscious of the present urgency regarding technological competitiveness. I do not know the answer to that. I am not sure that the <Col N="875" />foundation is the answer, but it may be, if it attracts the kinds of people suggested. If it does, it may work.</P>
    <P>The next important point, about which others have spoken, concerns the head of the foundation. The director general will be a very important person. If the foundation should transpire to be an elevated think tank for people to use as a sounding board, it will not work. If, on the other hand, the director general is successful in using the agency to drive thinking and competition and to provide encouragement, investment and advancement, it can be hugely beneficial. If it transpires, as a result, that this country can advance to international, world-class quality in that area, we will be on the right track. The University of Limerick and other universities and educational centres throughout the country have been doing that for years. If we examine that positive aspect, it can be hugely beneficial to our economy. However, people should not think that by merely throwing the foundation together, we will see a dramatic change in the whole sector and its development. It will not work that way.</P>
    <P>The membership of the board will be equally important. First, one needs people with specific qualifications and flair in the various disciplines. I have no doubt that their commitment will be huge. Their very existence, including both those within this jurisdiction and those who may visit, will give the foundation the ability to build up its reputation as a world-class centre for scientific endeavour, focusing on the importance thereof from the point of view of our competitors.</P>
    <P>I started by talking about competition. While I hate saying it, it is important that the Minister recognises this and that it be recorded as often as possible. A few years ago, this country was one of the most competitive economies in the world, but now we have changed. We did not do so without knowing it. We did not change without someone, somewhere, recognising the danger signals. Those signals existed across all types of industry. Slowly and inexorably, they have crept up like mercury indicators showing that we were moving into the danger area. Various Departments had access to those indicators at the time. It does not require a degree in rocket science to work out that, in those circumstances, with the signals warning that decisions needed to be taken immediately, those decisions were not taken. That is one of the reasons we now find ourselves in a less competitive situation than some years ago.</P>
    <P>We should be in a better position given that we had a head start. We set ourselves up very successfully in this arena as experts in the field. We have slipped, and there have been various reasons for that. I do not wish to delve too deeply into the politics of it today as there is not sufficient time. We cannot afford luxuries of that nature in future. We must ensure that there is a reaction whenever those red signals light up on the board. If we do not do that, we can have all <Col N="876" />the foundations, centres of excellence and top scientists we like. The foundation may be used for research purposes, but it may not be the catalyst for investment here that such a centre needs to be.</P>
    <P>The foundation will do a fine job, provided we keep inside clearly defined parameters and that we learn from rather than ignore the lessons of the past, as unfortunately tends to be the case in our society. The foundation will be useful for investors and employers generally. They can draw their own conclusions from it, and that too is important. All businesses and investors are very anxious to see forecasts, and they will make their own forecasts based on what they see happening in science and technology in this country when it comes to their decision on whether to invest in the economy. They will come to their conclusion based essentially on the costs and risks involved and the structure and support for the proposal &ndash; the back-up in the country in question.</P>
    <P>The foundation may be extraordinarily successful. We may become the world leaders to such an extent that we can set up a consultancy. Reference has been made to consultants already. Whatever it is, we should &ndash; and, one hopes, will &ndash; have the necessary technological and financial wherewithal to ensure that the concept is successful from the point of view of the Irish economy.</P>
    <P>Science and technology change with time. No technology has a shorter lifespan than the high-tech and information technology industry within which we all operate at present. It is almost entirely dependent on constant, ongoing research, upgrading, updating and so on. In those circumstances, we must ensure that, when setting up such a body as is proposed in this legislation, it is deeply conscious of the responsibilities placed on it and the need to be able to create the proper climate and identify industry's requirements well in advance.</P>
    <P>I was interested in some of the other contributions on the Bill. Deputy Finian McGrath raised the issue of children in inner city schools. I have always felt &ndash; it is no harm to repeat it &ndash; that every child has an aptitude in one way or another. Some may be academic and others interested in the mechanical and electrical areas or otherwise. It would be a great achievement if we could devise a system which would encourage the children of each era to develop themselves to the best of their ability and to avail of the services and facilities around them with a view to being of benefit not only to their families and communities, but to the country.</P>
    <P>Irish people have made huge contributions to science. There have been, and will continue to be, many Irish inventors. If this legislation, innocuous as it seems, works as it should, draws the kind of inspired people to it that it should and is ushered along by the Minister and his successors, it could be successful and not just another shop of excellence which does not penetrate the marketplace in the way we would like.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeHiggins" hpid="Mr. J. Higgins Mr. J. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>There are two main purposes to this Bill. On one hand, as the Long Title suggests, it is to establish a body known as Science Foundation Ireland and to designate its functions. On the other hand, it is to amend the Industrial Development Acts in regard to the amounts of grants that the State may give to various semi-State bodies and, through them, to private companies for various industrial and other developments.</P>
      <P>Very few, if any, of the contributors on the Bill dwelled on the area of grants, which is a mistake. We should use the opportunity presented by this Bill to lay down guidelines as to the criteria by which and to whom grants are awarded from here on. The State and previous Governments, particularly Fianna Fáil Governments in the 1970s and 1980s, gave massive grants, like confetti almost, to a range of enterprises, companies and multinational corporations with very little control as to what was required of such companies. Many rewarded the State by upping and leaving when it suited their purposes for one reason or another, leaving many workers in the lurch and treating workers and taxpayers with contempt. The future award of grants to private enterprises should be the subject of discussion. As this Bill significantly extends the amount of grants that can be given, this is the opportunity for that discussion.</P>
      <P>The current Fianna Fáil-Progressive Democrats Government is terminally inclined towards favouring, supporting and in all ways endorsing the multinational corporation system, and has put huge over-reliance on multinational corporations for the purpose of providing employment in the State. Therefore, we can assume that the grant increases provided for in the Bill will further facilitate the Government's inclination to support, to the cost of other possibilities, multinational corporations. There have been indications in the past six months of the dangers of this approach, with the Government essentially giving hostages to these corporations when it is clear that for rationalisation purposes and to suit their profits, they simply leave.</P>
      <P>The bringing forward of this Bill and the setting up of Science Foundation Ireland, even if many of its provisions are already in train, should be the occasion for a debate on how best taxpayers' public funding can be deployed with regard to developing industry and, in this case, scientific research and knowledge. I regret that the possibility to do that has not been availed of in the course of this debate.</P>
      <P>The other main point of the Bill is in regard to scientific research. As a socialist, I endorse scientific research&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;the quest for knowledge and the quest to understand nature, the human body, human nature, our world and our universe. However, to what end is this research undertaken? The Bill is amazingly silent on this. It is <Col N="878" />an amoral Bill in the sense that it has no regard for the ethics that should guide the scientific research that is provided for in the Bill.</P>
      <P>For example, in the past 20 years, countless billions of research dollars and pounds have gone into armaments research and the armaments industry, particularly in the United States and Europe. In other words, massive resources were put into scientific research for the purpose of designing and creating weapons that can destroy, maim and incinerate more people more efficiently and more horribly over ever greater areas of territory. That is immoral and obscene. However, it is an activity on which the Government does not have a view. With the creation of Science Foundation Ireland and the provision of grants for research, etc., will research for those multinational corporations which make up the armaments industry be possible in those circumstances and endorsed by the Government? If we are to take evidence to date, despite the fact that the vast majority of the Irish people are appalled and horrified by the obscene wastage of resources on the creation of horrific weapons of mass destruction, the Irish Government is taking an amoral, if not immoral, approach.</P>
      <P>The Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment replied to a parliamentary question recently, in this case to Deputy Michael D. Higgins, on the value of materials exported under military or dual licence in the past year for which figures are available. Incredibly, the first sentence of the reply states: &ldquo;My Department does not collect statistics on the value of actual exports of military and dual-use goods.&rdquo;  The reply goes on to give some provisional figures, which are substantial and growing, in regard to military licences that have been granted by the Government. Will this Bill accelerate that process because we have no built-in ethical standards in regard to the ending to which the funding and the research are committed?</P>
      <P>On the armaments industry and weapons of mass destruction, I do not know if the Minister of State, Deputy Fahey, can help me but I tried to get an explanation from the Taoiseach recently on the location of the weapons of mass destruction for which thousands of people were slaughtered in Iraq. The Taoiseach and the Tánaiste came into the Dáil day after day and assured us they existed and that this was the reason for the United States and Britain going to war. We now know that was a fabrication but the Taoiseach has not yet come into the Dáil to apologise. Perhaps the Minister of State might like to do it for him.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The development of research for biotechnology is explicitly mentioned in the Bill. I have major problems with that. I welcome biotechnology but the examples of the ends to which biotechnology have been utilised in certain cases in the course of the past 20 years have been extremely dangerous, with significant implications for the future of our environment. I refer particularly to the genetic engineering of seeds and crops and the large multinational chemical corporations like the for<Col N="879" />mer Monsanto, Novartis and Ciba-Geigy, which have developed the genetic manipulation of seeds for corn, for example, to resist the weed killer they have also developed. They now want to put these genetically-manipulated seed stocks into the wild with abandon. They are actually doing that, although not in Europe because it is not yet allowed. However, they are trying to get in in other countries.</P>
    <P>I would like to ask the Minister of State, or whoever will reply to the debate, if guidelines will be laid down about this type of research in the context of Science Foundation Ireland and the funding that will be given to assist technology. This particular development in biotechnology poses serious threats to the future of our ecological infrastructure by releasing unknown entities into the environment, the results of which are incalculable. These companies are buying up the seed capital of the world. They are buying up control of the seed capital in Third World countries and are enslaving poor farmers and small producers who, for centuries, have developed their own seed stock. They are now chaining them to contracts. They are then putting into the wild a new entity that they, like gods, have created in the course of a few years' research but the long-term results of which we do not know. We do not know how these seeds will react to different climatic changes, etc., and therefore food security for the world is a major consideration.

      <P>The multifarious problems posed and the dangers of genetic engineering have unnerved me; I cannot get everything straight at the one time.</P>
      <P>I am concerned that these issues are not provided for in this legislation, which is a major problem. The Minister of State is adept at facilitating multinational corporations, giving Dutch Shell our massive gas reserves off the Mayo coast and so on. Unfortunately, we cannot have any real confidence in this Government.</P>

      <P>The debate on the Bill has raised the issue of the importance of education for our society and our economy. It reminds us, if we need reminding, of the current debate on access to education and the other side of that debate, the free fees furore which has been going on for the past week or two. Yesterday, I was in a second level school in the north inner city. The school, which I will not name, is one of the best known schools in Dublin. All the children who currently attend the school are from the communities in the adjoining inner city areas. The school is doing its best to provide as high a standard of education as possible for local disadvantaged children. While attending a presentation of certificates on pathways to education in the school in question, I spoke to some of the teachers and asked them about their views on the current debate on free fees and equity.</P>
      <P>Debate adjourned.</P>
      <P>The Dáil adjourned at 4 p.m. until 2.30 p.m. on Tuesday, 27 May 2003</P>
