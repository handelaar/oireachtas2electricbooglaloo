    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 1 to 6, inclusive, together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In my reply to similar questions on 11 February 2003, I stated that the previous Government acted on most of the key recommendations which have emanated from the All Party Committee on <Col N="786" />the Constitution. In all, the previous Government brought forward nine referenda on Cabinet confidentiality, the Amsterdam treaty the British-Irish Agreement, local government, the death penalty, the International Criminal Court, the protection of human life in pregnancy and two on the Nice treaty. Unfortunately, a proposed referendum on judicial conduct did not proceed due to lack of cross-party support in the Dáil.</P>
    <P>The Government will avail of appropriate opportunities to take forward further recommendations of the all-party committee. The complexities involved in holding a referendum require that careful consideration be given to the frequency with which referenda can realistically be held and the significance of the issues in question. At this point, there are no plans to hold any referenda during 2003.</P>
    <P>I wrote to the All-Party Committee on the Constitution in February 2000, requesting it to consider the property rights aspects of the Constitution. To this end, it has invited submissions on property rights from the public and interest groups by way of advertisements in the newspapers on Friday, 11 April and Sunday, 13 April 2003. The committee is giving this matter priority and will make recommendations as soon as deliberations are completed.</P>
    <P>The Deputies will also be aware that a sub-committee of the Seanad Committee on Procedures and Privileges is considering the overall issue of reform of the Seanad. The recommendations they will make in due course may also require constitutional amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny" hpid="Mr. Kenny Mr. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Taoiseach accept that the opportunity to provide housing at an affordable price is now beyond the reach of most young couples? The recent reference to the examination by an Oireachtas committee of a report which envisages a constitutional change on the issue of compulsory purchase of land for housing is only a smokescreen which will not deal with the immediate problem. Figures in yesterday's newspapers indicated that the average cost of a house is now &euro;256,000 in Dublin and &euro;198,000 outside the capital. Does this not amount to an economic crucifixion for young couples, who are forced to borrow up to &euro;250,000 in some cases? The Government abolished the first-time buyer's grant, increased VAT charges and introduced a whole range of stealth taxes&mdash;</P>

      <P>The question relates to amendments to the Constitution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny" hpid="Mr. Kenny Mr. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand that, but what I am trying to do&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny" hpid="Mr. Kenny Mr. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a passing reference. In the absence of this report, which will not be produced <Col N="787" />until next year at the earliest, what does the Taoiseach intend to do about the constitutional right to home ownership of the thousands of young couples who are now denied that aspiration?</P>

      <P>The Deputy's question should relate to changes in the Constitution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny" hpid="Mr. Kenny Mr. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>I have said my piece.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no constitutional right to home ownership. The all-party committee is examining this issue in the context of the Constitution and I hope it comes up with some initiatives. I accept that, as the Deputy said, this will not change the current position &ndash; it is not designed to do so. The issue is also being examined in the context of Sustaining Progress. The Deputy knows the current position of house building and ownership, so I will not go into that. Almost 60,000 houses were built over the past year, which equates to a rate of 14.5 per thousand. This is double the rate of anywhere else in the EU. In the UK, excluding Northern Ireland, about 170,000 houses were built in the past year. The percentage of first-time buyers is increasing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny" hpid="Mr. Kenny Mr. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not sure whether the Taoiseach said he envisages having a constitutional referendum during the lifetime of this Government. A total of 38% of people did not vote in the last election. That means that either politics passed them by or they saw no relevance in it. This may well be because both Church and State have let down a great number of people. Arising from those statistics, do the Taoiseach and the Government have any strategy for attempting to make politics more relevant to the people who did not vote, particularly among the younger and poorer sections of society? Do they have a plan of campaign, working through the various Departments, to make people appreciate, if that is possible, that good politics and decisive and moral leadership can have a beneficial impact on their lives?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>As Deputy Kenny knows, following a case some years ago we set up the Electoral Commission, which made some changes in the way things were done by the Referendum Commission. A report was subsequently issued by the commission to the effect that in the last referendum improvements were made. It believes that the way it ran the last campaign in terms of advertising, the time allowed and other matters have been resolved and that the system is more effective.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Generally, on referenda, if issues are being grouped in referenda, one must try to select issues which stimulate public interest. During the lifetime of the previous Dáil it was difficult to stimulate the interest of people on some referenda issues. When an issue arises in which the political system is involved, whether it is for or against it <Col N="788" />or divided it is a different matter. The work of the Referendum Commission should be built on. The chairperson of the Referendum Commission in its last report set out some further issues that we should examine. As previous Governments have done in respect of all previous reports of the Referendum Commission, the Government has dealt with those and put in the effort.</P>
    <P>On the matter of trying to gain electoral support, a campaign will be run at the time of next year's elections to explain how the electronic voting system works for those who have not used it, to attract people to exercise their vote and to highlight the issues. Unfortunately, it is now necessary to build a campaign for a period in advance of an election on the issues and that will happen next year.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeHiggins" hpid="Mr. J. Higgins Mr. J. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister of State at the Department of the Environment and Local Government, Deputy Noel Ahern, spoke on Vincent Browne's RTE programme last night and on &ldquo;Morning Ireland&rdquo; this morning. He stated that &euro;100,000 of the &euro;250,000 cost of an average home in Dublin should be put down to the price of the site, the price of the land on which the home was built. Why has it taken this and the previous Government six years before the Taoiseach has come to the Dáil and promised that an all-party Oireachtas committee will look into this crisis? He was spitting fire against profiteering at the IMI conference in Killarney a few weeks ago.</P>

      <P>A question, please, Deputy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeHiggins" hpid="Mr. J. Higgins Mr. J. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>One would imagine that the profiteering horse has only just bolted. Is the Taoiseach aware that this horse has not so much bolted as has been running around rezoned fields in Dublin and other areas for five years and is completely out of control? Rather than going off now on another chase to the All-Party Committee on the Constitution, will he act on a report that is 30 years old, known as the Kenny report, which recommended at that stage controlling building land prices, the implementation of which does not need a constitutional referendum?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I have answered all these matters recently. What is happening now in the House is that in regard to the issues I stated, Members are now supporting them but saying that they thought them up. That is what is happening. If the Deputy wishes me to repeat the issues, I will do so. I have revived the property issue and the Kenny report. The Deputy will be aware that there were a number of flaws in the Kenny report and that is why it was not acted on. If the Deputy were to note some of the proposals stated in it, he would note that they would not result in increasing the supply side. Even five or six years ago, we were building about 35,000 houses a year; we are now building 60,000 houses a year. It is a demand and supply issue. It was <Col N="789" />written a long time ago by an eminent professor of economics, Professor Hansen, that where the problem is one of supply and demand and there is an excess of demand that the only way to deal with that is to deal with the supply side. That theory has not changed.</P>
      <P>There is a related issue of property and land values, and I have stated on numerous occasions what we could try to do in this area. Addressing these issues is not simple and I do not believe anyone purports to believe that it is. To increase the supply side, the Government has had to intervene in the market through the implementation of three Bacon reports and through changing the Planning and Development Act on two occasions. We have got the supply side right. What people have done down through the years is to manage to create problems in the marketplace. The first issue is that of supply.</P>
      <P>There is the related issue of land and there is the question of spatial strategy, where people live and where industry is based. This Government has dealt with most of those issues and is dealing with the other issues.  </P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle An Ceann Comhairle">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent" hpid="Mr. Sargent Mr. Sargent">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach will not be surprised to hear that people do not believe the Government has dealt or is dealing with this matter. Many feel it is unable or is not willing to deal with it. The committee has met since 1995 and has made a litany of recommendations, but there is no great history of implementing them.</P>
      <P>In regard to the price of land and the housing crisis, which is worsening for many, would the Government be prepared to implement recommendations which went beyond changes in the Constitution? So far, the comments committee members have heard are to the effect that the problem is not the Constitution but the lack of political will to take on the vested interests in the property market. Would the Taoiseach be prepared to act on recommendations in this regard, whether they involve a site value tax to deal with speculation on development land or stricter planning so that every farm does not become a potential area for development, driving up land prices, making farming unviable and denying people shelter and housing? Will the Government reflect on that and not wait for recommendations from the committee in regard to the Constitution which may not be the nub of the problem?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Sargent is correct and that is why the Government is not waiting and has progressed matters in a number of ways. We <Col N="790" />were once building fewer than 35,000 houses a year whereas now we are building 60,000.</P>

      <P>A few years ago when we clamped down on the rental market, there was an outcry in the House to the effect that it was the wrong thing&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>There was an outcry in the House that we should not affect the rental market in that way, that it was the wrong thing to do. We know that since those changes were made rents of properties have decreased dramatically in Dublin and other parts of the country.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>It can be seen in the figures that are issued every quarter.</P>
      <P>It is a question of getting the supply side right and dealing with the land aspect. I spent a great deal of time recently with the social partners in the discussions on Sustaining Progress examining the issues involved in this matter. They are not simple and I presume that is the reason successive Governments did not implement the Kenny report. With the legislation coming before us on protecting rents and in combination with the Planning and Development Act, the supply side has been moved forward.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The constitutional review group is one aspect and Deputy Sargent is correct to say that there are aspects to this that do not require constitutional amendment, especially since the debate that took place in court on Part V of the Planning and Development Act 2000. There are other issues that can be progressed, such as what land can be compulsorily purchased, where it is to be zoned, what framework plan is put in place for <Col N="791" />local authorities and so on. They are not part of this question but I will freely debate them.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent" hpid="Mr. Sargent Mr. Sargent">

All these data have been produced and Members should inform themselves of some of these issues.</P>

      <NameTxt>Caoimhghín Ó Caoláin</NameTxt>
      <P>Focusing on another area of the work of the All-Party Oireachtas Committee on the Constitution, I wish to ask the Taoiseach if he recognises that following the unilateral suspension of the Assembly elections by the British Government, people in the Six Counties have no democratic forum to which to send their representatives? What steps are being taken by the Taoiseach to pursue the recommendations of the All-Party Oireachtas Committee on the Constitution regarding access for elected MPs in the Six Counties' constituencies to the Houses of the Oireachtas? I missed the Taoiseach's initial response to the questions so may I ask whether changes envisaged in order to accommodate these important steps require constitutional change through referenda or whether, as I and others believe, such changes might not be necessary and that what is required is a decision by the Taoiseach and his Cabinet to allow for the facilitation? Will the Taoiseach recognise the importance of filling the current vacuum and allowing northern elected MPs the opportunity to have rights of attendance and rights of participation in specific debates accommodated at the earliest opportunity?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Some of these issues may ultimately require constitutional amendments but others do not. The All-Party Committee on the <Col N="792" />Constitution set out what could be done in regard to the right of audience and the right to participate in debates in this House. There was an all-party agreement on that early last year. The Government agreed to that. I have since asked party leaders for their views on the matter. The Government is in favour of the right of MEPS to attend and participate in committee debates on the EU and for Northern Ireland elected representatives to participate in debates on the Good Friday Agreement and other relevant debates. Some of those mechanisms can be put in place if there is agreement in the House.</P>
      <P>On the more long-term issue, the all-party committee raised the issue of Seanad Éireann. That will be further developed when a report is published later this year on the long-term position and that has my support. As soon as there is agreement in the House, I am prepared to move on those issues.</P>

    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>For the Taoiseach to accuse Deputy Joe Higgins and Deputy Sargent of following his lead on this matter is like accusing 100,000 people of going out on the streets following his lead on the invasion of Iraq. I do not know if the Taoiseach listened to the Minister of State at the Department of the Environment and Local Government, Deputy Noel Ahern, on the radio last night who said that the reason the Simon Community has found more people on the streets is because he has given them more money for outreach workers and that if he had not done so, they would not have found all these people on the streets.</P>
      <P>I wish to return to the question of private property. A number of months ago I asked the Taoiseach a question about private property and whether we could assert the primacy of the public good over private property in the matter of housing. The Taoiseach announced, much to the shock of Deputy Denis O'Donovan, that he had referred the matter to the all-party committee. What is the point of referring this urgent, immediate issue to an all-party committee that will take a couple of years to make a report on it? More importantly, what is the point when it is the manifestly inappropriate thing to do? I can understand the Taoiseach referring the matter of whether the Constitution ought to be reformed to a committee of the Oireachtas or of this House, but if one wants to know whether there is a constitutional impediment in the matter of the regulation of the cost of land, that is a matter for the law officer to the Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Did the Taoiseach seek the advice of the Attorney General and if he did, what is his advice? Has he any plausible explanation for referring this to a committee which will spend a couple of years waffling about it &ndash; after six years <Col N="793" />have passed, as Deputy Higgins said, which comes to a total of eight years &ndash; rather than ask for the view of the man who sits at his left-hand at the Cabinet table whose job it is to answer such questions? The Taoiseach is not serious about this matter. Does he agree that five, six or perhaps seven developers hoard all the land in this county and the surrounding counties and does he intend to have the register examined to see what steps might be taken to cause that land to come into the marketplace at the speed our people require housing as distinct from at the speed his supporter friends require development?</P>

      <P>I am sorry for upsetting Deputy Rabbitte if he thought it was his idea. On 29 February 2000 &ndash; it was not just a few weeks ago &ndash; I wrote to Deputy O'Donovan and I wrote to the then chairperson of the committee in relation to the consideration by the All-Party Committee on the Constitution of the personal and property rights aspects of the Constitution. That was more than three years ago. I will give a brief summary of the letter. I stated that there were major strategic issues arising in relation to the delivery of accelerated infrastructural projects under consideration by the Cabinet committee on infrastructural development. On 15 February the Government endorsed an integrated package of changes under the statutory approval and judicial review process in order to underpin that.

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>My reply will be very brief, a Cheann Comhairle. In the course of preparing the package of measures, a number of issues recognised under the Constitution as having a bearing on planning cases which came before the courts were identified. These were outlined in detail and at great length. Following that and in trying to move on the infrastructural issues, the Planning and Development Act was referred to the Supreme Court during that summer. The Government fought the case to make changes on the grounds of affordability for houses. The Government won its case, including the important aspect under Part V which recognised for the first time since 1937 that the State had a right to intervene in these matters and to try to deal with afford<Col N="794" />ability issues. This allowed us to move on and make further changes last year to make this work and we passed the Bill in this House.</P>
      <P>These measures have helped affordability and supply. We know from those involved in the industry that we are fairly close to maximum capacity in the construction industry. We have gone from a maximum of approximately 35,000 houses five or six years ago to 60% currently&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. B. Lenihan)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform has been informed by the Garda authorities that there are approximately 700 Garda stations in the country. No Garda station has been closed since 31 December 1997. The Garda authorities have made proposals to allow for the merging of Garda stations in three separate cases. These proposals have been approved by the Minister. The Garda authorities have also proposed the closure of two additional stations. Such proposals are under consideration.</P>
      <P>The personnel strength &ndash; all ranks &ndash; of the Garda Síochána as at 8 May 2003 is 11,783. This represents an increase of 815, or 7.4%, since 31 December 1997. The deployment of Garda personnel in individual Garda stations throughout the country is a matter for local management. As the House will be aware, the Cabinet has authorised the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to make the greatest possible use of the existing capacity of the Garda training college in Templemore over the next two years to bring the strength of the force to 12,200, its current authorised maximum strength. This will represent an all-time record level of strength.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A new Garda recruitment competition is under way. It is planned that 660 Garda trainees will be taken into the Garda college during 2003. The Commissioner has projected, based on the anticipated rate of retirement, that this level of recruitment will result in the maximum authorised strength of 12,200 being achieved during 2004. The Minister has already told the House that he will not be content with raising the strength of the Garda Síochána to an historic high of 12,200, and higher again as soon as budgetary circumstances permit the Government to make progress towards the target of 14,000 provided in the programme for Government for achievement by 2007. The Minister also intends to increase the <Col N="799" />number of Garda members available for front-line policing through a process of civilianisation as soon as circumstances permit.</P>
    <P>Effective law enforcement and the maintenance of public order is not achieved simply by increasing Garda numbers. A range of solutions and innovations across the criminal justice system as a whole must be invoked as society changes and new challenges arise. In this regard, the Minister is currently formulating proposals for Garda reform, increased accountability and improved investigative powers, to provide for a significantly enhanced modern police service. The Minister looks forward to the full co-operation of the House as he continues to address those challenges.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Additional information</i>The personnel strength of any Garda station can vary from time to time having regard to retirements, transfers and appointments. In those circumstances, the Minister understands from the Garda authorities that it would be a prohibitive task, certainly in the time available, to track the personnel strength of each individual station over the past five years. What is clear, however, is that the strength of the force has increased in that time by more than 800 gardaí, which has facilitated the making available of additional resources not only to many individual stations but to the greatly enhanced range of specialised national units which are based in Dublin but provide a nationwide service.</P>

      <P>The Minister of State's reply is nonsense which is something to which we are getting accustomed. There are plenty of unmanned stations around the country which were previously manned such as the one in Stradbally, the parish in which I grew up. There are no gardaí there now. This is utter nonsense. What does an elderly person who hears someone breaking down their back door do when the nearest garda is 20 miles away?</P>

I would like Deputy Lenihan to answer that since he is supposed to be a Minister of State at the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform. This is not just happening in urban areas, it is also happening in rural Ireland today. The rise in crime levels does not just affect urban centres, it also affects rural areas.

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Dea)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister's intentions regarding future changes in the licensing laws are as follows. In its second interim report, the Commission on Liquor Licensing advocated a codification of the entire intoxicating liquor code. The Minister intends to act on this recommendation and the necessary preparatory work is already under way in the Department.</P>
      <P>Codification will involve a consolidation of licensing provisions, which are currently spread across many statutes, into a single instrument. It will also involve reforms based on the commission's recommendations and the valuable work of the strategic task force on alcohol established by the Department of Health and Children. The intention is that the outline of the codification Bill will be available by mid-2004. The Commission made over 130 separate recommendations, the main thrust of which is directed towards a modernisation and streamlining of the licensing code and recognition of the need for compliance with and enforcement of its provisions. While many of the commission's recommendations relate to overall structural reforms that will require policy decisions, others are of a detailed and technical nature that will necessitate consultation with other Departments and State bodies such as the courts service. With the exception of a number of urgent recommendations, the commission's recommendations for legislative changes will be addressed in the context of the codification exercise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As the Deputy may be aware, following submission in December last of the commission's report on admission and service in licensed premises, the Minister announced his intention to bring forward legislative proposals to respond to the commission's urgent recommendations in relation to drunkenness and disorderly conduct on licensed premises. In the meantime, he has <Col N="802" />decided to enlarge his package of proposals to include legislative responses to certain recommendations set out in the commission's final report. He will bring the package of proposals for an intoxicating liquor Bill to Government in the coming weeks, the intention being to do so within this session.</P>

      <P>We have had four reports from the Liquor Licensing Commission, the last of which was published last month. The strategic interim report to the Department of Health and Children referred to by the Minister of State was published over 12 months ago. The Minister speaks constantly about his plans, but he has not done a single thing. He is unable to come into the House to provide us with a single proposal. Will he put a levy on the drinks industry? Will he control advertising? Will he ban children from pubs and will he raise the age limit? Will he respond to the proposal mooted yesterday at the 30th annual conference of the Vintners' Federation? The federation says the responsibility for excessive drinking lies with the consumer. Vintners think it is nothing to do with them, but they sell the alcohol. All drink sold to under age persons or those who are already intoxicated comes from an off-licence or from a licensed premises. How will the Minister respond to that? Will the Minister of State provide the House with some specifics?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>I am delighted to accommodate the Deputy. I gave very specific information in my <Col N="803" />initial reply. Emergency-type proposals will be introduced in this session and the main codification of the liquor licensing code to meet the other recommendations of the Liquor Licensing Commission will be introduced by mid-2004. There will be revised provisions in the Bill which is due before the House this session, including stronger penalties in relation to the sale and supply of intoxicating liquor to drunken persons and drunkenness on licensed premises. There will be stronger provisions in relation to the maintenance of order and prohibition of riotous behaviour and disorderly conduct on licensed premises. There will be a prohibition on promotional practices which lead to excessive consumption of intoxicating liquor on licensed premises and an extension of enforcement powers under the existing laws to uniformed gardaí. There will be wider use of temporary closure orders, closing time on Thursday nights will be brought back to 11.30 p.m. and there will be a new provision to allow local authorities pass a motion in respect of an application for an exemption, which will be taken into account by the court. There will be a prohibition on the provision of entertainment during drinking-up time and there will be an amendment to the Equal Status act to permit licensees to exercise discretion and exclude children under 15. Licensees will also be given discretion to exclude young persons of 15, 16 and 17 from licensed premises at any or all times and a new requirement will be introduced, whereby persons under the age of 24 must carry evidence of age document on licensed premises. Is that sufficient detail for the Deputy?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister of State has just presented ten specific elements, which were precisely what I sought in my question. However, he was not going to give me those details had I not asked him a supplementary question. I asked what the main provisions of the proposed legislation were and I thank the Minister of State for his reply. The Minister of State made no reference to how the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform will deal with under-age drinking in terms of the supply of drink. Recent surveys indicate that two thirds of 15 and 16 year olds are regular drinkers and half are binge drinkers. They cannot drink in this manner unless they are getting the drink from somewhere. How will the law be enforced? The gardaí in County Mayo are doing a fabulous job by enforcing the laws in relation to under-age drinking, but that is not being done anywhere else. The Minister of State has not given specific proposals as to how that will be done.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WillieODea" hpid="Mr. O'Dea Mr. O'Dea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>I have given the Deputy a number of specifics in a short space of time. These proposals will enable us to combat under-age drinking in so far as the drink is being supplied by licensed premises. I agree with the implications in the Deputy's question that licensed premises are <Col N="804" />not the only outlets that supply drink to under-age people &ndash; it is available in supermarkets and off-licences. We are introducing proposals to deal with the provision of alcohol to under-age persons in pubs, as they are commonly defined, but the question of how one deals with supermarkets and off-licences is a bigger one, which will be dealt with in the 2004 legislation.</P>

      <P>The report by Amnesty International in Ireland, entitled Mental Illness: The Neglected Quarter, was published in February, 2003. The principal areas dealt with in the report are matters for the Minister for Health and Children to consider. In that context, I refer the Deputy to detailed replies by the Minister for Health and Children to questions on 6 March and 7 and 8 May 2003.</P>
      <P>The Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform has worked and will continue to work with the Department of Health and Children in those areas of joint concern. For example, both Departments were involved in the drafting of certain aspects of the Criminal Law (Insanity) Bill 2002, which is awaiting Committee Stage in the Seanad. I also refer to the proposals in the Bill to establish an independent mental health review board, which will have as one of its main functions the regular review of the detention of persons found not guilty by reason of insanity or unfit to be tried, who have to be detained in a designated centre by order of a court. The board will also determine when such a person should be released. These provisions will ensure compliance with the European Convention on Human Rights. The Bill contains further provisions which will enable courts to refer persons, who come within the definition of criminal insanity, to designated centres as defined in the Bill, in line with a recommendation in the Henchy report of 1978.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In so far as other aspects of mutual concern to both Departments are concerned, a working group made up of representatives of the Minister's Department, the Department of Health and Children, the relevant health boards and the Irish Prison Service is exploring means of implementing the core recommendations of the 2001 report of the group set up to review the structure and organisation of prison health care services. In addition, recognising the need to tackle the underlying issue of the delays in the provision of in-patient psychiatric care to mentally ill prisoners, the Minister has made arrangements for the Irish Prison Service and the East <Col N="805" />Coast Area Health Board to draw up a service level agreement on the admission to the Central Mental Hospital of mentally ill prisoners and their treatment there. A working group charged with drawing up this agreement, which includes representatives of the Department of Health and Children, has been meeting on a regular basis since October 2002. It is expected that this matter will be finalised shortly.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CiaranCuffeGP" hpid="Mr. Cuffe Mr. Cuffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cuffe</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister of State concede that there is systematic discrimination against people with mental illness and that this is a fundamental abuse of their rights? What was the outcome of the service level agreement between the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform and the Department of Health and Children? Has there been agreement as to who is running the hospital in Dundrum? There has been no indication as to who is in charge.</P>
      <P>Neither the Criminal Law (Insanity) Bill 2002 nor the Mental Health Act 2001 lay down minimum standards for the treatment or care of people with a mental illness. There is no procedure for monitoring or ensuring that people's rights are protected. Rights cost money and if one signs up to rights, as the Government has under the international covenant on economic, social and cultural rights, one should respect them and increase the overall funding for people with mental illness. As it stands, the amount of funding for mental illness is falling steadily against overall health expenditure. The percentage being spent on those with mental illness is diminishing. What will the Minister of State do about that in the context of respecting these fundamental rights?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WillieODea" hpid="Mr. O'Dea Mr. O'Dea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>The question of the percentage of overall health spend on psychiatric illness is a matter for the Department of Health and Children. The Department of Justice, Equality and law Reform will deal with the issues that are relevant to it.</P>
      <P>It has been agreed that the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform is in charge of the Central Mental Hospital in Dundrum. We are somewhat disappointed that the service agreement is not in place already, but we expect it to be so in the next few weeks.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will be aware that as a result of the provisions of the Mental Health Act, a mental health inspector will be appointed shortly to visit each institution with people who are suffering from a mental illness at least once a year. The inspector will publish his reports which will be available to and may be debated by the Oireachtas, providing an impetus for reform.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The difficulty with the treatment of mentally ill prisoners is that main-line health care is primarily a matter for the Department of Health and Children. However, when someone is suffering from a psychiatric or other illness in the prison system, it becomes a matter for the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform. That is the model followed in other countries, but it is not entirely <Col N="806" />satisfactory. In theory, someone who requires treatment for a psychiatric illness while in the prison system can be referred to any of the regional hospitals in the various health boards or to the Central Mental Hospital in Dundrum. However, in practice, they are invariably referred to the Central Mental Hospital and a two-fold problem has arisen there, which I readily concede. First, the level of throughput means that people are waiting a long time for treatment in many cases and, second, the facilities are inadequate. The service agreement will deal with the first problem. In relation to the inadequacy of the facilities in Dundrum, a project team is looking at the physical structure of the hospital and it will send proposals to the Department of Finance shortly with recommendations as to how it can be upgraded and extended.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CiaranCuffeGP" hpid="Mr. Cuffe Mr. Cuffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cuffe</NameTxt>
      <P>Can the Minister of State not call a spade a spade, can he not admit that there are no places in Dundrum, that there is a backlog of people trying to get in and that there is no alternative in the Irish Prison Service for people with psychiatric illnesses? Padded cells, which are a Victorian measure, are still used, there are still no mental health units in the prison service, long periods of confinement are employed and there is little or no supervision.</P>

      <P>I do not know the purpose of the Deputy's supplementary question. I have conceded the issues he raised and have stated the measures that are being taken to deal with the situation. The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform has taken fundamental steps in relation to padded cells &ndash; we are getting rid of them as traditionally used &ndash; and that work is practically finished. The Minister has directed that solitary confinement in prisons will only be used where absolutely necessary and for people's own safety.</P>

Moreover, where a licence holder is convicted of such an offence, the District Court is required under the terms of the 2000 Act to make a temporary closure order in respect of the premises concerned. For a first offence the closure order shall not exceed seven days, while the <Col N="807" />closure order in respect of second and subsequent offences shall be for a period of between seven and 30 days. In addition, the court may order that the particulars of the conviction in these cases be endorsed on the licence of the premises concerned. Under Part III of the Intoxicating Liquor Act 1927, a licence carrying three such endorsements shall be forfeited and no new licence shall be granted in respect of the premises.</P>
    <P>Given the range of sanctions and penalties that I have just outlined, it is not clear that existing provisions need to be strengthened further at this stage. In this context, it is significant that the Commission on Liquor Licensing did not make any such recommendations in its final report published last month. The commission did, however, draw attention instead to the need for a more uniform approach to the enforcement of existing legislative provisions throughout the country. Moreover, it expressed unease at the existing uneven pattern of prosecutions and convictions across the country.</P>
    <P>As the Deputy will appreciate, the investigation or prosecution of alleged offences are matters for the Garda, the Director of Public Prosecutions and the courts. The Minister is, however, prepared to take any action that may be required in order to improve compliance with and enforcement of the licensing laws. In this context, he intends to include a provision extending enforcement powers to non-uniformed Garda officers, as recommended by the Commission on Liquor Licensing in the intoxicating liquor Bill that he will bring to Government in the coming weeks. The Bill will also very substantially increase penalties for both licensees and customers in cases of drunkenness on licensed premises and these provisions will apply, of course, to persons regardless of their age. The Bill will also include a number of proposals designed to assist licensees in complying with existing provisions, including a requirement that young people within a defined age group carry an evidence of age document while on licensed premises.</P>

      <P>A couple of months ago, the Minister, Deputy McDowell, said:</P>
      <P>Deputy Deasy . . .  stood up the other day and said he would prevent citizens of this State who reach the age of 18 from going for a drink. He wanted to make it illegal for them to drink until they were 20. It beggars belief that he should tell me I am out of touch with reality. He should cop himself on. People who have the right to vote have the right to go for a drink. . . .  It is a sad state of affairs that Deputy Deasy can do no better than to come up with the puerile, facile suggestion that citizens aged 18 and 19 should not be allowed have a pint in a pub.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On Friday, the Minister announced that he was planning to change the Equal Status Act 2000 to allow licence holders to introduce a policy of <Col N="808" />serving alcohol only to people over the age of 21 if they wish. I did not come here to ask questions, but to point out that the Government is nothing but a shower of hypocrites. The inconsistencies are just incredible.</P>

      <askee>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform</askee>
      <Quest>the action he has taken or intends to take on foot of the report received from the Garda Commissioner into the treatment of two persons (details supplied), arrested in Grafton Street, Dublin, in April 1998 who received an apology and undisclosed damages in a settlement announced in the High Court on 12 July 2002; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>
      <QRef>[12903/03]</QRef>
    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan" hpid="Mr. B. Lenihan Mr. B. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>As the question notes, the <Col N="810" />State settled the case taken against it by the two persons concerned, paid damages and in a statement in court expressed regret at what had happened and accepted that the persons concerned were of unblemished character.</P>
      <P>The Garda Commissioner has concluded his examination of the incident and the subsequent handling of the case and while he does not propose to initiate disciplinary proceedings, particularly taking into account the lapse of time and the retirement of certain Garda personnel, his report accepts that the subsequent handling of this incident by members of the Garda Síochána left a lot to be desired. It is of course a matter for the commissioner to initiate such proceedings &ndash; the Minister does not have the discretion to do so.</P>
      <P>Perhaps the aspect of this case &ndash; apart from the original incident, which was very serious in itself &ndash; that could most give rise to concern in people's minds is a perception of a potential conflict of interest in circumstances where a garda is involved in initiating a prosecution against a person for an assault on him or her, especially in cases in which that person has made a complaint against the garda involved. Most people would see this, no matter what the facts, as inherently unsatisfactory &ndash; I certainly do.</P>
      <P>On this point, and arising from the investigation into this case, a directive has been issued by the Assistant Commissioner in the Dublin metropolitan region requiring that in any case of alleged assault on a Garda, an independent member of at least sergeant rank should prepare the subsequent file. Supervisors will ensure that any charges are correct and adequately reflect the circumstances of the alleged assault. The completed file is to be submitted for the information and directions of the district officer, who in appropriate cases is to submit the file to the Director of Public Prosecutions. Emphasis has also been placed on the importance of dealing promptly and professionally with all correspondence involving such cases. The system outside the Dublin metropolitan region is different and already provides for independent scrutiny of proposed prosecutions, usually at superintendent level.</P>
      <P>This is a welcome procedural safeguard to ensure the appropriateness and correctness of charges in circumstances where there could otherwise be a perception of a potential conflict of interest. In addition, and in a development which should further address any such concerns, consultation is now under way between the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions and the Garda authorities in relation to procedures for prosecutions for assault on members of the force. This was a very regrettable case and many people may well consider the outcome, taking everything together, to be unsatisfactory. I hope, however, that lessons have been drawn and procedures put in place to ensure that any such case in the future is dealt with in a proper and professional manner.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>The background to this case was <Col N="811" />that two young women were ill treated, to say the least, in a wholly unwarranted fashion by gardaí. They were put into a car very roughly and imprisoned in a cell. When they took an action against the Garda for its members' behaviour, they were counter-charged with all sorts of nefarious activities, including assault and damage. This has been going on since 1998. The case against the women was dropped as it appeared in court and undisclosed damages were awarded to the two women. A belated apology was made to those young ladies, ordinary citizens to whom a great deal of damage was caused. We have been waiting for this report for some time. The Garda Commissioner was tweaking it on the last occasion I asked a question on this matter in February. We still have not received details of the report other than that the Garda Commissioner does not intend to initiate any action. Has the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform asked the Garda Commissioner, the person entitled to take action on this matter, whether he should do so? I take it from the tenor of the response and some of the remarks made by the Minister of State that it left a good deal to be desired, was inherently unsatisfactory, very regrettable, etc. It seems at the very least that the Minister should examine why that report cannot be acted on in a more efficient fashion in relation to those people, members of the Garda Síochána, who behaved in this criminal fashion.</P>
      <P>Approximately &euro;1 million is spent each year on damages of this nature which are generally settled out of court. Is it proper that taxpayers' money should be used for this purpose? Will the Minister agree to establish an ombudsman to deal with such allegations?</P>

In relation to the decision of the Garda Commissioner, the Deputy will appreciate that the matter of the initiation of disciplinary proceedings is left by legislation to a determination by the Garda Commissioner. I am not satisfied that it would be proper in those circumstances for the Minister to initiate an approach to the Garda Commissioner. It might well cause any subsequent disciplinary proceedings to be challenged in the courts for improper interference on the part of the Minister.</P>

      <P>The process of obtaining wayleave permission &ndash; from the owners of property on which it is planned to erect CCTV equipment or where cables will cross &ndash; is being pursued at present and is now almost complete.

      <P>I thank the Minister for his reply. The CCTV system for Bray is badly needed particularly in view of the upsurge in crime there in recent months. The Minister of State's ministerial colleague, Deputy Roche, made a statement in March 2001, which I am sure was made in good faith, that the system would be in operation by the end of that year, yet two years later it is still not in place.</P>
      <P>I do not dispute anything the Minister of State said in his reply. I note he referred to discussions on wayleave permission and a 20 week consultation process, with which I am familiar. Can he indicate when the system will be in operation? There is consensus that this system is needed and people want to know when it will be operation.</P>

      <P>To be helpful to Deputy Timmins, the information available to me anticipated the Deputy asking me that question.

      <P>There has been a flurry of media reports in recent days about the activities and alleged activities of a senior British agent operating within the senior level of the IRA in Northern Ireland who may have been guilty of <Col N="815" />involvement in very serious crimes including murder and other atrocities. I appreciate that this is a difficult and murky area, but if there is any substance to these claims and allegations, it suggests that British intelligence sources were engaged in highly questionable activities in Northern Ireland and that the level of collusion between security forces and loyalist paramilitaries is considerably greater than the Stevens inquiry has suggested.</P>
      <P>The Taoiseach has indicated his intention to have the matter raised with the British Government next week by the Minister for Foreign Affairs. In view of the fact that these allegations are of the most serious kind, that it is difficult to decipher what is going on, that the Taoiseach over the past six years has had at his disposal the level of intelligence available to the Army and the Garda together with briefings on Northern Ireland on a constant basis, some in respect of high level security and other matters, has it ever been brought to the attention of the Government that a situation like this might exist in view of the fact that members of the Sinn Féin army council would probably be known to the Government?</P>
      <P>Given that both Governments are in daily contact about a range of issues, will the Taoiseach contact Prime Minister Blair by telephone to raise this matter at Heads of Government level in order that we might be able to gain some knowledge or factual evidence of what is going on here? Perhaps the Taoiseach might indicate whether the Government, during his tenure of office, has ever had any evidence or indication of evidence from intelligence sources that the person referred to as &ldquo;Stakeknife&rdquo; actually existed. I ask the Taoiseach to bring this matter directly to the attention of the Prime Minister by way of a telephone call this evening or tomorrow.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>In reply to Deputy Kenny, I would say everybody is concerned about this matter. It is a situation on which we have very little factual information. We must be careful about these allegations because there are serious implications in them encompassing threats to life, the memory of loved ones and people's reputations. All allegations of collusion sharpen memories for families who have lost loved ones. In recent days, I have had many questions raised by families on this issue relating to incidents dating back a number of years.</P>
      <P>We have not had evidence in recent years about the matters concerned but, as Deputy Kenny knows from having questioned me on cases that were the subject of examination by Mr. Justice Barron, there have been many cases concerning such matters. I have no specific evidence about the individual called Stakeknife other than the confusion that exists today. I am almost afraid to say it but there appear to be two individuals with similar titles. I have no particular evidence about this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have consistently raised with the British Government the question of collusion and the <Col N="816" />actions of agents. The issue of British military intelligence operations in our jurisdiction is a serious allegation which I have also raised in the context of matters in the past. We will obviously pursue any evidence that this happened. We did so directly in the context of the Dublin and Monaghan bombings and that was the major case we followed up. We raised the latest case yesterday through the British-Irish secretariat and we will follow that up. I am not too certain that the British political system would have any more information. It is normally helpful in these matters, but we raised it yesterday and will pursue it in coming days to see if we can obtain information. At this stage it appears to be an issue of the British Army and military intelligence.</P>
    <P>The allegations are disturbing, add to a long list of accusations about the operation of the intelligence services in Northern Ireland and, in the view of the Government, raise fundamental questions about accountability and the rule of law. They also give rise to concerns about a number of murder cases, the list of which is already long and to which this allegation adds.</P>
    <P>This and previous Governments have succeeded in getting to the position where we have the Saville inquiry and the Cory inquiry which deals with a number of murder cases and which will report in the autumn. Some of Judge Cory's investigations have concluded and he has stated that he will give the report to both Governments together as required under his terms of reference. If there is any new evidence, I will deal with that.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny" hpid="Mr. Kenny Mr. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>I reiterate that, in so far as this side of the House is concerned, we will always support Government activity in terms of implementation of the Good Friday Agreement, and the Taoiseach knows that. He did not say whether he was ever informed as Taoiseach of evidence or facts as to whether this person, Stakeknife, actually existed and acted for British security intelligence within the realm of the IRA.</P>
      <P>When the Taoiseach raises this with the British Prime Minister, will he do so in the context of the lack of co-operation from British security intelligence referred to in the Stevens report and by Mr. Justice Barron who has cited on numerous occasions the lack of co-operation from British authorities in respect of the Dublin and Monaghan bombings, the 29th anniversary of which is next Saturday? Given that these are serious matters as the Taoiseach said, will he raise these murky allegations at the highest level? If it is deemed appropriate, will the Government seek the extradition of the said person in respect of a number of serious charges on this side of the Border if the Garda and the Director of Public Prosecutions recommend it?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I have never heard anything about this individual or any of the issues. I have heard many allegations about the activities of MI5, MI6 and others but I know nothing about them. Any such allegations would have related <Col N="817" />to the past, mainly the 1970s and mainly but not exclusively the Dublin and Monaghan bombings. There is the Séamus Ludlow case and others about which there have always been strong suspicions in the community and which are subject to examination by Mr. Justice Barron who it is hoped will report shortly.</P>
      <P>I know that many of the allegations that have arisen in recent years centre on the force research unit. I am aware from allegations surrounding Brian Nelson and arising from the work of the British Irish Rights Watch and the Stevens investigation that this unit has been implicated in the murder of Pat Finucane. I am aware of that but, needless to say, I cannot support it. However, I do not want to say that I am not aware of what has been said about that unit. That unit again surfaces in all this. In any of my discussions with the British Prime Minister I have never been able to nor, if I were talking to him today, would I be able to obtain information about the force research unit.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>Has the attention of the Taoiseach been drawn to a case reported in the <i>Irish Independent</i> where a District Court prosecution taken by the Department of Agriculture and Food against a County Offaly farmer, John Fleury, was thrown out by Mr. Justice Tom Fitzpatrick? The reason I raise it is because of the history of the case, the long-standing disputes covering a series of issues that have existed between the Department and Mr. Fleury and the exceptionally serious and shocking nature of the allegations made by him against departmental staff.</P>
      <P>I do not propose to name those individuals in the House at this stage or to repeat in detail the grave claims made by Mr. Fleury. I have met him and, over a few years, have heard his detailed account. I assure the Taoiseach of my conviction that these claims warrant urgent investigation. I first became involved when he asked me to intervene with a financial institution when his family home and farm were at risk because of the oppressive behaviour of the Department towards him.</P>
      <P>Essentially Mr. Fleury says that, since 1997 when he succeeded in overturning a decision halting the live cattle export trade, he has been a victim of an official campaign of harassment and interference that has culminated in groundless criminal prosecutions which involved withholding from the defence relevant evidence and, most seriously of all, the falsification of evidence, including documents, against him by officials in the Department of Agriculture and Food.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If his claims are even partially proven in future litigation, the State and relevant civil servants will be liable under civil law for large amounts of compensation to Mr. Fleury and certain individuals may also face serious criminal charges. At this stage, investigations are under way into these matters by the Garda, the Ombudsman and the Competition Authority and preliminary papers <Col N="818" />are with the Director of Public Prosecutions. I stress that it is not Mr. Fleury who is under investigation by these bodies, but a Department of State headed by one of the Taoiseach's colleagues in Government.</P>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I have listened to what Deputy Rabbitte said and am not aware of the case other than the article I saw this morning. I saw in one of the newspapers a photograph of the said gentleman which was taken following a case yesterday which he won on a technicality that the time it took to bring the case forward was too long. I was not aware of the other allegations. I would be glad to raise them with the Department. It has not given me any report other than this was a case brought against the individual for not complying with brucellosis claims, but the man won his case based on the fact that the procedure took too long. I am not aware of any of the other matters. If I understand the Deputy correctly, he is stating that the man was harassed for some period by the Department officials or inspectors. I will ask the Minister and the Department officials to examine that matter and I will inform the Deputy. I have no facts in the case, but I will be glad to do that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not expect the Taoiseach to have detailed information on this and I accept what he says. I assure the Taoiseach that the claims do not relate to any technicalities. They relate, for example, to tests for brucellosis being altered, evidence being fabricated and other similarly serious matters. If it were an isolated case it would warrant investigation but given that it is not the first concerning some officials &ndash; and I emphasise, some officials, because the gentleman himself would be full of praise for the conduct of other officials in the Department of Agriculture and Food &ndash; it warrants investigation. It is not the first case; there was Emerald Meats, Goodman and a number of cases that exposed the taxpayer to millions in compensation. While the case against him was dismissed yesterday on the grounds of a three and a half year delay in bringing the case to court, there are 160 summonses outstanding in circumstances that are reminiscent of the summons spree against Frank Shortt, although in this case, not initiated by the Garda but by the Department of Agriculture and Food. If those summonses are dismissed on similar grounds or if the Department simply decides to cut its losses and proceed no further with the matter, then we will be none the wiser as to the history of this affair and to the truth or otherwise of Mr. Fleury's allegations.</P>
      <P>I remind the Taoiseach that it has not just arrived in the public domain today; I refer him to an article by the journalist, Justine McCarthy, on 22 February 2003. I am grateful for the Taoiseach's undertaking to inquire with the Department of Agriculture and Food about the background to this case. I would be obliged if he would let me know in due course.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I will certainly do that. My only knowledge is from the case of yesterday. I know the leader of the Labour Party, Deputy Rabbitte, would not raise the issue unless he believed the individual in the case, Mr. Fleury. The Deputy is saying these matters were altered and fabricated in these cases and that is a very serious matter which I will take up. If that is true then it is a pity that the case was thrown out on a technicality because otherwise these matters would be tested and it would then have been dealt with in what is perhaps the appropriate place rather than in this House. I will be glad to ask the Minister and through the Minister, his officials, to give us a report on this case. I will undertake to reply directly to Deputy Rabbitte on the issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeHiggins" hpid="Mr. J. Higgins Mr. J. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>This week marks the end of the first year of the Taoiseach's second term in Government and almost six years since he first became Taoiseach. I ask the Taoiseach to reflect for a few moments on that past six years? This week also marks the price of a modest home in Dublin being close to &euro;250,000 whereas private rented accommodation comes at a crucifying cost for those who cannot afford the house costing &euro;250,000. The health service which Fianna Fáil grievously wounded in the 1980s' cutbacks is now under severe threat again. Wexford General Hospital is threatened with closure, refurbished wings of Blanchardstown Hospital, incredibly, may not be able to open because of shortage of funds. A most appalling cutback has taken place in respite care for carers of intellectually handicapped young people, with desperate parents forced to take their case on to the streets of Dublin.</P>
      <P>At the same time, obscene profiteering continues in land speculation. The chief executives of the major corporations are raking in more than &euro;1 million in income each year. Huge profiteering exists in the banking sector. Would it not be a fair summary of the Taoiseach's six years in office to say that his policies have sated the greed of the speculator, the rack-renter, the financier and the profiteering cabal in certain services?</P>
      <P>His policy as Taoiseach ensured a huge and continuing transfer of wealth from working people and poor people to the minority of big corporations, big finance and the big players in the building industry. I ask the Taoiseach to be very specific in his answer. Is it his intention to continue with this policy if he has another four years left? Is it credible to think that he might change course, reverse the policy-driven shift of transfers from those who produce most of the wealth who are ordinary working people, to the wealthy minority and thereby find the resources to restore the services that are under so much threat and to stop the profiteering and the suffering it is causing for ordinary working people and young people, in particular, needing a home?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I will deal first with the areas where I agree with the Deputy before dealing with that with which I disagree. Wherever there <Col N="820" />is any unreasonable profiteering within the system and wherever people are taking what they should not be able to take, I will continue to operate such policy measures as the Government has done in the past through the Bacon reports, the two Planning and Development Acts and Part V of the Act which deals with the integration of social housing and whatever other measures are required to make the system fairer and at the same time increase supply of houses so that people can obtain a home. Compared to the past, enormous resources are now being given to address the issue of homelessness and voluntary and social housing issues.</P>
      <P>I disagree with the Deputy on the other issues he raised. What any Government must do is create the economic circumstances whereby the ordinary people referred to by the Deputy and whom he and I represent, are given the opportunity to have a job, a quality of life and the dignity of work. In a few years and not all within my period of office, we have seen 600,000 additional people in employment and the expansion of home ownership. We have seen a move away from the policies that discourage inward investment. There is a fair tax regime for both corporate and personal tax so that can generate the wealth and resources needed to put into services. In the past decade and in the past six years we have been able to make enormous increases in public expenditure and to help in the areas of health, education, social welfare and other areas. This is due to the mix of policies which are not directed on any basis that is unfair. I assure the Deputy that we will continue to attempt to address the outstanding issues.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeHiggins" hpid="Mr. J. Higgins Mr. J. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I represent ordinary people and I do not believe the Taoiseach really does because his Government has implemented a policy of very specifically enriching a minority at the expense of ordinary people. Many people will find it quite amazing that after six years we now have the Taoiseach tilting at the windmills that many of us have been pointing to for the past six years, the profiteering by those cabals who are making life so difficult for ordinary people.</P>
      <P>Given that the Minister may have another four years &ndash; perhaps the term of the Government will end long before then &ndash; he could make decisions which would have a significant impact on services and the lives of ordinary people from the lower to the greater end of the scale. He could even powder his own nose and redirect the resources that go into that into areas of social necessity.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeHiggins" hpid="Mr. J. Higgins Mr. J. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>This could include the millions being spent on jets. Could the &euro;1 billion which is being given back to the corporate sector in tax breaks this year be redirected to the health services, respite care and other crucial areas of need? This would be a real help to those who <Col N="821" />are struggling in a society which the Taoiseach is responsible for having created in the past six years?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I remind the Deputy that we spend &euro;38 billion in this country and, thankfully, we do not borrow too much. The money is generated from what Deputy Higgins refers to as the corporate sector who generate the wealth that allows us to provide the services. A country does not generate wealth on its own without the services. Even though the Deputy has spent many years involved in the fringes of public life, he still does not understand the basic economic fact that most people in the socialist world have long understood.</P>
      <P>We will continue to sustain policies that generate the opportunity for people to work and to have sufficient money so that they can live a life with dignity and respect. We must generate the resources to provide substantial increases in services so that those who cannot work, including the aged, young people or people with difficulties, can have dignity and a quality of life. That is what we must continue to do and it is what we have been doing remarkably well in recent years.</P>

      <P>I answered this question at length last week and briefly today. Both Bills were put back last year. An enormous amount of consultation has taken place over the last year. It is the view of those who are authorities on this issue that the education for persons with disabilities Bill should be brought forward and passed first. There are many overlapping areas and many of the changes that have been made to the draft Bill of last year demonstrate that.</P>
      <P>The work has not stopped on preparation of the disabilities Bill but the view is that the other Bill should be passed first. In many areas that will provide a framework for the ongoing work that is taking place on the disabilities Bill. It has not been put back to the long-term. As soon as the education for persons with disabilities Bill is dealt with, which we hope will be in this session, we will bring forward the other Bill. However, there are many overlapping areas. The points have been made by all the groups who took part in the consultations in the past five months on this issue.</P>

    <Title>Opticians (Amendment) Bill 2002  [  Seanad ]  : Second Stage.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan" hpid="Mr. B. Lenihan Mr. B. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children (Mr. B. Lenihan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>This Bill seeks to modernise the Opticians Act 1956, as there have been no substantive amendments to it since its provisions came into force in 1959. There is now a pressing need to bring the current legislation up to date with the modern practice of optometry while advancing the interests of the consumer and ensuring that effective precautions are taken to safeguard public health. I hope it will therefore receive the full support of the House.</P>
      <P>It is important that we remind ourselves of the context of the regulation of the practice of optometry in Ireland. The primary purpose of the 1956 Act was to protect the public by a number of legal mechanisms. Those qualified to practise or those who, at the Bill's introduction, were deemed to be experienced enough to practise, now had to be registered. There was a commitment to fostering continual improvement in the education and training of entrants to the professions. A set of rules was devised under the Act to control the activities of registered opticians and sanctions were put in place to enable the Opticians Board to discipline those persons who breached the provisions of the Act or the rules of the board as approved by the Minister for Health.</P>
      <P>The development of legislation to regulate the practice of optometry was given impetus by the creation of the National Health Service in the United Kingdom in the 1940s. When the NHS was established, central professional committees were set up simultaneously to assess the applications of those who wished to be approved as service providers under the new system. In the case of the profession of optometry, some of those who applied had no formal training or qualification. They were therefore deemed by the central professional committees to have inadequate competence to act either as ophthalmic opticians or dispensing opticians in the United Kingdom. Consequently, an influx of persons who claimed to be ophthalmic opticians and who had been excluded from the National Health Service arrived in Ireland, where there were no barriers to their activities at that time. As evidence of those matters built up, the then Minister for Health and his officials accepted the need for legislation to ensure adequate standards of training and education for those entering the professions and controls on their activities and behaviour. The Opticians Bill was subsequently introduced in July 1955 and passed in 1956. Following the appointment of the first Opticians Board and the approval of the Minister for Health of the rules made under the Act, the provisions came into force in 1959.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I will examine the Bill's main provisions in detail. First, the title &ldquo;optometrist&rdquo; will be used in place of &ldquo;ophthalmic optician&rdquo;. There is no issue of principle involved in the change of title. The amendment's purpose is to give a legislative <Col N="834" /><Col N="835" />basis to the use of the more modern title of &ldquo;optometrist&rdquo;. During the Bill's passage through the Seanad, there was some confusion as to use of the titles &ldquo;optician&rdquo;, &ldquo;ophthalmic optician&rdquo; and &ldquo;optometrist&rdquo;. I would like to clarify that the term &ldquo;optometrist&rdquo; will replace any occurrence of the title &ldquo;ophthalmic optician&rdquo; or &ldquo;registered ophthalmic optician&rdquo; in the principal Act, while the term &ldquo;optician&rdquo; or &ldquo;registered optician&rdquo; will remain unchanged.</P>
    <P>Sections 24, 25, 33 and 34 of the principal Act will be amended to provide that being of good character and not having been declared bankrupt are requirements for the registration of optometrists and dispensing opticians trained within and outside the EU. In addition, not having been prohibited or suspended from practice because of conviction for a criminal offence or serious misconduct in connection with the carrying out of professional duties will also be a requirement for registration for both professions.</P>
    <P>Sections 24, 25, 33 and 34 are also being adjusted to provide for the registration of optometrists and dispensing opticians in different categories &ndash; those trained in the EU and those trained outside the EU. Those provisions will correlate with the terms of the EU directives on the mutual recognition of professional education and training, which were transposed into Irish law by SI 1 of 1991 and SI 135 of 1996.</P>
    <P>One of the Bill's main provisions will be to deregulate the sale of ready-made reading glasses and provide for their wider and cheaper distribution. Under current legislation, only a registered medical practitioner or a registered optician may prescribe and/or dispense spectacles. In 1993, the Opticians Board adopted rules under which a registered optician could sell spectacles without prescription where the spectacles are intended to correct, remedy or relieve the condition known as presbyopia.</P>
    <P>The Office of the Attorney General had previously advised that legislation to deregulate the sale of ready-made reading glasses was urgently required to avoid a potential liability in damages, should proceedings be instigated by the European Commission &ndash; as was proposed &ndash; and prove successful. My Department was subsequently advised, through the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, that the Commission had decided to close the case. It is assumed that the Commission took that decision on the basis of our proposal to deregulate. However, under the current legislation, the potential for action to be taken by private citizens in the Irish courts remains. A case was heard by the High Court in December 2002 and a judgment is awaited.</P>
    <P>With regard to the Bill, the specific details of how the sale of ready-made reading glasses will be deregulated are as follows. While section 49(1) of the principal Act, which regulates the sale of spectacles, will remain unchanged, its provisions will no longer apply to the sale of ready-made <Col N="836" />reading spectacles by unregistered persons. The Bill redefines &ldquo;spectacles&rdquo; to exclude ready readers, afocal sunglasses and afocal goggles and defines &ldquo;ready-made reading glasses&rdquo; separately. The separation of ready readers from the definition of &ldquo;spectacles&rdquo; in the Act has the effect of excluding them from the provisions of section 49(1). Contact lenses, with or without focal power, are included in the definition of &ldquo;spectacles&rdquo; and their sale will remain regulated.</P>
    <P>Originally it was proposed that the sale of ready-made reading glasses should be subject to an age restriction and accompanied by the stipulation that clients must be advised that ready readers are not a substitute for normal eye examinations. However, after consultation and detailed consideration, it was decided that the above proposals would not be included because: it was realised there would be practical difficulties with enforcement among sellers not registered with the Opticians Board; the stipulations are not enforced in other EU jurisdictions; imposing a labelling requirement would place an unfair burden on the industry; and, while worthy, the proposals are not medically necessary.</P>
    <P>The liberalisation of the sale of ready-made glasses already applies in the majority of member states of the European Union and should find favour with the general public. I note that the recent report carried out by Indecon International Economic Consultants for the Competition Authority welcomed my Department's proposals and stated that deregulation would lead to an improvement in competition and consumer welfare.</P>
    <P>Since 1993, the Opticians Board has expressed concern over the lack of disciplinary powers to deal with allegations of professional misconduct or unfitness to practise against registered opticians. The current legislation provides two categories of fines reflecting the fact that certain offences under the Act are more serious than others. The amounts payable in the two categories are derisory by modern standards: for first offences fines are £20 and £10, and for second and subsequent offences the fines are £100 and £50, respectively.</P>
    <P>It is proposed to provide for fines which range between &euro;500 and &euro;3,000. That will enable the board to apply reasonable discipline in an effort to ensure that those registered under the Act, as well as those commercial interests which may employ them, are obliged to behave in a manner which will contribute to the protection of the public by ensuring proper standards of practice and behaviour.</P>
    <P>The amendments to section 48(1) concern the administration of drugs. Section 48(1)(<i>b</i>) of the current legislation places an absolute prohibition on the prescription and administration of drugs by a registered optometrist who is not also a registered medical practitioner. However, in modern optometry practice it is not possible to conduct a proper examination of the eye without dilation of the pupil, which requires the use of <Col N="837" />mydriatic drugs. One effect of such drugs is to freeze the accommodation of the eye, that is, to reduce the eye's ability to change focus. In practice, optometrists are interpreting the 1956 Act to mean that the use of such drugs is lawful, since the principal Act refers to the administration of drugs whose purpose is to paralyse the accommodation of the eye. Optometrists contend that paralysing the eye is not the purpose but the effect of their professional activities, an application, perhaps, of the old moral principle of direct and indirect effect.</P>
    <P>It is now proposed to remove the absolute prohibition on administering drugs. Rather than permitting unrestricted access to drugs, the following additional changes are being made in conjunction with the deletion of subsections 48(1)(<i>a</i>) and (<i>b</i>) to allow optometrists to carry out their professional function while stopping short of facilitating their medical treatment of an injury or disease of the eye. Article 14 of the Medicinal Products (Prescription and Control of Supply) Regulations 1996 will be amended simultaneously with the Bill's enactment to ensure that opticians will have limited access to just three diagnostic drugs. The drugs in question are for topical application only, and they cannot be injected or taken orally. Optometrists will not have the authority to prescribe or supply those drugs. In other words, they will not be for resale and they may not be given to the patient. The regulations will also stipulate that optometrists may only use those drugs in the course of their professional practice.</P>
    <P>Optometrists will therefore be unable to carry out therapeutic treatment, as they will not be permitted access to therapeutic drugs. Control of the use of certain medicines by opticians will be put clearly within the remit of the Minister for Health and Children and will safeguard against future use of potentially dangerous drugs.</P>
    <P>Furthermore, in the revised section 48(1)(<i>c</i>), there will be a continued prohibition on diagnosing diseases. It is proposed to introduce an amendment to that subsection which will state that, if an optometrist suspects the presence of a condition or a disease which requires medical attention, he or she will be obliged to inform the patient and recommend that the patient consult a registered medical practitioner.</P>
    <P>I would like to emphasise that there is now a statutory obligation to refer under current legislation. The new requirement for the referral of patients to medical practitioners where injury or disease is suspected will be indicative of best practice.</P>
    <P>The question of striking a balance has not been easy to resolve, and there have been extensive consultations with the opticians board and the College of Ophthalmologists. At a meeting with the college in February, the President outlined the difficulties which many ophthalmologists had with the use of the word &ldquo;treatment &ldquo; which was originally in section 12(<i>b</i>)(4) of the Bill. I subsequently gave an undertaking to have my Department re-examine this area. Having exam<Col N="838" />ined the subsection in question and having consulted with the Office of the Chief Parliamentary Counsel to the Government, I proposed an amendment on Committee Stage of the Bill in the Seanad to delete the words &ldquo;or treatment of the eye&rdquo; from section 12(<i>b</i>)(4), which was accepted.</P>
    <P>The decision to proceed with the provisions allowing optometrists to use certain drugs in the course of their professional practice was influenced in part by the fact that the UK General Optical Council permits the use of drugs by optometrists for diagnostic purposes and is proposing to extend their provisions to allow optometrists to use drugs for therapeutic purposes also. The UK College of Ophthalmologists has accepted the General Optical Council's decision on diagnostic drugs.</P>
    <P>This Bill is intended to open up competition in terms of the deregulation of the sale of ready-made reading glasses, but it also has a strong element of health and safety built into it, which is indicative of best practice. I have recognised from the start that unanimity on the issue of the use of drugs by optometrists would be very difficult to secure. There are those who would wish to see a more restrictive approach and those who would wish to see a more liberal approach. However, I hope that the Department's previous concessions will enable a level of compromise, if not consensus, to be reached. I am pleased to introduce this short Bill in the Dáil. I commend it to the House and look forward to hearing the views of Deputies.</P>

It seems rather surreal to be discussing it in the context of other more pressing issues &ndash; health cutbacks, hospital strikes, the ending of the disabled person's grant, cutbacks in all areas of community care. Nevertheless, I realise this legislation has been promised for a very long time and I welcome the opportunity to speak to it. It amends the Opticians Act 1956 and is an attempt to update legislation in the area. Without question, there have been significant changes and advances in the whole field of optometry since the 1950s. It is only right that our legislation should adapt to accommodate these changes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The explanatory memorandum talks about modernising the legislation. In some areas the Bill modernises the law. However, in other areas it constitutes a welcome return to old practice. The change in the name to &ldquo;optometrist&rdquo;&ndash; the Minister has given a history of the reason &ndash; is something optometrists very much favour. In some sense this can be seen as formalising a name that is already in use to some extent. I hope that finally deciding that this is what they will be called will end confusion rather than cause further confusion as it becomes the standard title <Col N="839" />for practitioners, because for many people an optician is an optician and they will not change their minds, for some time anyway, merely because we say it is something else.</P>
    <P>I welcome the changes to sections 24, 25, 33 and 34 of the principal Act to ensure that registered optometrists, trained both within and outside the EU, are people of good character and have not been declared bankrupt or prohibited or suspended from practising because of a conviction for a criminal offence or serious misconduct in connection with the carrying out of their professional duties. These changes are a very welcome safeguard for consumers and will ensure that they receive the best professional service. That is an essential requirement in any health related service.</P>
    <P>The Act is also amended to allow for the registration of opticians trained both inside and outside the EU. That is also a positive development in line with our commitments under EU directives which were transposed into Irish law. It is a positive development which will open up the field further to professionals from outside the State and from outside the EU.</P>
    <P>The financial penalties have also been updated. In the context of the financial penalties which will be used as a disciplinary measure by the opticians board, should we not change the name of the board as well as those to whom it applies? These monetary penalties will give greater clout to the opticians board to tackle anybody accused of professional misconduct or unfitness to practice. This is welcome and will give the board the opportunity to safeguard the good name of the profession and guarantee the public the best service. The fines that were in place were laughable &ndash; £12 to £20 for a first offence and £50 to £100 for second and subsequent offences. These would have no impact whatsoever. The new fines, spanning from &euro;500 to &euro;3,000, will be something of a financial deterrent, will give greater protection to the consumer and ensure that the best possible standard of practice is upheld in the professional-patient relationship.</P>
    <P>The main focus of the Bill, and the reason the Bill is before us, is to deregulate the sale of ready-made reading glasses which, I am happy to tell the House, I am wearing, having purchased them across the counter outside this State. It is long over due and very welcome. My only concern is that the definition of spectacles in the Bill to exclude ready-made reading spectacles, afocal sunglasses and afocal goggles does not mention ready-made reading spectacles which are also sunglasses. I do not know if, by implication, they are included. Perhaps the Minister will let me know before Committee Stage because if they are not I would like to deal with it by way of amendment. It is a small matter, but there is no point in leaving it out. If the intention is to include ready-made reading spectacles which are also sunglasses, I want to ensure, by naming them separ<Col N="840" />ately, that they can be excluded from the definition of spectacles.</P>
    <P>The Bill also provides for modernisation of the legislation relating to optometry by clarifying that contact lenses are included in the definition of spectacles. That is very welcome. I do not know whether it is possible to do so here, but in other countries it is possible to buy contact lenses for cosmetic purpose to change the colour of the eyes. That is definitely something that must be done by way of prescription. It is not a safe practice and I welcome that it is not deregulated.</P>
    <P>Some aspects of the Bill have a modernising effect, but the return to the ready-made reading glasses is a return to older practice. I am old enough to remember when ready readers were available. I recall that for people from the provinces an essential part of every trip to Dublin was a trip to Woolworth's to buy ready readers for a very small amount of money. We have seen the full circle in this matter and today's development is welcome. From the consumer's perspective the deregulation of the sale of ready-made reading glasses will allow for greater accessibility to them as well as making them cheaper. When almost every other aspect of the health service is becoming more expensive for people, there is at least one area where we can say something will become cheaper, and we have the EU to thank for that. The reason the Bill is before the House is that the EU threatened the Irish Government for not deregulating many years ago. It only withdrew the threat of taking legal action against the State when the Government agreed to introduce legislation. There was a great deal of delay with the result that a private citizen took a case. While it has been slow in coming it is welcome even at this late stage. I hope this will be the end of cases against the State in this area.</P>
    <P>Public health concerns have been expressed on the issue of making ready readers more accessible to the public without the necessity of going to an optician or ophthalmologist and that this might result in people assuming they do not need to do regular eye tests as they get older. I appreciate that concern and there is a real danger that people will avoid having eye tests. Representations were made to the Minister to require the sellers of such glasses to carry a health warning saying that a person should attend for an eye test. The Minister has come out against that suggestion on the basis that it would be an unfair burden on the industry and also that it would be difficult to implement. I am inclined to agree with the case made by the Minister of State. It would be difficult to implement and would probably be unfair because there is a need for the test irrespective of whether one uses ready readers. Although it is age related the test is not the reason for getting the reading glasses. However, the two are not necessarily connected. There is a genuine concern here and the Minister should deal with it, as part of a health campaign, by drawing public attention to the need for regular eye tests, particularly after a certain age. That should be done either through <Col N="841" />the health boards or the health promotion units. Ongoing campaigns are part of health promotion and disease prevention. It would be unfair to impose that burden on one aspect of the industry as it would reach only the portion of the population who need glasses, not necessarily everybody who is at risk.</P>
    <P>While the main purpose of the Bill is to deregulate, the Minister of State said one area of the Bill which is very controversial has to do with the removal of the absolute prohibition on the use of drugs by optometrists. The optometrists association has sought this change to the Act to allow them the use of diagnostic drugs to examine patients who present for primary care assessment. It made the point that national contracts with the Department of Social and Family Affairs and health boards require optometrists to carry out certain tests to determine the patient's need for vision care. It points out also that, in the course of their four year degree course, optometrists receive both academic and practical training in pharmacology and in the use of drugs. In short it considers that the use of those drugs are essential to enable them to successfully and professionally carry out their work. While there is nothing in the Bill which describes these drugs, I understand the Minister has stated that amendments to the regulation will allow for the use of three specific drugs for the purpose of examining the eye.</P>
    <P>The ophthalmologist body and individual ophthalmologists have made strenuous representations to the Minister and me. Certainly they saw this as the thin edge of the wedge in permitting practitioners, other than medical doctors, the right to diagnose and prescribe for medical conditions. It may be that they misunderstood and assumed the right to prescribe was being given rather than merely the right to procure for use for the purpose of an examination. Whatever the reason, certainly they felt very strongly about it. The letter which the Minister received from his ophthalmologist representative on the opticians board states:</P>
    <P>In the event of the proposed changes in the Act proceeding I would find it impossible to continue to act as your representative on the opticians board.</P>
    <P>By any standards this is heavy stuff and I am sure this threat was not made lightly. It is a difficult call for a non-profession to make. I am conscious of the need to safeguard public health and I am also conscious of the need to ensure the public has easy access to services at minimum cost. I am also aware that health professionals &ndash; this is true of all professionals &ndash; zealously and jealously guard functions which they see as their own special preserve, simply because it has traditionally been so. I do not feel I am qualified to make this call. However, the Minister is obliged to make the call and I presume he has taken the best medical advice available. He has also stated that he has been particularly influenced by the UK model which permits the use of certain drugs to <Col N="842" />optometrists in the course of their professional practice and that this is supported by the UK college. While the Irish College of Ophthalmologists is affiliated to the UK college, it does not favour their use.</P>
    <P>I note what the Minister said that as a result of an amendment in the Seanad he deleted the words &ldquo;or treatment of the eye&rdquo; from section 12(<i>b</i>). It is not clear whether that is acceptable to the ophthalmologists. Certainly from what I have heard they are not happy and their complaint still stands. However, it may be that they genuinely misunderstand the intent of the Bill. I would welcome a communication from the Minister on that issue before Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>The other part of section 12 is bizarre. I assume it is sop to ophthalmologists or somebody who considers their feathers have been ruffled. On the one hand it states:</P>
    <P>A registered optician who is not a registered medical practitioner shall not suggest by any written or oral statement or by any action that the registered optician has made or is capable of making a medical diagnosis.</P>
    <P>On the other hand he is required, and now required by law, as stated in paragraph (<i>b</i>):</P>
    <P>Where in the course of an eye examination, a registered optician. . . suspects the presence of a disease or condition of the eye, the registered optician shall inform the patient of this and recommend that the patient consult with a registered medical practitioner.</P>
    <P>On the one hand there is a paragraph suggesting an optician is totally incapable of making such a judgment but on the other hand if he makes that judgment he is to take action immediately. In making it a legal requirement it places a legal onus on an optician. I have no doubt a registered optician would do that in any event. We are probably unnecessarily exposing them to litigation by making it a legal requirement, particularly when we have already adjudged in this same legislation that they are not capable of making that judgment.</P>
    <P>Subject to the points I have made, and I would welcome feedback before Committee Stage, I welcome and support the Bill. I welcome the deregulatory nature of it, which is long overdue. I welcome also the provision to monitor and control the activities of ophthalmologists, that is control by the board of its own members. I welcome the Bill and support the Minister's efforts in this regard.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LizMcManus" hpid="Ms McManus Ms McManus">
      <NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>
      <P>I understood this was minor legislation but when I saw two Ministers sitting in I began to get worried and thought I had missed something. Clearly, it is a minor Bill. It updates existing legislation that has remained as constituted since the mid 1950s. Its main relevance for the public is the deregulation and sale of over the counter glasses for every day use. It is a good development and I welcome it. It brings Ireland <Col N="843" />into line with other countries and facilitates the easy purchase and availability of what have now become basic items.</P>
      <P>My only quibble concerns the question of labelling. Like Deputy Olivia Mitchell, I believe that advising people on the need for eye tests should be included in the package of deregulation. It is the kind of public health information that should be disseminated and neither the Department nor any public health unit should be made responsible for it. It would be much better if those buying these items over the counter are advised of the need for eye tests by way of a simple labelling procedure. I am surprised it cannot be done. It is not easy to get the message across by using public health channels because much of the information disseminated in this way reaches the anxious healthy rather than those who need to receive it. We must widen the means of disseminating health promotion information. In this regard, this Bill is an opportunity missed, which is regrettable.</P>
      <P>Opticians have sought changes for some time, including updating the fines for breaches of the legislation and clarifying the process involved in the sale of spectacles. The current penalties are hopelessly inadequate.</P>
      <P>However, the general scheme relating to optical examinations works very well. I have a busy constituency office, yet I cannot recall anybody making a complaint about the optical service. There are huge numbers of complaints about the dental service, hearing aids for the elderly &ndash; some elderly are denied the chance to hear by way of hearing aid for weeks and even months &ndash; and artificial limbs. I even received a complaint from a cancer sufferer regarding his inability to get a wig. Many of these services, covering items that could make major differences to the quality of life of claimants, have not functioned at the point of access. Often supplies are inadequate or the bureaucratic arrangements are too penal, with the result that those requiring an item or a service are often unable to access them. By contrast, I have never heard of a complaint from those who need to wear glasses.</P>
      <P>The Minister should clarify the points raised by the College of Ophthalmologists and the Association of Optometrists, especially with regard to their concerns about the types of drugs the Bill will allow optometrists to use while examining patients. There may be a turf war element to these concerns, but they need to be addressed. I received a letter from a practising optometrist dealing with the drugs that will be allowed for use. It states:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>They have some very serious adverse reactions. They also should be used with special care on the elderly and especially on children. Caution should be taken with their use in certain conditions, such as cardiovascular, respiratory, genital, urinary and other conditions. They also must be used with caution in the presence of other drugs with which they can react. How can a medically unqualified person, <Col N="844" />such as an optician, be expected to use these drugs safely?</P>
    <P>The letter then asks various questions about opticians, including their knowledge and expertise in administering these drugs. It goes on to state:</P>
    <P>These are complex drugs and that is why the Irish Medicines Board has classified them as 'prescription only'. I think the Minister will leave himself and his Department open to further recrimination if he presses forward with these changes.</P>
    <P>I support the current scheme, which was extended in 1999 and which has worked well. Medical card holders and some PRSI workers are entitled to free eye examinations and they also have an element of choice in terms of who they attend. It gives power to the patient to choose where they will receive care, which is satisfactory. In many areas, especially with regard to the public hospital service, public patients have no choice, especially those who are stuck on hospital waiting lists. They have no power to accelerate access to care and are often frightened to complain on the basis that if they do so they will be penalised and lose out in terms of getting treatment. It is very distressing for patients when they attempt to access care. We should, therefore, acknowledge those schemes that work well.</P>
    <P>I understand this scheme has the lowest number of complaints in the Department of Social and Family Affairs, which is laudatory. The scheme requires that service providers do not discriminate, which is also very important. There are no waiting lists, from which the Minister could do well to learn. There is talk of all kinds of reform in the pipeline.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms O. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government is having difficulties bringing them ashore.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LizMcManus" hpid="Ms McManus Ms McManus">
      <NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>
      <P>We await them with bated breath. In this instance there is a fundamental issue about choice and access from which we can learn.</P>
      <P>The question of providing sufficient training to optometrists to administer and use these drugs safely is important. For example, what will be their role in the case of emergency? What happens if they are unaware of a patient's medical history or the medication they had taken? The Minister should advise on these and other safety procedures. Our concern here is with controlled drugs, in the sense that they are regulated by the IMB. It indicates that they cannot be used lightly. I am sure that is not the intention.</P>
      <P>I expected that index linking of penalties would have been included when the Bill went through the Seanad. While it rightly provides for a major increase in the penalties, there is no provision to deal with the effects of inflation, which is currently running at an annualised rate of 4.3%. Will the penalties have to be increased to keep them in line with inflation? Surely it is much better to include an index linking provision in the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="845" />The Bill will ensure better access and provision for the public and better standards in terms of regulation of the professionals providing the service. That can only be to the good. There also appears to be a good transfer of information between optometrists, general practitioners and consultants. It is an indicator and a confirmation that the optometrist is part of primary care provision and should be seen as such in the same way as is a pharmacist. It is important we understand that primary care is about the provision of various services and supports which are sometimes in grave shortage. When I think of the inability of medical card patients to access speech therapy for their children, I am quite disturbed. It is deeply disturbing that children are growing up without being able to develop language to attend school and avail of education. A system in which people can access care when their eyesight is faulty is to be commended.</P>
    <P>I ask for clarification of various points which have been made, but I welcome this Bill generally.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaudgeConnolly" hpid="Mr. Connolly Mr. Connolly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connolly</NameTxt>
      <P>The general thrust of the majority of this Bill's provisions is to be welcomed as they bring deregulation and order to the Opticians Act 1956. The Bill rationalises optical treatment by designating ophthalmic opticians as optometrists as is the case in the United States of America. The deregulation of ready readers, including ready-made spectacles, afocal sunglasses, goggles and contact lenses, is another welcome and common sense development. It will ensure that these items are more widely and freely available which is consistent with EU practice. The Association of Optometrists of Ireland, while welcoming this development, does not consider the use of such aids to be a substitute for a full and thorough eye examination. These products should not be used for protracted periods.</P>
      <P>The removal of the prohibition on the prescription and administration of drugs by optometrists is also overdue. They have practical experience of pharmacology as part of their training and they will now have an opportunity to put that training to practical use. Section 41C provides that optometrists will be able to inform patients of underlying medical symptoms or conditions which require medical attention. They will be able to recommend that a patient consults his or her general practitioner.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Bill seeks to achieve best practice in the general area of optical care and nowhere is this more vital than in the case of children. Educational research has determined that 80% of everything a child learns is acquired through his or her visual system. The ocular channel is, therefore, extremely important in the acquisition of knowledge and merits top quality care during the early, formative years at school. It has been estimated that 16% of all children suffer from inadequate visual skills and up to 94% of such children have reading problems which were <Col N="846" />previously attributed to special educational needs but are now recognised as being caused by reduced visual skills. Many such children with gifted ability could only read with limited fluency with the result that their self-esteem wavered. Many children and adults were told that their condition was untreatable and that they would have to learn to live with binocular vision.</P>
    <P>Fortunately, there is a treatment available, particularly in the United States of America, which has enabled many of the individuals affected to develop normal vision and binocular depth perception. This treatment is called vision therapy, vision training or optomic vision therapy. It can also be described as physical therapy for the visual system which includes the brain and eyes. Through a series of progressive therapeutic procedures, or eye exercises, patients develop or recover normal visual skills. Vision therapy has transformed the lives of countless children with visual defects and is an outgrowth of orthoptics, which literally means &ldquo;the straightening of the eyes&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>This Bill will permit opticians and optometrists to practise in a more professional and effective manner. It achieves an appropriate balance in the vitally important area of optical treatment. I welcome and support the legislation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnGormley" hpid="Mr. Gormley Mr. Gormley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gormley</NameTxt>
      <P>This legislation is long overdue according to people I have spoken to, many of whom are opticians. They see it as a tidying up exercise. I welcome the Bill though I have a number of questions to put arising from my direct experience as a sufferer from myopia. Over the years, I have experienced different types of optical aids going back to the old days of very thick glasses. I used hard contact lenses, gas permeable contact lenses as they were known, soft lenses, daily lenses and even monthly lenses. Huge strides have been made to assist people who are short sighted. Only recently, I purchased swimming goggles which are fantastic. Anyone who is short sighted will tell one that it can be a nightmare to be without glasses even in a swimming pool as it can be impossible to recognise someone just a few feet away.</P>
      <P>From my experience I am aware that when contact lenses were introduced people used them who should not have. They suffered as a consequence which was obvious from their red eyes and inflammation. I thought at the time that their opticians should have told them that they could not wear contact lenses, but many were being sold and people insisted on wearing them for vanity reasons etc. We talk about safety and penalties, the substantial increase in which I welcome, though they should be index linked. I would be very interested to know how many cases have been brought for misconduct and I ask the Minister to supply the information. What sort of misconduct is addressed? If improper advice is given about the type of lens which should be worn or whether lenses should be worn at all, is that misconduct?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="847" />There have been tremendous advances in laser treatment which we see being advertised more and more. Is this treatment being carried out by ophthalmic technicians, or optometrists as we now call them? Does the person carrying out the treatment have to have a medical background? I did not see that touched on in the speech of the Minister of State, which I read. It is important that we know since drugs are administered in the course of laser treatment. After the procedure takes place those drugs have to be taken orally.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gormley</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not. There may be opticians who are qualified, such as ophthalmologists. This area needs to be addressed in the legislation and I ask the Minister of State and his civil servants to examine the matter.</P>
      <P>I do not know if the Minister of State has looked at the Irish version of the Bill's Title, but the board was originally called Bord na Radharcmhastóirí. Does the Minister of State have the Irish versions of &ldquo;optometrist&rdquo; and &ldquo;ophthalmic optician&rdquo;? There is an overlap and the Irish may not be specific.</P>
      <P>As a consumer I have a statement to make on costs. The frames one purchases from opticians' shops can vary in price and some, particularly the more fashionable ones, are extremely expensive. However, the exact same frames are sold for much less on the Internet from the US and elsewhere. Again, this is a case of rip-off Ireland and it seems a little bit of a cartel is operating. While we are talking about deregulation, perhaps we should deregulate frames too so that anyone can sell them. Why does it have to be a specific group of people who are overcharging?</P>
      <P>The Government always expounds the merits of deregulation, how it is consumer friendly and how the consumer benefits. If that is the case, let us have real deregulation, whereby one can buy frames, although not lenses, in Dunnes Stores. Will the Minister of State consider such a measure? Overall, I welcome the Bill and the advances that have been made.</P>
      <P>I attended a fascinating lecture on genetics and evolution which explained the survival of the gene for short-sightedness by the fact that we are no longer hunter-gatherers. If we were, short-sighted men would not get a mate because we would not be good providers. Therefore, I thank God for the advances we have made. I look forward to the Minister of State's replies.</P>

      <P>He certainly does not have foresight.</P>
      <P>I welcome this Bill which is timely and necessary as it reforms and updates optometry legislation in the State. The 1956 Opticians Act regulated the practice of optometry as well as the education, training and qualifications of ophthalmic opticians. Much has changed since the provisions of the Act came into force in 1959 and the profession itself has expanded greatly, as has scientific knowledge and technical expertise. As a user of these services, I welcome such advances. I will not comment on Deputy Gormley's remarks at the end of his contribution &ndash; the least said about that, the better.</P>
      <P>The range of products available is much wider but there is a need for better choice, as Deputy Gormley pointed out and, where appropriate, the freer competition which many Deputies favour. This must be understood in the context of the protection of public health and safety. We cannot have a free-for-all situation. Rather, protections, guidelines and regulations must be built in.</P>
      <P>Apart from substituting the new title &ldquo;optometrist&rdquo; for the current term &ldquo;ophthalmic optician&rdquo; and providing for adjustments in registration of optometrists and dispensing opticians, the Bill's two main provisions concern ready-made reading glasses and the administration of drugs by optometrists. The deregulation of the sale of ready-made reading glasses is, by and large, a welcome development.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In his Second Stage speech in the Seanad, the Minister for Health and Children pointed out that it was originally proposed that the sale of ready-made reading glasses should be subject to an age restriction and accompanied by the stipulation that ready-readers are not a substitute for normal eye examinations. The Minister said that it was decided, after detailed consultation and consideration by a wide range of opinion, not to include these stipulations. Can the Minister of State elaborate on who was consulted and how wide a range of consideration was given? I am alarmed by the <Col N="849" />reason given by the Minister, which was that it was not current practice within the European Union. When did we lose our sense of introducing and spearheading best practice ourselves? What problem is there in the two critical areas of age restriction and, more particularly, the importance of emphasising the fact that ready-made reading glasses are not a substitute for normal eye-examinations? Surely that wise and good advice should have been incorporated and may yet be. We should advocate, encourage and provide for best practice in this regard.</P>
    <P>I dispute and find it difficult to understand the Minister's contention that a labelling requirement would &ldquo;place an unfair burden on the industry&rdquo;. This is a profitable industry, in which manufacturers spend millions of euro on advertising their products annually and provide a growing budgetary allocation for this. The proposal to advise people that ready-readers are not a substitute for normal eye examinations is reasonable and good advice and is by no means a restrictive requirement on the manufacturers and those involved in this industry. It would be useful to provide this advice to the public.</P>
    <P>There is always a danger that people could take short cuts with their health and we are all probably at fault in this regard at some point in our lives. Some of us take risks with our health, yet are quick to offer advice to others. However, where fees for optometrists and the costs of prescription glasses are high, there is always a danger that people might not seek regular and necessary check-ups. I am overdue a check-up, so I make this point from personal experience and practice as it is something I need to address.</P>
    <P>As in other areas, many people who are not covered by the general medical services scheme will fall into the income gap between those who qualify for the GMS scheme and those for whom the costs of regular examination and prescription glasses are not prohibitive. That gap takes in quite a number of people in our communities and I urge the Minister of State to reconsider this matter. I have no difficulty with the provision that removes some of the restrictions on the administration of drugs by optometrists. Optometrists will now have limited access to three diagnostic drugs. This seems both sensible and necessary for the practice of their profession. However, I note that in Senator Henry's contribution to the Seanad debate on this issue she raised a number of concerns about this provision. It would be useful if in the Minister's closing remarks he addressed some of these concerns regarding the removal of restrictions on the administration of drugs by optometrists. Perhaps the Minister already intends to do this, but it is important that we have additional information.</P>
    <P>A report published earlier this year by the consulting firm Indecon stated, regarding optometry, that as in other professions, including medicine and dentistry, certain restrictive practices had led to a poorer service for the public. There are restrictions, for example, on the numbers <Col N="850" />entering the profession, which does not allow for free competition. This is also the case in other areas &ndash; indeed, my colleague Deputy Connolly and I have referred to the restrictive practices of the consultant representative organisations of various faculties, colleges and institutes in recent years. We must recognise that the lack of accountability in optometry is similar to that of the all-powerful hospital consultants. I welcome the Minister to the debate: this is something that he and the Minister of State, Deputy Lenihan, and their colleagues will have to grapple with at some point &ndash; the powerful position of the representative bodies in the area of medicine, particularly in dentistry and obstetrics, whose key and primary interest is their profession rather than the service they provide and the needs of service users.</P>
    <P>The report recommended that the Opticians' Board should have a patient representative, as indeed should apply to Comhairle na nOspidéal, which I am sure the Minister is dealing with. Was it considered, in drafting this legislation, to provide for the presence of a patient representative on the board? It is not contained in the Bill. Would the Minister now accept an amendment to allow for the inclusion of a patient representative on the board? In all these areas we need service user representation. This board is no different to any other in the whole raft of health service provision. I urge favourable consideration of such a proposal. I ask the Minister to consider the various points I have raised and I look forward to his response.</P>

      <P>I welcome the opportunity of speaking on this important Bill. The Bill amends the Opticians Act 1956, which has been in existence for more than 45 years. There are five main aspects of the legislation. Firstly, it deregulates the sale of what are commonly known as ready readers. This will provide for their wider and cheaper distribution. Under current legislation, only a registered medical practitioner or a registered optician may prescribe or dispense spectacles. The Opticians' Board in 1993 adopted rules under which a registered optician could sell spectacles without prescription where they were intended to deal with the condition known as presbyopia. This section of the Bill is necessary under EU legislation. The redefinition of the word &ldquo;spectacles&rdquo; under this Bill will exclude ready readers, afocal sunglasses and afocal goggles. This will mean that members of the general public will be able to buy glasses to correct presbyopia across the counter, as is the case in most EU member states. This is a most worthwhile development and I warmly welcome it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The retitling of ophthalmic opticians as optometrists and the registration of optometrists is also in line with EU regulations. The registration of the profession is to be welcomed. Obviously, registration carries responsibilities, so the monetary penalties for professional misconduct need to be updated and brought into line with modern <Col N="851" />expenses. The section dealing with this reflects modern values. This will enable the board to apply reasonable discipline to ensure that those registered under the Act are obliged to behave in a manner which will contribute to the protection of the public by ensuring proper standards of practice and behaviour.</P>
    <P>When this Bill was debated in the Seanad, it emerged that there had been considerable discussion between the Minister and the College of Ophthalmologists in relation to the use of certain drugs in the examination of the eye. The Minister has engaged in widespread discussions with all interested parties and has taken on board many of the fears and worries expressed to him by those bodies. It is important to state that the use of drugs by optometrists in the treatment of eye disease is still prohibited under this Bill. Optometrists are unable to carry out diagnosis or treatment of eye disease as they will not be permitted access to therapeutic drugs. In addition, there will be a continued prohibition on diagnosing disease. A provision is included whereby an optometrist, where he or she suspects the presence of a disease that requires medical attention as a result of his or her examination of the eye, will be obliged to inform the patient of this and recommend that the patient consult a registered medical practitioner. This is indicative of best practice as it is in line with provisions in other countries such as the UK.</P>
    <P>There is not unanimity among ophthalmologists in relation to the use of drugs by optometrists in the examination of the eye. Some ophthalmologists to whom I have spoken did not see a problem, but the official line from the College of Ophthalmologists, in extensive representations to the Minister, was that it had problems in this regard. To achieve unanimity on this issue would be very difficult, but the Minister has obtained a good level of compromise, taking into account the best interests of the patient, who is after all the most important person in the health service.</P>
    <P>The use of drugs by optometrists to examine the eye so that a patient can benefit is good practice. Modern practice is such that the dilation of the pupil is necessary to obtain a view of the fundus. The use of certain drugs, such as cyclopentolate hydrochloride or oxybuprocaine hydrochloride, is very important in the performance of this function. Their use in the context of the Bill will be of major help to optometrists in the performance of their jobs. I am not saying that these drugs are trivial, but their use in the restricted situation of examination of the eye will be of great benefit to the patient. It is important to remember that optometrists do have a knowledge of pharmacology and the professional knowledge they possess can be utilised in the examination of a patient's eyes.</P>
    <P>This Bill places a statutory obligation on optometrists when they detect a problem to immediately inform the patient that he or she should seek further medical advice. This Bill <Col N="852" />brings in extra protections for the patient in the form of these statutory obligations on optometrists. I warmly commend the Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanNeville" hpid="Mr. Neville Mr. Neville">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Neville</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this Bill which is long overdue. Prior to the introduction of the principal Act there was deregulation, but the area was over deregulated at that time. However, matters have moved on during the past 50 years. There is a need for deregulation of the sale of what are known as ready readers. Such deregulation should ensure there is more competition and that people will be able to purchase reading glasses at a cheap price. One can purchase a pair of ready readers for between &euro;5 to &euro;8. I bought a pair for approximately £5 at a show some three years ago. They were being sold here at that time, although I was not aware that there was a need for deregulation to allow for the sale of them.</P>
      <P>An interesting point was raised by the previous speaker concerning the deregulation of the sale of frames. In this context, can one purchase the lenses only and use one's own frames? In my experience the frames are one of the most expensive elements in the purchase of glasses. One can be charged quite heavily for frames. I am sure the Minister of State has some information on that.</P>
      <P>I welcome the re-examination and updating of fines under the legislation. What was value for money 50 years ago is not anything like the value for money there is today. A £10 or £20 fine in the 1950s when probably the average weekly income was between £5 and £7 contrasts to the way inflation has increased. Therefore, it is necessary to update the level of fines. The level of fines rendered the sanctions useless and, therefore, the principal Act useless in that sense.</P>
      <P>Having regard to the preclusion of the treatment of any disease of the eye under the existing legislation, the provision that minor procedures can be dealt with such as the removing of dust from an eye is welcome.</P>
      <P>I am aware the Minister is anxious to move the Bill quickly through the House. I do not want to delay its passage nor do I want to repeat what previous speakers said. I welcome the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JerryCowleyIND" hpid="Dr. Cowley Dr. Cowley">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Cowley</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pleased to welcome this Bill. It is good, however, I would insert one caveat and I ask the Minister of State to accept an amendment in this regard. One can buy these glasses already made up in a shop in England or other EU countries as previous speakers said. One simply finds the glasses that suits one and buys them. However, such glasses should carry a health warning in the same way as a packet of cigarettes carries one. I am not saying that wearing a pair of these glasses would be as dangerous as smoking a packet of cigarettes. However, it could be if one put on a pair of these glasses and ended up in the ditch. This is quite a serious issue. The vision one has from wearing a set of these glasses is one's view on the world. It is important that this system works.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="853" />The Bill is good and I understand what it covers. However, because a measure is right for the rest of Europe does not mean it is right for us. People pay a good deal of money to purchase spectacles. There needs to be a qualification on the deregulation of the purchase of these glasses. A health warning should be given on the purchase of them to the effect that they are only a substitute pair of glasses but no substitute for a proper examination by a qualified eye specialist and that one should be suitably attired with spectacles with lenses that best suit the condition of one's eyes.</P>
    <P>These glasses are intended for the treatment of presbyopia. We all get to that stage and I am at that stage now. I never thought I would be. I always had great sight, but I now wear glasses. I cannot see a stem without them. If I were on my way to Dublin and discovered I had left my glasses at home, I could buy a substitute pair in a pharmacy.</P>
    <P>Everybody's eyes are different. Therefore, the glasses that are suitable for one person may not be suitable for somebody else. It is simple to purchase a pair of custom made spectacles, but they will not do the job they should. The sight in my two eyes is different. My eye defect through getting older and my lenses getting harder and less pliable means that I cannot adjust them or contract them as much as a younger person. It is part of my mortality and my getting older. The manifestation of that is that I have to wear glasses.</P>
    <P>One's left hand is different from one's right hand and one right eye is different from one's left eye. Therefore, one's lenses are also different. These glasses are made to a set strength of lens, but I guarantee the Cheann Comhairle that one of his eyes would have a different lens requirement from the other if he suffered from presbyopia or an older person's vision problem and that ready made glasses are not the answer.</P>
    <P>The sale of these glasses should have a health warning to the effect that one should seek a professional eye examination at an early stage. There is an opinion that one can buy these glasses in a pharmacy and that they will be a substitute pair of glasses, but they are not a substitute for a proper eye examination. It is in the interests of everybody to know that.</P>
    <P>Regulation such as this is good if it is in the public interest. There are many others areas in which we could have regulation as regards the operation of many non-medical practitioners. There have been sad cases as a result of people practising without regulation even in my own area. I hope there will be the same interest in regulating unqualified practitioners as there is in regulating the sale of spectacles or whether one can buy them in a shop without a prescription. This measure is welcome, but such regulation must be extended across the board.</P>
    <P>This is a short Bill. Many Members have not had too much to say on it. It is an important measure but there needs to be an amendment to it to the effect that such glasses are no substitute <Col N="854" />for a full eye examination. I welcome the Bill with that caveat and I will table an amendment to that effect.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FinianMcGrath" hpid="Mr. F. McGrath Mr. F. McGrath">
      <NameTxt>Mr. F. McGrath</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad of the opportunity of addressing the Bill, the object of which is to amend the Opticians Act 1956 to deregulate the sale of ready readers. I strongly support the views of Deputy Cowley in the debate. When discussing the issue of opticians and ensuring consumer rights and the rights of people, especially those with eyesight problems, it is essential that we do not forget that thousands in the State are visually impaired. It is up to us as a State and society to provide the resources and services at the best cost to these people.</P>
      <P>It is important where children with a visual impairment are concerned that we do not accept that they must travel outside their area to avail of services. I refer specifically to young children who are visually impaired and must travel more than 100 km from their homes, families and friends to avail of services that will improve their quality of life. I do not accept that because it is unfair.</P>
      <P>When the disability legislation is presented to the House and the debate on it commences, we must take into account the thousands of children, young people and adults with a visual impairment who have a right to services and resources. It is unacceptable that they must travel away from their homes and families to avail of these services. We have seen examples of good practice in other countries and we should examine them because they show the way forward. When discussing this legislation we should never lose sight of the fact that there are people who need these services and should have them as a matter of right.</P>
      <P>The Bill is progressive legislation. I am concerned that, if we are to involve ourselves in the area of deregulation, we remain conscious that professionalism must be retained in caring for people's health and eyesight in this case. We must have professionals and people we can trust. A situation cannot be allowed to develop where people are not treated properly and with respect. We must highlight this issue in the context of the legislation and ensure people are properly cared for.</P>
      <P>I welcome section 2 which amends the definition of spectacles to exclude ready made reading spectacles and afocal sunglasses and goggles and clarifies that contact lenses, with or without focal power, are included in the definition. Sections 3 and 4 provide for opticians to be retitled optometrists.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The legislation does not involve staffing or financial implications, which is worthwhile. It is important when dealing with finances that we remain conscious of the sections of legislation that refer to financial or staffing implications. There is an ongoing debate on the spending of public money. When targeting resources and funding, we must ensure that people, the con<Col N="855" />sumers, especially the visually impaired, receive the maximum benefit. I welcome the legislation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children (Mr. B. Lenihan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate the broad and substantial welcome the House extended on Second Stage to this legislation which allows for the liberalisation of the market in respect of certain items and the modernisation of the law governing the operation of this profession. There was broad agreement on those two points.</P>
      <P>Reservations and detailed points were made which would be better considered on Committee Stage, but I hope to address to the best of my capacity the different issues raised in the course of the debate. I am conscious of my lack of knowledge. I noted the vast majority of speakers had to use spectacles, something I have never had to use.</P>

      <P>Perhaps, but I have been blessed so far. I thought of blind Milton when I listened to Deputy Gormley speak about his difficulties.</P>
      <P>Deputy Olivia Mitchell inquired about section 2(<i>b</i>) and the definition of &ldquo;spectacles&rdquo;. This states that the definition does not include afocal sunglasses or similar articles. That clarifies the point the Deputy raised.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="OliviaMitchell" hpid="Ms O. Mitchell Ms O. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Ms O. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>I referred to sunglasses that were also ready readers. I will clarify it at a later stage.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is clear enough from that subsection but it can be teased out on Committee Stage.</P>
      <P>One of the issues raised in the debate was the use of drugs by the profession. The compromise at which the Minister has arrived is that certain drugs can be used for diagnostic but not prescriptive purposes. My impression from what Deputy Mitchell said was that this did not go far enough whereas Deputy McManus was concerned it would go too far. There was some divergence in the opinion expressed on that.</P>
      <P>I was asked by Deputy McManus to clarify the issues regarding the use of drugs by optometrists. The Irish Medicines Board wrote to the Department concerning the proposed amendments to the Medicinal Products (Prescription and Control of Supply) Regulations. These amendments will permit registered optometrists to use three specified drugs &ndash; cyclopentolate, oxybuprocaine hydrochloride and tropicamide &ndash; in the course of their professional practice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Concerns were expressed at a recent meeting of the IMB's advisory committee on human medicines regarding the training and ability of optometrists to be aware of the possible complications, the specific indications for use and to manage <Col N="856" />complications should they arise. The IMB has confirmed that it is within its remit to ensure that any prescriber or patient has appropriate information regarding the specific indications and side-effects of the drugs in question and that this information could be made available to optometrists in the usual manner.</P>
    <P>All optometrists in the course of their four year honours degree course receive both academic and practical training in pharmacology and the use of drugs in the eye. The possession of diagnostic drugs in a practice does not mean they must or should be used on every patient. Clinical judgment must determine their use. This is in line with best practice and similar to the situation that has pertained in the United Kingdom for many years.</P>

      <P>The outline of the qualifications and training of optometrists is not from the board. The last sentence is the view of the Department on the training of optometrists.</P>
      <P>Deputy McManus extended a broad welcome to the legislation. I have dealt with the core issue which was raised, namely, the balance struck by the legislation at this stage between diagnosis and prescription. We are not introducing the principle of prescription for the profession in this legislation.</P>
      <P>Deputies Connolly and Gormley welcomed the legislation in broad terms. Deputy Gormley raised a number of specific questions and, if Members bear with me, I will address them. He asked how many conduct cases have been brought before the professional regulation body. I do not have the statistics to hand but, if the Deputy wishes to obtain the information, it will be made available to him on Committee Stage.</P>
      <P>Regarding the Irish title of the board, níl a fhios agam faoi sin ach b'fhéidir go mbeimid in ann an cheist seo a réiteach ar Chéim an Choiste.</P>
      <P>Laser treatment is a medical treatment carried out in a hospital-based setting under the care of an ophthalmologist who is a registered medical practitioner. That is the regulation system that applies to that treatment.</P>
      <P>The Deputy raised the issue of free competition. This is a liberalising measure and, as was pointed out by many speakers, balances have to be struck between professional regulation and liberalisation. That issue was also raised by Deputy Ó Caoláin.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Many speakers, including Deputies Ó Caoláin and Cowley, raised the labelling requirements and the extent to which a warning should be given. Deputy McManus also raised this issue in <Col N="857" />her contribution. Judging from the sense of the contributions that issue will be revisited on Committee Stage. The reason the Minister made his conclusion on this issue was the question of practical difficulties and the fact that other European Union jurisdictions did not have this requirement which would place an unfair burden on the industry. Deputy Ó Caoláin asked who was consulted about this question. The Opticians Board and the Association of Optometrists were consulted and the General Optical Council in the United Kingdom was also consulted. There were consultations with those bodies before a final decision was made by the Minister. It is a final decision which is subject to the views and deliberations of a committee of this House and from the tenor of the debate I have no doubt the question will be revisited.</P>
    <P>Dr. Devins outlined the scientific basis of the compromise arrived at by the Minister on the question of diagnosis and prescribing. I cannot assist Deputy Neville in relation to frames. At present a member of the public goes to a dispensing optician to purchase frames. They cannot prescribe the lenses or even carry out the eye tests. It is unclear to me whether that makes any difference to the price and it is an issue that can be revisited.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnGormley" hpid="Mr. Gormley Mr. Gormley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gormley</NameTxt>
      <P>It certainly does make a difference and that is the point I was trying to make as well. If we are going to have deregulation, why not sell the frames and the opticians can look after the strength of the lenses? The frames could be purchased at a much cheaper price at normal outlets.</P>
    </Speaker>

    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy McManus and other speakers raised the issue of the fines and whether we have to freeze the fines in the Bill. The Opticians Board requested that provision be made for the periodic updating of fines by ministerial order. The Department had originally intended to include such a provision in the Bill. The advice from the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel is that increasing fines for offences is a matter for primary legislation. The Government has included in its legislative programme a Bill to provide for the updating and indexation of fines and related matters. The legal advice received is that a fine cannot be varied by the use of a statutory instru<Col N="858" />ment: separate primary legislation must be enacted to provide for the indexation of fines generally in all legislation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LizMcManus" hpid="Ms McManus Ms McManus">

      <P>I will raise that issue with the Department to see if we can accommodate the Deputy on Committee Stage. There is a stated intention in the programme for Government arising on foot of the Law Reform Commission report to provide in a general sense for the indexation of fines because it is a problem in legislation generally. There is apparently a constitutional objection to our enabling the Minister to vary the level of fine so it would require primary legislation. A specific provision could, if appropriately drafted, be considered in this legislation.</P>

      <P>The Indecon report was mentioned by Deputy Ó Caoláin. Areas of concern identified by Indecon include entry restrictions in the form of limited number of training places, controls on advertising, restrictions on the sale of ready-made spectacles or other visual aids and the composition and membership of the Opticians Board. The Indecon report is an interim stage of the Competition Authority's study of the professions. As the Deputy is aware, the authority will provide reports on individual professions in the following order: engineers, architects, dentists, optometrists, veterinary surgeons, medical practitioners, solicitors and barristers. I note that barristers are last on the list.</P>

      <P>I have no interest there now. The authority plans to finalise reports on each of the professions during 2004. In each case it will publish draft reports for public comment before finalisation. On conclusion of the overall study, the authority may seek changes to existing practices and make recommendations for regulatory reform.</P>
      <P>We are proceeding with the deregulation of the sale of ready readers in accordance with our Community law obligations. The other areas of concern referred to by Indecon will need to be examined by the Competition Authority in its reports before the Department can come to a final conclusion on them. I think I have dealt with most of the questions raised during the debate. I thank Deputies for their attention.</P>

      <P>This Fine Gael Private Members' motion is the only opportunity afforded to the Members of this Dáil to contribute to a debate on the national spatial strategy, decentralisation of Government Departments and other related matters. It provides an opportunity to test how the Government intends to implement the policies already announced and how it has reneged on its commitments since it took office one year ago and over the longer period of its previous five years in Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A number of basic factual points need to be addressed at the outset. The 2002 census of population shows that there are 3,917,336 persons living in Ireland now, compared to 3,626,087 in 1996. This is an 8% increase in six years. While the census report shows that the population in Dublin increased at a lower rate than the national average, there was an explosion in the commuter belt serving Dublin. The Lucan-Esker area trebled its population and there was a 61.9% increase in the population of the Blanchardstown-Blakestown area. Castleknock, Swords, Tallaght, Glencullen and Firhouse village experienced dramatic population increases in that six years. However, there was a 20% or more increase in population since 1996 in counties <Col N="861" />Kildare and Meath. Westmeath's population increased by 13.8% and Wexford's by 11.7% while the populations of Laois, Louth and Carlow also increased substantially, reflecting a widening of the Dublin commuter belt beyond Meath, Kildare and Wicklow.</P>
    <P>It is now estimated that more than 2.2 million people reside in what could be described as the Dublin commuter belt on the east coast. However, the 2002 census shows that the population decreased in several district electoral divisions of the Glenamaddy rural area of County Galway. Ballinakill lost 14% of its population between 1996 and 2002 while in the same area, Kiltullagh lost 6.2%, Templetogher lost 14% and Shankill lost 7.9%. These figures clearly show a huge imbalance of population. Even if there were a static national population base over the next six years, the normal growth dynamic of a population of that size would ensure a continual steady rise in population on the east coast. For all other regions, with the possible exception of Galway city, no such dynamic is at work. Unless sensible, workable, well researched strategies are put in place, therefore, there will be an even bigger widening of the gap in the population structure in six years' time.</P>
    <P>It is interesting to note that while all counties experienced inward migration between 1996 and 2002 it was again the counties of Meath, Kildare, Westmeath, Wexford and Laois that showed the biggest increases. In other words, these are the real growth areas for population increases and no doubt such huge increases in population contribute to the chaos that is Dublin city traffic. Ireland is regarded as one of the most centralised countries in Europe with no country with a similar population having so great a population residing in such a concentrated area. Can anything be done to slow down the population increase on the east coast and, at the same time, breathe new life and vitality into the regions, irrespective of how far away they are from Dublin?</P>
    <P>The feeble efforts of Fianna Fáil over the past 20 years have certainly not been successful. This country, for example, did not have a spatial strategy debate from 1966 until this year when the Government announced its gateway and hub towns. These, we are told, will receive priority infrastructural investment together with industrial development, housing and the other amenities needed to grow a population centre. What does the Government have in mind for decentralisation of Government Departments? I consistently ask both the Taoiseach and the Tánaiste in the Dáil when this decision will be announced. I constantly get &ldquo;in the near future&rdquo; as a reply.</P>
    <P>I believe a war is taking place inside the Cabinet, with Ministers obviously sulking in the knowledge that their county towns may be omitted. Certainly, the Government backbenchers are on overtime. I call on the Government to produce a blueprint for decentralisation providing the public with clear, unambiguous, transparent eligibility guidelines on which towns, cities and regions may <Col N="862" />be entitled to get a decentralised Government Department. I ask the Minister to outline how many Departments he has in mind for decentralisation and what sort of negotiations he has had with the various unions involved about this so-called major transfer of civil servants from Dublin to the country. The Tánaiste informed me at a meeting in her Department some months ago that gateway or hub towns already identified in the national spatial strategy plan would not get a decentralised Government Department.</P>
    <P>This Government and its predecessor were clearly Dublin-orientated in that the vast bulk of the infrastructural investment in roads, railways and transport went to the capital city. It is true that all areas benefited from the Celtic tiger but a few examples show how the areas outside the Dublin commuter belt were left out in the cold. Take, for example, the National Roads Authority allocations to local authorities for 2003. The schemes are the N1 in Dundalk, the Carrickmacross bypass, the Kilcock bypass, the Monasterevin bypass, the Naas Road, the Cashel bypass and the Waterford city bypass. Only one of them is in the BMW area. There appears to be more trouble in store for areas in the west and north-west where grandiose preferred road routes have been identified. These projects are dropping fast to the back of the queue. Look at the National Development Plan 2000-2006. It now appears that the projects situated far from Dublin will not be completed until 2016, possibly ten years later than planned.</P>
    <P>We are told that the financing of the Dublin Port tunnel, when completed, will have major implications for other schemes in the country in that there may well be more money available for projects outside Dublin. However, will there be sufficient funding for those projects even then? It seems to be a <i>fait accompli</i> that public-private partnerships will be established to build most of the motorways. The higher the volume of cars going through the toll plazas, the more profit they will make and the nearer they are to Dublin, the better the profit will be. Should private enterprise not be interested in road building, many parts of the country such as Mayo, Roscommon, Sligo, Leitrim and parts of Galway may be shunted to one side and their roads may never be completed.</P>
    <P>I want to take the opportunity to give a balanced overview of where people work and live, and how they get to their work; how one part of the country is overcrowded and the remainder is sparsely populated and starved of infrastructural development. In many cases the population base is so fragile that the ratio of births to deaths is a negative factor. For a national spatial strategy to work properly it must address all the factors that influenced the huge unmanaged growth in Dublin and on the east coast. At the same time in complementary terms it must provide a framework, a vision, an energy and an enthusiasm to introduce strategies to stabilise decreasing populations and to plan for viable towns and cities to counterbalance the growth of the east coast.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="863" />For daily commuters travelling long or short distances to work in this city every day, their only hope lies in a combination of better transport access by road, whether by bus or private car, rail, Luas, using park and ride facilities and then by the relocation of the 10,000 existing commuters away from the city to different centres around the country. This Government is in flagrant breach of a solemn commitment given before the last general election by the Minister for Finance who stated that 10,000 civil servants would be relocated. Deputy Harney told me on several occasions in this House that an announcement to this effect was imminent.</P>
    <P>What would 10,000 civil servants relocated from Dublin mean for Dublin? Everybody knows what it would mean for the regions. In Dublin the Minister refers to three Luas systems being cleared in one swoop and said it takes 165 buses morning and evening, with 60 people in each, to convey those 10,000 commuters to their work in Dublin every day. The Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Harney, and the Minister of State at the Department of Finance, Deputy Parlon, aired the decentralisation theme at their party's annual conference a few weeks ago. The Minister told worried community leaders and the 300 workers at the ill-fated Square D factory in Ballinasloe that the Government was urgently working on plans to decentralise Departments and that an announcement in their favour would be made shortly. That was three months ago but in his Dáil reply last week the Minister for Finance seems to have gone cold on the idea. He has to deal with a plethora of confrontations despite the fact that he has had since 1999 to do that.</P>
    <P>I put it to the Minister for Defence that there is a serious row going on in the Cabinet. It is not able to agree where to send the civil servants because it does not have a blueprint for where they should go. When the Minister speaks in this debate I want him to refer to the 120 applications he has from cities, villages and towns made at great cost to themselves. They genuinely believed their best hope was to get some part of a decentralised Department. I put it to the Minister and his Government that they cannot slide out of this promise. They cannot blame, for instance, overseas investors who may or may not want to come to the BMW region. Right or wrong that is what the Minister says. The Minister is in control of the decentralisation programme. He said he was going to shift 10,000 civil servants. He has done almost nothing. The plan is stillborn and is not going to happen.</P>
    <P>If the current demographic trends continue, even on a modest economic growth pattern, Ireland is likely to have 4.4 million people in 20 years or about 500,000 people more than at present. This will happen without any of the significant net migration into the country that we have experienced over the past four or five years. Parallel with this population increase we can <Col N="864" />expect an explosion in car ownership. It now looks as if the number of cars using our roads will double over the period to 2016. There were 1.1 million cars in 1996 and we are told there will be 2.2 million in 2016.</P>

      <P>If not managed properly the demographic profile will make Ireland so lopsided that if the country were a boat it would sink. The strategies that will deliver quality housing at affordable prices, linked to reasonably accessible job centres, based on the ability of modern communications technology such as broadband and greater use of the commuter rail facilities, are now of paramount importance. Unfortunately this Government has done nothing, apart from get involved in slick public relations games on the spatial strategy and decentralisation. This Government has shown no willingness to do anything about this imbalance.</P>
      <P>No Government in the past 20 years seems to have come to grips with the age old chestnut, in spatial policy terms, of whether the investment in infrastructure follows the population growth or whether new strategies are put in place to encourage people to come and live and work in certain areas. Contrary to what Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats are always saying, one of their senior Ministers, Deputy Ó Cuív, made a remarkable statement at a function I attended in Claremorris a week ago. He said that unless a Government got the imprimatur or blessing of people on the east coast and their representatives, it would not be possible to rethink our infrastructural development before a population increase in the west of Ireland. If that is the way our Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs and the rest of the Government think, God help the regions.</P>
      <P>This Government is not leading. It is a Government of parts. Each Minister seems to have a hobbyhorse of his or her own and thereby denies the country any possibility of seeing the full picture at one time. That is missing on this issue. Fine Gael believes it is possible to achieve all the aims. It is important to have a vibrant Dublin as the shop window of Ireland for the world but not at the expense of the rest of the country. It is not a contest between the regions and Dublin. I hope that the Government will take this seriously for the sake of the 120 communities that feel let down because they do not see decentralisation coming. The Minister will have a lot of answering to do the next time he crosses the Shannon.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Naughten</NameTxt>
      <P>I compliment Deputy Connaughton on tabling this motion. Dublin city and the surrounding counties are bursting at the seams and being choked by traffic congestion. The Government's solution is to force people from cars into an inadequate and haphazard public transport system. This Government's ineptitude in tackling Dublin's traffic has reduced the average travel speed on some Dublin city routes to 5 km. per hour. That is slower than travelling by ass and cart a hundred years ago. The average car journey to the city now takes 57 minutes, that is up 25% since this Government took office. At present people are forced to commute 50 and 60 miles, or up to three hours every day to get to and from work. The gridlock in the capital is costing city businesses more than &euro;650 million per annum. We need as a matter of urgency to take a new approach to the current rudderless situation and the lack of action since this Government and its predecessor took office just over six years ago. The abject personal failure of the Minister for Transport, Deputy Brennan, to expedite a solution to the escalating transport crisis in the Dublin area is a perfect example of the Government's gross inability to deliver projects.</P>
      <P>We all remember the hype over Luas. Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats promised, in the 1997 programme for Government, to re-energise it. The project is already late and well over budget, and it is now running a further three months behind schedule. The Red Cow interchange is a joke and will cause traffic chaos as soon as it commences operation. On top of that, plans have been put in place to provide a park-and-ride facility at Newlands Cross without including either an underpass or an overpass, meaning that everyone using it will have to cross over the southern side of the Naas dual carriageway.</P>
      <P>The Government is confusing public relations with public life. It cannot differentiate between announcing a project and delivering on it. Grand schemes overshadow practical, inexpensive and short-term solutions. How can there be any balanced regional development given what is happening in Dublin? There is no organisation or co-ordination. However, people will continue to locate in Dublin and the surrounding counties, and resources will have to be made available to provide schools, hospitals, roads and other infrastructure because of the demand. The problem is that if the members of the Government are going around like headless chickens trying to manage what is happening in the capital, how can they show leadership on regional development?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The following is typical of e-mails which I received recently regarding the Adamstown development in west Dublin. A constituent complained of trouble getting out of the estate in the morning, never mind getting off the M4, and asked what would happen when there were an extra 20,000 cars trying to get on to it. There is a railway line about 400 yards from that estate, but it is not much good because there is no station. <Col N="866" />Why has no station been built for Lucan? Does the population have to be over 100,000 before we see action? Dublin city needs decentralisation and regional development more than anywhere else. Congestion will never be resolved if we do not ease pressure by removing demand from the capital's infrastructure. New roads, rail and bus services are vitally important but can only help alleviate the misery rather than resolve the fundamental problem. In conjunction with those developments, we must provide regional development which will bring balance to the growth of recent years.</P>
    <P>The State must assist the growth of regional centres by deliberately assisting the development of basic infrastructure and lifestyle-enhancing facilities in those centres, which will assist in attracting people to them. If we are not proactive in spreading such facilities around the country, our capital city will slowly choke to death. To achieve that, we must address the infrastructural deficit outside the capital and take a proactive approach to decentralisation. The Government has no desire to improve infrastructure in the regions and it is pursuing a <i>laissez-faire</i> policy on decentralisation. It keeps promising but does not deliver.</P>
    <P>The railway system should be deliberately chosen by the Government as the primary artery for national development. However, if we look at the Government-commissioned strategic rail review, we see that it has no plans to enhance the rail network. The most basic errors are blatantly obvious in the report, yet the Minister did not have it redrafted. It completely contradicts the Government's spatial strategy, which is evidently not worth the paper it is written on when compared with the strategic rail review. The western rail corridor is shelved, even though it would link Sligo, Ballina, Castlebar, Tuam, Galway, Ennis, Shannon, Limerick and Cork. The Government has shelved the rail link between Mullingar, Athlone and Tullamore, yet the sole purpose of the strategic rail review was to review the feasibility of that link when the then Minister, Senator O'Rourke, announced it. The strategic rail review is nothing more than &ldquo;Pale rail&rdquo;. All the new developments are into and around Dublin except for one project, starkly contradicting what is stated in black and white in the spatial strategy, yet it was not redrafted by the Minister.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Transport stated that he was disappointed with the rail report, which he felt was not ambitious enough, but he did not have it redrafted. The Department of Transport's position is that the strategic rail review is not cast in stone but is its broad policy view. The Department does not believe that the rail report is at variance with the spatial strategy. As Deputy Connaughton pointed out, the Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs came out with the most astonishing comment regarding the strategic rail review, that it could only be changed to include projects such as the western rail corridor or the link between the three midland towns <Col N="867" />of Mullingar, Athlone and Tullamore with the approval of the people of the east coast and their representatives.</P>
    <P>If we examine the Government amendment before us tonight, we see that it &ldquo;commends the Government for its careful consideration of the many and varied factors which it must examine in order to fulfil the commitment in An Agreed Programme for Government to move forward the progressive decentralisation of Government offices and agencies, taking account of the national spatial strategy.&rdquo;  Is there careful consideration? In fairness, members of the Government are taking careful consideration, of their own political necks, and ensuring that this matter is shelved again until after the next election. The Government claims to be taking account of the national spatial strategy. The designation of a hub town is about as important as a hub cap on the side of the road.</P>
    <P>The national spatial strategy itself is nothing more than a headline-grabbing sham, and the Government has treated rural Ireland with contempt. For example, the midlands triangle of Mullingar, Athlone and Tullamore does not even have a decent road to connect the three towns, and the National Roads Authority has stated that there is no funding available to develop such national secondary roads. Another hub, Ballina and Castlebar, has a first-class rail line connecting the two towns, but no train service and no plans to provide such a service. The strategy proposes to develop Sligo, Galway, Ennis, Shannon and Limerick, yet, after its publication, the Minister for Transport gave Iarnród Éireann the green light to pull up the line.</P>
    <P>Let us examine the national development plan, which is designed to provide modern Ireland with the infrastructure it needs. Of the 34 road projects planned for this year, only 12 are starting. The Minister for Transport has shelved even the new motorways servicing some of the new hubs for another three years. The amendment looks more like &ldquo;Comical Ali&rdquo; tabled it rather than the Minister for Finance. Services provided by the Government must be decentralised in conjunction with the development of top-grade broadband telecommunications. As part of that process, we want to see entire Departments move out of Dublin.</P>
    <P>While the Government is talking the talk and the Tánaiste is promising decentralisation to towns as if it were snuff at a wake, it seems the Government is more interested in the cost of decentralisation and the provision of infrastructure than the benefits they will bring. Over 18,000 applications are with various Departments from civil servants who wish to transfer out of the capital. However, three and a half years after the Government's 1999 decentralisation pledge, it is still sitting on the fence. The applications are well in excess of the 10,000 sought by the Government. It is a further example of a Government which cannot distinguish between delivery and <Col N="868" />commitment in its promises. Relocating 10,000 workers from Dublin to towns outside the capital would benefit both the capital and the regional towns. It would help reduce the pressure on traffic and house prices in Dublin and bring jobs and investment to other locations as well as stimulating further investment in them.</P>
    <P>The most farcical example of the Government's commitment to decentralisation was the announcement by the then Taoiseach and leader of Fianna Fáil before the 1992 general election of the decentralisation of the General Registry Office to Roscommon town. Over ten years later, we still await publication of legislation which would allow the transfer. There have been 2,317 applications from civil servants based in Dublin to relocate to County Roscommon and surrounding towns, but, yet again, the Government continues to drag out the process. The Government's failure to deliver on that plan is consistent with the lack of connectivity shown between the national development plan, the spatial strategy and the strategic rail review. If one examined the three, one would think that they had been produced by three different Governments in three different parts of the world because they do not tally. It is typical of Government policy regarding the development of the regions. I commend the motion to the House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>Last Wednesday, members of South Dublin County Council voted to approve development plans for Abbotstown beside Lucan, County Dublin. This development of 10,000 new houses will see up to 25,000 people move to the area directly adjacent to Ireland's fastest growing town. Not surprisingly, local residents are worried about the impact of such a large new development. The Minister should try sitting in a car for one or two hours a day travelling to and from work and he might appreciate the frustration involved. Try getting children into schools which are trying to cope with a local population explosion of the past five years. Try watching every piece of green space close to your home being turned into row after row of new housing. Add another 25,000 people to the mix and see the local services stretch to breaking point.</P>
      <P>Future generations will condemn the Government for its abject failure to develop certain parts of the country while presiding over an expansion of Dublin that is unplanned, unfocused and uncontrolled. The Government has failed entirely to capitalise on the fact that sensible and constructive decentralisation would act as a pressure release valve for Dublin city while also bringing much needed investment jobs to many other parts of the country. In short, decentralisation is good for Dublin and for the regions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Almost four years ago, in December 1999, the Minister for Finance announced that 10,000 civil servants were to move out of Dublin in a large-scale decentralisation programme that would see half the Civil Service based outside the capital. The Minister wrote to his Cabinet colleagues in <Col N="869" />an attempt to ascertain which offices were most suitable for decentralisation but then allowed the scheme to go off the boil. The decision on which Departments should be moved was postponed until summer 2000, then until autumn of the same year and then put off for the foreseeable future. There are many ways in which the Government has squandered the vast resources it has had at its fingertips in recent years. Even more depressing is the total failure to capitalise upon the huge benefits that would accrue from sensible, well-planned decentralisation.</P>
    <P>Decentralisation offers the Government a key approach to tackling urban development and urban sprawl at the same time. We all know of the severe pressures that our capital city is under at present with regard to housing, rail and public bus transport services, park and ride facilities, the availability of serviced lands for development and the availability of schools and health care services. Many communities are crying out for the shot in the arm that decentralisation represents.</P>
    <P>On paper Ireland has experienced a booming economy in recent years, but we all know that the fruits of this boom did not reach all parts of the country equally. In parts of my constituency, for example, average disposable income is almost 15% lower than the national average. Tipperary town was given a commitment in regard to decentralisation not once, not twice but three times in three consecutive elections, not by ordinary Deputies or county councillors but by Ministers. What has happened in my constituency, a county that has never experienced decentralisation, is deplorable. Given the drop in income that Tipperary has experienced because of serious unemployment problems, it is disgraceful that the Government did not see fit to decentralise offices there. I rest my case.</P>

      <P>Spatial strategy here exists only on paper. As a Deputy representing a rural constituency on the western seaboard, I observe every day the concentration of investment in Dublin and on the eastern seaboard, and the total neglect of the west in terms of basic infrastructure such as roads, broadband provision, sewage treatment and a quality rail system.</P>
      <P>I would like to refer specifically to decentralisation and especially to a proposal by the three towns of Kilrush, Listowel and Newcastle West, otherwise known as the ISDN proposal, the integrated Shannon decentralisation network. The integrated Shannon decentralisation network was established by the local authorities and community councils of the towns of Kilrush, Listowel and Newcastle West with the support and assistance of Shannon Development to promote and advance the concept of decentralisation of a Department to their towns. The proposal is based on the Government's stated preferred intention to decentralise Departments in their entirety rather than on a piecemeal basis. This proposal forms part of the three individual submissions already made by the towns involved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="870" />The ISDN offers the Government the opportunity to decentralise one entire Department to three medium-sized towns in a region that is on the periphery of the west. It offers an opportunity for civil servants to follow a career path within their Department as all three towns are within commuting distance. It facilitates the Government spatial strategy as outlined in the national plan. It will facilitate partnership between communities, local authorities and agencies in line with Government policy. It will provide civil servants with a broader choice and improved quality of life and help to kick-start development in three locations that would enhance and improve future prospects at those locations.</P>
    <P>The three towns in question have a wide and varied range of associations, activities and facilities related to theatre, entertainment and sport. In addition, there has in recent years been a substantial increase in the number and variety of good quality restaurants in the environs of each town. The towns of Kilrush, Listowel and Newcastle West have been brought together by Shannon Development to provide a creative and unusual solution to Government to promote peripheral development in a most effective way to the advantage of all. The proposal is cross-boundary, cross-constituency and cross-party. It has brought together local authorities, community councils, Oireachtas Members and Shannon Development in co-operation and partnership in a way not previously experienced. I have recommended this proposal in the past to the Minister for Finance and he has expressed his admiration of the project in the Dáil on a number of occasions. It is time he acted.</P>
    <P>I would like to refer specifically to Listowel, my home town. Census figures show a decline in population in Listowel of 2.8%, from 19,275 in 1996 to 18,735 in 2002. It is one of the few rural areas in the country to show a decline in population. That is a very strong reason Listowel should be recognised for decentralisation. The live register figures for September 2001 to September 2002 show an increase of 8% and recent live register figures show a further increase. In relation to household disposable income per head in 2000, according to figures recently released by the Central Statistics Office, Kerry is fourth from the bottom of the league table. Below Kerry are Offaly, Donegal and Laois. The figure for Kerry is 84.9%. It is now 23rd in the league table. Kerry, especially places like Listowel, is dying. It needs decentralisation immediately if it is to be revived. If the Government's spatial strategy is to have any credibility, places like Listowel and Kilrush should be identified immediately for help.</P>
    <P>Recognising Deputy Connaughton's motion, what is needed in these areas across the country is positive action and preferential treatment, which they are not getting at present. The Government is posturing. It is feeding the people in these areas with plans and promises but it is not delivering. Every day I come to Dublin I see the differences between investment in Dublin, to which I have <Col N="871" />no objection. All we want on the western seaboard, in the midlands and across the country, is fair treatment. That is not what we are getting. I can say that as I represent a constituency that is dying on its knees because of lack of Government initiatives, lack of Government investment and lack of Government recognition.</P>
    <P>I hope we will hear from the Minister that the Government will not just act on promises, but that it will act on the ground and that we will see tangible results starting in the immediate future.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">

      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>To delete all words after &ldquo;Dáil Éireann&rdquo; and substitute the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;commends the Government for its careful consideration of the many and varied factors which it must examine in order to fulfil the commitment in An Agreed Programme for Government to move forward the progressive decentralisation of Government offices and agencies, taking account of the national spatial strategy.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I wish to share my time with Deputies Fleming, Finneran and Cregan.</P>
      <P>I apologise to the House for the absence of my colleague the Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, who is in Brussels at an ECOFIN meeting. The Minister will be here tomorrow to contribute to this important debate.</P>
      <P>I am particularly pleased to contribute to this debate given my long-standing support for the principle of decentralisation. In my constituency of Tipperary North, several sections of the Office of the Revenue Commissioners were relocated to Nenagh a number of years ago. These Government offices are now a well established feature of the town and their importance to the commercial life of the town and its hinterland cannot be underestimated. That programme of decentralisation had been promised by Fine Gael and the Labour Party some years earlier but was abandoned.</P>
      <P>These decentralisation programmes have proved to be an outstanding success, not only for the locality and the community to which those transferring brought new vitality but, most importantly, for those who have benefited from the quality of life which they enjoy in north Tipperary. I look forward to similar benefits accruing to Roscrea following the relocation of the headquarters of the Civil Defence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As an advocate for decentralisation I am convinced that a significant programme of decentralisation will be a win-win situation for all involved. It will make a contribution to lessening city centre congestion in Dublin and will be a statement of the Government's intent in this regard. It will be a significant boost to those centres to which Departments and offices will be relocated and beyond, as people choose to live in neighbouring towns and villages. It will bring economic benefit to the regions and, I hope, act <Col N="872" />as a powerful catalyst for further economic development in towns throughout the country.</P>
    <P>In adopting the national spatial strategy, the Government re-affirmed its commitment to the objective of balanced regional development. Decentralisation can also contribute in this regard by strengthening the potential of towns selected for the location of Government and public agency offices to attract inward investment and enterprise development, in addition to the public service employment which is being relocated.</P>
    <P>Notwithstanding the benefits for towns throughout the country, perhaps the greatest beneficiaries of decentralisation will be the individual members of staff. It will be a quality of life issue. For many it will be the end of the endless commuting grind that is coming into and out of Dublin city centre. Commuting times will be slashed and those living much closer to their workplace will suddenly find themselves with considerably more family time available to them. For those who have the opportunity to relocate in or close to their native areas, it may mean greater proximity to ageing parents and other family members.</P>
    <P>It is important to emphasise the extent to which civil servants are already located outside Dublin. There are, at present, approximately 36,000 civil servants and 2,500 public servants in non-commercial State-sponsored bodies. Following the earlier decentralisation of Department and offices and the well-established presence of networks and regional and local offices of the Department of Agriculture and Food, the Department of Social and Family Affairs and the Office of the Revenue Commissioners, there are now 14,000 civil servants located outside Dublin. Effectively almost 40% of the Civil Service already works in the provinces.</P>
    <P>Given the increased sophistication of and dependence on information technology, I am satisfied there is no good reason the current concentration of civil and public servants in Dublin has to be maintained.</P>
    <P>Furthermore, I believe there is sufficient interest among Dublin-based civil servants to ensure the success of a new and substantial programme of decentralisation.</P>
    <P>I would caution, however, against putting too much store in the figures quoted by Fine Gael in its statement yesterday and again in the House this evening. It has been selective in the manner in which it has presented these figures and even Fine Gael must realise that the presentation of figures suggesting that in excess of 80% of the Dublin-based Civil Service is interested in relocating to provincial towns, is at least overly ambitious if not totally misleading. I know the Minister for Finance is conscious of the calls made upon him, and other members of the Government, to use the vehicle of decentralisation to address job losses in various parts of the country.</P>
    <P>Like many others, I appreciate the concerns of Deputies in this regard but I know they will real realise there are a host of factors which will influ<Col N="873" />ence Government decisions on the issue. The process is not as simple as listing off a series of qualifying criteria against which the merits of the various towns can be measured. For Fine Gael to suggest otherwise is opportunistic and cynical.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaulConnaughton" hpid="Mr. Connaughton Mr. Connaughton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connaughton</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>In this debate the Deputy's contributors were seeking decentralisation to their own areas. As there are 43 constituencies that would give us an idea of where one is going.</P>
      <P>I would like to add a word of caution to those who seem to see decentralisation as the answer to localised job losses. Decentralisation will not, of itself, create jobs in any locality. While I am certain that the establishment of a new Government office in any provincial town has the potential to act as an economic catalyst for that area, it ought not to be as the necessary solution to job losses. The issues are distinct and ought to be seen as such.</P>
      <P>I am well aware of the many meritorious cases which have been made for inclusion in the new programme. I have come across several persuasive and compelling cases. While I know these will play their part in the decision-making process, I am also conscious that they are but one part of what will be an elaborate process.</P>
      <P>It is only appropriate to acknowledge the quality of the submissions made by local interest groups throughout the country, be they local authorities, chambers of commerce, community associations, etc. Many of those I have seen are of a high standard and, quite apart from the issue of decentralisation, make an impressive case for private sector inward investment. I hope that the work and time which groups have invested in making the case for the relocation of Government offices can be harnessed after this process has been completed to continue to work to attract inward investment.</P>
      <P>Fine Gael has issued two statements regarding decentralisation in the past two days and has added to those during this debate. The first does not have one constructive suggestion in it. It is typically condemnatory and takes no account of the work that has been done over the past few years. I am not sure just what it expects the Minister for Finance and the Government to do. It is right and proper that decisions of this significance are taken against the background of appropriate consultation. The Minister and his Department are to be commended for them diligence in ensuring that decisions of such significance are taken only after all of the implications are fully examined.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have already said how I consider Fine Gael is being deliberately selective in its interpretation of figures derived from a recent series of parliamentary questions. Its survey was of 11 Departments and its conclusion was that over 18,000 Dublin-based civil servants had expressed an interest in transferring out of the capital. Had the survey <Col N="874" />been more complete and included large offices, such as the Office of the Revenue Commissioners, there would have been even more transfer applications. It may have been that there would have been more applications than there were civil servants in Dublin. Presumably at that stage the recommendation would have been made that the entire Civil Service be relocated out of Dublin.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaulConnaughton" hpid="Mr. Connaughton Mr. Connaughton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connaughton</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a flippant response.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>Anybody looking at these figures who has the slightest semblance of knowledge of the Civil Service knows that it is impossible to draw the conclusions made by Fine Gael. All of us, especially those of us who represent non-Dublin constituencies, are aware of the determination of some people working in Dublin to transfer back to the country. We all equally know that the determination of some is such that they would apply for any or all locations close to home. The inevitable conclusion, therefore, is that many of those expressing a wish to transfer will have made multiple transfer applications. Consequently, the number of applications has to be discounted by a significant factor. I cannot believe that the Fine Gael Party does not appreciate this and, therefore, I can only assume that it has presented the figures in a deliberately misleading way to suggest that in some way the Government is responsible for holding back a massive outflow of civil servants from Dublin to provincial Ireland.</P>
      <P>I must also take issue with the by now tiresome suggestion that the Government has failed to deliver on its commitments. This is the first of a five year term and I challenge those on the other side of the House to sustain their arguments at the conclusion of our full term. The Government will shortly publish the first progress report of this Administration. Many of those accusing us of non-delivery will be surprised at the extent of progress made across every range of Government activity during our first year in office, notwithstanding a much more difficult economic climate.</P>
      <P>Today the Fine Gael Party issued a second statement which asked if the Government has given decentralisation the elbow. It gives me great pleasure to assure Deputy Connaughton and his colleagues that we have not. The party's statement suggests that it has no appreciation of the complexity of determining the shape of a significant programme of decentralisation and less of an idea of how to implement it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We all know of the population pressures on the eastern seaboard. While it may have escaped the notice of Members on the other side of the House, the Government has moved to address this issue through the publication of its national spatial strategy, to which full regard will be had in the decision-making process on a new programme of decentralisation. Deputy Connaughton and his colleagues should have no doubt about the Government's resolve to progress a <Col N="875" />new and substantial programme of decentralisation. When it is announced it will be a statement of the Government's intent to address the congestion issue in Dublin city.</P>
    <P>I hope that when as a Government we prove our ability to deliver so many efficient and effective public services from various locations throughout the country, it will act as an encouragement to various private sector enterprises and that it will become apparent to them that it is not necessary, as they appear to think, to place such a high dependence on having a city centre presence in Dublin. Decentralisation is an integral part of the Government's commitment to balanced development. All of us who have seen the benefits it can bring to urban centres throughout the country will welcome the new programme, which will be substantial. Those on the opposite side of the House should be in no doubt about the Government's commitment in this regard. I commend the amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFleming" hpid="Mr. Fleming Mr. Fleming">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fleming</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for sharing his time. This is a very important issue and it is also important that in the first year of its term, the Government study the process carefully with a view to making the right rather than quick decisions. I was surprised at the motion where the Fine Gael Party calls for exact criteria, rules, regulations and formulae by which decentralisation can be judged and suitable locations selected. We are concerned here with people, not numbers, and I would oppose that type of approach. A more holistic view must be taken that considers people and quality of life issues. The Fine Gael motion reminds me of a children's colouring book, where colouring is done by numbers. The party appears to want decentralisation done by numbers. Life and Irish society is much more complicated. Much greater consideration must be given to this issue than merely compiling rule books to govern the location of new offices.</P>
      <P>I would like to see the programme of decentralisation commencing as soon as possible, although I accept it will take a period of years to implement. It is important that we do not transfer civil servants from one over-crowded congested city to another. We must consider the large, medium and smaller provincial towns which are best suited to decentralisation. Decentralisation will have a positive impact on these towns. A new Government office will make a big contribution at local level and enhance the quality of life of residents. We often hear of law and order incidents and late night disturbances, but people know that such problems are not as severe in provincial towns as in the major urban centres.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I put my cards firmly on the table and call for decentralisation to include the town of Portlaoise, which is approximately 40 to 50 miles from Dublin. Every day, hundreds of civil servants commute from the town to Dublin city on the national primary roads and the rail link. It is a waste of national resources to construct motor<Col N="876" />ways and bypasses to enable people commute from what is effectively the commuter belt to the greater Dublin area. It makes far more sense to allow those living in the midlands to work there rather than spend four or five hours every day commuting. That would constitute real sustainable development. It is what regional development is about. We must transfer large numbers of civil servants out of Dublin.</P>
    <P>I was disappointed to learn recently that disposable household income in County Laois is one of the lowest in the country. There are structural reasons for this, which include Government investment and IDA Ireland's abysmal failure to act for the people of County Laois. The number of people in IDA Ireland supported industries in the county is a fraction of what it was ten years ago.</P>
    <P>The Minster rightly says that decentralisation is no substitute for inward investment. It is a different issue and both attract different types of employees. Decentralised jobs do not constitute new, but a transfer of employment. Such a move would represent a structural change in County Laois and I would like to see it implemented by the Government.</P>
    <P>The Government faces serious choices. At the last count, 110 submissions were made from 110 towns across the country and I am sure every local authority has contacted the Minister seeking a meeting to press the case for these towns. That is not the way to proceed. Each town must be judged on its merits, and some are well merited while others are not suitable.</P>
    <P>Portlaoise fits all the necessary criteria. The town is served by excellent road and rail transport services. The quality and pricing of housing is good and the quality of life is improving. When making its decisions in the coming months I ask the Government to give the town favourable consideration. In this regard, I will enlist the support of my constituency Cabinet colleague, the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Cowen, to work on behalf of the constituency. Although he is an Offaly man I expect he will be happy to support the case for Portlaoise.</P>
    <P>None of these matters can be resolved by the application of simple formulae. I therefore ask that all the relevant factors are taken into consideration by Ministers when final decisions are made. I look forward to this happening as soon as possible.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFinneranFF" hpid="Mr. Finneran Mr. Finneran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Finneran</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to contribute to this debate on decentralisation and I support the amendment to the motion and the Government's record and approach to the issue. I wonder why the Fine Gael Party moved the motion. It does not have a regional policy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When the issue of Objective One status was debated nationally many Deputies, particularly those on the east coast, were ambivalent about an important Government decision for the midlands and the west, including my constituency. It may be the reason Fine Gael is reduced to three <Col N="877" />Deputies in the Dublin area. The party might have abandoned Dublin having decided that its lot lies in the midlands and the west. If that is the case, the party is reverting to the old Clann na Talún position, but I hope it is not. Fine Gael has played a part in the public life of the country.</P>
    <P>To some extent, there is an opportunistic, political motive behind tonight's motion which may not be in the best interests of decentralisation. Decentralisation is an important matter, which involves people, jobs and towns. Many people have indicated to us as public representatives their wish to transfer from Departments in Dublin to offices in the regions. As the Minister stated, many of those people have submitted multiple applications and the figures presented by Fine Gael are very misleading.</P>

      <P>We have done that in the past and I welcome the opportunity to contribute tonight to this debate. Given where I come from and what I represent, I believe there is a strong case to be made for decentralisation to the midlands and the west. I must pinpoint here the opportunity that exists for the Government to decentralise to Roscommon town, County Roscommon generally and the constituency of Longford-Roscommon. I record my support for the case for decentralisation to Ballinasloe.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaulConnaughton" hpid="Mr. Connaughton Mr. Connaughton">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Finneran</NameTxt>
      <P>Many of my constituents have worked and work in the town, which has been the market centre for a great area of south Roscommon. While I was not here for Deputy Connaughton's contribution, I support any case he has made in that regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When looking at the Government's spatial strategy, it is obvious to examine gateway towns. Roscommon town is ideally situated to provide a link between the population centres of Athlone and Sligo and Mayo. A town like Roscommon offers great opportunities as it meets many of the infrastructural requirements which would entice and be appreciated by people moving from Dublin to the west. I mention in particular the refurbished county hospital at which a major development is under way. A major leisure and swimming pool centre has recently been opened <Col N="878" />in Roscommon town which also has an 18 hole golf course and an excellent road and rail network. I record my gratitude for the recent decision of the independent appeals board of An Bord Pleanála which grants permission to proceed with a Government office block of 50,000 square feet in the town. There will be much spare capacity in the block which should be considered when decisions are made regarding decentralisation.</P>
    <P>The Government has made a commitment to the regions which others failed to demonstrate when they had the opportunity to do so. I consider the decision on Objective One status and the rural renewal decisions made by the Government to be very important regional policy developments. Nobody else in the history of the State attempted to implement any such policies.</P>

      <P>I do not know what the Labour Party ever did. Labour had a bit of a party in our place at one time, but it disappeared about 30 years ago. Jack McQuillan, the Lord have mercy on him, kept it going for a time, but it has been gone for a long time.</P>
      <P>In its time in government, Fianna Fáil has addressed these issues in a productive manner. We are conscious of the increasing population in areas which were previously denuded of people over many years. The increase is definitely the result of sound Government policies in regard to Objective One status and rural renewal which are important matters now and will continue to be in the future.</P>
      <P>The next important decision which will hopefully be made in favour of Roscommon will concern decentralisation. The town's location favours a positive decision to decentralise there. I agree with the previous speaker that it would not be appropriate to create further traffic problems where centres of population are identified. No one would want to see that happen.</P>
      <P>I am pleased to have the opportunity to speak on this matter. I support the Government amendment to the motion and I compliment the Minister for Finance for the steady hand with which he has directed the national finances. When others wilted this man showed himself to have the best interests of this country's long-term economic development at heart. I have no doubt that when the time comes he will look with a favourable eye on the proposals coming forward from me on behalf of my constituency.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cregan</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister and my colleagues for allowing me the opportunity to say a few brief words on this important issue for my constituency of west Limerick and the country as a whole. I support the amendment in the strongest possible way and I offer the Minister for Finance my strongest support for the manner in <Col N="879" />which he has handled the issue of decentralisation.</P>
      <P>Prior to the general election, it would have been very easy for the Minister for Finance to look around the country and do something opportunistic in terms of our party by promising decentralisation to certain places. I was a member of a deputation which met the Minister three years ago to impress upon him the reasons my constituency should benefit from decentralisation. The Minister listened very carefully, but he has yet to make a decision. The reason he has not is that it is his firm intention to base on merit what is a pertinent and important decision for the regions and for provincial and county towns like Newcastle West. I welcome that as it is important the Minister conduct his business in that manner.</P>
      <P>I wish to dispel the myth put about by the Opposition parties that there are 18,000 public service employees who are ready to decentralise to the regions. There may well be 18,000 applications to decentralise, but that is a very different matter. For example, if a civil servant working in Dublin wishes to further his or her career in Limerick, he or she will naturally apply to every Government office in the greater Limerick area, which could amount to some six or eight different offices. Throw in five or six different Garda stations and one has one civil servant making an application to move to the region on 12 different application forms. It is a myth that there were 18,000. To his credit, the Minister is now confident he has enough people in the Civil Service who are prepared to travel and be decentralised. We must also remember that it is not just about civil servants, it is about their families, furthering their careers and having the right opportunities.</P>
      <P>Newcastle West, Listowel and Kilrush have made a unique application. I wish to pay tribute to the three county councils, Shannon Development in the mid-west region and everyone who was involved in putting this worthwhile and valid proposal to the Department of Finance three years ago. It is unique because it gives an opportunity for transfers within the three areas as well as enhanced career opportunities. None of the three towns would be capable in its own right of having a substantial Department. We were realistic about this and decided that coming together in a geographical triangle would be important to show that we were dealing with our business seriously and that the proposal had merit. Newcastle West could be very attractive. I have lobbied the Minister for Finance to ensure that the town benefits, because it has not benefited from industrial jobs for at least the last 20 years. We need these jobs in Newcastle West.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB" hpid="Ms Burton Ms Burton">
      <NameTxt>Ms Burton</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to share time with Deputies Penrose and Crawford.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If decentralisation is to proceed, the Government must be prepared to take the hard decisions now. However, I am sceptical of whether the Taoiseach is capable of making such decisions, <Col N="880" />where the public good comes before narrow political advantage. We are one year away from local and European elections, when the Government will be seeking to curry favour with all the towns where local Deputies or Senators have hinted or directly promised that their town will benefit as a result of decentralisation.</P>
    <P>The merits of decentralisation are agreed by all. If properly negotiated, many civil servants would happily relocate from large cities to smaller towns and many would be happy to escape Dublin's traffic gridlock and exorbitant house prices for a much easier life in the country. The Government could also save substantially on expensive city office space and, with effective telecommunications infrastructure, the public could be served just as well from outside, as opposed to inside, the capital. There are probably only a small number of senior civil servants who need to be close to the Dáil. There is probably an argument to be made as to why some Ministers should be located outside Dublin, perhaps in the suburbs, so they can keep in touch with the economic realities of ordinary people.</P>
    <P>The success of decentralisation has already been demonstrated by the Revenue Commissioners, the Department of Social and Family Affairs and other Departments which have successfully decentralised over the last ten years. Towns like Longford and those in Donegal and Sligo have also benefited significantly from decentralisation. As someone who worked in the Department of Social and Family Affairs and still has, like many Deputies, dealings with the Department, I can say there has been no impact on the quality of services offered to the public. Many of the staff are happy to have relocated to those towns.</P>
    <P>Why, therefore, is the Government delaying making further decisions on this matter? Decentralisation was launched and re-launched from 1999 onwards. The Minister for Defence, Deputy Michael Smith, referred to the end of year assessment of the Government's first year in office. The Government is coming to the end of its sixth year in office and it has precious little to show for it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms Burton</NameTxt>
      <P>I can only conclude that the failure to make a decision about decentralisation is just one more example of pork-barrel politics by the Government. It is afraid to face up to its election promises and to the towns that have failed to make it onto the decentralisation list. The Minister for Finance must have a list but he is most likely afraid to face up to those towns which have failed, for one reason or another, to make it on to the list.</P>

      <P>Why not face the music on decentralisation? It is time to make the decision to make Government more efficient and get on with it. The Government may find that the public is actually grateful for seeing at least one election promise fulfilled. Some areas may get bad news but people are not fools. We know the Celtic tiger has all but disappeared over the horizon, but we want what could be a helpful policy and a substantial contributor to the wealth and development of the regions. It should be proceeded with.</P>
      <P>The Minister of State at the Department of Finance, Deputy Parlon, is the Government's auctioneer with his gavel at the ready, yet where are the Progressive Democrats Deputies? They have had nothing to say about this. However, the Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Harney, has promised and re-promised on this issue every year. The only policy statement I could find from any member of the Government was a statement by Deputy Harney that she did not think decentralisation should be spread too thinly. However, given that 130 towns have requested decentralisation and that, even by the most generous assessment, only 20 towns can benefit from it, quite a number of towns will be disappointed. Deputy Fleming made an eloquent case for Portlaoise and Portarlington, Deputy Finneran spoke about Roscommon town and Ballinasloe to assist the case of Deputy Connaughton, and the Minister for Defence, Deputy Michael Smith, made eloquent cases for the success of decentralisation in Roscrea and Nenagh and what would happen in Roscrea in the future.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms Burton</NameTxt>
      <P>This is an example of the depth of the provincialism with which we are dealing. The Minister is from Tipperary, yet he could not find it in his heart to even mention Clonmel or Carrick-on-Suir, which have made powerful cases in the context of the job losses they have suffered and the jobs and development Carrick-on-Suir never got under the Government. In a parade of five Fianna Fáil speakers, we heard of dozens of different locations. I almost wish Deputy Parlon was in the House to hear the bids, as the Government's auctioneer, and perhaps make a decision.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the national spatial strategy there is a bewildering array of hub towns, gateway towns, spoke towns and satellite towns. All we lack is the wheel. These things are dependent on a wheel, <Col N="882" />but where is it? All we have seen in relation to the 130 proposals, the national spatial strategy and the broadband infrastructural project are consultants' reports that now lie a mile high, in which, understandably, town after town has put in its bid under the myriad headings the Government has offered. All these so-called strategic initiatives &ndash; the national spatial strategy, decentralisation &ndash; are carrots, or bits of carrots, dangled in front of every substantial town in the country.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately, there is a sinister side to all this. The potential, in planning terms, to be one of the favoured few is leading to significant rezoning in towns everywhere. Where there is space and realistic opportunity to develop either inward investment or decentralisation, it makes for sensible planing, but where it is inappropriate &ndash; in some cases, towns have been dangling for more than four years &ndash; it is leading to a massive upsurge in land prices based on speculative hope. The downside is that, as happened in west Dublin for many years under the Minister's former colleagues such as Deputy Burke&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;the speculative profit will not benefit the community already in those towns or those coming to the towns. It is going into the hands, exclusively, of landowners. Where a town is selected for this kind of development, some of the benefits of the rise in land value that follows such a programme should be used to fund community infrastructure &ndash; schools, community centres, the road network and the public transport infrastructure. That would be sensible planning. Unfortunately, with the Government's attempt to please all the people in all 130 towns, plus Fianna Fáil's builders, the consequences will be particularly unfortunate.</P>

      <P>For a number of years I have been a strong advocate of decentralisation, as the Labour Party's spokesperson on agriculture and rural development. I was extremely disappointed with the Government's initial approach to the decentralisation programme. It was like a bull in a china shop. It made a number of <i>ad hoc</i> decisions to relocate elements of Departments and boards, with the sole criterion that locations have strong links to Ministers. At that time, little regard was given to the needs of the civil servants involved or the suitability of locations. That was a huge problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome the Government's decision to pursue the process of decentralisation. Its success will depend on the Government's will to ensure that the recipient towns are provided with the necessary infrastructure and supports to capitalise on an increasing population. This is not a simple <Col N="883" />matter of locating civil servants in towns throughout Ireland or rewarding towns in which there is a sitting Minister, regardless of the town's employment or economic needs. The process is far more complex than that.</P>
    <P>The national spatial strategy should have come out a long time ago. Mullingar is part of a triangle in the midlands consisting of itself, Athlone and Tullamore. It has designated gateway status, and it is absolutely essential that this is sustained. Mullingar is the only town of the three that has not so far benefited from decentralisation, but when the infrastructure is put in place for designated gateway status, it must follow. Unless logic is torpedoed out the door, decentralisation of a Department, board or major semi-State body is essential. I see Deputy Connaughton is here &ndash; I advocate something like that for Ballinasloe also. It is no use designating these places for special status unless it is followed through.</P>

      <P>Three years ago, I contributed to the debate on the Town Renewal Bill. I stated that local authorities should be given greater autonomy for planning the social, physical and economic infrastructure of their towns and villages. Local autonomy and the devolution of central Government is a central ingredient in the success of the decentralisation process. Ireland is sufficiently small to ensure that a decentralised form of government can work successfully. The case was well made for Mullingar by Westmeath County Council in co-operation with Mullingar Town Commission, as it then was, the Westmeath County Enterprise Board, the Mullingar Chamber of Commerce, the Mullingar District Trades Council and the Westmeath Community Development Board. These groups made a presentation to the Minister for Finance in March 2000 on the reasons Mullingar would be an ideal centre for decentralisation. The most recent quarterly national household survey clearly showed that the midland and Border regions have benefited least from employment growth. The jobless rate in those regions still hovers at around 7%. That statistic should be borne in mind when decisions on decentralisation are made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Mullingar has been bypassed on a number of previous occasions. We are not into the politics of begrudgery in Westmeath, as that achieves nothing. However, many towns around Mullingar have benefited from the transfer of Departments. We have seen that and we want to be part of it. Jobs and infrastructure have resulted. I am delighted by the success of the decentralisation process, which is important for the reinvigoration of rural Ireland and the reduction of congestion in and around Dublin. Many civil servants from Mullingar and the surrounding towns and villages in north-west Meath travel to Dublin and elsewhere on a daily and weekly basis. They would <Col N="884" />welcome the opportunity of transferring back to their homes or an area nearby. They would also welcome the opportunity of applying for transfers to other decentralised Departments or agencies which may be located in Mullingar. The statistics in this regard are available in the Departments. If these people were presented with the opportunity of moving back home they could avail of a cheaper standard of living and more affordable property prices. Some commuters travel daily on a rail service which can prove problematic. They would welcome the opportunity of working in a decentralised Department in Mullingar.</P>
    <P>I will briefly outline some of Mullingar's virtues, with which the Minister of State, Deputy Aylward, will be familiar. It is located only one hour from Dublin and is the county town of Westmeath. With its rural hinterland, the town displays the best rural and urban aspects of contemporary Irish life. It offers a high-quality lifestyle, with first-class schools, excellent health care services and an enjoyable social atmosphere. Mullingar is a friendly, outward-looking town which combines modern facilities with a co-operative, supportive and welcoming environment. Those are important qualities for any town wishing to attract a decentralised Department.</P>
    <P>Mullingar is known as the capital of the lakelands. An ideal location for leisure and recreation, it is located close to Loughs Owel, Derravaragh, Ennell and Lene. We have an excellent 18-hole championship golf course, horse-riding enthusiasts can avail of a choice of equestrian centres, and the town's swimming pools offer top-class facilities. We have one of the best arts centres in the country and the jewel in the crown is Belvedere House park and gardens. I am proud to come from the town and I am sure the Government cannot turn a blind eye to the most deserving place that has been mentioned tonight.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeymourCrawford" hpid="Mr. Crawford Mr. Crawford">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crawford</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Connaughton for raising this important issue. I was somewhat amused by the contributions of some of the Government spokespeople, which questioned our right to put forward this motion, raised issues about the figures the Deputy used in his speech and so on. Those figures were obtained from replies to parliamentary questions and they only state the number of applicants. The Government stated that it would decentralise 10,000 people, and that is the figure we must question tonight. How many of those have actually been decentralised, apart from those who went to the constituency of the Minister, Deputy McCreevy?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We all know this city is jammed with people. We know how difficult it is to get into the city centre compared to six, eight or ten years ago. That is good, because it has economic benefits, but what has happened down the country? I represent the Cavan-Monaghan region. People are travelling to Dublin from Virginia in County Cavan, even from Cavan town, on a daily basis. There is a poor bus service and no train service. People travel from Carrickmacross by the bus<Col N="885" />load because there are no decentralised offices there. Some of them take the train from Dundalk, but Monaghan town is just too far away. I beg that a town such as Monaghan be considered for decentralisation. That town has lost Monaghan Poultry, St. Patrick's College, McCaldin's bakery and Montex, and Monaghan General Hospital is being wound down. Unlike some of the other towns mentioned it does not have a swimming pool. We hope the Minister with responsibility for this area will deliver what his predecessor promised the week prior to the last general election.</P>
    <P>The issue of social welfare was mentioned. There is an office in Monaghan town in which there is room to accommodate at least another ten people, yet queries concerning minor matters have to be passed to the office in Dundalk for decision. I beg the Government to rectify matters such as that.</P>
    <P>There is an excellent district veterinary office in Ballybay town and there is ample space beside it to increase the numbers there, which would avoid some of the problems we have encountered in recent times where numbers do not allow for upgrading the skills of the staff. That office has been available for the past few years, yet the Minister of State, Deputy Parlon, who has been <i>in situ </i>for one year has done nothing about it. This and the previous Government have had all that time to act. There was also the closure of the CPV plant in Clones.</P>
    <P>The Minister said we cannot provide replacement jobs through this measure, but they are not being provided in any other way. This is one of the aspects we can use to address that need.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, made an important statement in response to a question I put a month or so ago. He said that one needed to have good roads, broadband access, sports facilities, etc., before one could justify decentralisation. I am concerned for areas such as Monaghan which still have a long way to go in terms of having good roads and which have no rail service or swimming pool. Those are the issues the Government must address in the period in which it will take to decide on decentralisation to ensure that Border areas such as Monaghan and Cavan do not lose out.</P>
    <P>I remind the Minister that there was an opportunity to provide decentralised bodies in the Border region under the Good Friday Agreement, but the body dealing with food production was based in Cork. That opportunity arose as a result of the Good Friday Agreement. How could that decision be justified? Northern Ireland folk could not understand why they were not able to drive by car across the Border to this body rather than having to board a aeroplane to go to Cork to where this body is based to discuss matters relevant to their own area.</P>
    <P>County Monaghan produces two thirds of all mushrooms and poultry produced and it is a good dairy farming county. Cavan ranks second largest in pig production in the country, yet the <Col N="886" />decentralised body dealing with food for the Border region and Northern Ireland was based in Cork. Does that make sense? Can we be assured that when the Minister, Deputy McCreevy, makes a decision on decentralisation it will not be made solely on the basis of the number of Ministers in a constituency or in respect of the power such persons have?</P>
    <P>I appreciate the additional time afforded me to speak on this matter. This is an important issue. It is vital for the BMW region. I urge that when decisions are made they will be made in a positive way.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kirk</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Chair for the opportunity to deal with this matter on the Adjournment. The outbreak of foot and mouth disease which occurred in 2001 has had profound implications for the Cooley Peninsula, which straddles the Border on one side and the sea on the other side. In many ways the agricultural industry and the economy were fortunate in that when we unfortunately had an outbreak of the disease it occurred in a peninsular area. That helped considerably in dealing with and controlling the outbreak of the disease.</P>
      <P>I raise this issue because some months ago the Agriculture Commissioner, Franz Fischler, brought forward the mid-term review proposals, which have profound implications for those in the agricultural industry in the Cooley area. Under the proposals the reference years will apply as will the particular year in which the outbreak and subsequent depopulation took place. That means that the basis of the calculations for eligibility for the decoupled payments will be in doubt for farmers in the Cooley area. This is a <i>force majeure</i> position.</P>
      <P>I ask the Minister of State, Deputy Aylward, and through him the Department of Agriculture and Food, to take due account of the particular position that obtains for farmers in the Cooley Peninsula in the context of the negotiations on the mid-term review of the Common Agricultural Policy. It is important for the area that the <i>force majeure</i> principle is respected and that the necessary adjustments are made in the calculations to ensure that individual farmers in the Cooley do not lose out in the short and the longer term.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamAylward" hpid="Mr. Aylward Mr. Aylward">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture and Food (Mr. Aylward)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Deputy for raising this matter. Under the current Fischler proposals, the decoupled payment is to be based on the average amount paid to the farmer under the various premia schemes for the reference years 2000-02, inclusive. The average amount is determined by taking the three yearly <Col N="887" />average number of animals and/or arable hectares which attracted payment, multiplying by the premium rate for 2002 &ndash; the highest rate under Agenda 2000 &ndash; and dividing by the average number of hectares declared on the area aid application over the three-year period. The result is that a certain number of payment entitlements are established. The total number of entitlements will be equal to the average number of hectares in the reference period while the value of each entitlement will be the figure obtained by dividing the average amount determined for the reference period by the average number of hectares.</P>
      <P>There is also provision in the proposals for dealing with cases where, because of <i>force majeure</i> or exceptional circumstances occurring before or during the reference period, a farmer's production was adversely affected during the reference period. In such circumstances the farmer is entitled to request that the reference amount be calculated on the basis of the calendar year or years in the reference period not affected by the case of <i>force majeure</i> or exceptional circumstances. If the whole of the reference period was affected, there is provision for calculating the reference amount on the basis of the 1997-99 period.</P>
      <P>I am satisfied that these provisions adequately cater for farmers in the Cooley Peninsula who were unfortunately compulsorily depopulated in 2001 because of the outbreak of foot and mouth disease. I am aware of the Deputy's personal interest and concern about this issue. If particular cases were brought to his attention, he should bring these to the attention of the Minister. I am sure that the circumstances I outlined will cover the case generally for farmers in the Cooley Peninsula.</P>

      <P>I thank the Chair for the opportunity to address this issue. I have a vested interest in this issue as I have worked in a disadvantaged school in the north inner city area of Dublin for more than 20 years. I have many friends and colleagues working there doing and performing a great service for people. I am proud of the teachers who have dedicated their careers and lives to work in such areas. Over the years these teachers have shown great compassion, understanding, dedication and the radical vision of dealing with major changes in our society. I want the Minister to recognise that reality and support my request.</P>
      <P>We must reward dedication, integrity and, above all, good practice and quality professionalism in the education service. This is the only way forward. We have to show vision but, above all, we must make provision. The vision has got to be accompanied by provision. We must listen to the teachers on the ground in disadvantaged areas. Their views are important and their ideas would make a significant contribution to the elimination of disadvantage in our society.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="888" />Once known as the land of saints and scholars, Ireland is today better known as the land of scandals and tribunals. Politics, banking, the church, business, health, the law and the Garda have all suffered an erosion of public confidence. Ireland has undergone rapid social and economic change, yet a section of our people has been left behind. This shows us that we have to look at the ethics and values in contemporary Ireland. We have to make tough decisions in the interests of the people left behind and we have to look after our teachers who are in the frontline. These teachers are our educators, social workers, football coaches, artists and sometimes defenders of children at risk, and they must get our support. We must recognise the ongoing crisis in the recruitment and retention of staff in designated disadvantaged schools. I call on the Minister to support the Irish National Teachers Organisation, INTO, in its demands for an allowance payable to teachers in disadvantaged schools comparable with that paid to teachers with a special duties post, and an early retirement scheme for teachers serving these schools based on an additional year's full pension and lump sum credits for every eight years served by a teacher in a disadvantaged school.</P>
    <P>These are sensible and practical proposals and I urge the Minister and the Department to listen to the views of the INTO on the issue. If he does, he will take radical steps and invest in the future and a quality education service for poor children. We would all win in such a situation. It is similar to the debate that took place on free second level education. Many of us present are the products of that decision and vision. We need to reward initiative, good practice and courage. This debate is about these matters.</P>
    <P>I agree that we must be more focused as there have been too many pilot schemes. We need to provide stability in disadvantaged schools which must be funded and resourced because that is the way forward. There is too much coming and going. As we know, stability and support are the ways to deal with difficult children. Hence the teacher is a major factor in the equation. That is the reason there is an urgent need for this allowance. It would be a way of saying, &ldquo;Thank you,&rdquo; for the extra effort, rewarding good practice and another key step in breaking the cycle of educational disadvantage.</P>
    <P>I do not want to hear any more of the whingers in Cabinet say it would be a waste of public money. It would not; it would be a small investment in the future of the education system for greater returns. This is a chance for the Minister to make his mark on education. He should take a clear, progressive and correct view by putting a little extra public money into disadvantaged schools. An allowance of &euro;5,000 would be a small price to pay. We now have 1,587 pupils in the Early Start programme and 2,320 in Giving Children an Even Break schemes. These are excellent projects but we need to ensure their stability by retaining teachers. The best way to do this is by <Col N="889" />caring for them. They also need an even break and our support.</P>
    <P>I urge the Minister to implement this recommendation. It is a positive, progressive and common sense proposal to assist disadvantaged schools.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamAylward" hpid="Mr. Aylward Mr. Aylward">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aylward</NameTxt>
      <P>On behalf of the Minister for Education and Science, I thank the Deputy for raising this matter.</P>
      <P>Dealing with educational disadvantage remains a key priority of the Government. The Department of Education and Science has introduced a range of key interventions and programmes in primary schools aimed directly at tackling the problem. An Agreed Programme for Government sets out a commitment to implement changes to retention and support policies which will assist schools in areas of significant disadvantage to recruit and retain teachers.</P>
      <P>The Department is committed to providing support for teachers in all primary schools. Following negotiations with teacher representatives, there have been many improvements in the conditions of service of teachers in recent times. These include the introduction of release time for teaching principals, improvements in conditions for the appointment of administrative principals, the introduction of payments in respect of supervision duties and the provision of increased substitute cover for absences.</P>
      <P>The Department is in ongoing discussion with teacher representatives concerning the conditions of service of primary teachers. The recruitment and retention of teaching staff present a difficulty for many boards of management due to the current shortage. The difficulty is not confined to disadvantaged schools. The action being taken to increase teacher supply generally will ensure the current difficulties in teacher supply will be eliminated. The difficulties experienced are aggravated by the number of teachers availing of the career break and job sharing schemes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While the action being taken to increase teacher supply generally will also be of assistance to schools in areas of disadvantage, the Department will consider other possibilities. In this regard and in the context of the commitment referred to in the programme for Government, the Minister has recently received the report of a sub-group of the statutory committee on disadvantage. This group examined the issue of recruitment and retention of teachers within schools in disadvantaged areas. The report makes recommendations relating to a wide range of issues affecting schools in disadvantaged areas such as enhanced administrative assistance, additional allowances for teachers, in-career development focused on positive intervention in educational disadvantage, expansion of the employee assistance service, teacher training, pupil profile and research focusing on teachers working in disadvantaged settings and pupils in such schools to assist with a more comprehensive approach to and tracking of the individual's progress through <Col N="890" />the education system. The report is being considered in the Department. Following this process, officials from the Department will consult the partners in education in this regard.</P>
    <P>All issues relating to pay and conditions of teachers are matters for the Teachers Conciliation Council. The parties to the council are the management bodies, the teacher unions and the Departments of Education and Science and Finance. Any proposals for additional allowances for teachers would have to be and will be dealt with in the context of public sector pay policy.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Crawford</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Ceann Comhairle for allowing me to raise this important issue and the Minister of State for attending to reply. I hope it is the right one.</P>
      <P>The medical service is in a serious and traumatic position, not just in Monaghan General Hospital but also nationally. It is because of the recent announcement at national level that I was forced to raise this issue once again. It is only six to seven weeks to the anniversary of the removal of Monaghan General Hospital from an on-call position. We were promised by the Minister at that stage that he would get something done as quickly as possible. Some of my colleagues said to the media that the on-call service would reopen in a few days. I did not believe it could at the time and genuinely did not believe the Minister was saying that to me but I certainly did not believe for one second that he would allow it to remain closed for almost a year.</P>
      <P>I was one of those who welcomed the appointment of Mr. Kevin Bonner as an independent outside consultant. I sought it from more than 18 months ago until now. It scares me that this has continued for so long and we have no indication yet when his report will be published and the new structures put in place.</P>
      <P>As far as young doctors are concerned, 1 July is D-Day which is approaching again with no positive decisions worked out. I welcome that the nurses' union, through the work of nurse Catherine Quigley, obtained a positive decision at its meeting in Galway when she made a proposal that Monaghan General Hospital be reopened. It is good to see some of the unions and others coming behind the people of Monaghan on this issue. However, when one sees personnel in hospitals such as St. Vincent's making it clear that, with their difficulties, they should not admit any patients from the country, one realises the seriousness of the situation for a constituency such as mine, Cavan-Monaghan, and especially for Monaghan with its hospital which is no longer on-call.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The staff in Monaghan General Hospital are doing a good job in as much as they are allowed to and can do an excellent one if given the opportunity. The theatre is brand new and modern. The personnel are half idle because they are not allowed do the work. Monaghan patients are <Col N="891" />being sent to God knows where to be treated. That is all right to some extent when the Mater, St. Vincent's, St. James's, Beaumont and others admit patients but if they decide not to, where will the waiting lists be?</P>
    <P>I cannot help mentioning a strategy document brought forward in 1999. It reminds me of one we received on Monaghan General Hospital in 1997 when we were promised everything and that all issues would be brought forward. This country has come through the Celtic tiger since and nothing has happened. The strategy document to which I referred comes from the Isle of Man where a group of us, through the British-Irish Inter-Parliamentary Body, went last week. The difference is that this document which was a proposal in 1999 is now a reality. It is a 314 bed, ultra-modern hospital with six theatres providing a service for 76,000 people, and has been funded and paid for. There is a bank loan against it but investments made by the health board over the years will pay for it. There will be a brand new hospital in July 2003 with no debts, and a full complement of staff has already been allocated.</P>
    <P>What are we doing wrong in this country? I represent a population of 110,000 to 120,000 people. We pay our taxes &ndash; the Border region pays more than its fair due because people come across the Border in droves to buy petrol and other products. We are putting a lot more into the Exchequer than the population figure would suggest. If the Isle of Man can be successful in this regard, a small country run by the people themselves, I believe we must re-examine the structure of our health boards and the way our country is run to ensure that we have a proper health service. It was stated there was a problem on the Isle of Man &ndash; some people were waiting for hip replacements for up to six months.

      <P>It is a matter for the board to determine the nature and level of service provision at the hospital, consistent with the board's commitment to the provision of a high quality, efficient and cost-effective service across the north-eastern region. The Deputy will be aware that Mr. Kevin Bonner, management consultant and former Secretary General of the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, has been commissioned to advise, <i>inter alia,</i> on an appropriate management structure for Monaghan hospital and to assist the board in implementing this structure. He is also working with the board to facilitate the resolution of outstanding issues pertaining to the provision of services at the hospital, including emergency services. It is anticipated that Mr. Bonner's report will be finalised in the coming weeks.</P>
      <P>The recommendations of his report will assist in determining the future configuration of services under the Cavan-Monaghan Hospital Group. The Minister is assured by the North Eastern Health Board of its continuing commitment to the future provision and development of services at Monaghan hospital. The Minister considers it essential that all parties involved play their part to resolve the present difficulties and to assure the future delivery of services at the hospital as an integral part of the existing Cavan-Monaghan Hospital Group. The Minister is advised that in working towards a resolution to the current difficulties at Monaghan hospital, the board is being guided by professional clinical advice. The board has advised that in the solution to these difficulties regard will need to be had to advice from professional bodies, including the Royal College of Physicians in Ireland, the Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland, the College of Anaesthetists, the Medical Council and Comhairle na n-Ospidéal.</P>
      <P>The board's overriding objective is to ensure the provision of safe and sustainable hospital services at Monaghan as part of the Cavan-Monaghan Hospital Group. My officials are working closely with the ERHA and the DATHS and have entered into a process to try to resolve the difficulties that we are facing in this area this year.</P>

Substantial progress has been made on preparation of legislative proposals in this regard and I would hope to put these to Government shortly. Among my proposals will be a provision that certain forms of action will require the support of sworn affidavits so as to create liability in perjury for fraudulent claims and a provision to allow the courts to make orders to deal with those who make false and exaggerated claims.</P>

      <P>First, it is clearly a matter of the greatest regret that any person, for whatever reason, should lose his life in this way and it is right that we should convey our condolences to the friends and family of the man concerned.</P>
      <P>Moving from the circumstances of the individual case &ndash; and I think it right in all the circumstances that we should not focus on the particular case which has been the subject already of an inquest &ndash; I think it is not unreasonable, as a general observation, to say that even those who have extensive medical training can sometimes miss the signs that somebody is quite ill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am informed by the Garda authorities, who are responsible for the training of Garda members, that first aid is a compulsory element of the physical education, health and safety studies module of the student-probationer education-training programme. In order to progress in the <Col N="894" />student Garda education training programme each student must attain pass standard of competence in first aid.</P>
    <P>The first aid course delivered adequately, equips each student to identify and render basic first aid at the scene of an accident or emergency. The course covers a wide variety of injuries and illnesses. Up to now, the identification of a stroke victim has not been specifically covered on the course but the course is now being extended to include stroke identification.</P>
    <P>It is not possible to provide first aid training to meet all eventualities and emergencies. Garda regulations provide that medical assistance be summonsed for a person where it appears to the member that such assistance is required.</P>

      <P>As I have previously informed the Deputy, at 5.50 a.m. on 30 October 2001, a family member of the person in question telephoned Cahirciveen Garda station to report the death of this person at the family home. The gardaí went immediately to the scene, and, based on their initial observations and the circumstances of the report, the scene was preserved and a request was made for the services of the State Pathologist and a team from the Garda Technical Bureau.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The district officer at Cahirciveen took charge of the investigation, and inquiries were carried out to establish the last known movements of the <Col N="895" />deceased. The scene was also examined by the State Pathologist, who subsequently carried out a post-mortem examination on the body at Tralee General Hospital. At the inquest, the cause of death was initially given as hypothermia as a result of acute ethanol intoxication and later in the inquest as acute ethanol intoxication and possibly cardio myopathy. The State Pathologist stated that the injuries were consistent with a number of falls with no evidence of assault. The deceased had a concentration of 327 mgs of alcohol per 100 mls of blood and 439 mgs of alcohol per 100 mls of urine.</P>
    <P>The Garda investigation concluded that he received his injuries as a result of a fall within the vicinity of his home. All statements relative to this investigation were forwarded to the coroner, who set a date for the inquest for Tralee courthouse on 30 September 2002. This was adjourned to the courthouse at Listowel on 11 November 2002, where a Garda superintendent represented the State. After 22 witnesses gave evidence, the coroner's court was adjourned again to 11 December 2002, when a further 12 witnesses gave evidence. The jury returned a unanimous open verdict stating that the person in question died on 30 October 2001.</P>
    <P>The person in question had been released from Garda custody the previous day but I am not aware of any evidence that his unfortunate death was in any way connected with this.</P>
    <P>In accordance with the provisions of the Coroners Act 1962, a coroner is a statutory officer exercising judicial or quasi-judicial functions, in relation to which he or she is independent. It would not therefore be appropriate for me to comment further on the conduct of, or the verdict in, this case.</P>
    <P>In the light of the issues raised, I have asked the Garda Commissioner for a further report on the matter.</P>

      <P>The personnel strength, all ranks, of the Garda Síochána as at 8 May 2003 is 11,783. This represents an increase of 815 or 7.4% since 31 December 1997.</P>
      <P>As this House will be aware, the Cabinet has authorised the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to make the greatest possible use of the existing capacity of the Garda Training College in Templemore over the next two years to bring the strength of the force to 12,200, its current authorised maximum strength.</P>
      <P>Currently Garda applicants are being recruited from the 2002 competition for Garda trainees. In the year to date, 318 Garda trainees have commenced training in the Garda college, Templemore. They are due to be attested to the force in 2004. Two more intakes of Garda trainees totalling 342 are projected for the latter half of 2003. It is anticipated that the first successful candidates from the competition for selection of Garda trainees in 2003 will commence training in September 2003 and will be attested to the force in November 2004. The commissioner has projected, based on the anticipated rate of retirement, that this level of recruitment will result in the maximum authorised strength of 12,200 being achieved during 2004.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have already told this House that I will not be content with raising the strength of the Garda Síochána to an historic high of 12,200, and higher again as soon as budgetary circumstances permit the Government to make progress towards the target of 14,000 provided in the programme for Government for achievement by 2007. I also intend to increase, as soon as circumstances permit, the number of Garda members available for <Col N="897" />front-line policing through a process of civilianisation.</P>
    <P>Effective law enforcement and the maintenance of public order is not, of course, achieved simply by increasing Garda numbers. A range of solutions and innovations across the criminal justice system as a whole must be invoked as society changes and new challenges arise. I look forward to the full co-operation of the House as I continue to address those challenges.</P>

      <Quest>the action he has taken or intends to take on foot of the report received from the Garda Commission into the treatment of two persons (details supplied) arrested in Grafton Street in April 1998 who received an apology and undisclosed damages in a settlement announced in the High Court on 12 July 2002; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. McDowell Mr. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. McDowell)</NameTxt>
      <P>As the question itself notes, the State settled the case taken against it by the two persons concerned, paid damages, and in a statement in court expressed regret at what had happened and accepted that the persons concerned were of unblemished character.</P>
      <P>The Garda Commissioner has concluded his examination of the incident and the subsequent handling of the case and, while he does not propose to initiate disciplinary proceedings, particularly taking into account the lapse of time and the retirement of certain Garda personnel, his report accepts that the subsequent handling of this incident by members of the Garda Síochána left a lot to be desired. It is, of course, a matter for the commissioner to initiate such proceedings &ndash; I do not have a discretion to do so.</P>
      <P>Perhaps the aspect of this case, apart from the original incident, where there is a conflict of accounts, that could most give rise to concern in people's minds is a perception of a potential conflict of interest in circumstances where a garda is involved in initiating a prosecution against a person for an assault on him or her, and that this is all the more so where that person has made a complaint against that garda. Most people would see such a situation, no matter what the facts, as inherently unsatisfactory, as I do.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On this point, and arising from the investigation into this case, a directive has been issued by the Assistant Commissioner in the Dublin metropolitan region requiring that, in any case of alleged assault on a garda, an independent member of at least sergeant rank should prepare the subsequent file. Supervisors will ensure that any charges are correct and adequately reflect the circumstances of the alleged assault. The completed file is to be submitted for the information and directions of the district officer, who in appropriate cases is to submit the file to the Director of <Col N="898" />Public Prosecutions. Emphasis has also been placed on the importance of dealing promptly and professionally with all correspondence involving such cases. I should explain here that the system outside the Dublin Metropolitan Region is different and already provides for independent scrutiny of proposed prosecutions, usually at superintendent level.</P>
    <P>I believe that this is a welcome procedural safeguard to ensure the appropriateness and correctness of charges in circumstances where there could otherwise be a perception of a potential conflict of interest. In addition, and in a development which should further address any such concerns, consultation is now under way between the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions and the Garda authorities in relation to procedures for prosecutions for assault on members of the force.</P>
    <P>This was a very regrettable case, and many people may well consider the outcome, taking everything together, to be unsatisfactory. I hope, however, that lessons have been drawn and procedures put in place to ensure that any such case in the future is dealt with in a proper and professional manner.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 138 and 410 together.</P>
      <P>The provisional figures for 2002 are a cause for concern. While the statistics are still undergoing a validation process within the Garda organisation &ndash; and are not, therefore, final figures &ndash; it is not expected that the validated figures will differ significantly from this provisional data.</P>
      <P>On the publication of the provisional statistics for 2002, I gave a commitment in the Oireachtas that the preliminary crime figures would be made available on a quarterly basis as soon as possible after the end of each quarter, and I was, therefore, pleased to publish the statistics for the first quarter of this year as soon as I received them from the Garda Commissioner.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The significant reduction of 9% over the same quarter in 2002 revealed in those statistics is welcome news. It is to be hoped that this is an indication of a return to falling crime figures. However, as I stated last week, it would be precipitate to <Col N="899" />draw too many conclusions from a change in any one quarter.</P>
    <P>I am strongly supportive of specialised and focused Garda operations, such as Operation Encounter, to counter late night disorder and is determined that the resources of the entire criminal justice system are used effectively to combat crime. I will continue to ensure that the gardaí have all necessary powers to tackle this problem, and will consider carefully recommendations for legislative changes which have been made in recent reports, including the report on public order published by the National Crime Council on 9 May.</P>
    <P>As the Deputy is aware the Criminal Justice (Public Order) Bill is currently awaiting debate in the Seanad. I also intend to bring forward shortly a new Intoxicating Liquor Bill, which will respond to certain of the recommendations in the Crime Council's report, as well as the strategic task force on alcohol's interim report of May 2002, and those contained in the reports of the Commission on Liquor Licensing.</P>

      <P>The published revised 2003 Estimates determined the total amount of funds available for the Garda Vote. It is a matter for Garda management to determine the allocation of funds to Garda divisions. Notwithstanding the pressures placed upon divisional budgets arising from major security operations, the Garda Síochána is obliged to manage the resources at their disposal to ensure that the Garda Vote remains within the Estimates envelope.</P>
      <P>The Garda Síochána has been provided with an annual budget of &euro;964 million for 2003 representing an increase of over 60% on the 1997 budget allocation.</P>
      <P>I have previously commented as to the adequacy of the provision of Garda resources this year, and has stated that the priority will be to maintain the existing level of front line policing services to the public by focusing on key services, increasing efficiency and getting best value for money.</P>

      <P>I expect to have a Bill published during this session which will provide a new statutory mechanism for investigations, to be known as commissions of investigation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The legislation will be of general application. It will not be establishing a single or permanent investigations body. Instead, it is foreseen that <Col N="901" />commissions will be established as required and more than one could be operating at any given time.</P>
    <P>Having said that, it is true that the proposal for a new mechanism was informed, in the first instance, by the public concern over the handling by the Dublin Catholic archdiocese of allegations of clerical sexual abuse and by the meetings and useful discussions which I had with victims' organisations, representatives of the Catholic hierarchy, the Conference of Religious in Ireland, and other affected parties. While I believe that the new procedure could provide a means of examining, for example, the systems in place within the Catholic Church for the handling of allegations and complaints, I am of the view that it would be premature to make a decision on the establishment of any commission of investigation prior to the enactment of the proposed legislation.</P>
    <P>I would, nevertheless, like to make clear that a commission of investigation, should one be established, will not replace or interfere with the processes of the criminal law for the investigation and prosecution of offences.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 143, 144 and 155 together.</P>
      <P>I am considering a number of measures to strengthen the operational capacity of the Garda Síochána. In this regard, the merit of establishing a Garda reserve force will be among the measures considered in the context of proposals which I am advancing for Garda reform, increased accountability and improved investigative powers, to provide for a significantly enhanced modern police service.</P>
      <P>With regard to the question of resources for the Garda Síochána generally, it is my intention to make progress towards the target strength of 14,000 for the Garda Síochána provided in the programme for Government for achievement by 2007 as soon as budgetary circumstances permit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As a first step in this process, this House will be aware that I have been authorised by the <Col N="902" />Cabinet to make the greatest possible use of the existing capacity of the Garda Training College in Templemore over the next two years to bring the strength of the force to 12,200, its current authorised maximum strength. While it will not be possible to increase numbers beyond that point for as long as the cap on public service numbers remains in place, this in itself will represent an all time record level of strength.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 145, 182 and 197 together.</P>
      <P>The current strength of the force stands at approximately 11,800.</P>
      <P>As this house will be aware, I have been authorised by the Cabinet to make the greatest possible use of the existing capacity of the Garda Training College in Templemore over the next two years to bring the strength of the force to 12,200, its current authorised maximum strength. While it will not be possible to increase numbers beyond that point for as long as the cap on public service numbers remains in place, this in itself will represent an all time record level of strength.</P>
      <P>A new Garda recruitment competition is under way. It is planned that 660 Garda trainees will be taken into the Garda college during 2003. The commissioner has projected, based on the anticipated rate of retirement, that this level of recruitment will result in the maximum authorised strength of 12,200 being achieved during 2004.</P>
      <P>I have already told this House that he will not be content with raising the strength of the Garda Síochána to an historic high of 12,200, and higher again as soon as budgetary circumstances permit the Government to make progress towards the target of 14,000 provided in the programme for Government for achievement by 2007. I also intend to increase, as soon as circumstances permit, the number of Garda members available for front-line policing through a process of civilianisation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Effective law enforcement and the maintenance of public order is not, of course, achieved simply by increasing Garda numbers. A range of <Col N="903" />solutions and innovations across the criminal justice system as a whole must be invoked as society changes and new challenges arise. I look forward to the full co-operation of the House as he continues to address those challenges.</P>

      <P>As regards the size of licensed premises, the Commission on Liquor Licensing has expressed concerns in its final report concerning the recent proliferation of very large licensed premises. These tend to create noise and nuisance for local residents and make compliance with and enforcement of the licensing laws much more difficult.</P>
      <P>As a means of countering this trend, the commission has recommended the creation of an additional &lsquo;small premises' licence for new entrants to the licensed trade. This recommendation, together with other structural reforms recommended by the commission, will be considered in the context of the codification of the licensing laws.</P>
      <P>While the commission did not recommend imposing a statutory limit on the size of licensed premises, this is a matter which could also be explored in the codification context. Any such provision would have implications for planning law and would have to be discussed in the first instance with the Department of the Environment and Local Government.</P>

      <P>I am familiar with the survey referred to by the Deputy and agree that there is, without doubt, cause for concern in the material revealed. However, the methodology utilised to analyse the data is unclear. The most comprehensive victimisation survey to date was carried out <Col N="904" />as part of the Quarterly National Household Survey conducted by the Central Statistics Office in late 1998 which found that 63% of all assaults are reported to the gardaí. Over one-quarter of those who did not report an assault did not consider it important enough to do so. It is difficult to reconcile this with the numbers set out in the newspaper article.</P>
      <P>I am strongly supportive of the need for properly researched data in this area. I therefore obtained Government approval for a proposal to conduct national crime victimisation surveys every two years. These will provide an important source of information on the incidence of criminal victimisation complementary to that in the Garda Commissioner's annual report. As a result, a more comprehensive picture on crime will emerge in the medium to long-term.</P>
      <P>It is intended that the first survey will be conducted in 2004 and will involve sampling thousands of households and persons to determine their experiences of crime-related matters. In particular, it is anticipated that the survey results will provide an empirically sound evaluation of the level of unreported crime, which, of course, is an internationally observed phenomenon.</P>
      <P>With regard to increasing the Garda presence on the streets, I have been authorised by the Cabinet to make the greatest possible use of the existing capacity of the Garda Training College in Templemore over the next two years to bring the strength of the force to 12,200, its current authorised maximum strength. While it will not be possible to increase numbers beyond that point for as long as the cap on public service numbers remains in place, this in itself will represent an all time record high.</P>
      <P>I also intend to increase, as soon as circumstances permit, the number of Garda members available for front-line policing through a process of civilianisation.</P>
      <P>In addition, I am strongly supportive of specialised and focused operations to counter late night disorder such as Operation Encounter, which came into force on 23 February 2002 and is focused on all issues of public order occurring in the community.</P>
      <P>I will continue to ensure that the gardaí have all necessary powers to tackle this problem, and will consider carefully recommendations for legislative changes which have been made in recent reports, including the report on public order published by the National Crime Council on 9 May.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy is aware the Criminal Justice (Public Order) Bill is currently awaiting debate in the Seanad.</P>
      <P>I also intend to bring forward shortly a new Intoxicating Liquor Bill, which will respond to certain of the recommendations in the reports of the Commission on Liquor Licensing, as well as those in the Crime Council's report and the interim report of the strategic task force on alcohol of May 2002.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. McDowell Mr. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. McDowell)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 149, 168 and 190 together.</P>
      <P>In accordance with section 28 of the Parental Leave Act 1998 and a commitment in the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness, my Department chaired a working group which undertook a review of the Parental Leave Act 1998 in 2001. The working group comprised the social partners, relevant Departments and the Equality Authority. The report of the working group on the review of the Parental Leave Act 1998 was published on 29 April 2002. During the course of its deliberations, the working group considered both the paternity leave and parental leave schemes in operation in other EU member states, including the proposal to introduce paid paternity leave in Britain which is now in place. The various schemes are detailed in the working group's report which is available on my Department's website at www.justice.ie.</P>
      <P>Comparison between parental leave provisions in member states is difficult as some member states have a range of schemes which serve the purpose of providing leave from work for child-minding purposes. It can be difficult to ascertain what may be classified as parental leave in terms of the EU Parental Leave Directive and what may not. However, an examination of the parental leave regimes across the EU shows that the parental leave provisions differ widely. For example, in Sweden, part of the full-time parental leave period, until the child is 18 months old, would be classified as maternity leave in other member states. Also, the parental leave entitlement is the combined entitlement of the mother and the father rather than an individual entitlement in some member states. The manner in which parental leave may be taken in member states also varies from full-time, part-time, single block leave periods to a broken leave format, or a combination of the aforementioned leave types. The maximum age of the child, the payment, if any, available, the employment rights and general administration procedures in relation to the parental entitlement also vary greatly between member states. Furthermore, collective agreements in some member states provide for entitlements beyond the statutory minima.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Framework Agreement on Parental Leave, which was incorporated into Directive 96/34/EC, represents an undertaking by Euro<Col N="907" />pean Social Partners. The directive does not provide that parental leave provision in member states must attract payment. However, member states are allowed the option of providing more favourable provisions than those set out in the Directive. Parental leave is unpaid in Greece, Ireland, the Netherlands, Portugal, Spain and the United Kingdom. In France, parental leave allowance is only available in respect of the second and subsequent children. In Belgium, if leave is taken under the career break scheme, and the employee is replaced, the leave taker is entitled to an allowance from the unemployment benefit scheme. Parental leave is paid in Austria, Denmark, Finland, Germany, Italy, Luxembourg and Sweden.</P>
    <P>The working group which reviewed the Act made 16 recommendations, ten of which were agreed and six were by majority. Among the six majority recommendations, it was recommended that employees should have a statutory entitlement to three days paid paternity leave per child, payable by employers, and that parental leave should attract payment. The Equality Authority supported both of these majority recommendations.</P>
    <P>The working group did not reach consensus on the principle of paid parental leave and accordingly, did not address all the possible options this raises. However, the potential cost of a social insurance payment for parental leave, based on the qualifying criteria for the maternity benefit scheme and a payment level equivalent to maternity benefit, was estimated by the Department of Social and Family Affairs in the context of the review of the Act.</P>
    <P>The potential cost per annum: social insurance payment in respect of parental leave based on the earnings related maternity benefit rate and a 90% parental leave uptake level by women and a 15% uptake level by men would amount to &euro;78.74 million; public sector employer costs &ndash; where the rate of payment for parental leave to public sector employees is full pay, similar to maternity leave, the cost to public sector employers, net of Department of Social and Family Affairs reimbursements in respect of full PRSI contributors, would amount to &euro;50.5 million; and the total cost to the Social Insurance Fund and the Exchequer if parental leave attracted a payment on the same basis as maternity leave is estimated to amount to &euro;129.24 million.</P>
    <P>In relation to paternity leave, the cost implications for employers, both in terms of the absence of the father from the workplace and the monetary cost arising in the event of such leave being paid by employers, were considered by the review group. Concern was expressed in relation to the adoption of any new measure which would result in increased costs for employers in view of the current economic climate and the need to maintain international competitiveness. It was counter-argued that fathers should have a legal right to paternity leave and that such leave should attract payment. A statutory arrangement to <Col N="908" />allow for a father's entitlement to leave at the time of and-or immediately after childbirth would enhance arrangements for the reconciliation of work and family life.</P>
    <P>In the context of the review of the Parental Leave Act, the annual cost of three days paternity leave paid by employers was roughly estimated at &euro;12 million based on the number of children born in 2000 and the average industrial wage rate at that time. Of course, this estimate assumes that for every birth, the father is in employment and takes the full period of leave. Extrapolating this out to two weeks paid paternity leave, as is available in the UK would cost Irish employers &euro;40 million.</P>
    <P>The Government is committed under, Sustaining Progress &ndash; Social Partnership Agreement 2003-2005, to strengthening the parental leave scheme in line with the agreed recommendations of the social partners arising from the working group on the review of the Parental Leave Act 1998. The working group's recommendations are currently being examined in detail by my Department with a view to bringing concrete proposals to Government.</P>

      <P>In general, non-EEA workers who are not required to have a visa to travel to the State may be joined by their families at any time.</P>
      <P>In the case of non-EEA workers who require a visa to travel to the State, if they arrive under the work permit scheme they must be in employment in the State for 12 months and have been offered a contract for a further 12 months before they can be joined by their families. This 12 month waiting period has been reduced to three months in the case of certain high skilled workers. Workers who arrive under the working visa scheme, which was set up as a fast track recruitment scheme designed for designated sectors of the employment market where skill shortages are particularly acute, may be joined by their families after three months.</P>

      <P>Officials in my Department, together with representatives from the Garda Síochána and the Courts Service, have been actively examining this proposal and I am awaiting the outcome of their deliberations before forming a definitive view on the matter. I am aware, however, that similar proposals were piloted in a neighbouring jurisdiction with very mixed results. I would also wish to consider this matter in the context of the overall measures which might be taken to address the problems of late night public order offences and in light of more recent research and analysis such as that contained in the recently published report of the National Crime Council into Public Order Offences in Ireland.</P>
      <P>I am considering the use of fixed penalties procedure coupled with a formal caution in relation to lesser public order offences. If that procedure leads to significant reductions in court hearings, it may become a relevant consideration in assessing the usefulness or effectiveness of night courts.</P>

As part of that remit, the Department collects data in relation to the 3% target for employment of people with disabilities in the public service, excluding Civil Service data which is collected by the Department of Finance. Although the target has yet to be achieved, there has been a degree of progress over the last number of years.

    <P>The figures given for January 2000, January 2001 and January 2002 are provisional figures as returns are outstanding from a number of individual public service bodies. The annual survey relating to the statistics at 1 January 2003 is currently under way.</P>
    <P>Each Department is responsible for taking appropriate action to ensure that public bodies under its aegis achieve the 3% target. This principle was set down in the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness and is reinforced in Sustaining Progress which provides that:</P>
    <P>Civil and public service employers will implement agreed codes of practice for the employment of people with disabilities and promote employment opportunities for people with disabilities in line with the Government's 3% employment target.</P>
    <P>A monitoring committee established and chaired by the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform helps to monitor and guide progress in relation to the target. It has supported a number of initiatives in recent years including: approval of a draft code of practice for use in the public service and exploration of the options for common selection procedures for people with disabilities; raising awareness of the 3% target among, and giving information to chief executives, personnel officers and disability equality officers in the public service through a series of eight regional seminars, and publication of an information brochure; publication of a brochure designed to encourage people with disabilities to consider a career in the public service and promotion of this option at the Public Sector Careers Expo in April 2001; the commissioning of research on the issues and barriers relating to achievement of the target in six public service organisations &ndash; the report, published in Nov<Col N="911" />ember 2001 and titled, Research Project on the Effective Recruitment of People with Disabilities in the Public Service, provides an insight into some of the issues which hinder progress and includes recommendations to facilitate improvements; and in partnership with the Equality Authority, the launch of an employer resource pack on 3 December 2002 to assist public service employers in the recruitment and retention of people with disabilities. I am responsible for the 3% target for the employment of people with disabilities within the Civil Service.</P>
    <P>The annual survey of the position on the employment of staff with a disability in the Civil Service is being carried out by the Department of Finance at present. The December 2001 survey showed that 900 people with a disability were employed in the Civil Service &ndash; equivalent to 2.8% of total numbers.</P>
    <P>The Programme for Prosperity and Fairness included a commitment to reviewing the operation of the 3% employment target throughout the Civil Service. The Department of Finance commissioned Goodbody Economic Consultants to carry out research into the operation of the target and the career progression of people with a disability in the Civil Service. The resulting report is now available and provides a great deal of useful information about the position people with a disability working in the Civil Service. The report makes recommendations for practical steps which can be taken to make certain that the Government's policy operates effectively for the benefit of people with a disability.</P>
    <P>The Civil Service equality unit in the Department of Finance and the staff unions are now considering the proposals in detail with a view to improving the existing policy for the benefit of people with disability throughout their careers in the Civil Service.</P>

      <P>Both the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform and the Garda Síochána are represented on the high level group on road safety chaired by the Department of Transport which commissioned the review referred to by the Deputy. The group is currently in the process of formulating a revised strategy on road safety which will take account of the issues raised in the report.</P>
      <P>However, provisional figures indicate that over 300,000 speeding offences were detected by the Garda Síochána in 2002 and in 2003 over 40,000 such offences have been detected up to 31 March. This level of detections results from a substantial commitment of resources which is reaping benefits in terms of the number of lives saved and serious injuries prevented since the introduction of the penalty points system.</P>
      <P>I accept that we still have a problem with drivers who see fit to risk their own lives, and those of others, by driving at excessive speeds or engaging in drinking and driving. However, the statistics available to me strongly indicate that the increased level of enforcement by the Garda Síochána over recent years is having a positive effect on road casualties.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. McDowell Mr. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. McDowell)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy will be aware that a sum of &euro;17.075 million has been allocated to the Legal Aid Board this year. While this figure represents a slight decrease of 3% on the allocation last year, it still represents a significant increase in resources for the Legal Aid Board in recent years, up from &euro;10.563 million in 1997 to &euro;17.075 million in 2003, an increase of almost 62% over the period in question. In addition, of course, sanction for the board to employ additional full-time solicitors was also received during this period.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will appreciate that under section 5(1) of the Civil Legal Aid Act 1995, the function of the Legal Aid Board is to provide, from within the board's resources and subject to the other provisions of the Act, legal aid and advice in civil cases to persons who satisfy the requirements of the Act and the regulations made thereunder. In addition, under section 30 of the Act, responsibility for determining how legal services should be provided, including the location of law centres, the staffing required by these centres, and the use of private practitioners is a matter for the board.</P>
      <P>The Deputy may be aware that in early 2000, after a pilot test in the Dublin area, the Legal Aid Board extended a private practitioner's scheme nation-wide. The purpose of the private practitioner's scheme is to provide a complementary legal service to that which is already available from the board's permanent law centre network. This complementary service relates to certain family law matters in the district court namely, domestic violence, maintenance and custody-access.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I can inform the Deputy that in reviewing the use of the private practitioner's scheme, the board has decided that priority should be given to cases involving domestic violence and that other cases, where domestic violence is not an issue, will be referred to the board's law centres. I understand that where a domestic violence case <Col N="914" />which has been referred to a private practitioner includes matters concerning child access, custody and maintenance, these matters will also be dealt with by the private practitioner. I am informed by the Legal Aid Board that, in recent years, approximately 65% of the legal aid certificates issued included a domestic violence matter.</P>
    <P>I would also mention to the Deputy that, in relation to those applicants waiting for legal services, the board operates a procedure whereby priority is accorded for certain categories of cases over other cases, for example, domestic violence, child care, child abduction and cases where there are time limits. In these cases the application is dealt with immediately and such applicants are not placed on a waiting list. I understand that during 2001 such priority cases accounted for over 22% of the total caseload handled by the board.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. McDowell Mr. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. McDowell)</NameTxt>
      <P>The current position is that section 40 of the Intoxicating Liquor Act 1988 makes provision for the issue of age cards to persons who have attained the age of 18 years and who are therefore legally entitled to purchase and to consume alcohol in licensed premises. Detailed arrangements for the age card scheme are set out in the Intoxicating Liquor Act 1988 (Age Card) Regulations 1999.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="915" />This is a voluntary age card scheme and it is operated by the gardaí in order to assist licence holders to comply with legislative provisions relating to under-age consumption of intoxicating liquor by providing evidence of age where a doubt exists. As an incentive towards greater use of the scheme, the Intoxicating Liquor Act 2000 provides that in any proceedings against a licence holder for the sale of alcohol to an under-age person, it shall be a defence for the defendant to prove that an age card was sought and was produced by the person in respect of whom the charge is brought.</P>
    <P>In the context of the sharp increase in alcohol consumption by young people in recent years, consideration has been given to the possibility of making the age card compulsory for certain age groups when purchasing liquor. However, certain practical difficulties arise in this context. For example, it would be unreasonable to expect young tourists and visitors to this country to apply for the Garda card. An alternative approach, which I favour, would be to require all young people within a defined age category to carry some proof of age in licensed premises. The aim would be to assist licensees to comply with the licensing laws and the gardaí in enforcing them.</P>
    <P>In the coming weeks, I will be bringing a draft intoxicating liquor bill to Government in response to certain urgent recommendations of the Commission on Liquor Licensing. It will contain provisions designed to combat under-age and excessive consumption of alcohol, including a requirement that young people within a defined age group carry an evidence of age document on licensed premises. Pending publication and enactment of this legislation, I would urge the licensed trade to demand production of proof of age whenever there is doubt regarding a young person's age.</P>
    <P>As regards a possible future role for local authorities under the licensing laws, the Commission on Liquor Licensing recommended in its final report that it be given a role in determining the duration of special exemption orders in their respective areas. Specifically, it recommended that where, following consultation with relevant local interests including the gardaí, a local authority formally adopts a resolution concerning the duration of special exemption orders, the district court shall have regard to the content of the resolution in granting such orders. I intend to give effect to this recommendation in the Bill to which I have already referred. I should add that the commission did not recommend that local authorities be given a decisive role in determining the normal opening hours.</P>

      <P>The programme to which the Deputy refers is the follow up to the multi-annual, European Community action plan on promoting safer use of the Internet by combating illegal and harmful content on global networks. The original action plan, administered by the European Commission's Information Society Directorate General, covered a four year period from 1 January 1999 to 31 December 2002. It had a budget of &euro;25 million and had three main action lines: creating a safer environment by creating a European network of hotlines for the reporting of child pornography and encouraging self regulation and codes of conduct for the internet service provider industry; development of technical means of parental control &ndash; rating and filtering systems for on-line content; and promoting awareness actions by providing funding for awareness projects, aimed at teachers, parents and children.</P>
      <P>Some projects under the original action plan are still ongoing.</P>
      <P>In March 2002 the European Commission introduced a proposal to extend the existing plan for a further two years, from 1 January 2003 to 31 December 2004. Some new elements were introduced and several adjustments made to the way that the action plan has been implemented so far. These include: extending the coverage to new online technologies, including mobile and broadband content, online games, peer-to-peer file transfer and all forms of real time communication; more attention to other forms of illegal and harmful content on the Internet in addition to child pornography, such as racism and violence; more active involvement of industry; more networking among project participants; and the association of accession countries in ongoing activities, and projects to share experiences and know-how with them. A budget of &euro;13.3 million has been allocated for the extension. The European Parliament voted in favour of the proposed extension on 11 March 2003, and formal Council approval is expected in May or June of this year.</P>
      <P>The Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform provides the Irish representation on the action plan's programme committee.</P>
      <P>Several Irish projects have received support from the original action plan. A call for proposals for the new round of funding will be issued by the European Commission later in the year.</P>

      <P>On 23 January 2003 the Supreme Court gave its judgment in the cases of L and O which was that the Minister was entitled to deport the persons concerned who were the parents of Irish-born children.</P>
      <P>Since that date I have ceased accepting new applications from persons claiming a right to reside in Ireland based solely on the birth of a child.

      <P>At present the commission has a chief executive and four of its permanent administrative staff. It is now at an advanced stage of recruiting an additional six members which will bring its full staffing complement to ten, as it requested. I have already indicated that the commission's ability to service the public is limited until such time as it has its full complement of staff. However, I believe this stage will now be achieved fairly quickly. The commission recently published its strategic plan for 2003-06. The plan sets out key areas of work on which the commission proposes to focus over the next four years. The commission's budget for this year is &euro;1.28 million.</P>

      <P>During 2002, I advised the Garda Commissioner of policing priorities which the Government wishes to see addressed. The priorities have been incorporated into the Garda <Col N="918" />Síochána policing plan 2003. They include the objective of developing a strategic approach to policing and operational responsibilities in the areas of serious and organised crime.</P>
      <P>In implementing this objective, the targeting of areas of criminality, as well as of individuals and groups operating nationally, will continue to be priorities for the Garda Síochána. The areas of criminality targeted are, in particular, trafficking in illicit drugs and human beings, armed robbery, &ldquo;white collar&rdquo; crime, counterfeiting and high-tech crime, including child pornography. The co-ordination of this approach will be undertaken by the Garda national support services, in consultation with local units as appropriate.</P>
      <P>The Garda policing plan 2003, which is available in the Oireachtas Library, is the fourth of five annual policing plans to achieve the objectives of the Garda corporate strategy 2000-04. It sets out, in some detail, the strategic goals and performance indicators for the Garda Síochána in investigating crime generally, including serious and organised crime, and in implementing new and improved crime prevention measures.</P>
      <P>The strategy statements of the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, copies of which are also available in the Oireachtas Library, set out the range of challenging goals and activities across the broad spectrum of the Department's activities, including the delivery of the Government's comprehensive initiatives to tackle serious crime. The strategy statement for the period 2003-2005, which was approved recently by the Government, will be published in the very near future.</P>

      <P>Perjury, that is, the giving of false evidence on oath or affirmation, is an offence at common law, although a number of statutes also address matters incidental to the offence. The offence is committed by any person lawfully sworn as a witness or as an interpreter in a judicial proceeding who wilfully makes a statement, material in that proceeding, which he or she knows to be false or does not believe to be true. The maximum penalty is imprisonment for seven years.</P>
      <P>I am examining the present law relating to perjury in the context of false and exaggerated claims on which I will shortly publish legislative proposals. The Deputy may also wish to note that the question of putting common law offences, such as perjury, on a statutory basis will be one of the issues considered by the expert group on codification which is at present examining approaches to codification of all substantive criminal law in a new crimes Bill.</P>

It is proposed, in the context of implementation of the directives, to amend the current exclusion from the provisions of the Employment Equality Act 1998 in respect of employment in private households. The Government is committed in the new partnership agreement, Sustaining Progress, to have the amending legislation enacted as soon as possible.</P>

Three stations have remained static and 16 had a reduction in the number of personnel.

      <P>My understanding is that the results of the IBEC survey indicate that legal costs amount to 44% of the compensation award rather than of the total outlay on the claim. In any event, the Deputy will appreciate that I cannot verify this or other estimates, which must remain the responsibility of their authors, though I note that this finding is broadly in line with data contained in the report of the Motor Insurance Advisory Board. It should also be borne in mind that legal costs in this context relate not solely to legal fees but include other costs, such as medical and other expert witnesses and reports, as well.</P>
      <P>It is widely accepted that the cost of delivery of personal injury compensation is too high and the Government are proceeding with a comprehensive programme of measures to deal with this. In relation to my area of responsibility, substantial progress has been made on preparation of legislative proposals which are, in part, intended to address this problem and I will put these to Government very shortly. In addition, I have requested the Committee on Court Practice and Procedure, which is chaired by Mrs. Justice Susan Denham, judge of the Supreme Court, to examine all aspects of practice and procedure relating to personal injuries litigation and this work is well under way.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. McDowell)</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy is aware there are a number of issues involved here and I would like to tease out what I see as the respective roles and responsibilities of the existing agencies which are involved in dealing with the fallout of racism and racially motivated incidents.</P>
      <P>First and foremost, the Garda Síochána is the body responsible for dealing with the investigation and detection of criminal matters which, of course, includes racially motivated crime. In this regard the Garda Síochána established the Garda Intercultural Office which has the role of co-ordinating, monitoring and advising the force on all aspects of ethnic and cultural diversity as they impact on policing. The Garda authorities have also agreed a definition of a racially motivated incident and now have in place a nation-wide mechanism to record and gather information on racist incidents and offenders using the PULSE computer system.</P>
      <P>Second, at a general level within society, it is the role of the Equality Authority to promote the awareness of the overall equality framework, of which anti-racism measures are a constituent part. The authority works at many levels and with many bodies towards the elimination of racial discrimination and harassment within society. Furthermore, the Office of the Director of Equality Investigations &ndash; the Equality Tribunal &ndash; is the main body for investigating and mediating on cases of discrimination and harassment.</P>
      <P>Third, there is a system in place within the National Consultative Committee on Racism and Interculturalism to record racially motivated incidents. As the Deputy may be aware, the NCCRI is an independent body which is funded by my Department. The NCCRI is an umbrella organisation representing a range of NGOs and it operates a system of recording the number, type and location of racist incidents and also identifies emerging trends. The NCCRI publish its findings every six months and its third report, covering the period May to October 2002, was published recently. As I have said in the house before, the NCCRI is assisting my Department in the review of the Prohibition of Incitement to Hatred Act 1989.</P>
      <P>Finally, it is the role of my Department to monitor the situation and to recommend additional measures as appropriate. The Deputy will be aware of the many and relatively recent measures taken which have been developed by Government to deal with racism and racial discrimination. Legislation, such as, the Employment Equality Act 1998 and the Equal Status Act 2000 outlaw discrimination and harassment on nine grounds, including, race, religion and membership of the Traveller community.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The national anti-racism racism awareness programme, KNOW Racism, is in its third and final year and will be followed by the proposed <Col N="923" />national action plan against racism details of which are expected to be published before the end of this year. The action plan will provide an opportunity for debate on all issues relating to racism.</P>
    <P>In the light of the above, I am sure the Deputy will appreciate that there is a complex and sophisticated system in place to assist in dealing with the range of issues he is rightly concerned with. I have, accordingly, no plans for establishing another body to monitor and investigate race relations incidents.</P>

      <P>In the commission's report on admission and service in licensed premises published in December, it considered issues arising in relation to admission and service in licensed premises and made a series of recommendations for appropriate legislative changes. Following submission of the report, I announced that I would bring forward legislative proposals in response to the commission's urgent recommendations in relation to drunkenness and disorderly conduct on licensed premises. These proposals will form part of a package of measures which I will bring to Government in the coming weeks. It is not intended that the proposed provisions will be discriminatory towards any group.</P>
      <P>There has been a significant increase in alcohol consumption by young people in recent years. This is leading to increased alcohol related harm among young people. A policy response is required to combat this problem. I intend to address some of the issues in the package of measures that I have already mentioned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I intend to safeguard the discretion of licensees to exclude children under the age of 15 years <Col N="925" />from licensed premises, whether they are accompanied by a parent or not, at all times or at any time. Licensees should also have discretion to exclude 15 to 17 year olds from licensed premises at any or all times. In order to improve compliance with and enforcement of the licensing laws I intend to provide that young people within a defined age group must carry an evidence of age document on licensed premises.</P>
    <P>I intend to provide that licensees may set a minimum age limit higher than the current statutory minimum age limit of 18 years under equal status legislation for the sale and supply of intoxicating liquor. This is provided that the policy is clearly displayed in the premises concerned and that it is implemented in good faith. Consequently, a licensee would be free to operate a policy of not selling or supplying intoxicating liquor to persons under the age of, for example, 21. The Government has already approved the drafting of legislation to give effect to this latter proposal.</P>

      <P>The Garda authorities have informed me that the Garda Bureau of Fraud Investigation is aware of the proliferation of e-mails perpetrating fraud. Every day tens of thousands of e-mails are generated by criminal gangs in the hope that a small number of people will respond.</P>
      <P>This type of crime is a world-wide problem. The bureau liaises with law enforcement agencies around the world in attempting to prevent and detect such crime. It also liaises with Europol and Interpol in the international effort to target these criminal gangs.</P>
      <P>Fraud prevention advice is regularly and widely provided by the Garda to counteract these attempted fraudulent activities. Recently one gang was intercepted operating in Dublin and, as a result of an operation by the bureau, one UK national and two Nigerian nationals were sentenced to five years imprisonment after being found guilty at the Dublin Circuit Criminal Court. The bureau is not aware of any gangs operating in Ireland at present. Should information come to hand it will be investigated.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 178 and 384 together.</P>
      <P>Work is under way on the development of a computerised fixed charge processing system for the Garda Síochána to facilitate the introduction of an electronic system for notification of penalty point offences to the Department of the Environment and Local Government. The computer system will facilitate the implementation of the relevant provisions of the Road Traffic Act 2002. It is expected that implementation of the system will commence in the second quarter of 2004 with the progressive extension of it to cater for all penalty point offences taking place as quickly as possible. The Minister is satisfied that sufficient resources will be allocated by the Garda authorities to enable it to be implemented.</P>
      <P>A manual system for speeding offences is in place on an interim, administrative basis since the introduction of penalty points for speeding offences on 31 October 2002. This is a purely temporary measure pending the implementation of the computer system. The Minister has been informed by the Garda authorities that sufficient resources of personnel and equipment are being made available to operate the manual system. The Minister has also been informed that the operation of the manual system is kept under constant review by Garda management and that should further resources be required they will be provided.</P>
      <P>A breakdown of the number of gardaí and man hours involved in the manual system is not readily available. It could only be obtained by the expenditure of a disproportionate amount of Garda time and resources.</P>

      <P>A review of the maternity protection legislation was carried out in 2000 by a working group, chaired by my Department. It consisted of social partners and relevant Departments and agencies. The group was set up in accordance with commitments in the Government's programmes, An Action Programme for the Millennium and the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness. The report of the working group on the review and improvement of the maternity protection legislation was published in February 2001. During the course of its deliberations it considered the maternity leave schemes in operation at that time in other EU member states.</P>
      <P>Among its recommendations the group recommended an increase in the maternity leave entitlement, which attracts a payment from the Department of Social and Family Affairs, from 14 weeks to 18 weeks and an increase in the unpaid additional maternity leave entitlement from four weeks to eight weeks. These increases were announced in budget 2001 and implemented by means of the Maternity Protection Act 1994 (Extension of Periods of Leave) Order 2001 (S.I. No. 29 of 2001) with effect from 8 March 2001. Identical increases were simultaneously applied to the adoptive leave entitlement.</P>
      <P>During its deliberations in relation to the increase in the maternity leave periods, the group considered the benefits and costs to employers and to the economy generally. The benefit to employers and industry, to the extent that increased maternity leave periods facilitates the increased participation and retention of women in the labour force, was among the factors considered. The Irish Business and Employers Confederation, the Department of Finance and the Health Service Employers' Agency were represented on the group. Costs were taken into account when they agreed to the recommendations.</P>
      <P>The Maternity Protection (Amendment) Bill 2003 was published on 2 May and we aim to have the legislation enacted by the end of 2003. Its enactment will implement the outstanding recommendations of the maternity protection review group. It will fulfil a statutory component of the work-life balance programmes to which the Government is committed to under the Sustaining Progress agreement. The recently published Bill makes no provision for a further extension of the maternity leave periods beyond the improvements implemented in 2001. As a result, the implications for business of following the new UK model have not been considered.</P>

      <P>The joint committee of the two human rights commissions in both jurisdictions, North and South, has been established as provided for in the Good Friday Agreement and the underlying legislation, section 8(<i>i</i>) of the Human Rights Commission Act 2000. Several meetings of the committee have already taken place. Work arising from that commitment including, in particular, the question of establishing a charter on rights protection on an all Ireland basis has commenced. The Human Rights Commission in this jurisdiction has recently published its strategic plan for 2003-06. The plan sets out key areas of work on which it proposes to focus over the next four years, including the following: to work with the Northern Ireland Human Rights Commission, through the joint committee, to develop a charter of rights in line with the provisions of the Good Friday Agreement and engage in an inclusive consultation process on the charter.</P>
      <P>The HRC has informed me that the joint committee, at its meeting in Belfast on 11 April, agreed a pre-consultation document on a charter of rights for Ireland. It will be sent to a small number of organisations in both parts of Ireland. The pre-consultation document will present three types of charter which could be recommended and will indicate the committee's preferred option at this stage. The joint committee hopes that this pre-consultation process will be followed by the publication of a fully fledged consultation document before the end of 2003 or, at the latest, early in 2004.</P>

      <P>The Government has recognised the importance of early intervention as a measure to address the needs of children who may come before the courts or get in trouble with the law. This is clearly set out in objective one of the national children's strategy. Action has been taken to follow through on this objective.</P>
      <P>The Department of Health and Children is leading a review of family support services provided by the health boards. The review will make recommendations concerning the future development of family support services by the health boards and an enabling structure to facilitate prioritisation, access, delivery, development and integration with other services. Recently, the Family Support Agency has been established. Its functions include a family mediation service and the development of the family and community services resource centre programme.</P>
      <P>The Children Act 2001 is major legislation comprising 13 Parts with 271 sections. It introduces a wide range of innovative measures that will provide a statutory framework for the future development of the juvenile justice system in accordance with modern thinking and best international practice. Apart from young offenders, the Act also makes provision for addressing the needs of out of control non-offending children who are the responsibility of the health boards and who have been appearing in the courts in recent times.</P>
      <P>Three Departments have a role in implementing the Act; the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, the Department of Health and Children and the Department of Education and Science. The National Children's Office has responsibility to oversee its implementation and to co-ordinate regular working group meetings. During the passage of the Act through the Oireachtas it was made clear by the Government that implementation must take place on a phased basis given its complexities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Significant parts of the Act have already been commenced. The first commencement order under the Act in respect of my Department was signed by my predecessor on 23 April 2002. The order, which came into force on 1 May 2002, provided for, <i>inter alia: </i>the establishment of the <Col N="930" />Garda diversion programme on a statutory basis and the introduction of a diversion conference based on restorative justice principles as pioneered in New Zealand; the establishment of the Children Court; the introduction of a fines structure for children found guilty of offences and the payment of compensation by parents in respect of offences committed by their children; the introduction of a curfew for children found guilty of offences; court orders to parents to exercise proper control over their children; the updating of the law in relation to cruelty to children and persons who cause or encourage a sexual offence on a child; reversing the burden of proof on parents whose children are found begging; a limited clean slate in respect of most offences committed by children; and provisions relating to the safety of children at entertainments.</P>
    <P>Garda youth diversion projects are crime prevention initiatives which adopt a multi-agency partnership approach to tackling crime and anti-social behaviour at community level. The role of these projects is to bring about the conditions whereby the behavioural patterns of young people towards law and order can develop and mature through positive interventions and interaction with the project.</P>
    <P>The projects are particularly targeted at ten to 18 year old at risk youths in communities where a specific need has been identified. The number of participants in each programme varies according to the level of intervention required. At present there are a total of 64 Garda youth diversion projects operating in urban and rural areas. Funding of almost &euro;5 million was allocated to these projects in the year 2002.</P>
    <P>An emphasis is &ndash; and will continue to be &ndash; placed by the Prison Service on the rehabilitation of such young offenders in custody. Rather than focusing on committing young offenders to custody it is an underlying concept of the Children Act to expand the options a court will have at its disposal when deciding on how to deal with a young offender. These options are an essential feature of the Act as they will allow effect to be given to the principle that detention for young offenders will be a last resort. The Act envisages committals to custody of young offenders being availed of only in situations where other alternative diversions and community based options have been resorted to and have failed.</P>

      <P>I am informed by the Garda authorities that the total strength, covering all ranks, of the force as at 8 May is 11,783. As many as 660 trainee gardaí are due to be recruited and commence training in the Garda Síochána college in 2003. Of these, 318 have commenced training this year to date.</P>
      <P>As many as 169 gardaí covering all ranks have retired from the force between 1 January and 8 May. A further 73 are due to retire on compulsory age grounds between 8 May and 31 December.</P>
      <P>Due to the varied operational requirements of each Garda post and the changing nature of operational deployments to meet varying operational needs, it is not possible to specify the total number of gardaí required to staff each post. To maintain a Garda presence at a post requiring 24 hour cover it has been calculated that a personnel commitment of 5.17 gardaí is required.</P>
      <P>Garda personnel are deployed in a variety of shift patterns in order to maximise the available resources during periods of most demand. The number of Garda personnel on duty can vary from day-to-day and location to location according to the exigencies of the service. I have been informed by the Garda Commissioner that in 2002 there were a total of 2,301 gardaí available for duty at any one time out of a total Garda strength of 11,895.</P>

      <P>Last year a working group on the jurisdiction of the courts was established by the Courts Service Board. Its aim was to examine the existing jurisdiction of the courts of Ireland and make recommendations as to any changes which are desirable in the interests of the fair, expeditious and economic administration of justice. This included proposals for the establishment of new courts jurisdictions, whether appellate or first instance, for determining the appropriate number of judges for each jurisdiction and the supporting staffs required in such jurisdictions and for alterations in the quantitative or geographical limitations of existing jurisdictions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The group's work is being carried out in modules and the first module is on criminal jurisdiction. It will report shortly on this module. I will <Col N="932" />then consider the question of jurisdiction further in the light of its report, together with all available information.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. McDowell)</NameTxt>
      <P>Joyriding is a complex problem which, while requiring significant inputs from the criminal justice system, can only be tackled to lasting effect through a multifaceted and multi-agency response involving the community and relevant statutory bodies. A number of proven strategies are already in place to tackle the worst manifestations of the problem from a criminal justice perspective.</P>
      <P>A number of targeted policing operations have been instituted by local Garda management in areas that have been identified as potential hotspots of joyriding. Specialist Garda patrols and vehicles are concentrated in these areas and they are often assisted by the Garda air support unit when required.</P>
      <P>Members of the Garda Síochána regularly liaise with community groups in areas particularly prone to bouts of joyriding. Preventative projects are in operation in many of these areas to deal with those responsible, including a network of 64 Garda youth diversion projects and a number of probation and welfare service projects, most notably the auto-crime diversion project in Cork city.</P>
      <P>The Garda and local authorities work together in relation to estate management and reducing the opportunities for joyriding. For example, physical changes such as barriers and speed ramps are used to reduce access to areas frequented by youths engaged in these activities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Garda impound vehicles without tax and insurance and remove them to car compounds. In the Dublin metropolitan region there is a dedicated car compound located at the Talbot complex in Santry. Car compounds are also being <Col N="934" />provided at all newly built divisional-district Garda headquarters wherever the site allows.</P>
    <P>In relation to company cars, the Department of the Environment and Local Government has been actively engaged with the Society of the Irish Motor Industry, the Irish Motor Vehicle Recyclers Association, the Metal Recyclers Association of Ireland and other concerned parties with a view to developing a producer responsibility initiative to implement the main provisions of European Parliament and Council Directive 2000/53/EC on end-of-life vehicles. A particular objective of the directive is to ensure that all ELVs are collected, dismantled and recovered by the industry in an environmentally sound manner at no cost to the final holder.</P>
    <P>It is intended that the necessary legislative provisions to implement the directive will be incorporated, at an appropriate stage, in the Protection of the Environment Bill 2003. This Bill has been passed by the Seanad.</P>
    <P>The Garda authorities consider the provisions of the Road Traffic Acts 1961 to 2002 adequate to deal with situations where persons use or take possession of mechanically propelled vehicles without the consent of the owner.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. McDowell Mr. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. McDowell)</NameTxt>
      <P>I assume that the Deputy is referring to a proposal by the Irish Penal Reform Trust in its policy paper published in 2001, entitled Community Solutions to the Criminalisation of the Mentally Ill in Ireland, for the establishment of a mental health court system on the lines of similar initiatives undertaken in the United States, particularly in Alaska. This initiative involves a centrally organised co-ordination of court, agency and mental health resources. All offenders with a history of mental illness appear in these courts before judges who have special expertise in mental health issues. The judge is also responsible for co-ordinating the role of the court with the police, the prosecution, the defence and the mental health agencies.</P>
      <P>At present the Criminal Law (Insanity) Bill 2002 is awaiting Committee Stage in the Seanad. The Bill contains proposals to deal with certain aspects of this matter in the context of persons who come within the definition of criminal insanity in our criminal law and their referral by the courts to a designated centre as defined in it. This is in line with a recommendation in the Henchy report 1978.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill is not designed to alter the sentencing powers of courts to include treatment orders so <Col N="935" />that persons who are mentally ill, but who are not found to be criminally insane, charged with or convicted of a criminal offence could be sent to an appropriate local hospital instead of being committed to prison. I am generally in favour of moves to ensure the more appropriate placement of persons suffering from mental illness &ndash; as defined in the criminal law and otherwise. However, the proposal involves major policy and resource issues for my Department, the Prison Service, the Courts Service and, especially, the Department of Health and Children. My immediate priority is the early enactment of the Criminal Law (Insanity) Bill.</P>

      <P>The level of overtime worked in the Prison Service has long been the subject of discussion in this House. Within the past week I have arranged for a framework proposal to issue to staff representatives with a view to early negotiations on a new way forward. I expect the negotiations to deliver an agreement which will eliminate the unsustainable burden of chronic overtime and which will deliver a more efficient and cost effective Prison Service.</P>
      <P>The Irish Prison Service has invited the IPOA to discussions. These will take place within days once the association has had an opportunity to give the proposal preliminary consideration.</P>
      <P>The proposal involves the implementation of a programme of detailed staffing and work practice efficiencies together with the elimination of overtime working and the introduction of an annual hours system of attendance. This system envisages staff undertaking to work certain levels of additional hours which would be remunerated whether all the additional hours were required to be worked or not. This approach is designed to reinforce the attractiveness of more efficient working practices. The proposal also involves the payment of lump sums to staff over a three year period subject to the delivery of specific savings targets. In addition, the proposal outlines scope for organisational restructuring covering rationalisation of certain functions and greater focus on core and developmental roles of various grades.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="937" />The proposal is in the form of a negotiation document and it would not be helpful to go into detail now.</P>
    <P>In my speech at the recent annual conference of the IPOA I explained that this proposal must be considered and agreed within the next three months. This problem must be agreed by the end of July if the Prison Service is to keep within its allocated budget. If progress cannot be achieved I will have no choice but to address, what will by then represent, a critical situation.</P>
    <P>Much work has been done on which early progress can be built. Real advances can be made in forthcoming discussions with the IPOA and I look forward to a mutually satisfactory outcome to this process.</P>

      <P>My intentions regarding future changes in the licensing laws are as follows. In its second interim report, the Commission on Liquor Licensing advocated a codification of the entire intoxicating liquor code. I intend to act on this recommendation and the necessary preparatory work is already under way in my Department.</P>
      <P>Codification will involve a consolidation of licensing provisions, which are currently spread across many statutes, into a single instrument as well as reforms based on the commission's recommendations and the valuable work of the strategic task force on alcohol established by the Department of Health and Children. It is intended that the outline of the codification Bill will be available by mid-2004.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The commission made over 130 recommendations. The main thrust of them is directed towards a modernisation and streamlining of the licensing code, while recognising the need for compliance with and enforcement of its provisions. Many of the recommendations relate to overall structural reforms that will require policy decisions. More of them are of a detailed and technical nature that will necessitate consultation with other Departments and State bodies such as the Courts Service. With the exception of a number of urgent recommendations, the commission's <Col N="939" />recommendations for legislative changes will be addressed in the context of the codification exercise.</P>
    <P>Following submission in December of the Commission's report on admission and service in licensed premises, I announced my intention to bring forward legislative proposals to respond to its urgent recommendations in relation to drunkenness and disorderly conduct on licensed premises. In the meantime, I have decided to enlarge this package of proposals to include legislative responses to certain recommendations set out in the final report. In the coming weeks I will bring this package of proposals for an intoxicating liquor Bill to Government.</P>

To date the group has met 16 times. In November 2002 it reported to Government on its progress. In December 2002 the report was published on the website, www.betterregulation.ie. Copies have been placed in the Dáil Library. The report outlines progress made in relation to the OECD's recommendations on regulatory reform up to November 2002.</P>
      <P>Since the report was published work has continued in my Department and other Departments on the implementation of the OECD recommendations. Progress made to date on the implementation of sector specific recommendations are a matter for the relevant Minister. I draw the Deputy's attention to the answers to the Parliamentary Question answered by all Ministers on Tuesday, 15 April, on the progress made to date on the implementation of the OECD recommendations on regulatory reform.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The high level group on regulation continues to focus on two main areas: preparation of a national policy statement on regulatory reform; <Col N="940" />and development of a model of regulatory impact analysis.</P>
    <P>To inform the formulation of the national policy statement the 90 submissions received in response to the consultation document Towards Better Regulation were studied and analysed. In December 2002 my Department published a booklet containing two papers; the first summarising the submissions received and the second offering an independent analysis and commentary on the submissions by an independent economist. More than 1,000 copies of the booklet have been sent to interested parties and copies have been placed in the Dáil Library.</P>
    <P>In January a drafting group composed of senior officials from key Departments was formed to commence preparation of a draft national policy statement/White Paper on regulation. While a specific date for publication has not been set, it is anticipated the draft text of the policy statement will be submitted to Government in the summer with a view to publication later in the year.</P>
    <P>Work on the development of a system of regulatory impact analysis as recommended by the OECD in its report is also continuing. RIA is a policy tool designed to identify and quantify, where possible, the impact of new and existing regulations. A working group of officials has been developing a model that would be suitable for the Irish policy making context.</P>
    <P>Significant progress has been made in the area of better regulation since the establishment of the high level group on regulation. It will continue to monitor and co-ordinate progress in this area.</P>

      <P>The issue of 20% balancing payments under the 2002 suckler cow and special beef premia schemes commenced on 30 April. To date more than &euro;37 million in balancing payments has been paid to 55,000 farmers under the suckler cow premium scheme and &euro;27 million has been paid to 132,000 farmers under the special premium scheme.</P>
      <P>The later commencement of the balancing payments arose due to the EU requirement to apply penalties across all bovine premium schemes with effect from the 2002 scheme year and because of problems with the overshoot of the special beef premium national quota. While the requirement to apply penalties across all bovine premuim schemes under amending Regulation 2419/2001 will mean later balancing payments for 2002 and future years, the penalties that will be applied to the bovine schemes for irregularities and late lodgement of area aid applications will be much lighter than those applied up to now.</P>

      <P>Based on the animal number declarations made by the person named on his CEN.1 and 2 forms at all five census dates, the stocking density of his holding for 2001 was 2.298 livestock units per hectare. Due to foot and mouth disease control measures that were in place during the early part of 2001 the EU Commission Regulation 1900/2000 provided for an across the board application of a 0.8 co-efficient to the livestock unit value of the animals declared by herd owners in respect of the first and second census dates in 2001. When the co-efficient was applied to the livestock unit value of the animals declared by the person named at the first two census dates it reduced the stocking density to 2.1044 livestock units per hectare. This was still in excess of the 2.0 livestock unit per hectare limit that would enable my Department to pay extensification premium in this case.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 219 and 224 together.</P>
      <P>Last December I announced in my budget speech a number of increases in the stamp duty charges on various financial products such as ATM cards, laser cards, credit cards, cash cards and cheques. These changes are estimated to yield a total of about &euro;52 million in a full year.</P>
      <P>Stamp duty is a significant contributor to the Exchequer. It helps to fund public services while keeping the direct tax burden low thereby facilitating continued economic success.</P>
      <P>These changes have been legislated for in section 140 of the Finance Act 2003. The Act's changes, particularly the inclusion of certain anti-avoidance measures, have given rise to representations of the kind mentioned in the questions.</P>
      <P>I have asked my Department to examine the issues which have arisen bearing in mind the need to secure the revenue to the State arising from the changes to stamp duty. This examination is in progress.</P>

      <P>The Parliamentary Questions and the Adjournment debate to which the Deputy refers relate to the disabled drivers' and disabled passengers' tax concessions scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I have previously informed the Deputy in reply to a similar parliamentary question, the terms and conditions governing the scheme have not been referred to the National Disabilities Authority. The authority has no function in determining whether a claimant meets the medical criteria necessary for admittance to the scheme. The former national rehabilitation board provided secretarial service to the Disabled Drivers Medical Board of Appeal. The board of appeal's chairperson held the post of a senior area medical officer with the National Rehabili<Col N="948" />tation Board prior to its dissolution. The post has been transferred to the National Rehabilitation Hospital. The board of appeal's chairperson, together with another member, made an oral presentation to the interdepartmental review group on the disabled drivers' and disabled passengers' tax concession scheme.</P>
    <P>The review group, which was chaired by an official from the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, examined the scheme. I received its report and it is being examined. Any recommendations relating to the scheme's medical criteria or other conditions will receive full consideration. When this process is finished I envisage that the report will be made available to the public.</P>
    <P>I am informed by the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform that the group met 30 times over the course of its work. The group was established in 1998 and completed its report in 2002.</P>
    <P>The group heard 21 oral submissions from interested individuals-organisations in May and September 2000. Some 250 written submissions were received.</P>

      <P>The board of appeal operates independently but I have been informed that it has to deal with a backlog of appeals. In 1997 the waiting period for assessment was two to three months. At present a person must wait between 18 and 24 months to be assessed. This is an indication of the level of demand for tax relief under the scheme. In addition, the backlog seems to be exacerbated by the fact that many of those who appeal to the board are aware that they do not meet the medical criteria specified in the regulations. However, they still insist on exercising their right of appeal.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 227 and 228 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On a number of occasions recently, I have set out the Government's position with respect to the situation in Papua. With respect to the particular case raised by Deputy Gormley, I am aware of <Col N="950" />reports on the arrest of Mr. Tabuni, with others, on 6 April 2003, and of the allegations that the detainees were beaten while in custody. Ireland, together with our EU partners, supports the development of a strengthened dialogue and partnership between the EU and Indonesia as the best means by which to address our concerns. I have asked my officials to stress the importance which Ireland attaches to the issue of human rights in Papua in their ongoing contacts with Indonesian representatives.</P>
    <P>At the recent meeting of the External Relations Council which I attended on 14 April 2003, Ireland, together with our EU colleagues, adopted revised Council conclusions on Indonesia. These conclusions reaffirmed the importance which we attach to the promotion and protection of human rights in Indonesia. The conclusions stressed the importance of bringing all perpetrators of human rights violations to justice and also emphasised the importance of actively promoting peaceful solutions to the internal conflicts in Indonesia, including that of Papua. The conclusions stressed the importance of the full implementation of the letter, and spirit, of the special autonomy laws in Papua, and Aceh. Clarification was sought on the implementation of the special autonomy law for Papua, and the recent presidential decree, which divided Papua into three provinces. The Council expressed concern also at the delays on the Indonesian side in accepting international support for the implementation of the special autonomy law.</P>
    <P>Deputies will remember that I have reported previously on my meeting with the Indonesian Foreign Minister, Mr. Wirajuda, at the EU-ASEAN foreign ministers meeting at Brussels, in January 2003, when I raised issues of particular concern such as respect for human rights, and the tensions in Papua, and I made the point that these matters impact on our national perception of Indonesia. I understand that my colleague, Deputy Kitt, Minister of State with responsibility for overseas development and human rights, will meet with representatives of the West Papua Action Group later this month, and that these issues may be reviewed further then. The Government will continue to monitor closely the situation in Papua, and will continue to encourage the authorities in Indonesia to act with due regard to the rights and interests of the people of Papua.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>The UN Fund for Population Activities, UNFPA, which is supported by 119 countries, is the largest multilateral source of assistance on population <Col N="951" />issues for developing countries. The needs in this area are acute: it is estimated that some 500,000 women in the developing world die each year due to pregnancy-related causes and that 350 million women have no access to any form of contraception. In 2003, Ireland Aid has committed &euro;2.539 million to support UNFPAs core resources which are focused primarily on the world's poorest countries.</P>
      <P>UNFPA is committed by its mandates to the principles of voluntarism and all of its programmes of assistance throughout the world are based on the principles of freedom of choice and informed consent. Its guiding policy, as laid down by its governing council in 1985, stipulates that UNFPA is &ldquo;not to provide assistance for abortions, abortion services and abortion-related equipment and supplies as a method of family planning&rdquo;. In recent years, there have been a number of allegations that UNFPA has supported coercive family planning programmes and-or abortion. Many of these allegations have been made by the Population Research Institute, a private body based in the United States. In response to representations from Ireland, the fund has categorically denied all of these allegations and insisted that it continues to abide by its mandate. In the case of China, a number of independent investigations have taken place into allegation made against UNFPA. All of these investigations have confirmed that UNFPA does not support China's one-child policy and is making an important contribution to encouraging the Chinese authorities away from coercive family planning measures.</P>
      <P>Ireland served a three-year term on the executive board of UNFPA from 1998-2000 and was closely involved in discussions on UNFPA's policies and programmes. We were impressed by the quality of UNFPAs development activities, the commitment of its staff and the support it provides to some of the world's poorest countries. Ireland Aid continues to monitor UNFPA closely and attends all of the executive board meetings of the organisation. Over the past year, I have had a number of meetings with Ms. Thoraya Obaid, the executive director of the fund, to discuss our contribution and the fund's activities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Health is, and will continue to be, a major priority for Ireland Aid. Supporting UNFPA is just one part of this approach. For example, one of UNFPAs key tasks is to contribute to the implementation of the millennium development goal of reducing the maternal mortality rate by 75% by 2015. UNFPAs programmes also have a major focus on the fight against HIV-AIDS &ndash; one of the biggest challenges facing developing countries and an overarching priority of Irelands development assistance. However, Ireland Aid also contributes bilaterally and multilaterally and through NGOs and missionaries towards improving health, including maternal health, in developing countries. Approximately 20% of programme expenditure in the priority countries of <Col N="952" />Ireland Aid &ndash; Ethiopia, Mozambique, Lesotho, Zambia, Tanzania, Uganda and Timor Leste &ndash; is directed to the health sector.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that UNFPA is playing an important role in supporting the efforts of developing countries to improve maternal health and welfare and to fight HIV-AIDS. It continues to abide by its mandate and does not support coercive family planning methods or abortion. Irelands funding of UNFPA is, therefore, fully warranted and helps the organisation provide much needed assistance to people living in extreme poverty.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>Shortly after the arrests of the Cuban dissidents referred to by the Deputy, the Greek EU Presidency, on 26 March 2003, issued a statement agreed by Ireland and the other partners condemning the arrests as contrary to freedom of speech, declaring the prisoners to be prisoners of conscience and demanding their release without delay. On 14 April 2003, the General Affairs and External Relations Council, GAERC, adopted conclusions on Cuba, reiterating the condemnation of the arrests, the unfair trials and the arbitrary and excessive sentences imposed. The Council called for the release of all political prisoners. The Council conclusions went on to note that these developments marked a further deterioration in the human rights situation in Cuba, which would affect the EU's relationship with Cuba and the prospects for increased co-operation. The GAERC conclusions also contained a condemnation of the summary execution on 11 April 2003 of three hijackers of a ferry-boat.</P>
      <P>EU Heads of Mission in Havana were instructed to make a <i>démarche</i> on 18 April to the Cuban authorities, again strongly condemning the unprecedented wave of arrests, and the passing of severe sentences on independent journalists and members of the opposition, who were exercising their right to freedom of opinion and expression, a principle strictly upheld by the EU. The <i>démarche</i> noted serious deficiencies as regards the procedures and practices employed during the trials, <i>inter alia,</i> the lack of time for defence lawyers to prepare a proper defence, the rejection by the courts of some lawyers appointed by family members of the accused, and the barring of foreign press and diplomatic observers. It was pointed out to the Cuban authorities that the EU had concluded that the trials were not conducted in accordance with international human rights standards.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Furthermore the <i>démarche</i> expressed deep concern about the outcome of the trials, which had seen severe sentences, based on law no. 88 on the protection of national independence and the economy and-or law no. 62 concerning crimes against the independence or territorial integrity of the State. In particular, law no. 88 prohibits the passing of information to a foreign organisation or media, and is thereby in breach of Article 19 of the Universal Declaration on Human Rights. The EU made clear to the Cuban authorities that it rejected the sentences and urged that the trials be conducted again in conformity with internationally-accepted human rights standards and that independent observers be admitted to the <Col N="954" />courts. The EU reiterated its earlier demands that those detained and convicted &ndash; considered by the EU to be prisoners of conscience &ndash; be released immediately and that harassment of peaceful members of the opposition come to an immediate halt. The EU Heads of Mission notified the Cuban Government that continued imprisonment and harassment would negatively affect EU-Cuban relations and co-operation.</P>
    <P>At the 17 March-25 April session of the UN Commission on Human Rights, four Latin American countries tabled a resolution urging the Cuban Government to admit to its country the personal representative appointed by the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, and to provide all the facilities necessary for her to be able to fulfil her mandate. Costa Rica proposed the reinforcement of this text by a reference to the recent events in Cuba, expressing deep concern at &ldquo;the recent detention, summary prosecution and harsh sentencing of numerous members of the political opposition&rdquo; and urging the Cuban Government &ldquo;to release all those persons immediately&rdquo;. Ireland supported this strengthening amendment, which unfortunately was defeated by 31 votes to 15, with seven abstentions. The resolution as originally proposed was adopted by 24 votes to 20, with nine abstentions. Ireland voted in favour but declined on this occasion to co-sponsor the text, regarding it as too weak to merit co-sponsorship in view of the omission of the proposed explicit reference to the recent serious damage inflicted on human rights in Cuba. We made it clear that had the Costa Rican amendment been carried we would have co-sponsored the resolution.</P>
    <P>As well as expressing our views through our membership of the EU and the UN, Ireland has also made its concern known through bilateral channels. I instructed senior officials in my Department to make known to the Cuban <i>chargé d'affaires</i> in Dublin the very serious view taken by the Government of the recent events. This has been done on two separate occasions.</P>

Other countries may be admitted as members when their application has been approved by a simple majority vote of the World <Col N="955" />Health Assembly, WHA, the supreme decision-making body for the WHO, which meets this year at Geneva from 19-28 May. Territories which are not responsible for the conduct of their international relations may be admitted as associate members upon application made on their behalf by the, member or other authority responsible for their international relations.</P>
      <P>The issue of Taiwan's membership of the WHO is not on the agenda of the forthcoming meeting of the WHA, although I understand it may be raised at the meeting of the general committee on 19 May. Ireland, together with our EU partners, does not support Taiwanese membership of organisations where statehood is a pre-requisite for membership. However, Ireland, and its EU partners, recognise that all people should be allowed to have access to the highest level of medical care, as set out in the WHO constitution. In light of the issue of severe acute respiratory syndrome, SARS, Ireland and the EU support Taiwan's co-operation with the WHO, by means compatible with the &ldquo;one China principle&rdquo;, which would not imply Taiwanese statehood, and where Taiwan's participation would add value in terms of the objectives of the WHO. The EU delegation in Geneva is co-operating on the issue of Taiwanese participation at the WHA with the United States and Japan.</P>
      <P>According to WHO statistics of 8 May, there have been 131 reported cases of SARS in Taiwan, resulting in 13 deaths; this is out of a total number of 7,053 reported cases, resulting in 506 deaths. I understand that Taiwan has been in receipt of information from the WHO to assist it in coping with SARS, since the disease first made its appearance late last year.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 234 and 256 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My Department has been undertaking a review of student support provisions with the aim of ensuring that the benefits of the substantial investment being made are maximised. As I have indicated previously, I expect that the outcome of the review by my officials will provide me with a range of possible options which will seek to ensure that the avail<Col N="956" />able funding is targeted in a manner that achieves maximum impact from the point of view of equity of access to third level education.</P>
    <P>When I have had an opportunity to consider the contents of the review I will bring the matter to Cabinet. Following its consideration by Government, I will make a determination as regards publication and consultation arrangements, as appropriate. I recognise the need to avoid, as far as possible, uncertainty for students and their parents. In any event, it is my intention to decide shortly as to the arrangements and support provisions which will be in place for students for the 2003-04 academic year. The abolition of tuition fees for part-time students in third level education could only be considered in the light of the budgetary situation and in the context of other competing demands in the education system, including tackling educational disadvantage at all levels, addressing capital and equipment needs and improving support services across the system. To introduce free fees for all part time students would be extremely costly and there are no plans at present to do so.</P>

      <P>The proposed refurbishment-extension project at the school referred to by the Deputy is listed in section 7 of the 2003 school building programme which I published on my Department's website at www.education.ie.

Projects listed in sections 6 and 7, primary, are not being authorised to progress beyond their current stage of architectural planning for the time being. The timing of when projects listed in these sections can progress to tender and construction will depend on the budgetary allocation for 2004 and subsequent years and the priority afforded to each project by reference to the band rating.</P>

      <P>The contract for the provision of a <Col N="958" />bundle of five post-primary schools was signed in November 2001 with Jarvis Projects Limited. The schools are Maria Immaculata Community College, Dunmanway, County Cork, Ballincollig Community School, Ballincollig, County Cork, St. Attracta's Community School, Tubbercurry, County Sligo, Largy College, Clones, County Monaghan and St. Caimin's Community School, Shannon, County Clare. All five schools were handed over to the Department within schedule by the end of 2002. These are the first schools built to date under the Government's PPP pilot programme.</P>
      <P>I am actively identifying other possible education PPP projects. However, under EU rules, where projects are financed on a deferred payment basis by the private sector, such as public private partnerships, the capital value of such projects is a charge on the general Government balance over the construction phase. The GGB is the critical measure of what can be accommodated within our obligations under the Stability and Growth Pact of the Maastricht Treaty. A EUROSTAT group is currently reviewing the accounting rules on this issue as will a standing committee established by my colleague the Minister for Finance to advise on the GGB implications of private sector financed projects. Consideration of any new PPP projects will also be based on an evaluation of the completed pilot PPP schools project together with a thorough assessment of affordability of the project in the context of the competing demands on the likely capital funding envelopes going forward and taking into account the issues surrounding the general Government balance.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Mr. N. Dempsey)</NameTxt>
      <P>My Department considered an application for resource teaching support for the pupil referred to by the Deputy. Resource teaching was not approved since the child is not eligible under Circular 08/02. The purpose of this circular is to ensure, in so far as is possible, that resource teaching support is allocated on the basis of professionally-assessed need. In the first instance, however, pupils who have reading difficulties, or who function at a low level, are the responsibility of their class teachers. Where a low-functioning pupil &ndash; at or below the 10th percentile &ndash; shows no signs of improvement, in spite of the best efforts of the class teacher, the pupil may be referred for learning support. Schools are able to meet the needs of most children with reading difficulties by means of the learning support service.</P>
      <P>There are some pupils who have severe learning difficulties and who function at a very low level &ndash; at or below the second percentile. However, such difficulties may also be encountered in a child of average or above average intelligence and, in such cases, the discrepancy between ability and achievement is not readily explained. The discrepancy is even harder to explain where progress continues to be slow in spite of the best efforts of class and learning support teachers. It is because the discrepancy is widest in the case of these pupils that their need is seen as greatest and most likely to need more intensive support from a resource teacher.</P>

      <P>Employment of school staff is primarily a matter for the boards of management of schools who have a statutory responsibility in this regard. School authorities have a duty of care to their pupils and normal practice is to insist on letters of reference from previous employers before offering a position.</P>
      <P>Bus Éireann is responsible for the day-to day operation of the school transport service, including the appointment of contractors who are employed on an individual contract basis. My Department has no involvement in the matter. However, the schemes governing bus escorts and supervision and substitution arrangements for post-primary schools both require appointees to be vetted by the Garda Síochána. The procedure involves the proposed appointee signing a form of consent to his or her proposed appointment being sent for Garda clearance. In addition, under the Sex Offenders Act 2001, it is an offence for a person, who has previously been convicted of a sexual offence, to apply for a position that involves access to children. My Department's guidelines for dealing with allegations and suspicions of child abuse have also recently been revised in consultation with the education partners and copies have been issued to all primary schools and in-service training has been provided to primary school teachers to support these.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My Department is also consulting with the education partners and the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform seeking their observations on the issue of Garda clearance for teachers. As large numbers of appointments are made every year, significant Garda resource issues arise. Screening procedures other than Garda vetting, such as references, will be explored in the discussions with the education partners. In addition, the child protection joint working group, composed of officials from the Department of Education and Science and the Department of Education Northern Ireland, has recommended the establishment of a confidential mechanism across the Britain and Ireland for the reciprocal identification of people who are considered to be unsuitable to work with children <Col N="961" />and young people.

      <P>The proposed large-scale building project for Robertstown, Naas, County Kildare is listed in section 6 of the 2003 school building programme which I published on my Department's website. This proposed project is at an advanced stage of architectural planning and has been assigned a &ldquo;band 2&rdquo; rating by my Department in accordance with the published criteria for prioritising large-scale projects. Projects listed in sections 6 and 7, primary, are not being authorised to progress beyond their current stage of architectural planning for the time being.</P>
      <P>The timing of when projects listed in these sections can progress to tender and construction will depend on the budgetary allocation for 2004 and subsequent years and the priority afforded to each project by reference to the band rating. In the meantime, individual schools should use their devolved grant to deal with any urgent health and safety works.</P>

      <P>An Agreed Programme for Government sets out a commitment to implement changes to retention and support policies, which will assist schools in areas of significant disadvantage to recruit and retain teachers. My Department is committed to providing support for teachers in all primary schools. Indeed, following negotiations with teacher representatives, there have been many improvements in the conditions of service of teachers in recent times. These include the introduction of release time for teaching principals, improvements in conditions for the appointment of administrative principals, the introduction of payments in respect of supervision duties and the provision of increased substitute cover for absences.</P>
      <P>While the action being taken to increase the teacher supply generally will also be of assistance to schools in areas of disadvantage, my Department will consider other possibilities. In this regard and the context of the commitment referred to in the programme for Government, I have recently received the report of a sub-group of the statutory committee on disadvantage. This group examined the issue of recruitment and retention of teachers within schools in disadvantaged areas. This report is currently being considered in my Department and following this process my officials will be consulting with the partners in education in this regard.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 253, 255, 269, 274 and 277 together.</P>
      <P>The Higher Education Authority has for a number of years provided dedicated funding to the universities and other Higher Education Authority designated institutions to support new developments in areas of strategic importance in higher education. One particular priority area is that of broadening access to the universities and Higher Education Authority institutions for students from traditionally under-represented groups. These include students from disadvantaged backgrounds, mature students and Travellers. In 2002, the Higher Education Authority provided over &euro;6 million to support institutions in initiatives aimed at providing for such broadened access.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The &ldquo;Foundation Course for Higher Education &ndash; Young Adults&rdquo; in Trinity College is one development which has been funded by the Higher Education Authority under its targeted initiatives. In this regard, &euro;127,000 was provided by the Higher Education Authority in 2002. Decisions regarding allocations for 2003 for all access programmes in the university sector will be taken by the Higher Education Authority in due course. Overall, in 2002, a total of &euro;706,000 was provided for access measures in Trinity College, under the targeted initiatives. My Department also grant aids a number of special projects which <Col N="965" />are designed to improve access to third level for second level pupils in particular schools in disadvantaged areas. In this regard, my Department provided funding of &euro;36,830 in 2002 for these activities within the Trinity access programmes.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. N. Dempsey Mr. N. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Mr. N. Dempsey)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware of the report by Professor Pat Clancy on his fourth national survey of access to higher education which found that Dublin, by comparison with other counties, had a low level of participation in third level education. However, it should be noted that this survey, based on entrants to higher education in autumn 1998, was carried out before the significant additional funding committed by Government to further and higher education. New measures have been introduced specifically aimed at increasing access to third level education. There is a provision within the national development plan for a third level access fund totalling almost &euro;121 million, over the period 2000-06, to tackle disadvantage at third level. The report of the action group on access to third level education, which was established to advise on the development of a co-ordinated strategy to increase participation of students from disadvantaged backgrounds, mature students and students with a disability at third level, was published in July 2001.</P>
      <P>To date, a number of measures have been taken in response to some of the main recommendations in the report. These include special rates of maintenance grant, usually referred to as 'top-up' grants, payable to disadvantaged grant holders, were introduced with effect from the 2000-01 academic year. Following a review in 2002, I increased the annual income threshold for the special rates by 32%. For 2002-03, I also increased the special rate of grant to &euro;4,000 for students residing more than 15 miles from college and &euro;1,600 for students resident within 15 miles of college. As a result of the review, it is expected that the number of students qualifying for the &ldquo;top-up&rdquo; grant in 2002-03 will double to 7,000 students.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A new millennium partnership fund for disadvantage was introduced with effect from 2001. The fund provides assistance to partnership companies and community groups to develop their support schemes for students from disadvantaged families. Area Development Management Limited, under whose aegis the partnerships operate, accepted my Department's request that it would administer the fund for the 2001-02 academic <Col N="966" />year. The total allocation for the 2001-02 academic year was &euro;1.2 million, with 37 partnerships and community groups receiving allocations from the fund. For 2002-03, I increased the provision for the fund to &euro;2 million and 50 area partnerships and community groups have received allocations.</P>
    <P>I have also given approval for the establishment of the national office for equity of access to higher education, within the Higher Education Authority, a key recommendation of the action group. I anticipate that the national office will facilitate the aim of increasing third level access by the three target groups, in partnership with my Department, the third level institutions and other stakeholders and agencies. Financial support is also available to students, in approved third level institutions, through the student assistance-access fund which assists students who might, due to their financial circumstances, be unable to continue their third level studies. &euro;8.9 million was allocated from this fund in 2002, in respect of the 2002-03 academic year. The under-representation of students from lower socio-economic backgrounds in the higher education system remains unacceptable. It was against this background that, last autumn, I requested my Department to undertake a review of student support provisions with the objective of ensuring that the benefits of the substantial investment being made in this area by the taxpayer are maximised.</P>

      <P>The proposed extension at Elphin Community College is at an early stage of architectural planning, pre-planning permission. It is listed in section 7 of the capital programme for 2003 which is published on my Department's website. However, given the level of financial commitments to be met from projects already in construction, I do not envisage that my Department will be in a position to allow architectural planning for further large scale building projects, including that at Elphin Community College, to progress beyond their current authorised this year. The timing of when the project can proceed is dependent on the financial allocation for 2003 and subsequent years. Elphin Community Col<Col N="967" />lege operates under the aegis of the County Roscommon Vocational Education Committee. The onus is on the VEC to ensure that health and safety standards at the school are maintained.</P>

      <P>The school authorities were notified on 29 April 2003 that resources would not be put in place for the person to whom the Deputy refers. My Department's Circular Letter 08/02 sets out the criteria for eligibility for extra resources in respect of special educational needs. In relation to specific learning disability, it stipulates that resource teaching for 2.5 hours per week may be allocated only to children whose test results fulfil the following criteria:</P>
      <P>Such children have been assessed by a psychologist as: being of average intelligence or higher; and having a degree of learning disability specific to basic skills in reading, writing or mathematics which places them at or below the second percentile on suitable, standardised, norm-referenced tests. Children who do not meet these criteria and who, in the opinion of the psychologist, have a specific learning disability, are more properly the responsibility of the learning support and-or class teacher.</P>
      <P>My Department's Circular Letter 07/02 refers to the care needs of pupils with disabilities in an educational context. There was insufficient evidence provided to my Department to enable a definitive decision to be taken regarding the application for special needs assistant support for the pupil in question. It would not be appropriate for me to comment on the test scores of an individual child, but the information can be made available to his parents.</P>

Many children with the condition in question are capable of attending ordinary schools on an integrated basis with the support, where necessary, of the resource teacher and-or special needs assistant services. Where the level of the condition is of a more serious nature, provision is made by way of special schools or special classes attached to ordinary schools. All such facilities operate at a maximum pupil teacher ratio of 8:1 and special needs assistant support is provided where required.

My objective is to secure the passage of this legislation through the Oireachtas before the summer recess.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 265 and 282 together.</P>
      <P>The position is that Donabate-Portrane Educate Together national school was granted provisional recognition in September 2002. The school authorities were advised at that time the question of permanent recognition would be considered when the Department was satisfied that long-term viability had been demonstrated and that the school was operating in accordance with the rules for national schools. Until such time as permanent recognition is granted to the school, my Department will not consider purchasing a site to permanently accommodate the school. If and when permanent recognition is granted, budgetary factors will then determine the rate of progress on the acquisition of a site and on the delivery of permanent accommodation for the school.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In response to its pending accommodation difficulties the board of management made a proposal to my Department, which would involve the lease or purchase of a site reserved for edu<Col N="971" />cational purposes, from Fingal County Council in order to house the school in temporary accommodation on the site. Due to budgetary constraints, this option is not being pursued at this time.</P>
    <P>In order to cater for the accommodation needs of the school for the forthcoming school year, my Department has approved grant-aid for the rental of two temporary classrooms to be located on the site of the sea scout den.</P>

It may also be provided to pupils who are awaiting an appropriate educational placement. A recent review of home tuition cases involving children attending a special junior school catering for children with autism revealed that ten children were in receipt of home tuition grants. The school in question has an enrolment of 24 children and a staffing complement of five teachers and 13 special needs assistants. The home tuition was withdrawn with effect from the end of April.</P>

An application from the body referred to by the Deputy, for a new school, is one of a number of applications for recognition which has been assessed by the new schools advisory committee. I am currently considering the outcome of their deliberations in each case. It is my intention to notify each applicant of my decision in its case shortly.</P>

      <Quest>the reasons for the decision to close St. Brigid's Convent, Goresbridge, County Kilkenny; if he will review this decision immediately in view of the educational requirements of 129 second level students and the excellent educational opportunity offered to the students of this area; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. N. Dempsey Mr. N. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Mr. N. Dempsey)</NameTxt>
      <P>The future of St. Brigid's secondary school, Goresbridge, has been under review for some time. The school was owned and run by the Brigidine Order as a girls boarding school until 1978. At that time, the nuns withdrew and the school was taken over by a local board of trustees and a local board of management who leased the buildings from the nuns and ran the school as a co-educational voluntary school.</P>
      <P>In April 1998 the board of management decided to phase out the operation of the school. The board's decision was strongly resisted locally and a community action group was set up to save the school. In June 1998 the board of management notified the Department that it had reversed its decision to close the school.</P>
      <P>Subsequently, in 2001, a group representing the various school interests made a proposal to my Department, in which approval was sought for the implementation of various measures which, it was considered, would result in the development of St. Brigid's as a viable school into the future.</P>
      <P>Following a thorough examination of the issues involved, including submissions to retain the school under the trusteeship of the VEC, I have concluded that the major capital investment which would be warranted to sustain a school of this size, could not be justified.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Since 1995 enrolments at the school have remained steady at a figure of approximately 130. The school has a current enrolment of 129 pupils and a long-term projected enrolment of approximately 125 pupils. This is an optimistic assessment in that it assumes full student retention through junior and senior cycles and 75% of all fourth year pupils taking the transition year option, TYO. It is also based on a pattern of enrolment where in excess of 60% of the total <Col N="975" />first year intake comes from outside the catchment area.</P>
    <P>As part of its strategy to increase enrolments, the interest group representing the school, has sought adjustments to existing catchment boundaries and current transport arrangements. Any attempt to alter existing arrangements would be likely to provoke strong opposition from other providers in the area. It could also be argued that this strategy for increasing enrolments could be viewed as verification of the school's non-viability for the future.</P>
    <P>Even with the interventions mentioned there would still not be a sufficient base, to justify major refurbishment or, perhaps, a new building. Consequently, my view, is that educational provision should be phased out over a two year period, with final closure in June 2005, and I have advised the owners and trustees in this regard. To facilitate an orderly closure, the school authorities are not accepting a first year intake in September 2003.</P>
    <P>In relation to any decision on the closure of a school, my Department's concern is to ensure that there are sufficient pupil places to meet demand in a given area. The alternative choices for pupils who attend St. Brigid's are essentially Borris vocational school and the Presentation de la Salle and vocational school in Bagenalstown. Pupils from the same primary schools that feed into St. Brigid's also attend a range of other schools including Grennan College, Thomastown, Scoil Aireagail, Ballyhale, and various post-primary schools in Kilkenny city, therefore it is to be expected that these would also be alternatives for pupils who would otherwise attend St. Brigid's.</P>
    <P>My Department is satisfied that arrangements can be made to facilitate the placement of pupils from St. Brigid's in neighbouring schools as the situation arises. Arrangements are currently being made to accommodate the remaining pupils during the phasing out of the school, through the provision of temporary accommodation.</P>

      <P>The erection of telegraph poles is governed by the Planning and Development Act 2000, which is the responsibility of the Minister for the Environment and Local Government. Section 254 of that Act, as amended by the Communications Regulation Act 2002, provides, <i>inter alia,</i> that the erection of overground electronic communications infrastructure is subject to the grant of a licence by a planning authority.</P>
      <P>As this provision has only been in force since 29 April 2002, I have no plans to seek a review of the legislation. Any amendment of the legislation would be primarily a matter for the Minister for the Environment and Local Government.</P>

      <P>My Department actively monitors research in this area. The European Union, through its COST, Co-operation on Science and Technology, research initiatives, and WHO, World Health Organisation, through its international EMF project are among the major sponsors and co-ordinators of health related research activity in the field of mobile telephony. Ireland participates fully in all relevant European Union, COST and WHO committees, contributing financially and providing expertise.</P>
      <P>The recommendation of the Council of Health Ministers of 12 July 1999, which Ireland fully supported and which continues to reflect the best consensus of available scientific findings, sets out limits for public exposure to non-ionising radiation from mobile phones and phone masts. Such non-ionising radiation emissions from mobile phones marketed in Ireland and from base station masts are well within these limits. The latter are measured on a sample basis by the communications regulator under its ongoing compliance procedures. This year the communications regulator will be monitoring some 400 base stations to ensure their compliance with EU limit values. This represents over 10% of the total number of masts in the country and is a monitoring commitment that compares favourably with anywhere in Europe.</P>
      <P>I also have pleasure in announcing that this week I am hosting an international conference where 100 invited scientists and experts from across Europe will meet to discuss the issue &ldquo;Mobile Base Stations and Health&rdquo;. This meeting is part of Ireland's contribution to the EU's COST Action 281 which sponsors and co-ordinates research on the potential health implications from mobile communications systems.</P>

      <Quest> the steps he has taken in the recent AER VI competition to prevent big business interests from submitting unrealistically low bids, with no intention of building any of these wind farms in order to keep other smaller players out of the market; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <P>AER VI is operated in compliance with the open tender pro<Col N="979" />cedures under EU procurement rules addressed to the electricity market &ndash; Directive 93/38/EEC as amended. There are no procedures to exclude any applicant based on financial worth or market power.</P>
      <P>AER VI is confined to projects with planning permission in the biomass, hydro and onshore wind categories. In the new categories of offshore wind a foreshore licence or a foreshore lease is a precondition and in the biomass anaerobic digestion and biomass CHP categories a prior planning application lodged with the appropriate planning authority is a prerequisite. It is my view that the cost of pursuing these consents is such as to ensure that only bidders with serious intent make bids.</P>
      <P>As a further measure to discourage speculative bids in AER VI, applicants are required to apply for an electricity grid connection within 20 days of receipt of a formal offer from my Department or lose the offer. The associated payment to the network operators is a further disincentive to speculative bidders. In addition, within 90 days of receipt of an offer from my Department, applicants are required to submit a detailed time schedule for completion of the project and thereafter time is of the essence in meeting those deadlines or the offer can be withdrawn.</P>
      <P>Even if it was desirable, I do not see any practical way of excluding applicants based on market power or financial presence. The procedures adopted do as much as is practicably possible to discourage unrealistic bids and to quickly identify and weed out any such proposals where they occur irrespective of the market power or financial worth of the applicant.</P>

      <P>As Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources, I have no statutory function in relation to seafarers' wages. The ship operated by the company referred to by the Deputy is not registered on the Irish Ship Register. Obligations on the ship's owners regarding maintenance, crewing standards and certification of those matters are appropriate to the flag state operating the ship's register, St. Vincent and the Grenadines.</P>
      <P>Foreign registered vessels using Irish ports are inspected regularly by the marine survey office of my Department in the exercise of Ireland's port state control obligations. These inspections are aimed at ensuring that such vessels are maintained and operated in compliance with international safety standards laid down by the International Maritime Organisation, IMO, and, in relation to seafarers' social conditions, by the International Labour Organisation's, ILO, maritime conventions, together with relevant EU initiatives in the maritime area. Deficiencies identified are brought to the attention of the owner and flag state administration and may have to be rectified before the ship continues its journey.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My Department completed a strategic and operational review of maritime safety regulatory services in October 2000 and its recommend<Col N="981" />ations are now being implemented. A maritime safety directorate was established in February 2002 and an additional nine vessel surveyors were recruited to the marine survey office, which is an integral part of the new directorate. Inspections of foreign ships, under the Directive 95/21/EC on port state control, have increased from 14.6% in 2000 and 21% in 2001 to 30% in 2002.</P>
    <P>Ireland participates in IMO and ILO discussions on seafarers' welfare, supporting proposals aimed at improving their terms and conditions of employment. Ireland will continue to support efforts in all appropriate fora to enhance working conditions for seafarers and will continue to enforce safety and operational standards through the port state control framework.</P>

      <P>Under the local authority swimming pool programme, which is administered by my Department, there are four stages in a swimming pool project, following the submission of a feasibility study. These, in order of progress, are preliminary report, contract documents and ten<Col N="982" />der and construction. My Department's technical advisers, the Office of Public Works, evaluate each stage and local authorities cannot proceed to the next stage of a project unless prior approval issues from my Department. Grant aid is allocated only when tenders have been approved for the project and will be capped at the time of allocation.</P>
      <P>Under the programme, grants of up to a maximum of &euro;3.8 million are available towards either the refurbishment of existing pools or the provision of a new pool subject, in either case, to the total grant not exceeding 80% of the eligible cost of the project or, in the case of projects located in designated disadvantaged areas, 90% of the eligible cost. Support is available towards the cost of the swimming pool, toddler pool, sauna and steam room.</P>
      <P>In March 2003 I approved the contract documents for the proposed new swimming pool in Youghal. This approval allows Youghal Town Council to seek tenders for the work proposed.

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children (Mr. T. O'Malley)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware of the concerns regarding the provision of services to persons with an intellectual disability and those with autism. Additional funding of &euro;13.3 million has been allocated to services for persons with an intellectual disability or autism in 2003 to meet <Col N="983" />the full year cost of the 2002 developments and to further enhance the health related support services to children with an intellectual disability or autism. This funding is in addition to the very significant revenue investment, amounting to &euro;188 million, which has been made in these services since 1997 and which is built into the ongoing budget base. The additional funding provided by this and the previous Government between 2000 and 2002 was used to put in place, in addition to a range of other services, over 900 new residential, 380 new respite and around 2,000 new day places for people with an intellectual disability and those with autism.</P>
      <P>In particular &euro;14.6 million has been invested in health related support services for children with autism or an intellectual disability nationally between 1998 and 2002. A further &euro;4 million has been allocated to these services in 2003. This includes diagnostic and assessment services, early intervention, home support and out reach support to children of school going age.</P>
      <P>Despite this very significant investment, demographic factors are contributing to growing waiting lists for residential services in particular, although the number of people in receipt of services, including full time residential services, continues to increase. The increased birth rate in the 1960s and 1970s has resulted in large numbers of adults in their late 20s and early 30s requiring full-time residential services. In addition people with an intellectual disability are living longer than previously adding to the need for services compared to previous generations. This has also been the international experience in service provision to this population.</P>
      <P>The overall economic position in 2003 has had implications for all aspects of public investment, and this is reflected in the Estimates and budget adopted by the Government for 2003. Within this overall framework, however, some two thirds of the additional funding available for non-capital investment in services has been allocated to the health services.</P>
      <P>This funding is being applied largely to maintaining existing levels of service across all service programmes including services for people with an intellectual disability. While it is regrettable that the level of investment in these services achieved in recent years could not be maintained in 2003, my Department will work closely with the health boards and other service providers in relation to service provision this year.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 295 and 328 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The main vehicle for the implementation of the provisions of the Mental Health Act 2001 is the Mental Health Commission which was established with effect from 5 April 2002. The detailed work programme of the commission is a matter for the commission itself to determine, in accordance with its statutory functions under the Mental Health Act. However, I understand that one of the priorities for the commission over the next year will be to put in place the structures required for the operation of mental health tribunals. The mental health tribunals, operating under the aegis <Col N="986" />of the Mental Health Commission, will conduct a review of each decision by a consultant psychiatrist to detain a patient on an involuntary basis or to extend the duration of such detention.</P>
    <P>The Mental Health Commission will also appoint an inspector of mental health services who will replace the existing office of the Inspector of Mental Hospitals. The inspector will be required to visit and inspect all approved centres at least once a year. The Minister will be empowered to make regulations specifying the standards to be maintained in all approved centres and these will be enforced by the inspector. The inspector's annual report and review of the mental health services will be published along with the commission's report.</P>
    <P>The Commission has recently advertised the position of Inspector of Mental Health Services and three other senior administrative posts.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children (Mr. T. O'Malley)</NameTxt>
      <P>The current criteria under which mentally disordered people may be detained involuntarily are set out in the 1945 Mental Treatment Act, which was last amended in 1961. The Act was innovative legislation in the mid 1940s and its principles have been described as enlightened for its time. However, successive Governments have acknowledged the need to reform this legislation and to bring it into line with current thinking and international norms on the detention of people with mental disorder.</P>
      <P>The Mental Health Act 2001 was enacted in July 2001 and represents the first significant reform of mental health legislation in this country for over 50 years. The Act updates legislation concerning the involuntary detention of persons for psychiatric care and treatment and establishes mechanisms by which the standards of care and treatment provided in the mental health services may be supervised and regulated. When fully implemented the Mental Health Act 2001 will bring Irish mental health law fully into conformity with the European Convention on Human Rights and into line with the best practice in the field internationally.</P>

Work has commenced within my Department on a scoping document and terms of reference to facilitate the work of the review group, which will be established later this year. While the precise composition of the working group has not yet been determined, it is anticipated that it will include representatives of service users. All areas of mental health policy and service provision will be examined in the course of the review and, where appropriate, additional research will be undertaken.</P>

      <P>VHI's private health insurance premiums are primarily determined by the level of claims it is obliged to meet. It represents good commercial and insurance practice for VHI Healthcare, or indeed any other health insurer, to have regard to the possibility of members seeking third party recovery for fees or charges, where such recovery is in order, and a claim against the relevant third party is justified. VHI would be failing in its responsibilities to its members generally were it not to pursue policies that minimise its claims experiences, and consequently the levels of its premiums, where it is reasonable to do so. This is established practice in the area of health insurance, with BUPA (Ireland) having a similar rule regarding the payment of benefits for treatment which was due to the fault of a third party.</P>
      <P>Insurance practice in this regard is reflected under the Health Insurance Act 1994 (Minimum Benefit) Regulations 1996 which were made in March of that year. These regulations include specific provision in respect of circumstances involving third party recovery relating to healthcare costs incurred by an insured person.</P>
      <P>VHI has been contacted concerning the Deputy's questions and has advised that its rules in respect of third party claims are as set out in the rules, terms and conditions of membership. In that context, rule 8 (s) states that it will not pay benefits for expenses which a claimant is entitled to recover from a third party. Furthermore, rule 9 (f) states:</P>
      <P>If you (the policy holder) claim benefits for treatment which is needed because a member was injured through the fault of some other person or body, you and the member (if the member is over 18) must complete the relevant section of the claim form. We (VHI Healthcare) will pay the benefits if a policy holder or member completes a written undertaking to:</P>
      <P>(i) Include those benefits in any claim being made or to be made against the person who caused the injury: and</P>
      <P>(ii) do everything we (VHI Healthcare) ask to recover those benefits and repay them to VHI Healthcare.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Where a claim is received by VHI Healthcare requesting benefit towards expenses which have arisen as a result of an accident, VHI Healthcare <Col N="989" />will write to the member concerned requesting full details of the accident and whether or not the member intends to pursue a claim against a third party. Where the member indicates that they do not intend to pursue a claim, VHI Healthcare will provide benefit towards the medical costs incurred. If a member indicates that they intend to pursue a claim, VHI Healthcare, in accordance with rule 9 (f), will only provide benefit where an undertaking is received from the member's solicitor.</P>
    <P>The member's solicitor undertakes to include the moneys paid out by VHI Healthcare in the claim and, in the absence of a court order to the contrary, to refund these moneys in full to VHI Healthcare where the claim is successful or compromised. Where a case goes to trial, VHI Healthcare will accept the terms as set out in any court order. Where a claim is unsuccessful, VHI Healthcare does not pursue any refund and all undertakings are discharged.</P>
    <P>The Deputy refers to the increasing cost of insurance in the context of the number of personal injury claims being taken. It is the need to minimise claims costs in order to minimise premium increases in health insurance, that motivates health insurers to make prudent provision for the legitimate recovery of benefits paid where the costs concerned are later recovered from a third party.</P>

      <Quest>the requirements in place by his Department and the respective health boards to ensure that persons, under the aegis of his Department or the health boards, working with or transporting children or persons with a disability, have been screened and have Garda clearance in order that adequate protections are in place to prevent harm or assault to the children of the persons with a disability being cared for or being transported; the nature and extent of background checks or Garda clearance required; if he has satisfied himself that all possible steps are being taken to guarantee the safety of patients and clients in this context; the plans he has to add to or to improve the safety measures currently in place; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children (Mr. B. Lenihan)</NameTxt>
      <P>Guidelines on the recruitment and selection of staff in children's residential centres were issued by my Department in 1994 which included requirements in regard to Garda inquiries and also in regard to references and the contacting of referees. Expanded arrangements for Garda clearance were introduced in 1995 in respect of candidates for employment in areas of the health service where they would have access to children and vulnerable individuals. Health boards were notified at that time that, in circumstances where they <Col N="990" />fund the provision of services in respect of children and vulnerable individuals by external agencies, through section 65 grants or otherwise, application of the Garda clearance arrangements, where appropriate, should be on the same basis as that in place in respect of children's residential homes. Agencies were also reminded of the need for continuing review and strengthening of procedures in the area of recruitment and selection, particularly in relation to validation of information supplied by candidates and proactive verification of references.</P>
      <P>It is worth stressing that, irrespective of whatever clearance arrangements are in place, it will continue to be necessary to bear in mind that criminal record checks, while being capable in appropriate circumstances of making a significant contribution to ensuring that unsuitable persons do not secure positions of trust, are not the sole answer to ensuring applicants' suitability for jobs particularly where children or other vulnerable persons could be open to abuse.</P>
      <P>There will continue to be a particular onus of care on employers or organisations to maintain good employment practice both during the recruitment stage e.g. good interviewing practice, checking references and, also, when it comes to ensuring adequate supervision arrangements post recruitment.</P>
      <P>Children First: National Guidelines for the Protection and Welfare of Children recognises the need to support community and voluntary groups develop best practice in their dealings with children. A document entitled, Our Duty to Care, was published in April 2002. It is based on Children First and on Northern Ireland's Our Duty To Care document and is available to all groups. Essentially, it promotes good practice and procedures for organisations dealing with children and consists of a booklet and fact sheets covering areas such as safe recruitment practice, developing safe management practices and policies and raising awareness of child abuse among volunteers and staff. It also provides advice on how to report concerns to the health boards. This is an extremely useful tool for voluntary organisations.</P>
      <P>My colleague, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, has informed me that it was envisaged that when the central vetting unit became fully operational and all its backlogs were cleared that a phased extension of Garda clearance arrangements to other groups would take place. To this end the Garda Commissioner has established a working group to examine the issue, taking account of all aspects of the vetting of persons coming in contact with children and vulnerable persons be they full-time, part-time, voluntary or community workers or students on placement. The work of the working group is ongoing at present.</P>

      <P>The inquiry, chaired by Ms Anne Dunne SC, is proceeding with its investigative work and I expect to receive the first report which will deal with post mortem issues in paediatric hospitals around the end of the year. This will be followed by further reports on maternity and general hospitals.</P>
      <P>When I receive the chairman's report, I intend to table a motion that the inquiry report be presented to the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Health and Children. If it transpires that it is not possible for the Oireachtas committee to pursue the matter, whether as a result of the Supreme Court judgment in the Abbeylara case or otherwise, I am committed to ensuring that it is done through another appropriate forum, with statutory powers.</P>

      <P>The predominance of drug treatment in the mental health services was first highlighted by the Inspector of Mental Hospitals in his annual report for 2000, when he commented that it was often the only form of treatment available. There is an increasing desire, however, among professionals and patients alike that supportive and complementary <Col N="1000" />treatments such as psychotherapy should be more widely available. Supportive and general psychotherapeutic skills are now taught in post-graduate psychiatric medical training. Many psychiatric nurses are also trained in various forms of counselling and use these skills in their work with patients.</P>
      <P>While traditionally the provision of care was dominated by the doctor-nurse model, it has been recognised for some time that other skills such as those of psychologists, social workers, occupational therapists, etc., are a necessary component of service delivery and that, without them, adequate treatment and management in the broader sense is difficult. Service providers aim to provide mental health services through consultant-led multidisciplinary teams. However, significant recruitment difficulties exist in relation to the paramedical professions at present. Measures are being taken to recruit such staff from outside the mental health services and to increase the number of training places available.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 330, 332 and 333 together.</P>
      <P>I am aware of the recommendations made in the report mentioned by the Deputy. It has been the policy of my Department for some 15 years that persons with autism and those with an intellectual disability should not be admitted to a psychiatric hospital unless they have an underlying psychiatric disorder which cannot be treated elsewhere.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There has been significant progress in relation to the transfer to more appropriate accommodation of persons with autism and those with an intellectual disability currently accommodated in psychiatric hospitals and other inappropriate <Col N="1001" />placements. The number of persons accommodated in psychiatric hospitals in October 2002 was 452, down from 571 in 2001 and 970 in 1996. There is specific mention of this programme in the health strategy with a stated objective to complete the overall transfer of persons with an intellectual disability from psychiatric hospitals in all health board regions as soon as possible. The Department has been and is continuing to work with the Eastern Regional Health Authority and the health boards to achieve this objective.</P>
    <P>The very significant revenue investment, amounting to over &euro;200 million, which has been made in these services since 1997 and which is built into the ongoing budget base, has enabled the health boards to provide a broad range of enhanced services to persons with autism and those with an intellectual disability.</P>
    <P>The additional funding provided by this and the previous Government between 2000 and 2002 was used to put in place, in addition to a range of other services, over 900 new residential, 380 new respite and around 2,000 new day places for people with an intellectual disability and those with autism.</P>
    <P>From information recently submitted to my Department by the Eastern Regional Health Authority and the health boards, it would appear that there are around 16 persons with autism currently accommodated in psychiatric hospitals.</P>

      <P>Significant advances have been made in this country in the provision of community psychiatry, nursing services, community residences, day hospitals and day centres since the publication of the landmark report, Planning for the Future. In the period 1999-2002, an additional &euro;70.7 million was invested in the mental health services. In the current year, additional revenue funding of &euro;7.6 million will be provided for ongoing improvements in mental health services, to develop and expand community mental health services, to increase child and adolescent services, to expand the old age psychiatry services, to provide liaison psychiatry services in general hospitals and to enhance the support provided to voluntary agencies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Approximately &euro;190 million capital is being provided over the lifetime of the national development plan to fund the development of acute psychiatric units linked to general hospitals, as a replacement of services previously provided <Col N="1002" />in psychiatric hospitals. Substantial progress has already been made. There are now 19 general hospital psychiatric units operational, a further two units will become available to their mental health services in the near future, two are under construction and several others are at various stages of planning. In relation to community residences, there are approximately 400 community psychiatric residences in the country providing over 3,000 places. This compares to 111 residences, providing less than 1,000 places in 1984. In relation to day hospitals-day centres, there are approximately 200 providing over 3,500 places. This compares with 39 such centres providing approximately 1,200 places in 1984.</P>
    <P>Significant funding has been made available by Government to support groups and organisations such as Schizophrenia Ireland, Mental Health Ireland, GROW and Aware to heighten awareness and develop support services for service users and carers. Work on a comprehensive review of the mental health services, which reflects a commitment in the health strategy, Quality and Fairness, to the development of a new national policy framework on mental health will commence later this year.</P>
    <P>In describing the shortcomings and deficiencies of the existing mental health services, the annual reports of the Inspector of Mental Hospitals and the recently published Amnesty report, have highlighted the scale of the challenge facing both Government and Irish society as a whole, in seeking to reduce the stigma traditionally associated with mental illness and, by extension, the mental health services.</P>
    <P>The new Mental Health Commission established in April of last year under the provisions of the Mental Health Act 2001 has an important role to play in improving the quality of our mental health services. The establishment of the commission was welcomed by Amnesty International in its report. The primary functions of the commission are to promote and foster high standards and good practices in the delivery of mental health services and to ensure that the interests of detained persons are protected. The Mental Health Commission is now working, along with officials from my Department, to put in place the structures required for its new role. The commission has recently advertised the position of Inspector of mental health services and three other senior administrative posts.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>Entitlement to health services in Ireland is primarily based on means. Under the Health Act 1970, determination of eligibility for medical cards is the responsibility of the chief executive officer of the appropriate health board, other than for persons aged 70 years and over who are automatically eligible for a medical card. Children suffering from ADD and ADHD are not automatically eligible for a medical card. Medical cards are issued to persons who, in the opinion of the chief executive officer, are unable to provide general practitioner medical and surgical services for themselves and their dependants without undue hardship.</P>
      <P>Income guidelines are drawn up to assist in the determination of a person's eligibility and these are revised annually in line with the consumer price index. However, the guidelines are not statutorily binding and even though a person's income exceeds the guidelines, a medical card may still be awarded if the chief executive officer considers that his-her medical needs or other circumstances would justify this. It is open to all persons to apply to the chief executive officer of the appropriate health board if they are unable to provide health services for themselves or their dependants without hardship.</P>
      <P>Persons suffering from any of the following conditions, who are not already medical card holders, may obtain without charge drugs and medicines for the treatment of that condition under the long-term illness scheme: mental handicap, mental illness, for persons under 16 years only, phenylketonuria, cystic fibrosis, spina bifida, hydrocephalus, diabetes mellitus, diabetes insipidus, haemophilia, cerebral palsy, epilepsy, multiple sclerosis, muscular dystrophies, parkinsonism and acute leukaemia.</P>
      <P>Non-medical card holders, and people with conditions not covered under the long-term illness scheme, can avail of the drugs payment scheme. Under this scheme, no individual or family unit pays more than &euro;70 per calendar month towards the cost of prescribed medicines.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy is aware the health strategy includes a commitment that significant improvements will be made in the medical card income guidelines in order to increase the number of persons on low income who are eligible for a medical card and to give priority to families with children and particularly children with a disability. However, increased investment in this or any other developmental aspect of the strategy agenda, is dependant on the availability of the necessary additional resources. Due to the prevailing budgetary situation I regret it is not possible to meet this commitment this year but the Government remains committed to the introduction of the necessary changes within the lifetime of this Government.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 338 and 339 together.</P>
      <P>The public health review, also known as the Brennan review, commenced in 1999 and was charged with reviewing the operations of public health departments and community public health medical services of the health boards in the context of the 1994 memorandum of agreement between the Department and the Irish Medical Organisation, IMO, and to consider future developments for these services. The group comprised representatives of the Department of Health and Children, the health boards and the IMO. It published its report in April 2002.</P>
      <P>There was agreement on many of the matters considered by the group, including the need for a formally structured out-of-hours arrangement. There was one main area of disagreement. The IMO held the view that public health directors and specialists should have parity with hospital consultants, while management felt this was outside the terms of reference of the group. The report did not make a recommendation on the matter and the chairman recognised that any such issues as referred to by the official side would have to be the subject of industrial relations negotiations. The report also acknowledged that there might be a need to revisit the recommendations on public health following the implementation of proposed changes recommended by the health strategy and the primary care strategy.</P>
      <P>Talks, both formal and informal, have been held with the IMO on these issues since the publication of the Brennan report. The issues central to the public health doctors' dispute have been the subject of negotiations between the IMO and management, comprising officials from the Health Service Employers Agency, HSEA, the Department of Health and Children and the health boards over the past 12 months, initially through joint discussions and in more recent times under the aegis of the Labour Relations Commission. Since the commencement of strike action by the IMO, efforts have been made at the highest level to reach a satisfactory conclusion. In this regard, management has made a substantial offer to the IMO.</P>
      <P>On 14 March at informal talks in the Labour Relations Commission, management made an offer of 10.5%, excluding benchmarking, through the independent chair. This offer was confirmed in writing by the HSEA on 18 March. The application of such an income, as well as the increases awarded to public health doctors under benchmarking and the Sustaining Progress national agreement, would result in increases of between &euro;11,000 and &euro;29,000 for public health doctors between now and 2005.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The HSEA also requested the IMO to agree to have all outstanding issues referred to the Labour Court. Unfortunately, the IMO did not agree to this request and the strike started on 14 April. On at least three occasions since then I have asked the IMO to return to the negotiating table. In <Col N="1006" />addition, the National Implementation Body has urged the IMO to suspend its strike and to avail of the industrial relations mechanisms, in accordance with the conditions of the national pay agreement, Sustaining Progress.</P>
    <P>On 1 May, exploratory talks took place in the Labour Relations Commission with the HSEA and officials of my Department. At these talks, management indicated its willingness to discuss the implementation of the recommendations of the Brennan report, including the development of a structured out-of-hours system. In addition, the above-mentioned increase of 10.5% was again offered. During these talks, management stressed that the issue of the granting of consultant status to directors and specialists was not the subject of a recommendation by the review group on public health. Efforts are being made under the aegis of the National Implementation Body to identify a basis on which negotiations can be resumed, leading to resolution of the issues in dispute.</P>

      <AskConj>asked the </AskConj>
      <askee>Minister for Health and Children</askee>
      <Quest>his plans to establish a health protection agency similar to that in the UK; if a structured public health on-call system will help to address the current lack of preparation for a bio-terrorism attack or an infectious disease outbreak such as SARS; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>
      <QRef>[12730/03]</QRef>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no plans at present to establish a health protection agency. The National Disease Surveillance Centre, NDSC, in existence since 1998, is Ireland's leading specialist centre for the surveillance of infectious diseases. The aim of the NDSC is to improve the health of the population by the collation, interpretation and provision of the best possible information on infectious diseases. This is achieved through surveillance and independent advice, epidemiological investigation, research and training. The NDSC works in partnership with the health boards and with international organisations to ensure that up to date information is available to contribute to the effective control of infectious diseases.</P>
      <P>In the wake of the events of 11 September 2001 in the USA, I established an expert committee under the chairmanship of Professor William Hall, director of the Virus Reference Laboratory, to develop a contingency plan which would be implemented in the unlikely event of a biological attack here. In preparing the plan it was necessary for the committee to identify the level of risk of such an attack. The committee considered that the secondary consequences of an attack in another country was the most likely threat.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On 17 October 2001, I launched a protocol for dealing with a suspected anthrax attack in Ireland. The protocol was prepared by the expert committee and deals with the procedures to be adopted in the event of a suspected anthrax <Col N="1007" />attack including patient treatment and management, post exposure guidelines and so on. Included with the protocol are guidelines for individuals and companies on how to deal with a suspect package believed to contain anthrax. The document is available on my Department's web site: www.doh.ie.</P>
    <P>A detailed protocol in relation to category A agents, including smallpox, botulism, plague and tularaemia entitled Biological Threats &ndash; A Health Response for Ireland was issued in May 2002 to all health board chief executive officers and directors of public health for circulation to all relevant personnel. The chief executive officers were requested to circulate the document to appropriate medical personnel and to ensure that each board's emergency plan was reviewed and updated to take account of the protocol. This document is available on my Department's website: www.doh.ie/pdfdocs/biothreat.pdf.</P>
    <P>The National Disease Surveillance Centre issued a document entitled Biological Threat Agents &ndash; this document was aimed at informing all medical staff, but particularly GPs, in order to assist in the diagnosis of anthrax, plague, botulism and smallpox. This document was agreed by the expert committee and was circulated in May 2002.</P>
    <P>It was agreed by the expert committee that a sub-group, representative of health boards, consultants in emergency medicine and infectious diseases, public health doctors as well as the NDSC, was required to examine operational issues arising from the document Biological Threats &ndash; A Health Response for Ireland. This sub-group was established in October 2002 and was requested to examine several key issues including the designation of hospitals for treatment of smallpox cases, development of protocols in relation to transport of patients, samples and so on. It has submitted a number of reports to the expert committee for consideration.</P>
    <P>A high level containment facility has recently been constructed at the National Virus Reference Laboratory. The facility is designed to a BL3+ standard to allow for containment of a range of infectious agents including smallpox and to ensure increased safety. In addition, protective clothing for use by frontline staff in the event of an attack as well as specific equipment for use by the VRL have been secured. In the event of a biological threat occurring, the expert committee will provide advice on the management of the situation, including the issue of vaccine use, based on the specific circumstances prevailing at the time.</P>
    <P>The National Virus Reference Laboratory provides a national diagnostic virology service for Ireland, employing a wide range of methodologies for the identification of viral infection in humans and the determination of anti-viral immune status. The VRL also provides information about viruses and the infections they cause in Ireland and throughout the world.</P>
    <P>As the Deputy will be aware, I established an expert group in mid March 2003 to advise me on <Col N="1008" />issues related to severe acute respiratory syndrome. The deliberations and recommendations of this expert group are based on a number of sound, well tried infectious disease surveillance, control and prevention principles which are internationally accepted and are exemplified in the guidance on this issue published by the WHO, the Centres for Disease Control and Prevention in the USA and a number of other reputable international public health institutes. Protocols and guidance for hospitals and health professionals which describe the syndrome and provide advice on how suspect cases should be managed have been developed. In addition, information for the public and health care workers as well as guidance for aircraft cabin and aircraft cleaning staff has also been provided.</P>
    <P>This material is reviewed and updated by the expert group on an on-going basis and the most up to date information is available on my Department's website (www.doh.ie). A large amount of other relevant information in relation to SARS has also been placed on my Department's website including a Frequently Asked Questions document which should help to inform the public and to address public concerns.</P>
    <P>The public health review, also known as the Brennan review, commenced in 1999 and was charged with reviewing the operations of public health departments and community public health medical services of the health boards in the context of the 1994 memorandum of agreement between my Department and the Irish Medical Organisation and to consider future developments for this service. The group comprised representatives of my Department, the health boards and the IMO. It published its report in April 2002.</P>
    <P>There was agreement on many of the matters considered by the group, including the need for a formally structured out-of-hours arrangement. The issues central to the public health doctors' dispute have been the subject of negotiations between the Irish Medical Organisation and management, comprising officials from the Health Service Employers' Agency, HSEA, my Department and the health boards over the past 12 months, initially through joint discussions and in more recent times under the aegis of the Labour Relations Commission. Since the commencement of strike action by the IMO, efforts have been made at the highest level to reach a satisfactory conclusion. In this regard, management has made a substantial offer to the IMO.</P>
    <P>I have already acknowledged on a number of occasions that the professional input made by public health doctors to the management of infectious diseases and other public health threats is significant. I have also made clear my belief that the response of the health system is significantly hampered by the absence of that input. I, and my Department, have done and are doing all in our power to facilitate the resumption of negotiations on outstanding issues. I again take the opportunity to appeal to the IMO to call off their indus<Col N="1009" />trial action and, in accordance with the terms of Sustaining Progress, to participate meaningfully in negotiations under the recognised industrial relations machinery, with a view to having outstanding issues resolved as speedily as possible.</P>

    <P>There is no specific allocation made for the cost of administration to each health board. As set out in the 1996 accountability legislation, the boards and the ERHA receive a net determination each year, and the development of service plans and management of expenditure is a matter for the boards-authority.</P>
    <P>However, as a guideline the cost of administration across the boards-authority is typically between 4% and 5% of overall payroll costs. This covers both frontline administrative staff, such as hospital consultants' secretaries, ward clerks and community services clerks, and other management-administrative staff such as those who work on accounts, payroll, personnel and so on.</P>

      <P>Following receipt of the report, Diabetes: Securing the Future from the Diabetes Federation of Ireland last year, a meeting took place between officials of my Department and the federation. The federation was informed that the report would be considered in the context of the current health strategy Quality and Fairness &ndash; A Health System for You, the primary care strategy A New Direction and within the limits of available funding. My Department is examining how best diabetic services can be improved nationally.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A full range of services for persons with diabetes is provided by the health services generally and many initiatives have significant benefits for persons with diabetes and in the prevention of the disease. A particular case in point is the car<Col N="1011" />diovascular health strategy, Building Healthier Hearts, which made a number of recommendations on the prevention of heart disease and many of these are also relevant to the prevention of diabetes.</P>
    <P>The strategy recommends the expansion of primary prevention initiatives to reduce the development of risk factors, and related diseases such as diabetes, in the population. Awareness of the need to adopt a more healthy lifestyle was one of the main objectives of the first phase of the heart health campaign Ireland Needs a Change of Heart. A combination of primary prevention in the general population and secondary prevention in those known to have heart disease, as outlined in Building Healthier Hearts, can be expected to substantially reduce the risk of heart disease, including in patients with related conditions such as diabetes, in the coming years.</P>
    <P>The funding allocated by Government to the health services in 2003 is designed to maintain the existing level of service in overall terms. The economic outlook for 2003 is reflected in the approach taken by the Government to spending Estimates and the budget. Of the overall level of investment in public services in 2003, some two-thirds has been allocated to the health services.</P>

      <P>I am not familiar with the report to which the Deputy refers. MMR vaccine was introduced into the primary childhood immunisation programme in 1988. The current GP delivered primary childhood immunisation programme was introduced in December 1995. Therefore, national immunisation uptake data in respect of MMR vaccine, for children at two years of age, is available from 1998. Detailed information in respect of earlier years is not available for all health boards or for all years concerned. The national MMR uptake rate in respect of children at two years of age since 1998 is as follows:</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="1012" />The primary childhood immunisation programme provides for the immunisation of children up to two years of age against a range of potentially serious infectious diseases. Under the programme parents may have their children immunised free of charge by the general practitioner of their choice. The schedule of immunisation is in accordance with the recommendations of the Immunisation Advisory Committee of the Royal College of Physicians of Ireland.</P>
    <P>MMR vaccine is available under the primary childhood immunisation programme and there is no provision for children to receive separate measles, mumps or rubella vaccinations under this programme. Information provided by the Irish Medicines Board, which has responsibility for licensing all pharmaceutical products in Ireland, indicates that while single dose vaccines for measles, mumps and rubella are licensed in Ireland, it does not believe these single vaccines are currently marketed here. There are sound public health reasons for not administering the MMR as separate vaccines. On the basis of currently available information there is no evidence that giving each of the component vaccines separately has any greater benefit than the combined vaccines.</P>
    <P>Splitting the MMR vaccine into separate components would involve extra injections for children and would cause both children and the people with whom they come in contact to be exposed to these potentially serious diseases for a much longer period of time and be at greater risk of contracting the diseases concerned. To my knowledge no other country advocates the use of three separate vaccines rather than the MMR vaccine. MMR vaccine is in use worldwide. Most countries implement a two-dose MMR vaccine programme and this policy has been very successful in controlling measles where high uptake of the vaccine has been achieved. My primary concern and that of my Department in relation to immunisation is that the vaccines in use are safe and effective. There is a sound evidence basis for the use of MMR in the national programme.</P>
    <P>The international consensus from professional bodies and international organisations is that MMR is a safe and effective vaccine and that the recently published medical evidence does not support a causal link between MMR vaccine and autism or inflammatory bowel disease. The institutions include the Medical Research Council Expert Committee the British Committee on Safety of Medicines in the UK, the Centres for Disease Control and Prevention, the American Academy of Paediatrics in the USA as well as the World Health Organisation and UK professional organisations. Recent studies by the United States Institute of Medicine concluded that there was no link between the vaccine and autism or inflammatory bowel disease. A large Finnish study involving 1.8 million individuals demonstrated that no case of inflammatory bowel disease or autism was linked to the MMR vaccine. A similar Swedish study found no increase in <Col N="1013" />cases of autism in the 10 years during which MMR vaccine was introduced. A recent UK study where researchers analysed 2,000 studies from 180 countries found no evidence of a causal link between MMR vaccine and autism or inflammatory bowel disease. In late 2002, the <i>New England Journal of Medicine </i>published details of a study of more than 500,000 children born in Denmark between January 1991 and December 1998 which indicated that the risk of autism was the same for children regardless of whether or not they were vaccinated with MMR.</P>
    <P>The World Health Organisation has indicated that observations made regarding the onset of autism following the administration of MMR vaccine do not meet the scientific criteria required to suggest that the vaccine is the cause. It has also indicated that there has been no new scientific evidence that would suggest impaired safety of MMR. The WHO strongly endorses the use of MMR vaccine on the grounds of its convincing record of safety and efficacy. This view is supported by the Irish Medicines Board and by the Royal College of Physicians of Ireland.</P>
    <P>The Irish Medicines Board, IMB, is responsible for the monitoring and safety of all pharmaceutical products in Ireland. The monitoring of vaccine safety is ensured through clinical trials prior to licence and post-licence surveillance by the IMB. The IMB liaises closely with international bodies including the European Medicines Evaluation Agency and the World Health Organisation.</P>
    <P>The Joint Committee on Health and Children in its Report on Childhood Immunisation which was published in July 2001 concluded that there is no evidence of a proven link between the MMR vaccine and autism and that there is no evidence to show that the separate vaccines are any safer than the combined MMR vaccine.</P>
    <P>There is concern among some parents in relation to the measles, mumps and rubella vaccine. Negative coverage on this issue has added to the confusion of parents in deciding whether or not to vaccinate their children. In April 2002, I launched the MMR vaccine discussion pack, an information guide for health professionals and parents. The pack was produced by the NDSC and the Department of Public Health, Southern Health Board, and was published by the health boards executive on behalf of the health boards.</P>
    <P>The pack sets out the facts in relation to the most common concerns about MMR in a way that will help health professionals and parents to explore these concerns together, review the evidence in relation to MMR and provide the basis for making an informed decision. The information is presented in such a way as to allow full discussion between health professionals and parents on each issue. The pack also contains an information leaflet for parents. The layout of the pack is in question and answer format and addresses such issues as the alleged link between MMR and autism and Crohn's disease, the safety and side effects of the vaccine, the purpose of a <Col N="1014" />second dose of vaccine, combined vaccine versus single doses and contraindications to the vaccine. The pack will be of great assistance to health professionals and will enable them to respond to the very real concerns of parents.</P>
    <P>I urge all parents to have their children immunised against the diseases covered by the childhood immunisation programme in order to ensure that both their children and the population generally have maximum protection against the diseases concerned. General practitioners are aware of the contraindications to the recommended childhood immunisations and parents should discuss any concerns they may have with their general practitioner before making a decision about their child's immunisation. Any decision regarding immunisation of a child is a personal and private one for the parent(s) concerned; my Department's role in the matter is to enable parents to be fully informed prior to making such a decision.</P>

      <P>I assume the Deputy is referring to the practice, following the FN judgment in 1995, of the High Court in judicial review or other proceedings, making orders for the detention of non-offending children in need of special care or protection in detention facilities for offending children in a small number of cases.</P>
      <P>This practice has greatly diminished in recent years with the increase in the number of health board high support and special care places for non-offending children who need more intensive intervention and with the development of other services. Approximately &euro;40 million in capital funding has been made available by this Government through the health boards to put in place additional high support and special care places. The number of such places has increased from 17 in 1996 to a current total of more than 120.</P>
      <P>A five place regional special care unit for boys is due to open later this year in the Mid-Western Health Board. In addition a number of intensive community based services have been put in place to provide for the needs of this group of children, for example, the Youth Advocacy Pilot Projects in the Northern Area Health Board and the Western Health Board which commenced last year.</P>
      <P>While High Court orders of detention are currently required by health boards to detain non-offending children with challenging behaviour in special care units, work is at an advanced stage with a view to introducing Parts 2, 3 and 11 of the Children Act 2001 later this year. These Parts provide a statutory scheme for non-offending children in need of special care or protection to be placed in special care units on foot of a special care order made by the District Court in appropriate circumstances as a last resort and for as short a period as possible. Taken together these measures should obviate the need for applications to be made to the High Court for orders for detention of non-offending children in need of special care or protection.</P>

      <Quest>if the NWHB roster is such that registered psychiatric nurses in Sligo Leitrim Mental Health Services have to work 13 ten hour shifts in a 15 day period with the possibility of working a further 7 hour shifts on night duty with the result that the nurse may be required to work 20 shifts in a 23 day period; if his attention has been drawn to the fact that mothers working as registered psychiatric nurses with this service are unable to work the current roster and are forced to cut their hours by working reduced hours or on a job sharing basis in order to have some form of quality time with their families; his views on whether the roster referred to is inconsistent with the needs of a modern health service and is anti-women, anti-family and has the potential to compromise patient care; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <P>I have made inquiries with the North-Western Health Board and have been informed that the present roster system for psychiatric nurses with Sligo-Leitrim, West Cavan Mental Health Services is no longer capable of meeting the needs of a modern mental health service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The North-Western Health Board is addressing the issue and has proposed a revised roster to both trade unions, PNA-SIPTU who represent psychiatric nurses in the region. To date one union has rejected the proposals and the issue is being addressed through the normal industrial <Col N="1020" />relations mechanisms. It is the intention of the board to introduce revised rostering arrangements at an early date. The scenario as described can arise within the present rostering arrangements, however local nurse management facilitate staff with the opportunity to take days off or annual leave prior to commencing night duty.</P>
    <P>On the provision of &ldquo;job sharing&rdquo; and &ldquo;flexible working arrangements&rdquo; within the mental health services, the North-Western Health Board provides the same opportunities to psychiatric nurses as other employees. By its very nature psychiatric nursing must be provided on a 24 hour, seven day a week basis. It is the policy of the board to facilitate staff where possible. The revised roster proposed by the board addresses inadequacies identified in the present system and will make a positive contribution to family friendly working arrangements. The new roster provides for psychiatric nurses to work no more than four consecutive days.</P>
    <P>The suggestion that working arrangements for psychiatric nurses are anti-women and anti-family is incorrect. The North-Western Health Board is an equal opportunities employer and has been to the forefront in implementing family friendly working arrangements across all services. The impetus for changing the current rosters is to promote both patient care and staff welfare in a consistent manner. </P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 360 to 362, inclusive, together.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy is aware, I established an expert group in mid March 2003 to advise me concerning SARS-related matters. This group meets regularly and continues to monitor the situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Persons travelling to Ireland from a SARS-affected area are advised to monitor their health for ten days following their departure from an <Col N="1021" />affected area; if they develop any of the symptoms of SARS they should seek medical advice urgently and advise the relevant medical practitioner that they have recently been in an affected area. Advertisements to this effect have been prominently displayed in the national newspapers on a number of occasions since the end of March 2003. Specific travel advice and guidelines have been developed by the expert group for members of the public as well as for teachers, students and health care workers. These guidelines are available on my Department's website www.doh.ie.</P>
    <P>In addition, my Department strongly advises individuals not to travel to the following SARS-affected regions: China; Hong Kong Special Administrative Region of China; and Singapore. Since the incubation period of SARS can be up to ten days, general registration or health controls, that is, screening, at ports of arrival in Ireland are of little value. On the contrary, they may give the public a false sense of security. This is in line with expert advice received from the World Health Organisation and the European Union's communicable disease network committee. Instead, the WHO recommends that persons departing from an affected area should be interviewed by a health care worker to assess whether they have any of the symptoms of SARS or have had any contact with a probable or suspect case.</P>
    <P>Protocols and guidance for hospitals and health professionals which describe the syndrome and provide advice on how suspect cases should be managed have been developed. The relevant guidelines and protocols have been circulated to medical practitioners. This material is reviewed and updated by the expert group and the most up to date information is also available on my Department's website (www.doh.ie). A large amount of other relevant information in relation to SARS has also been placed on my Department's website including a frequently asked questions document which should help to inform the public and to address public concerns. This information is updated on an ongoing basis.</P>
    <P>Recommendations have been made by the expert group as to the nature of the public information which should be made available in relation to SARS. Arrangements have been put in place to give effect to these recommendations and early in the process, information was made available by way of notices in airports to alert travellers to the issue. This effort was expanded recently and, with effect from Monday, 28 April 2003, arrangements were made to hand out information leaflets on all incoming flights to Ireland and at other points of entry &ndash; ports and Enterprise train line. It is estimated that circa 100,000 leaflets per day will be distributed through these channels. Public announcements are also being made on incoming flights and ferries. SARS information desks have been set up at arrival terminals in all airports and ferry ports. A national SARS freephone information line &ndash;<Col N="1022" />1800 45 45 00 &ndash; has been set up with effect from 28 April 2003.</P>
    <P>I have met with the Special Olympics Committee on one occasion in recent weeks to discuss matters in relation to SARS. The chief medical officer of my Department has met with the Committee on three occasions, most recently on 9 May 2003, and continues to liaise with them on a regular basis. The matter is under consideration by the expert group. Assistance in relation to this issue has been received from the World Health Organisation. It is hoped that a decision in relation to the Special Olympics will be reached by mid-May. The World Health Organisation has laid down guidelines in relation to the isolation and accommodation facilities required for the management of probable SARS patients in an in-patient setting. These are, in descending order of preference:negative pressure rooms; single rooms with their own bathroom facilities; and cohort placement of patients in a dedicated area. My Department has been advised by the Eastern Regional Health Authority and the health boards that there is considerable response capacity in place which satisfies the WHO guidelines.</P>

      <P>I refer to the reply to Question No. 176 of 8 May 2003. I met with a delegation from the EU Committee on Petitions on 4 April 2003 along with officials from my Department and the interim chairman of the Commission for Taxi Regulation. I took the opportunity to explain the background to taxi liberalisation and the independent three person taxi hardship panel that was established by the Government to report in general terms on the nature and extent of extreme personal financial hardship that may have been experienced by individual taxi licence holders arising from loss of income as a direct result of liberalisation. I also explained that based on legal precedent there can be no legal duty on the State to compensate taxi licence holders in relation to open market licence values that may have existed prior to taxi liberalisation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I informed the delegation that the Government has approved the implementation of the taxi hardship panel recommendations and that every effort will be made to put in place a structure to <Col N="1023" />facilitate the commencement of payments on the basis of those recommendations as soon as possible.</P>

      <P>In February 2002 the Government approved the appointment of a panel of three independent persons to report in general terms on the nature and extent of extreme personal financial hardship which may have been experienced by individual taxi licence holders as a direct result of the liberalisation of entry to the taxi industry on 21 November 2000.</P>
      <P>On 17 December 2002 the Government approved the implementation on a phased basis of the recommendations of the taxi hardship panel in accordance with An Agreed Programme for Government. These recommendations relate to extreme personal financial hardship as a result of taxi liberalisation experienced by taxi licence holders only. Any payments to be made as a result of this implementation will not represent compensation but rather compassionate payments in respect of extreme personal financial hardship. The report of the taxi hardship panel recommends the establishment of a scheme to provide payments to individual taxi licence holders who fall into one of six categories that the panel assessed as having suffered extreme personal financial hardship.</P>
      <P>The design and administration of a scheme to implement the recommendations of the taxi hardship panel and the arrangements to facilitate the making of payments to eligible persons will be progressed as quickly as possible so as to ensure that applications are dealt with on a confidential and objective basis. In that context, I have already asked Mr. Jimmy Farrelly, who I recently appointed as the interim chairman of the Commission for Taxi Regulation, to progress as a priority the implementation of the findings of the panel report.</P>

      <P>While issues concerned with the cost and availability of motor insurance are primarily matters for my colleague, the Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, I have taken a number of road safety initiatives that I expect to have a <Col N="1024" />positive effect on the cost of motor insurance. The more significant of these include the implementation of penalty points for speeding offences and the phased roll-out of penalty points to other offences. In this regard I recently announced that it is proposed to introduce penalty points for driving without insurance with effect from 1 June 2003, and in respect of seat belt offences committed by drivers with effect from 1 July 2003.</P>
      <P>I am also in consultation with the motor insurance industry with a view to putting in place arrangements to secure reductions in motor insurance costs for drivers with no penalty points. My Department is working towards the earliest possible implementation of those recommendations of the Motor Insurance Advisory Board for which I have responsibility and which the MIAB considers will contribute to lower insurance costs.</P>

      <P>I refer the Deputy to the replies which I gave to Parliamentary Questions Nos. 360 and 361 on 15 April 2003. The following developments have taken place since that reply was given.</P>
      <P>My Department wrote to Dublin Bus on 17 April 2003 stating that it could proceed with additional services on the existing 38C route that currently serves Tyrrelstown, as notified on 6 March 2003. On 28 April 2003 a notification was received from Dublin Bus requesting additional services on the existing 40D route. On 2 May 2003 my Department informed Dublin Bus that a decision on this notification was being deferred as the initiation or alteration of the service requested would give rise to competition with a proposed service for which a licence had already been sought by another operator. As indicated to Dublin Bus, my Department will revert to the company as soon as a decision has been made on the licence application.</P>

      <P>As the Deputy is aware, the equal opportunities child care programme 2000-06 is providing almost &euro;437 million of Exchequer and EU funding for the development of child care services. The programme aims to increase the supply of group child care places by 50% by programme end.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To end of April 2003, &euro;189.9 million was allocated to more than 1,600 child care services on a national level. It is estimated that the grants to child care providers and community groups will create 23,120 new child care places and will also support over 23,098 existing places. The Department's records show that the total funding committed to the Tallaght, Dublin 24 area, over the past year, is &euro; 3,068,211. This may be understated as it is not always possible to determine the geographical location of projects with precision. This total funding committed includes: Four capital grant applications for community based/not-for-profit groups have been approved and a total of &euro; 2,245,591 has been committed; one capital grant application for private provider has been approved and over &euro;22,000 committed; four staffing grant applications for community based/not-for-profit have been approved and &euro;740,000 has been committed; and national voluntary child care organisations were approved funding of &euro;50,000 to support the development of child care facilities and enhance the quality of child care provision. The Deputy will be interested to hear that our records show that over &euro;8 million has been committed to the Tallaght area since the equal opportunities childcare programme began in 2000. There is still funding available for good projects which meet the programme's aims and <Col N="1027" />would encourage more groups in the Tallaght and Dublin 24 area, who are interested in setting up or developing a child care service, to contact my Department or the South Dublin County Child care Committee.</P>

      <P>I am informed by the Garda authorities that there are approximately 210,000 licensed firearms within the State. The responsibility for issuing and renewing firearm certificates is that of the local Garda superintendent. Since the passing of the Firearms Act 2000 the issue of firearms certificates to non-nationals is also the responsibility of the local superintendents.</P>
      <P>The firearms database is maintained at Garda headquarters. New applications are processed there throughout the year. Renewal notices and firearm certificates are issued from Garda headquarters in August each year. The Garda IT section carries out the printing of renewal notices and certificates. The distribution of notices and certificates has been contracted out for many years through open tender competitions. The contractor distributes the certificates to station level. Licence holders are required to attend their local station to collect their certificates on payment of the appropriate fee.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1028" />Three clerical officers and one staff officer maintain the database, two clerical officers full time and one job sharing. Consideration of any further contracting out of this work would of course have to take appropriate account of legislative and security issues, but in general I am anxious to examine every possibility to relieve the administrative burden on the Garda Síochána and to enable it to concentrate on front line policing.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. McDowell Mr. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. McDowell)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 381 to 383, inclusive, together.</P>
      <P>In general, I am fully in favour of relieving the Garda Síochána of administrative or technical duties so as to make them available for operational policing duties. I am informed by the Garda authorities that the Garda national digital project is presently considering the outsourcing of service provision for the replacement of the current Garda national radio network. I am also informed that where practicable, the Garda telecommunications section outsources maintenance contracts. At present the value of these outsourced projects is &euro;2.2 million. In addition, all significant IT development is outsourced.</P>
      <P>Research conducted under the Garda Síochána strategic management initiative identified a number of areas which it was considered would be suitable to outsource. These included fleet maintenance; vehicle maintenance and repair; vehicle spare parts; management of the contract for disposal via auction; towing; supply of tyres; and vehicle marking and fit-out. These recommendations are currently under consideration in my Department.</P>
      <P>The personnel strength of the Garda Síochána as at 12 May 2003 is 11,774, all of whom are available for operational duties. There are currently 420 Garda personnel allocated to administrative duties and there are almost 900 civilian clerical and administrative staff employed as a support to the Garda Síochána.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1029" />In November 1997 the Government accepted in principle the recommendations set out in the report of the steering group on the efficiency and effectiveness of the Garda Síochána. The report contained a number of recommendations requiring more comprehensive development relating to the organisation, operations, financing and performance and accountability of the Garda Síochána and also recognised the potential for further civilianisation within the force. It stated that the concept behind the introduction of civilianisation was to allow for certain jobs to be done at a more economic cost and to free up gardaí for work more suited to their training and development, while at the same time increasing the operational capacity of the force.</P>
    <P>More recently, a comprehensive bottom-up review group focused on organisation structures-systems and the deployment of operational resources and brought recommendations to the Garda SMI steering group in the areas for which it was responsible, including civilianisation. The Government approved the steering group's report on civilianisation in the Garda Síochána, which recommended a programme of civilianisation of 496 technical and administrative posts occupied by gardaí to allow for the release of Garda members to operational policing. These posts are located in Garda headquarters, in the Garda College and in districts and divisions throughout the country. Some 65 posts have been identified to commence this process and it is envisaged that the remaining posts will thereafter be civilianised on a phased basis.</P>
    <P>Civilianisation of posts is one option which can enable gardaí to return to highly visible operational duties and in addition to the areas mentioned above, there are other areas of administrative or technical work which could be successfully contracted out to others.</P>

      <P>The position is that in November last the Commission on Liquor Licensing placed advertisements in the newspapers seeking submissions from the public and interested parties in relation to trading hours. A substantial number of responses was received by the commission. Arising from its consideration of the issues involved and the submissions received, the commission recommended that closing time on Thursday night should revert to 11.30 p.m. I intend to provide for this in the Intoxicating Liquor Bill which I will bring to Government in the coming weeks.</P>
      <P>According to the final report, the commission was concerned that the later opening on Thursday nights was having an adverse impact on young people reporting for work or training, or turning up for classes or lectures on Friday mornings. No recommendations were made by the commission in relation to closing times on Friday or Saturday.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy may be aware, the commission recommended a role for local authorities in relation to the duration of special exemption orders in their respective areas. Specifically, the commission recommended that where a local authority, having consulted with relevant interests, including the Garda Síochána, formally adopts a resolution concerning the duration of special exemption orders in all or part of its functional area, the District Court shall have regard to any such resolution in granting such orders. I intend to give effect to this recommendation in the Bill I have already mentioned.</P>

      <P>In the event of a Garda vehicle being involved in an accident, the Garda driver forwards a completed MT15 form to the fleet management section immediately. The MT15 is a preliminary report of the accident which notifies the fleet management section of the occurrence of the accident and the circumstances surrounding it. The public service vehicle inspector will then assess the damage to determine the viability of repairing or replacing the vehicle. Should the vehicle be deemed repairable, three competitive tenders must be obtained before final approval will be given for the repair to be carried.</P>
      <P>The decision on sanction for repair or replace will normally rest with the technical inspector. If the damage is relatively minor and the vehicle repair can be completed in a short space of time, local management may be able to cope from within existing resources. Where this is not possible, every effort is then made to provide a temporary replacement from the fleet management section while the repair is being carried out. The timeframe for having the car returned to service after minor repairs is normally no longer than two to three weeks. In most instances, for minor accidents, this time is considerably less.</P>
      <P>For major repairs and where it is not possible for local management to manage from within existing resources, a replacement car will be provided, depending on availability, as soon as possible. Should the vehicle be deemed a write-off, a new vehicle will be issued as soon as possible, again subject to availability. If a new vehicle is not available immediately, a temporary replacement may be issued, pending the availability of new vehicles. This process should normally take no longer than two to three weeks and in most instances will be less. In dealing with the replacement of vehicles each case is dealt with on its merits and the urgency of the situation.</P>

      <P>With regard to the family concerned, the husband and his wife and children arrived in the State on separate dates and their subsequent asylum applications, while duly recognised to be those of a married couple, were also processed separately. The husband arrived in the State on 9 April 2001 and applied for asylum. He was interviewed by the Refugee Applications Commissioner on 16 May 2002 and notified that it was recommended that he not be declared a refugee on 22 August 2002. He appealed this decision.

      <P>On 10 March 2003 he was notified that the Minister was proposing to make a deportation order in respect of him under the power given to him by section 3 of the Immigration Act 1999.

Her appeal was rejected following a hearing at the Refugee Appeals Tribunal on 12 March 2003. On 23 April 2003 she was notified that the Minister was proposing to make a deportation order in respect of her and her children under section 3 of the Immigration Act 1999. She was informed of the following options: to make written representations to the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform within 15 working days setting out reasons she and her children should be allowed to remain in the State; to voluntarily leave the State; or to consent to deportation.

As I stated then, my Department is in regular contact with the Garda authorities about the progress of various Garda station building projects, including the future development of Tallaght Garda station. Moreover, I indicated that the Office of Public Works is researching proposals, in consultation with South Dublin County Council, to maximise the development potential of the site of Tallaght Garda station and that any redevelopment of the site will include the provision of a new Garda station which will meet all current and future requirements of the Garda Síochána. I am not aware that consideration is being given to relocating the Garda station as stated by the Deputy. I understand from the Office of Public Works that the current position is that consultations with the county council are nearing conclusion and it is expected that a planning application for the development of the site will be made by end 2003.</P>

Section 37 of the Employment Equality Act 1998 provides, <i>inter alia,</i> that those parts of the Act relating to discrimination on the age ground do not apply to employment in the Garda Síochána.</P>
      <P>On 27 November 2000 Council Directive 2000/78/EC was adopted establishing a general framework for equal treatment in employment and occupation. The implementation of the directive will have implications for the age provision of the Employment Equality Act 1998. The Government has approved the drafting of legislation to amend the Employment Equality Act 1998 and the Equal Status Act 2000 to give effect to three EU equality directives, including Directive 2000/78/EC. Any implications for admission to the Garda Síochána will be considered in that context.</P>
      <P>The Minister's objective is to have a fit, active and experienced force with an appropriate balance as regards the age profile.</P>

That decision was affirmed by the Refugee Appeals Tribunal. Subsequently, my predecessor made a deportation order in respect of the person. The person referred to has sought leave of the High Court to apply for judicial review of the decisions in the case. In the circumstances, it would be inappropriate for me to make any further comment in relation to the case until the judicial review proceedings have been determined.

Dealing numbers D2002PS008440D and D2002PS008413A refer. I understand that due to their complicated nature, applications under section 49, which require detailed examination of claims for registration as owners, can take some time to process.

      <P>While the number of Garda personnel on duty on any given day can vary from day to day and location to location according to the exigencies of the service, the Minister has been informed by the Garda Commissioner that, in 2002, a total of 2,301 gardaí were available for duty at any one time out of a total Garda strength of 11,895.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will be aware that the Cabinet has authorised the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to make the greatest possible use of the existing capacity of the Garda Training College in Templemore over the next two years to bring the strength of the force to 12,200, its current authorised maximum strength.</P>
      <P>A new Garda recruitment competition is under way. It is planned that 660 Garda trainees will be taken into the Garda Training College during 2003.

      <P>The Minister has already informed this House that he will not be content with raising the strength of the Garda Síochána to an historic high of 12,200, and higher again as soon as budgetary circumstances permit the Government to make progress towards the target of 14,000 provided in the programme for Government for achievement by 2007. The Minister also intends to increase, as soon as circumstances permit, the number of Garda members available for front-line policing through a process of civilianisation.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 403 and 414 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am informed by the Garda authorities that ongoing co-operation with police services from other jurisdictions in tackling drug trafficking is both positive and beneficial. Co-operation is achieved in a number of ways, including: through the exchange of operational information on the activities of individual criminals and criminal organisations; through investigations and prosecutions at home and abroad in accordance with <Col N="1040" />legislation governing mutual assistance in criminal matters.</P>
    <P>Garda liaison officers are based in London, Paris, The Hague, Madrid, and at Europol and Interpol headquarters. Their presence facilities co-operation with the relevant law enforcement agencies in those jurisdictions and with the international institutions, especially in relation to drugs matters. Since 1994, Europol has been able to provide intelligence and analytical support to investigations into international drug smuggling operations.</P>
    <P>All EU member states agree on the need to tackle the organised criminals who either smuggle drugs into the EU or, as in the case of certain synthetic drugs, manufacture them illegally in laboratories within the Union. The EU, as a result, has a co-ordinated strategy on drugs for the period 2000-04. It is designed to put more emphasis on prevention and on reducing drugs demand. It aims also, in accordance with the treaties, to reinforce the fight against organised crime and drug trafficking and to strengthen police, customs and judicial co-operation in these areas.</P>
    <P>All member states agree also that maximum benefit should be derived from co-operation between their respective law enforcement authorities when investigating cross-border crime in any member state. To this end, the Criminal Justice (Joint Investigation Teams) Bill 2003 gives effect to agreement at EU level, as foreseen in the Treaty on European Union, to set up such teams, as a first step, to combat trafficking in drugs in particular. All stages of the Bill will be taken in the Seanad between 14 and 20 May.</P>
    <P>On a broader level, our particular legal framework reflects both international trends and measures tailored to meet our national situation in responding to the problem of drugs. Ireland is a party, for example, to the important multilateral UN conventions on drugs and psychotropic substances. The basic aim of the international drug control treaties is to limit the use of drugs to medical and scientific purposes only. They also provide a framework for international co-operation in achieving these objectives.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. McDowell)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 411 and 412 together.</P>
      <P>Under the Courts Service Act, 1998, the Courts Service &ndash; which is responsible for the day-to-day management of the courts &ndash; is independent in the performance of its functions. I am responsible for ensuring that the service is adequately funded and, in this regard, &euro;92.179 million has been provided in 2003 for the Courts Service. This represents a 5.6% increase on 2002. The funding provided is allowing the Courts Service to progress the implementation of its strategic plans and policies specifically in the areas of information technology and capital building programmes. I am confident that the level of funding provided to the Courts Service is adequate to maintain existing levels of service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While some element of delay is inevitable in the courts system, the position differs from court to court. For instance, there are little or no delays in the hearing of cases in the Supreme Court. In the case of the High Court, the waiting time for the hearing of personal injury actions is ten days in Dublin &ndash; from the time that both parties are <Col N="1044" />ready to go for hearing &ndash; and, in respect of cases heard outside Dublin, they are generally included in the next sitting of the court. The average waiting time for the hearing of a judicial review is between three and six months.</P>
    <P>In the Central Criminal Court, the waiting time is 18 months. However, it is proposed to have four courts sit throughout September and this will reduce the waiting time.</P>
    <P>The situation in the Circuit Court differs from venue to venue. In many venues, cases will be heard at the next available session. As regards the District Court, there is no delay in most districts in cases being brought to hearing. In the Dublin District Courts, contested criminal cases take, on average, five months for a hearing.</P>
    <P>The Deputy specifically refers to family law. In this regard, I have been informed by the Courts Service that the waiting time for a date for the hearing of applications for divorce and judicial separation is on average four months in most parts of the country. In Dublin, where up to 40% of all divorce cases and approximately 25% of judicial separation applications are heard, there is a four week waiting time if the divorce is by consent and a 12 week waiting time if the divorce is contested. However, there are some venues outside Dublin where waiting times are longer.</P>
    <P>As regards judicial resources, seven additional judges were appointed under the provisions of the Courts and Court Officers Act 2002 &ndash; two High Court judges, three Circuit Court judges and two District Court judges. The provision of these additional resources has assisted in the objective of reducing delays generally.</P>

      <P>Crime statistics are published in the annual reports of the Garda Síochána, which are available in the Oireachtas Library. The most recent published report is in respect of 2001. Provisional statistics for 2002 are also available in the Oireachtas library.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I recently released the provisional crime statistics for the first quarter of this year. While I would hesitate to draw too many conclusions from a change in just one quarter, I very much welcome the significant reduction shown by the figures. I was particularly pleased to see that, <Col N="1045" />according to the statistics for the quarter, there was a 43% decrease in sexual assault cases, a 37% decrease in cases of assault causing harm, a 28% decrease in cases of possession of drugs for sale or supply and a 6% decrease in burglary.</P>
    <P>I consider that the figures demonstrate that a strategic and targeted use of police resources can achieve results and vindicate the Government's policy of ensuring that the gardaí have the resources to investigate crime, the courts the resources to deal effectively with criminal cases, and the Prison Service sufficient prison places to ensure that those convicted of crime will serve the sentences imposed on them by the courts.</P>

      <P>The granting of an Irish visa is, in effect, only a form of pre-entry clearance. It does not grant permission to enter the State. Visa holders are subject to the normal immigration controls at the port of entry and may be granted or refused entry to the State by the immigration officers in accordance with the provisions of the Aliens Act 1935 and the Aliens Order 1946, as amended.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1047" />Visa applications are assessed by a visa officer having regard to the criteria set out in the above legislation, who will address, <i>inter alia,</i> the following concerns. Is the applicant's stated purpose of visit their true purpose of visit? Is the applicant in possession of a valid passport or other such document? Is the applicant in a position to support himself or herself while in the State? Might the applicant breach the conditions of the visa by, for example, working without a work permit or overstaying the length of time applied for? Might the applicant breach the common travel area by travelling from the State to the UK or Northern Ireland without an appropriate entry visa?</P>
    <P>In assessing these issues the visa officer will have regard to the information provided in the application and to such factors as the applicant's ties and general circumstances in his country of origin, his immigration history as well as the relative attractiveness and feasibility of his remaining in the State. The Department's approach in these matters is informed by past experience, including experience of abuse of the system.</P>
    <P>When assessing the applications in question, consideration was given to the personal circumstances of the applicants and the extent of their ties in their country of origin. The applications were refused because it was not established, on the basis of the documentation supplied to my Department, that the applicants would observe the conditions of a visit visa. In particular, it was felt that the applicants had not displayed sufficient evidence of their obligations to return home following their proposed visit. In one case, for example, the applicant is 60 years of age, has supplied no evidence of means in her country of origin and does not appear to be in employment there. In the other case the applicant in question has no previous travel history although he is in employment.</P>
    <P>It is open to the applicants to appeal against the refusal of the visas by writing to the visa appeals officer in my Department and providing additional supporting documentation. It is the responsibility of each applicant to submit all relevant documentation, including any evidence of intent to return home, which may support the appeal.</P>

      <P>As the Deputy is aware, the Government decided in September 2001 to accept the thrust of the package of reforms <Col N="1048" />recommended by the Commission on Public Service Pensions and to establish a working group to advise on implementation, as provided for in the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness. Parallel structures with the same remit were established in the case of An Garda Síochána and the Defence Forces. The operational details of the implementation of the commission's recommendations will be agreed by Government following receipt of a report from the implementation working group. The report is in the process of being finalised.</P>
      <P>The position on the issue of parity of pensions for members of An Garda Síochána who retired prior to 1 January 1993, who do not receive the unsocial hours element in their pensions, and those who retired prior to 1 October 1982, who do not receive the rent allowance element in their pensions, is that the commission examined the specific issue of the pensionability of allowances for members of An Garda Síochána and others, as part of its deliberations, but, having assessed the arguments involved, did not recommend any increase in pension for the groups involved. Having regard to the commission's report, I have no plans to introduce amending legislation at this stage.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 421 and 438 together.</P>
      <P>Retail planning guidelines under section 28 of the Planning and Development Act 2000 were made in December 2000. The purpose of the guidelines is to assist local authorities in addressing retail development in the context of their development plans and in assessing applications for planning permission, to guide retailers and developers in formulating retail development proposals and to ensure that sustainability in terms of land use, including access by public transport where feasible, guides the identification of the preferred location for retail development. The report of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Enterprise and Small Business, May 1999, was among the inputs to which regard was had in developing the retail planning guidelines.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1049" />In relation to capping of the permitted size of certain retail developments, the guidelines prescribe a maximum area of 3,000 sq.m. net retail floorspace for foodstore development, except in the greater Dublin area, where the cap is 3,500 sq.m. The guidelines also prescribe a maximum area of 6,000 sq.m. gross retail floorspace for large-scale single retail warehouse development.</P>
    <P>When the retail planning guidelines were published it was indicated that they would be reviewed in the light of experience with their operation. I am now activating such a review, which will need to consider a number of factors including current and prospective economic circumstances, inflation and developments in retailing.</P>

It is administered by a task force under the aegis of my Department and operated on the ground by the health boards. Decisions to grant assistance in individual cases are the responsibility of the health boards at local level and it is a matter for each board to determine, within the funds available and having regard to the guidelines issued by the task force, the priority and urgency of individual cases on hand. The repair or maintenance of a house rented privately or from a local authority would be a matter for the owner of the house concerned.</P>

A review on the effectiveness of statutory road-opening controls is being carried out by my colleague, the Minister for Transport. As part of <Col N="1050" />the review, city and county managers have been asked for their comments in relation to the 2002 Act and other road-opening provisions. Depending on the outcome of the review, consideration will be given as to whether further strengthening of legislation to deal with road openings undertaken by statutory undertakers generally &ndash; i.e. in the telecommunications area and also bodies such as ESB and Bord Gáis &ndash; is required.</P>
      <P>Section 254 of the Planning and Development Act 2000, as amended by section 54 of the Communications Regulation Act 2002, provides that a licence is required from the relevant local authority for the erection of overground electronic communications infrastructure, including telegraph poles, along a public road.

      <P>As regards management fees in particular, I have no immediate plans to set guidelines on the levying of fees. It has always been a feature of home ownership that expenses arise for households on the ongoing maintenance of the property, whether the property is in more traditional housing estates where the householder directly manages this process, or some new estates and apartment blocks which have specific arrangements with companies to look after these aspects. It would not be appropriate for Government to seek to control the level of fees which should be applied as part of the maintenance of these properties.</P>

      <P>Internal renovation works were carried out to Gartan Gate Lodge at Glenveagh National Park, County Donegal, to enable it to be occupied by the head conservation ranger of the park so as to facilitate the management of the national park. The project was supervised by the foreman of the buildings maintenance unit of Glenveagh National Park and carried out in accordance with relevant procedures.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The works initially proposed involved repairs to the plumbing and heating systems at minor costs. However, as the project progressed, the project supervisor identified further works which were necessary to protect the fabric of the building and to make Gartan Gate Lodge comfortable <Col N="1052" />to live in. The final cost of materials for the works amounted to &euro;32,349.12.</P>
    <P>Most of the work was carried out by national park staff. One external contractor was engaged to carry out repairs to the plumbing system. The tender process was followed for these works.</P>
    <P>The national parks and wildlife section of my Department paid for the permanent internal fittings, as is normal in these cases.

      <P>Project details, including proposed materials and estimated overall project costs are submitted at the beginning of each year for approval by regional and senior management.

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 439, 440 and 441 together.</P>
      <P>In August 2001, my predecessor requested the Health Research Board to commission a study in order to provide an objective and expert analysis of information regarding the likely effects of landfill and thermal treatment, especially incineration, activities on public health and the environment. Six key terms of reference for the proposed study &ndash; ToR &ndash; were identified to the HRB.</P>
      <P>A study team was subsequently selected by the HRB, with the assistance of independent external advisors &ndash; my Department had no involvement in this selection process. It is understood that this study team submitted a draft report to the HRB on or about the end of February 2002. This draft report was then subject to an external academic peer review process, intended to establish that it was of a requisite standard for publication by the HRB.</P>

      <P>As the first payments from the levy on plastic bags were only received by my Department in July 2002, and the first payments for the levy on the landfilling of waste in September 2002, it is not possible for my Department to provide full-year comparisons. However, returns for both levies indicate that annual receipts should amount to around &euro;11 million for the plastic bag levy and &euro;28 million for the landfill levy. Average receipts from both levies have not varied greatly since coming into operation.</P>

      <P>The purpose of the scheme of community support for older people is to improve the security and social support of vulnerable older people. This funding is provided by way of grant aid to voluntary groups and organisations that have undertaken to identify those elderly people in need of assistance under the scheme. Under the terms of the scheme, grant aid is available towards the once-off costs of purchase and/or installation of small-scale physical security equipment and socially monitored alarm systems.</P>
      <P>It is expected that the scheme for 2003 will be advertised in July in the national and local papers. For the Deputys information following is a list of organisations funded under the scheme in the north-western region in 2002, any of which will be happy to apply for assistance on behalf of individuals in that area.</P>

      <P>The National Assessment Committee, NAC, of the young peoples facilities and services fund, which is chaired by my Department, is examining the services projects funded under round one of the fund. The intention would be that, where they are found to be effective, they will be mainstreamed, thereby enabling their ongoing provision by statutory agencies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1061" />Qualification for continued funding is dependent on the successful evaluation of each project by the services steering group, which has been set up to examine the projects, and subject to sufficient funding being in place. The work of the steering group has been completed and recommendations have been made to the NAC with a view to making final recommendations to the Cabinet committee on social inclusion at its June meeting. The development groups will be informed as soon as possible thereafter of the approved recommendations.</P>
    <P>The position regarding the commitments for staffing capital projects under phase 1 and the plans for phase 2 investment in local drug task force areas is that these are also being considered by the NAC. That committee is having discussions with the State agencies which are responsible for managing and developing the facilities involved as to the best way forward. The Cabinet committee recently considered a number of issues in relation to the operation of the fund and the matter remains under review.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan" hpid="Mary Coughlan Mary Coughlan">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Social and Family Affairs (Mary Coughlan)</NameTxt>
      <P>The conditions of entitlement to payment on the death of a spouse are provided for in social welfare legislation. Under these rules a person can qualify for widow's contributory pension on the basis of 156 PRSI contributions paid and an average of 39 paid or credited over the previous three or five years. These relatively favourable conditions for entitlement to pension have applied for many years and I have no plans to change them. Furthermore, whereas the practice in relation to survivor's pensions generally is that entitlement depends on the contribution record of the deceased spouse and not of the survivor, the conditions here can be fulfilled on the insurance record of the survivor herself or the deceased spouse.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Entitlement to old age contributory pension depends on the claimants contribution record and the same rules of entitlement apply in all cases. A person in employment can accumulate the necessary contributions for an old age contributory pension over a long period whereas this is not necessarily the case for widow's pension. The qualifying conditions for a widow's or widowers contributory pension are, therefore, more flex<Col N="1063" />ible. With increased social insurance coverage and improved participation of women in the paid labour force, I anticipate that in the future more women will qualify for pensions in their own right. I am satisfied that the current arrangements are reasonable in the circumstances.</P>

      <P>The person concerned is not entitled to a widow's non-contributory pension as she has failed to substantiate the disposal of significant capital arising from the sale of her farm and dwelling. Should she be in a position to provide the necessary proof of disposal of her capital, her entitlement to the pension will be reviewed.</P>
      <P>Under the relevant legislation, decisions in this regard are matters for deciding officers and appeals officers. These officers are statutorily appointed and I have no role in regard to making such decisions.</P>
