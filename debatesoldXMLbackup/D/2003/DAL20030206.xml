      <P>Before coming to the Order of Business I propose to deal with a number of notices under Standing Order 31 dealing with three different topics. I propose to deal with these topics separately and I will call on Deputies in the order in which they submitted their notices to my office. In regard to the first topic I have received notices from Deputies Sherlock and Boyle. I call on Deputy Sherlock to state the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeSherlock" hpid="Mr. Sherlock Mr. Sherlock">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherlock</NameTxt>
      <P>In accordance with the terms of Standing Order 31, I seek to move the adjournment of the Dáil to discuss the following specific and important matter of public interest requiring urgent attention, namely, the announcement of the loss of in excess of 200 jobs at Technicolor Home Entertainment, Youghal, which, coming on top of the loss of 160 jobs just six weeks ago, represents an economic body-blow to the east Cork region, and the need for the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment to request the industrial development agencies to give the area absolute priority in the search for replacement jobs. In view of the importance of this issue I hope the Ceann Comhairle will agree to this request.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Boyle</NameTxt>
      <P>I request the adjournment of the business of the House under Standing Order 31 to discuss a matter of urgent and national importance, namely, the decision of Technicolor Home Entertainment to close its Youghal, County Cork, factory with the loss of 230 jobs following the closure of another factory in the town, bringing to 450 the jobs lost in this town over a six week period.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gogarty</NameTxt>
      <P>I request the adjournment of the House under Standing Order 31 to discuss another matter of urgent national importance, namely, the shocking, shameful and questionable refusal by the Department of Education and Science to release documents under the Freedom of Information Act, including the valuations of church property but also relating to other documents involving the compensation deal agreed with religious orders in relation to abuse in religious institutions, given the topicality and urgent nature of this matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cuffe</NameTxt>
      <P>Under Standing Order 31, I request that the business of the House be adjourned to discuss a matter of urgent national importance in regard to illegal dumping in County Wicklow and that this House requests the Environmental Protection Agency to investigate urgently the significant unauthorised dumping that has taken place on CRH-Roadstone's land close to the Blessington reservoir and the need to protect the Dublin water supply from contamination from the extensive and unauthorised dump.</P>

When will the redundancy payments Bill come to the House? Is the Tánaiste aware of newspaper reports to the effect that some employers who are down-sizing are bringing forward redundancies to evade the terms of the legislation? Is it her advice that the legislation could have retrospective effect? </P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Stagg</NameTxt>
      <P>The leader of the Labour Party has just asked if the Government will consider certain business for discussion in the House. I do not see how that can be out of order on the Order of Business.</P>

      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>The Order of Business, for the benefit of the House, involves the taking of business which has been promised, including legislation promised within or outside the Dáil, the making of secondary legislation, arrangements for sittings and when Bills or other documents on the Order Paper needed in the House will be circulated&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EmmetStagg" hpid="Mr. Stagg Mr. Stagg">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Stagg</NameTxt>
      <P>There are several places where Deputy Rabbitte's question would be in order under what you read out, a Cheann Comhairle. It is a bad situation when the leader of a party cannot suggest to the Government that it might provide for a particular issue.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle An Ceann Comhairle">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>The point I made to Deputy Rabbitte is that the House has to be fair to every Deputy. If one allowed one Deputy to <Col N="1309" /> raise issues in that manner, one would have to allow every Deputy to do so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EmmetStagg" hpid="Mr. Stagg Mr. Stagg">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Stagg</NameTxt>
      <P>On that point of order, leaders have special positions under Standing Orders. They are allowed to ask one question on the Order of Business, to raise one issue.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope the Tánaiste will take the opportunity of answering Deputy Rabbitte's question at this point. Before I ask my question on promised legislation, I wish to point out that I will be asking it in Irish in case anybody wants to take advantage of the headphones provided &ndash; I found mine underneath my bench. Beidh mé ag bualadh le roinnt eagrais Gaeilge inniu agus tá a fhios agam go mbeidh ceist acu mar gheall ar Bhille na Gaeilge. Tá an Bille sa Seanad anois ach níl aon freagra faighte againn go fóill ar na ceisteanna go léir a cuireadh mar gheall ar an Bhille sin agus ar cathain a bheidh sé sa Dáil. Ba mhaith liom a fháil amach inniu, roimh an chruinniú sin, an bhfuil aon phlean ag an Rialtas an Bille sin a thabhairt isteach i gceann seachtaine nó dhó. Tá sé reidh agus b'fhearr liom dáta a fháil inniu más féidir.</P>

      <P>On promised legislation, the Taoiseach told the Dáil on 19 November last that a working group of officials from a number of Departments had drawn up legislative proposals to implement the recommendation of the 1999 Victims Commission that there should be a trust fund for victims of the conflict in this jurisdiction. He said these proposals were with the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform.</P>

In respect of the 50 Bills the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform has on the Government programme, would it not be better for him to devote his attention to enforcing exist<Col N="1311" /> ing laws rather than spending so much time drafting new laws?

      <P>A Cheann Comhairle, I am anxious to stay within your rulings and to be in order, but there are numerous precedents where Deputies from both sides of the House have asked the Taoiseach, the Tánaiste or whoever is taking the Order of Business for special debates on a number of issues, for instance, Northern Ireland, Iraq or other pending issues of great importance. Few issues are of greater importance at present than the economic situation and the job losses which have been faced and are about to be faced. Can I ask, I hope in order and in equal seriousness, whether the Tánaiste would be prepared to schedule an emergency debate on the actions to be taken&mdash;</P>

      <P>I wish to ask about two Bills on the list. The first is the safety, health and welfare at work Bill, which will amend and consolidate the Safety, Health and Welfare at Work Act 1989. It is a scandal that in 2003 workers have to hold public demonstrations to establish safety in the workplace, particularly given that the Government has rejected legislation on this which was prepared by my party. The second Bill caused me more difficulty. It is No. 51 and is described as the radio communications Bill, which, it is suggested, is new legislation to &ldquo;allow for a more modern and liberal approach to the environment&rdquo;. Perhaps the Tánaiste will deconstruct that phrase.

    <P>Question again proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="PeterKellyFF" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>Even to the present day, most legislation applicable to rail safety emanates from inquiries into accidents or, if we are lucky, near misses. Of course, a network our size would not <Col N="1321" /> have the same potential for accidents as the bigger UK network. This has created a major problem in that fewer accidents lead to fewer inquiries. In the absence of regular independent inquiries into rail accidents, there has been no dynamic presence in these Houses to prompt updating of legislation.</P>
      <P>That is why I welcome the new rail safety commission. The Rail Safety Bill 2001 imposes stringent new procedures for rail safety, including giving rail companies the power to test staff for drink or drugs. The proposed rail safety commission will have up to three members and will be completely independent of the Department of Transport. It will have powers to monitor and inspect railway infrastructure and investigate and publish reports into railway accidents, and it will be able to enforce its decision.</P>
      <P>As well as Iarnród Éireann, the commission will police safety on the Luas, the proposed metro and various heritage railways around the country. Any company failing to co-operate with the commission can be fined up to &euro;500,000. Each company will have to outline its safety management systems in what is called a safety case and will not be allowed to operate unless the commission is satisfied with its plans.</P>
      <P>One major area of the Bill relates to intoxicants, drugs and alcohol. In consultation with staff and unions, each company will have to draw up codes of conduct for the use of drugs or alcohol and will be able to require what are called safety critical staff to provide samples for testing for intoxicants, whether through breath tests or blood and urine samples. It is recognised that there was sustained under-investment in the railways for many years. It is a credit to the staff and management of Iarnród Éireann that they have managed to operate the railways safely over those difficult years. I am confident that the new regulatory framework, together with the major investment this Government continues to make in our railways, will lay the bedrock for safe railway travel in the future and will give assurance to the travelling public that safety will continue to be of paramount importance to this Government.</P>
      <P>I was pleased to learn recently that Iarnród Éireann now has a total of 187 carriages on order for its entire fleet, which includes suburban, arrow and inter-city trains, and further orders are planned. These included a &euro;115 million order for 80 new carriages for suburban services in the greater Dublin area, which will enter service in mid-2003, and a &euro;117 million order for 67 new inter-city carriages, which will enter service in 2005. The new inter-city trains will represent the first new carriages on the inter-city fleet for more than 20 years, with the exception of the Enterprise service to Belfast. I also welcome the news that the 7 o'clock train from Longford to Dublin will have an entire set of new rail cars at the end of this year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FinianMcGrath" hpid="Mr. F. McGrath Mr. F. McGrath">
      <NameTxt>Mr. F. McGrath</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to share time with Deputy Trevor Sargent. I am grateful for the <Col N="1322" /> opportunity to address this important legislation. The Railway Safety Bill 2001 is about ensuring the protection and safety of all citizens and about planning for the future with the proposed Luas and metro lines and the essential strategies of ensuring public safety. It is important that this Bill be implemented in full and maximum effort is put in to making our railways safe. Many trains are death traps; we should not shy away from this fact and we must urgently deal with this public safety crisis to prevent loss of life and serious injury. It is not good enough that dilapidated trains travel to our cities each day with thousands of commuters at risk. Neither is it good strategic planning to put workers' lives at risk as they travel to work. People cannot be expected to travel to work from Killester, Clontarf, Fairview and Marino in overcrowded trains and DART services. They are crammed and dangerous and I urge the Minister to follow up on the orders for new trains.</P>
      <P>This Bill provides for the establishment of an independent rail safety commission with wide-ranging powers of inspection, investigation and enforcement and the transfer of railway safety functions currently held by the Minister. I warmly welcome the establishment of a rail safety advisory council with membership drawn from all areas of the railway sector, including persons representing the public interests and the interests of mobility impaired persons. This is a positive section of the Bill and I urge the Minister to give a proper voice, not a token one, to the public interests and disability groups in the advisory council. If we are serious about social inclusion and disability rights enough places on this council must be guaranteed for these people. The customer and the taxpayer must be heard. This will ensure a quality rail service.</P>
      <P>There are examples of good practice regarding inclusion of people with disabilities. Dublin City Council has exceeded the 3% public service quota and its work force now includes 257 people with disabilities, that is 4.3% of the total. We should use examples of good practice when services are being planned.</P>
      <P>We need urgent investment in passenger and freight railway services. This will ease congestion on our roads and save lives. Why do we not look at this as a strategic part of overall traffic management plans? We must be radical and creative in order to improve quality of life.</P>
      <P>Section 20 provides that a commissioner will cease to hold office where he or she accepts a nomination of Seanad Éireann or is elected to the Dáil or European Parliament. I strongly agree with this important section as politicians cannot hold such an important independent position. I also approve of section 19 regarding ethical behaviour. Public trust and accountability must always be a priority.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 41 provides that a railway undertaking must implement a safety management system; this will lead to good practice in safety issues. The recent incident at Clontarf with subsidence connected to the construction of the Dublin Port <Col N="1323" /> Tunnel showed the clear need for workable safety measures and the urgent need to be on guard regarding risks on our railways. It also demonstrates the very serious threats posed by tunnel collapse and fire. Many tunnels around the world have collapsed and we have seen serious fires in others that resulted in many deaths. The people of Marino, Fairview and Santry have constantly warned the authorities on safety issues and their views are represented by some of the sections in the Bill. I hope we all pay attention to their serious concerns. Ramming through projects without proper safety measures will inevitably lead to loss of life.</P>
    <P>Section 39 deals fairly with the threat posed by drugs and alcohol. Under no circumstances should a person be allowed to carry out duties while under the influence or drugs or alcohol and all staff should be made aware of this from the outset. Staff programmes should be instituted for people with alcohol or drugs problems. Under no circumstances should people with drug or alcohol problems be allowed to take responsibility for trains.</P>
    <P>The Department of Finance has given sanction to the creation of nine posts on the commission. These posts should not be filled by party hacks, rather they should be filled by people with the relevant experience and qualifications and a genuine interest in safety on the railway system. The total cost of the commission will be approximately &euro;2 million. I hope costs never become an issue when public rail safety and good safety practices are at stake.</P>
    <P>Did I understand the Minister correctly when I heard him say companies such as Dublin Bus will not be privatised? Yes. I welcome that and his comments on Dublin Bus. Dublin Bus has made great efforts to improve its services in recent years. It is an excellent organisation but it must be helped. Many of its staff positions would not be filled were it not for the non-nationals working for it. I commend them on the excellent public service they provide. They are taxpayers living in this State and make a massive contribution to our city.</P>
    <P>There are many positive aspects to this Bill. It will lead to a quality rail service that has safety at the top of its agenda.</P>

      <P>Ba mhaith liom buíochas a ghabháil le mo chomhghleacaí, an Teachta Finian McGrath, as a chuid ama a roinnt liom. This Bill is very welcome and much needed. The formation of a rail safety commission will make an important statement as well as doing important work. I support Deputy Finian McGrath's comments about the need to involve people with disabilities at the earliest planning stages of development work, particularly work that has safety in mind.</P>

    <P>From experience, I have found Iarnród Éireann has a mixed reputation on safety for people with disabilities. There is no doubt that the ramps it installed are helpful and necessary but they are not always available. One finds that <Col N="1324" /> lifts across the track are out of order for long periods. Using Iarnród Éireann can be a most frustrating experience for someone with a buggy, an elderly person, someone with a broken leg or somebody with no leg. The waiting time for repairs to lifts is often very long. The lift at Balbriggan was repaired and worked for one day before it broke down again. The Minister needs to look more closely at the arrangements for keeping facilities in good repair.</P>
    <P>The wider issue of safety is related not only to the durability and repair of the tracks, but to issues such as overcrowding. Strictly speaking, this does not come within the remit of the Bill. I take the train from Balbriggan that runs on the northern suburban line. People frequently faint on it; others are squeezed when the doors close while others fall out when the doors are opened. These issues must be taken into account when dealing with safety. I know people that have had to stay at home due to illness arising from travelling on the train. I consider this a safety issue. I hope this does not become more serious and result in fatalities.</P>
    <P>The northern suburban line claims to be seeking a 40% increase in capacity, but there is an unreality about the claims that this will be the end of the matter. The population in towns along the line such as my town of Balbriggan is due to increase 200% in the next ten years.</P>
    <P>We have all seen the advertisement on television to the effect that we are not there yet but are getting there, and the young fellow getting to the finishing line. The finishing line is moving faster than the young fellow is running. I see him getting very tired if reality was to be reflected. There is need to grasp the nettle in regard to mass commuting. We must reduce the need for mass commuting, rather than allowing it to increase and then trying to meet the demand for it, which we will not be able to do. We are not meeting that demand now and we certainly will not be able to meet it in the future.</P>
    <P>Having heard of a factory closure in Youghal today and my colleague, Deputy Boyle, speaking on the Order of Business about the increasing number of factories closing nation-wide, brings to mind the crisis people will face commuting in the future. They have two choices; they either get thrown on the scrap heap of unemployment or they must travel by rail, bus or join the queues in their cars. The pace of travel by rail as well as by car is slowing down. In response to questions concerning the time spent commuting, we are generally told that a consultant has been engaged to examine the matter, but in this case time is not on our side to wait for the consultant's findings, and the Minister realises that.</P>
    <P>The closing of rail lines will worsen the standard of rail safety. A concentration of people will be pushed onto already crowded lines where development will take place. The ghost of Todd Andrews seems to be roaming when we look at the list of line closures. They include: Ennis-Athenry-Claremorris; Limerick-Foynes; Limer<Col N="1325" /> ick-Ballybrophy; Limerick Junction-Rosslare Harbour; Gorey-Rosslare Harbour; and the Navan-Kingscourt line which was closed last November when the freight line from Navan to Kingscourt closed after gypsum freight carried on trains to Limerick was transferred to road. With the phasing out of timber, cement and fertiliser freight by rail, it is estimated that 1.25 million tonnes of freight is being transferred to road transport. We are dealing with rail safety under this Bill, but we should not forget the reality that rail safety is related to road safety if increasing numbers of rail commuters are being pushed to travel by car. We are not specifically dealing with road safety, but it must be borne in mind that it will be affected by such rail closures.</P>
    <P>Instead of subventing the cost of freight, which would have been the proper way to proceed and in the long-term would have been more cost effective, it seems that we are prepared to charge the taxpayer more for building more motorways. The national development plan provides for the building of some 750 kilometres of new motorway and the laying of only 23 kilometres of new rail track. The cost involved is not only the cost of laying tarmac and engineering costs, there is also the related cost which still has not been generally faced up to in this House or by the Government, namely, the Kyoto Protocol and what will come after it. The Kyoto Protocol is only a taste of what is to come. From listening to discussions at European Commission level, I understand that the EU penalties for exceeding what is set down in the Kyoto Protocol will be augmented by a required payment in respect of exceeding what is set down in the protocol. Flooding and related climate change costs are additional, which make the cost of subventing freight, which would be a far lesser figure than people would think, pale into insignificance.</P>
    <P>Rail safety requires not only making the existing lines safer but the putting in place of additional lines. I travelled from Belfast by train today. The Belfast train holds up the suburban rail service. Rail traffic on the line is congested due to the fact that there are only two lines which were laid in 1844. Those rail lines were intended for the transport of people and for horses, which boarded at the Rush and Lusk stations, where there was a horse farm nearby. Times have changed radically since then. We are still expecting the 1844 rail infrastructure, scaled down after all the rail closures, to satisfy current commuter needs. An extra northern line is required to ensure there are three northern suburban lines, with the Dublin to Belfast line being the middle line, as it would not need to stop at platforms. Trains on that route currently have to stop and start because of congestion on the line due to the suburban rail service.</P>
    <P>How committed is the Government to the platform for change programme 2002 to 2006? Will priority in funding be given to the rail system if it comes to a hard decision between rail and road funding? If rail safety is given priority, will that mean that the pace of travel by rail must become <Col N="1326" /> slower and slower? That seems to be what is happening. The Enterprise from Belfast this morning had to stop at quite a numbers of points and the word &ldquo;express&rdquo; or &ldquo;Enterprise&rdquo; did not seem to fit the experience, just as the word Luas seems to be a ridiculous name for a system for which we are waiting for so long. We are making a farce of the names we give to such projects because they do not meet people's expectations.</P>
    <P>Customers need a rail charter. When one goes to a railway station, one sees timetables and various other notices, but one does not see a charter which would put pressure on customers and the staff to follow a code of practice and to have certain valid expectations. In terms of serving and representing the public interest, I ask the Minister to ensure there is a charter for Iarnród Éireann passengers which would ensure that they would not only travel in safety but with expectations of punctuality, efficiency and services being available, such as lifts and toilets in proper working order. The toilets in Limerick station last weekend and in Heuston were a disgrace. The disabled toilet at Heuston Station was locked and there was nobody around to open it, if it had been needed.</P>
    <P>A customer rail charter is badly needed because there is low morale concerning rail travel. That low morale affects customers far more than it seems to affect the Government. I ask the Government to bring itself up to date with the type of turmoil and trouble customers face on the rail system to ensure that, in future, customers will be encouraged and will feel welcome to use the railways. Unfortunately, that is not the case in many instances, where customers are merely tolerated and have to board a train one way or another and sometimes they cannot board it. For example, commuters in Donabate can be left behind because of overcrowding on the train. The train may stop at the station but no commuters can get on it. That is the ultimate frustration. It makes a mockery of all the talk about encouraging people to use public transport. When they try it and it fails them, they have to go back to using their cars and they are told again to try public transport, which they have already tried and found it does not work for them. I ask the Minister to ensure that a customer rail charter will be put in place which will be realistic and will guarantee the service that he expects, but he needs to ensure that.</P>
    <P>We should also examine the Iarnród Éireann belief that if a train is 15 minutes late, it is not actually late, that such a delay is within an acceptable margin of error. That contrasts strongly with the degree of punctuality on rail services on the Continent in any country in which I have travelled, be it Italy, Switzerland, Germany or France. One can see the train driver looking at the clock and waiting for the second hand to hit the hour, which is the time that the train physically moves out of the station. We need to introduce that level of discipline and to ensure that rail passengers have that level of expectation not only to ensure safety, but also to ensure the ser<Col N="1327" /> vice is efficient. Staff who are frustrated and among whom there is low morale will not be the best in terms of ensuring safety. Quite a number of times when I am catching a train, the notice displayed is not that the train is coming, but that we apologise for the delay. That results in everybody being in a bad mood boarding the train and the driver must also be frustrated by the fact that an incoming train has been delayed.</P>
    <P>This Bill is important, but it is also important that we have a debate on how we can improve safety by reducing the demand for mass commuting and mass transit. If we did that, we would be doing everyone a favour, as well as the environment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Eoin Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this important legislation. We are all aware that legislation cannot guarantee complete safety. Unfortunately, accidents happen and we have all seen pictures in the media of the horrific aftermath of recent serious accidents in the United Kingdom and elsewhere. We need to ensure that systems are in place in Ireland to minimise the risk arising from railway operations. I am sure the Bill will result in a balanced and effective approach to the regulation of rail safety.</P>
      <P>The new framework set down in the Bill, combined with genuine commitment and the will to buy into it from railway companies and their employees can certainly make a significant contribution to the enhancement of safety on our railways. The Bill should also give members of the public confidence that the Government is committed to providing safe and reliable railway transport.</P>
      <P>The Minister outlined the substantial improvements made to date throughout the rail network under the rail safety programme. In addition to improvements to the existing network, we will soon see the opening of two new light rail lines to serve the capital.</P>
      <P>It is important that we look at the history. I am sure everyone agrees that the railway system has suffered from chronic lack of investment for many decades. Fortunately, that has changed and we have undertaken a major investment programme in recent years. While much of this has concentrated on addressing shortfalls in such areas as track, signalling and stations, we have also begun to increase capacity, especially in the Dublin area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Some of the progress made includes the renewal of 325 miles of track, the replacement of 200 bridges, the upgrading of 400 level crossings, the extension of the DART to Malahide and Greystones, bringing 38 new DART carriages into service, the upgrading of the Maynooth line with double track and new services, bringing 47 <Col N="1328" /> new diesel rail cars into service, the redevelopment of Heuston Station and the construction of the Drogheda maintenance depot, which I hope will be completed this year, the delivery of 80 diesel rail cars to be put into service in the middle of this year, and new stations at Clontarf, Grand Canal Dock, Drumcondra and Monasterevin. We are about to see the ordering of 67 inter-city carriages, the commencement of the increase in the size of DART trains to eight car capacity, the upgrading of stations to accommodate such trains and the placing of an order for 40 new DART carriages.</P>
    <P>This investment has brought much needed safety improvements and increases in capacity. By the end of 2003, lines to Cork, Tralee, Limerick, Waterford, Galway, Westport, Sligo and Belfast will be renewed with continuously welded rail. Peak capacity in Dublin has been increased by 40%. This level of investment must be sustained if the railway is to continue to expand to meet the demands being placed on it now and into the future.</P>
    <P>It is important from a safety point of view that one of the first actions of the previous Minister, Senator O'Rourke, was to ensure the track was continuously welded, and along with the money invested in signalling, this was the most responsible action to take. She could have bought new carriages but it would have been the wrong way to go because we would not have had the infrastructure on which they could be run properly and safely. Senator O'Rourke needs to be commended for taking what was not in many ways the easiest public relations option but was the right thing to do. She ensured in the long-term that the new carriages would run on safe lines.</P>
    <P>Track capacity will be increased to allow continual increase in DART capacity at peak times. The objective is to achieve an increase in capacity of up to 75% over the next five years. Other objectives are to provide eight new stations, upgrade Tara Street Station and provide a new station at Spencer Dock.</P>
    <P>Some 67 new carriages will be purchased for inter-city trains to be in service by 2005. These will replace all carriages whose life has expired. Some 50% of the fleet will be more than 30 years of age by 2007. I am sure we all agree that some of the carriages are in an appalling condition and should not be in use.</P>
    <P>The safety programme will continue. There will be a complete resignalling programme, redevelopment of Cork, Galway and Limerick stations, provision of new booking and reservation systems and increased frequency of services on main corridors.</P>
    <P>This huge investment will cost &euro;2 billion to &euro;4 billion but it needs to be carried out. The goal is to increase the number of passengers from 34 million per annum to 44 million within five years. That is a significant growth project in the Dublin commuter market and the prime inter-city routes. CIE has a huge challenge ahead and I hope it meets the targets it has laid down.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1329" />The strategic rail review should also provide us with a strategic policy framework for the future development of the railway throughout the country. It would be foolhardy to face into such a period of change on our railways without also updating the legislative framework to oversee the safety of staff, passengers and the general public. Creation of an independent railway safety regulator will provide a means by which this change can be managed in an effective and coherent manner.</P>
    <P>Railway undertakings will be required to have a safety management system in place that will ensure that the railway company can carry out its operations in a safe manner. I also note that under section 41, the railway companies will have to describe their safety management systems in a document called the safety case. This will have to be accepted by the Railway Safety Commission before the company can get a safety certificate.</P>
    <P>I welcome the fact that from now on there will be independent acceptance of the means by which railway companies manage safety. The safety case will facilitate this and will also provide a means by which the Railway Safety Commission can monitor the operations of a railway company to ensure that it carries out its activities in accordance with its safety case.</P>
    <P>The strong enforcement powers that are being given to the Railway Safety Commission will give it the necessary teeth to enable it to carry out its work effectively. I note that the commission will have discretion to investigate any railway incident. While I do not doubt Iarnród Éireann's commitment to safety, independent investigation by the commission will greatly reassure the public that the true cause of an incident will be established and made public and that similar incidents will be avoided in future.</P>
    <P>If we ask people to use public transport, it is important that they feel safe using it. If we are to achieve the targeted increases in rail passenger numbers, people must feel confident about the handling of the aftermath of an accident when it occurs. Safety is primary in allaying people's fears and ensuring they use the rail system.</P>
    <P>I am glad the Bill recognises that all risks to the safety of our railways are not just in the hands of railway companies or their employees. The Bill places a duty of care on members of staff, passengers and the public. Passengers have a role to play in behaving responsibly while travelling on a train. Likewise, members of the public have a responsibility not to endanger themselves or the railway while they are using a level crossing or a bridge over the railway. Builders and others carrying out an activity near a railway should also be expected to take care not to endanger the railway. The Bill places statutory duties of care on all these parties and this is very much to be welcomed.</P>
    <P>I welcome the provision establishing a railway safety advisory council. This body, comprising representatives of a cross-section of groups with an interest in or a role to play in railway safety, <Col N="1330" /> will be an excellent forum for discussion and examination of railway safety issues. What could be called neutral players, that is, people not representing railway companies or their staff, will also be members of the council and that is to be welcomed.</P>
    <P>I urge the Minister to examine the idea of a rail users group. It is important to have an independent statutorily funded body, as exists for instance in parts of Australia and England and other countries where it works extremely well, that would be independent of the rail companies, Dublin Bus or anyone providing public transport. It would be able to represent the users of public transport. It is important that they have a voice, something they do not have at present. If we are trying to encourage people to use public transport, such a body would highlight issues that affect passengers every day, whether they use bus, rail or whatever. It would be imaginative and would help the Minister in his work, as it would highlight issues that exist relating to the providers. It is the correct way to go on this issue especially if we are trying to get people out of their cars and into public transport. The Minister should consider this idea, which has been extremely successful in other parts of the world. I welcome this Bill and I wish the Minister success in implementing it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCallananFF" hpid="Mr. Callanan Mr. Callanan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Callanan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this Bill and especially the establishment of an independent commission to look after safety on our railways. We must do everything in our power to ensure railway road crossings are made completely safe. Many of the signalling controls at these crossings need upgrading to avoid accidents. When safety measures and new signalling are introduced in future there should be consultation with other public bodies in the area.</P>
      <P>A few months ago there was disappointment when, without any consultation with anyone, Iarnród Éireann removed a junction on the Dublin to Galway line at Athenry, which cut off rail access from Athenry to Tuam and Claremorris. Although this line is not used at the moment, Galway County Development Board is actively promoting the upgrading of this line to create a commuter train service linking Galway to Tuam and Athenry and also linking Limerick to Claremorris. Iarnród Éireann was informed of these proposals a long time ago, but made no effort to consult the board. Safety improvements at this junction were necessary but could have been done in a different way to allow the line to remain open. This was done in the past at Athlone, Drogheda and Limerick Junction. Following the enactment of this Bill I look forward to there being better consultation when safety developments like this take place in the future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The new safety commission should look at railway bridges across small country roads where fencing is poor and side walls are low as these are dangerous for children. Iarnród Éireann should review the timing of trains travelling to and from <Col N="1331" /> Galway in order to facilitate workers using the train to get to work. Our railway lines are underused at the moment, but suitable train times would take much traffic off our roads. I congratulate the Minister on introducing this Railway Safety Bill so that Iarnród Éireann's passengers can travel in safety.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnCartyFF" hpid="Mr. Carty Mr. Carty">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Carty</NameTxt>
      <P>Railway safety legislation has not been properly updated since the foundation of the State. This has resulted in Ireland's rail operating company, Iarnród Éireann, being responsible not only for all financial and economic elements of the company, but it is also solely and completely responsible for operational rail safety. I welcome this legislation, which will see the formation of an independent regulatory body for rail safety in Ireland for the first time. All EU countries have independent safety bodies.</P>
      <P>Ireland has not had a multiple fatality derailment since the Cherryville Junction disaster in August 1983, when seven passengers died and the Buttevant disaster two years earlier. With increasing passenger numbers annually and a more frequent and extensive service planned under the national development plan, we must be ready to accept the increased potential for serious accidents if our infrastructure, regulation, training and safety systems are not up to standard.</P>
      <P>The Regulation of Railways Acts 1840, 1871 and 1889 were all introduced under British rule. The formation of the State created for the first time divergent legislation. The Railway Act 1924, which is archaic, is still the most relevant legislation for the operation of all aspects of Ireland's railways. It is ridiculous that we are still dealing with legislation passed 80 years ago. The Railway Safety Bill imposes stringent new procedures for rail safety including giving rail companies the power to test for drink or drugs.</P>
      <P>The proposed railway safety commission will have up to three members and be independent of the Department of Transport. Those three people should be experts in rail safety. The unions also have a role in this area. The commission will have powers to monitor and inspect railway infrastructure, to investigate and publish reports into railway accidents and to enforce its decisions. In addition to Iarnród Éireann, the commission will police safety on the Luas, the proposed metro and various heritage railways around the country. Any company failing to co-operate with the commission can be fined up to &euro;500,000. Each company will have to outline its safety management systems in what is called a safety case and will not be allowed to operate unless the commission is satisfied with its plans.</P>
      <P>A major area of the Bill relates to intoxicants, drugs and alcohol. In consultation with staff and unions, each company will have to draw up codes of conduct for the use of drugs or alcohol and will be able to require what are called safety critical staff to provide breath, blood or urine samples for testing for intoxicants.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1332" />It is well recognised that there was sustained underinvestment in railways for many years. It is a credit to the staff and management of Iarnród Éireann that they have managed to operate the railways safely over those difficult years. The Bill will introduce a modern and flexible means of independently overseeing the safety of our railways affecting not just Iarnród Éireann, but also the new Luas lines and the planned metro network.</P>
    <P>I congratulate Iarnród Éireann and the Government for the significant amount of money they have provided for railways in my area. This money went into the upgrading of the Athlone to Westport line. However, I would like to see the Collooney to Athenry line re-opened. This would open that part of Ireland for business. It would provide a good link between Sligo, Claremorris, Galway and Limerick and then on to Rosslare. We should have no dormant railway lines.</P>
    <P>New carriages are needed on the Dublin to Westport line. The line has now been upgraded but the carriages sometimes used are nothing short of a disgrace. I compliment the western railway committee for the good work it has done in keeping the Collooney to Athenry line <i>in situ</i> over the years. I thank the Minister for the positive attitude he has shown to this project in the past and I hope he will be even more positive in the future.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FergusODowdFG" hpid="Mr. O'Dowd Mr. O'Dowd">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dowd</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to share time with Deputy Deenihan. Some good things have happened in recent years. There has been a significant improvement in railway safety and in investment in rolling stock. The quality and commitment of Iarnród Éireann staff is second to none. I welcome the fact that its management and safety systems have certainly been improved. I acknowledge particularly the improvement in the rolling stock generally.</P>
      <P>However, some important things need to be addressed. Two weeks ago the express train from Connolly Station to Belfast had carriages that were not fit to take cattle to slaughter. It was disgraceful that a ramshackle rattling, shaking train brought passengers at quite a frightening speed from Dublin to Belfast. The speed was normal for a train with proper intercity carriages, but the rolling stock was disgraceful and totally unacceptable to those who travelled on that train. For people who paid money, it was an unacceptable standard of transport.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I frequently travel on the northern line and particularly on the Belfast to Dublin intercity express. This train is often late, often has less than its full complement of carriages and is generally not efficient. Many people in Drogheda who used to travel on that train have stopped because it is always late, which is unacceptable. The way Iarnród Éireann generates statistics for trains being on time needs to be changed. Iarnród Éireann will claim a train is on time if it arrives up to 15 minutes after the published arrival time. It is not good enough that commuters have to <Col N="1333" /> take an earlier train to ensure they arrive in Dublin on time. Last week, my son happened to travel from Dublin to Drogheda. The train on which he was due did not arrive on time and he arrived home two hours later. When we inquired as to what happened, it transpired that three trains had been held up outside Drogheda, one of them for more than two hours, due to a technical problem on the line. Neither is it acceptable that commuters who expect value for their money must endure cases such as those I raise.</P>
    <P>Railway safety is very important. While I acknowledge recent improvements in this area, I am concerned by the question of future capacity as the volume of people who want to travel on our railway system continues to increase, a development we all want to encourage and support. How safe is travel on our overcrowded trains, particularly commuter lines? Travelling from Drogheda to Dublin on the commuter line, one has to stand for the entire journey because of overcrowding and one is subject to extremes of temperature, which sometimes cause people to faint. This is completely unacceptable.</P>
    <P>I am not sure which Members have travelled on the stampede train, the 17.13 from Pearse Street to Dundalk. I am sure Deputy Sargent has taken it. It is by good fortune that people are not killed in the scramble to board that train. What do Iarnród Éireann and the Minister plan to do about it? I suggest the Minister takes time to watch the dangerous rush for that train, which is an unbelievable sight. People believe somebody will be killed in the stampede to board the carriages.</P>
    <P>I am also concerned about the facilities provided for people who want to travel on the railway. People who want to get off the road, but need to drive to their local railway station, face significant problems. In the case of my local station in Drogheda, parking is not available to hundreds of rail passengers. As the station is full, drivers park everywhere else in the vicinity in a manner which poses a danger. This issue needs to be addressed. I am aware of Iarnród Éireann's proposal for multi-storey car parking on its inter-city lines. However, it wishes to charge for this facility, which until now has been free of charge. Commuters pay enough for their tickets and should not have to pay for parking.</P>
    <P>Park and ride facilities are not available outside Dublin for those who drive into Dublin from a northern direction, for example, through County Meath. Such facilities would enable drivers to park at a station and connect with the city transport system, whether rail, Dart or other public transport. This issue, which affects the Greater Dublin Transport Authority more than the Minister, has not been properly thought out. People who live a distance from public transport routes need to be able to drive from the country towards the city and connect with the city transport service. This would be a useful and practical development.</P>
    <P>There is a question concerning the capacity of <Col N="1334" /> the northern line. Thousands of people are building and buying new homes along the line in Skerries, Balbriggan, Gormanston, Drogheda and so forth, yet the rail system does not have the capacity to meet demand. What plans does the Minister have to increase capacity on this line where the problem of extreme overcrowding is set to worsen? If he were to visit Drogheda, I would be happy to travel on the line with him to allow him to see what happens in some of the railway stations along the route. It is an unbelievable sight of panic as people push and shove as they try to squeeze on board a full train and this is a serious problem.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FergusODowdFG" hpid="Mr. O'Dowd Mr. O'Dowd">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dowd</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister will have seen what I describe, which is unacceptable.</P>
      <P>Some years ago a proposal was made to raise the height of the railway bridges on the northern line. However, they were not raised sufficiently to allow double decker trains to run on the line. These trains are used in France and elsewhere on the continent and increase capacity by around 40%. I urge the Minister to consider the possibility of again raising the bridges on the line.</P>
      <P>Expensive fares are also an issue. The problem is that one has two types of fare, the inter-city fare, the cost of which Iarnród Éireann can increase without reference to the Minister, and the suburban fares, for which increases must receive ministerial sanction. Residents of Drogheda, which is effectively a suburban town and gets a suburban service, pay inter-city fares. This means a journey from Drogheda to Dublin costs twice as much as one from Balbriggan to Dublin, the difference being that the former is an inter-city service, which Iarnród Éireann controls at will, while the latter is suburban service which the Minister controls. Price adjustment is required.</P>
      <P>Passengers who get a seat on good rolling stock get value for money from Iarnród Éireann and capacity and quality are definitely improving. However, some antediluvian, dreadful carriages are still in use on the Belfast line, at least that was the case on the occasion I travelled on it.</P>
      <P>I return to the issue of punctuality. The Minister must take an initiative in this area. I acknowledge he has taken initiatives in other areas. It is not good enough that a train which arrives within 15 minutes of its arrival time can be considered punctual. We need monthly statistics providing information on the percentage of trains which are punctual or late, including the percentage which arrive exactly on time. More pressure must be exerted on the company to deliver that for which the consumer pays, which is to arrive at his destination on time. This applies particularly to those travelling to work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are two management systems operating on the northern line, the suburban system, which runs as far as Balbriggan, and the inter-city sys<Col N="1335" /> tem which covers Drogheda and Dundalk. We need one boss, one management and one fare structure for everybody travelling from Dublin to the Border. This would be fair and equitable to everybody concerned. Having a division of responsibility is not acceptable. Passengers on the northern line face real problems.</P>

      <P>The purpose of this legislation is to upgrade and consolidate legislation going back as far as 1845 or thereabouts. Its primary purpose is to set up an independent statutory public body called the railway safety commission to replace the current railway inspectorate and I welcome it for a number of reasons.</P>
      <P>The issue of rail safety and investment came to the forefront with the Knockcroghery derailment in November 1997. It was only then that the Government was forced to respond with action. The RMS consultancy group was appointed to draw up a plan, as a result of which we now have considerable investment. I acknowledge the strides made by Iarnród Éireann in recent years, not least in the area of safety. The last rail accident passenger fatalities occurred 20 years ago in the Cherryville accident. Since then, despite chronic under-investment, our railway system has laid claim to the record of being one of Europe's safest. That was not down to the infrastructure or the funding available but to the people in the organisation at all levels. The IRMS report highlighted that vividly with its accounts of the age of rails, sleepers and the store of expertise which overcame those obstacles and ensured that millions of customers annually were safe. From all our experience it is fair to recognise the wonderful team of people who worked for Iarnród Éireann and CIE over the years, the great relationship they built up with their passengers and their extensive knowledge of the geography of different areas. They were the unsung heroes of transport.</P>
      <P>The 1999-2003 safety investment programme has changed the landscape dramatically. More than 440 kilometres of track has been renewed with numerous lines completely upgraded to modern, continuous welded rail. This year, work on the Mallow to Tralee line, which we feared would face closure a few years ago, will be completed with improved safety and speeds to provide strong competition to the private car. I acknowledge the improvement on that line because Kerry attracts approximately 2 million tourists every year, many of whom come by rail. Those tourists have not been impressed with the standard of the carriages or the many breakdowns on the line but people have noticed a vast improvement and I hope it will only be a matter of time before we have better carriages. I will refer to that matter later.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There has also been record investment in level crossings, bridge renewal, fencing, embankments and signalling to strengthen safety. I appreciate the efforts of Iarnród Éireann staff in achieving <Col N="1336" /> that, aided by additional resources for safety training and safety management systems.</P>
    <P>Record passenger numbers nationally and on the Dublin-Tralee service highlight the potential of our rail network. In addition to safety investment, stations have received critical funding with Heuston and Connolly now unrecognisable compared to what they were a few years ago. Regional stations are also receiving support. That is backed up by the efforts of unheralded railwaymen and women. In Killarney, we are delighted to have the winner of the most recent best inter-city station award in the Iarnród Éireann station awards and the best staff effort from Michael Leahy and his team.</P>
    <P>The carriages on the Mallow-Tralee line are the Craven carriages which are approximately 45 years old. When the new rolling stock is obtained for the other lines, I hope improved carriages will be made available immediately for that line because that is vitally important in terms of the number of tourists coming to Kerry. I understand it costs approximately &euro;2 million to buy a new carriage. Nevertheless, they are being bought and I hope this line will be prioritised for new ones in the future.</P>
    <P>We all want to see fleet improvements and it is a measure of past neglect that more than half of Iarnród Éireann's fleet is now more than 30 years old. In December Iarnród Éireann confirmed a &euro;117 million order for new inter-city carriages and further orders are planned for regional rail cars to boost services on routes such as Mallow-Tralee as well as improve comfort and customer service.</P>
    <P>With the strategic review we are into a new age of rail. For our citizens and our tourism industry, that development must continue. The Railway Safety Bill will strengthen regulation of safety on our railways in an environment where Luas and other projects will have to be subject to regulation and where the fine traditions of safety in our rail network must be emulated. I also look forward to the successor of the rail safety investment programme which is about to be devised by Iarnród Éireann with the Department of Transport. Safety is a race which is never won but we must ensure the resources are provided to Iarnród Éireann and other operators in the future to maintain our record and standing internationally.</P>
    <P>The Bill also refers to heritage railways. The Minister and I turned the sod on a unique heritage railway in Kerry about two years ago which will be ready to roll shortly. It is called the Lartigue monorail which ran between Listowel and Ballybunnion between 1888 and 1924 and was the only one of its type in the world. I am glad we have the locomotive and the carriages which are exact replicas of the originals. This will be a very exciting project, not only from a local tourism point of view but from a heritage railway point of view. It has attracted interest from all over the world even before it is officially launched.</P>
    <P>The people involved in the project will also <Col N="1337" /> have to make the safety case and we are currently working on that for the train but it will be complex. In that regard I would like the Minister to expand on the safety case for a heritage railway which may run over a short distance at low speeds &ndash; the maximum speed at which this locomotive will travel will be approximately 20 miles per hour? Will the committee have to make the same safety case as would be made for, say, the main line from Dublin to Limerick or Dublin to Cork? Perhaps the Minister would refer to that point in his reply.</P>
    <P>As someone who uses our railways on a regular basis, I very much support railway transport. The people who decided to close several railways throughout the country made a bad decision. Kerry probably suffered more than most in that respect. The Killarney-Cahirciveen, TraleeDingle and Tralee via Listowel-Limerick connections were abandoned. If those railways were in place, they would be tremendous tourist attractions and the areas that became isolated as a result of them being abandoned, like Listowel and Cahirciveen, would have a major connection to the outside world, which would address the problem of roads.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill and ask the Minister to refer to the obligations on those who undertake to provide a safety case for a heritage railway as opposed to mainstream railways.</P>

      <P>I listened to Deputy Deenihan talk about the Lartigue railway and the fact that the south-west suffered disproportionately from railway closures in the cutbacks in the 1960s. We must remember that the railway building mania occurred from the mid-1800s to the beginning of the 20th century when the population was more than eight million. That figure halved over the years up to the 1960s removing from the railways a major source of revenue. Up to the 1960s, and even up to today, the roads were not adequate to take the passenger numbers using them. We have to take a fresh look at the railways and see where they can be positioned in terms of our transport infrastructure.</P>
      <P>The jury has been out for a long time on the role of railways in freight transport but there is no doubt the rail network must be upgraded to transport passengers safely, speedily and in comfort. In the last ten years the Irish economy has grown by 110% and the Government is committed to improving the transport infrastructure as that growth has led to transport congestion. Rail transport has become a focus of Government attention and major plans for improvement have been announced recently.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The biggest ever rail investment programme in the history of the State will be implemented over the next six to ten years. Iarnród Éireann has an <Col N="1338" /> investment programme called On Track which will see over &euro;1.3 billion invested in the rail service. This covers track improvements, station renovations and reconstruction, new carriages, bridge renewals, level crossing upgrades, safety studies and signalling. There will be an upsurge in many key areas and Ireland will remain an attractive market in the short to medium term. The market will be increased further by the stringent new safety procedures announced recently by the Government, the setting up of a rail safety commission, the announcement of a major study to pinpoint routes for the expansion of the country's rail network and a suburban rail inter-connector study.</P>
    <P>However, much of the regional network needs upgrading to bring it up to modern standards. We should draw attention here to the Rosslare-Limerick line, where it takes four hours and 32 minutes to get from Rosslare to Limerick and the return journey takes three hours 52 minutes. How do they manage that?</P>
    <P>The investment of &euro;117 million will provide 67 new carriages for the company's inter-city service although they will not all be in service until autumn 2005. The air-conditioned carriages will be deployed on all Dublin-Cork services as well as key Limerick and Galway routes. More than half of the company's current fleet is over 30 years old and it hopes this announcement will be followed by further commitments to fleet replacements. It is hoped to have new high-specification carriages available for the remaining lines by 2007 at the latest.</P>
    <P>The announcement puts the company ahead of its national development plan target, which foresaw just 20 new inter-city rail carriages. The new carriages, which have been ordered from Spain, are to be the first new inter-city carriages for Iarnród Éireann in 20 years, with the exception of the Dublin-Belfast Enterprise service. They will offer Enterprise levels of comfort and customer facilities, adjustable seating, in-seat radio and music, reading lights and table lamps in first class. They will be formed into nine-carriage trains, comprising six standard class and three first class carriages. There will be seating for 499 passengers and trains will be fully accessible for mobility-impaired customers. Some 47 new diesel rail cars for suburban services have also entered service since 1999. Iarnród Éireann has also renewed 325 miles of track, replaced 200 bridges, extended the DART to Greystones and Malahide, built new stations at Clontarf Road, Grand Canal Dock, Monasterevin and Drumcondra and doubled the track to Maynooth since 1999. Ongoing investment includes 80 new diesel rail cars and the redevelopment of Heuston Station, both of which are due to be completed this year.</P>
    <P>This legislation lays the foundation for secure rail travel in the future and will give a guarantee to the community that security will continue to be of supreme significance to this Administration. Last year road vehicles crashed into rail bridges 105 times. Almost all these incidents involved lor<Col N="1339" /> ries hitting overhead rail bridges and in most cases the lorry was too high to pass under the bridge. There is a danger that such incidents will cause train tracks to lift, leading to a derailment. I am particularly worried about East Wall in my constituency, where the railway bridge over the East Wall Road has been struck by trucks over 100 times in recent years. Little attention is paid to such incidents although there is huge potential for calamity involved.</P>
    <P>Overcrowding on the DART system is also reaching dangerous levels and I am already aware of accidents which have occurred on the system. There should be a complete review of this very good service as I am particularly concerned for my constituents, who face claustrophobic travelling conditions on the DART from Connolly Station. One can also travel from many stations to Bray for nothing on Sundays as the stations in various satellite towns are closed and there is no one at Bray to collect fares or tickets.</P>
    <P>Rail safety legislation has not been properly updated since the foundation of the State, leading to an untenable situation where Ireland's rail operating company, Iarnród Éireann, is responsible for all financial and economic elements of the company but is also solely responsible for operational rail safety. I welcome the forthcoming Bill, which will see the formation of an independent regulatory body for rail safety in Ireland for the first time. The Bill imposes stringent new procedures for rail safety, which includes giving rail companies the power to test staff for drink or drugs. The proposed rail safety commission will have up to three members and will be completely independent of the Department of Transport. It will have powers to monitor and inspect rail infrastructure, to investigate and publish reports on railway incidents and it will be able to enforce its decisions. I welcome the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMcGuinness" hpid="Mr. McGuinness Mr. McGuinness">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGuinness</NameTxt>
      <P>I compliment the Minister on his appointment and on the many initiatives he has taken. I look forward to his contribution as Minister and I welcome the Bill which is just one of many steps which must be taken if Iarnród Éireann is to be brought into the 21st century and its rail infrastructure is to be improved for both passengers and freight. A modern economy cannot progress without investment in rail infrastructure. Regrettably, our rail infrastructure has been neglected over many years and we cannot satisfy a range of customers and deliver services all over the country. We lose out continually in terms of freight carriage with services being closed. We must introduce new policies to deal with this area but the Minister is making a new start. He can overhaul the existing service by focusing investment. We see many advertisements nowadays outlining what Iarnród Éireann intends to do and the proposed changes are very impressive. However, that investment should be taken from the advertising budget and put into customer care and development of the rail infrastructure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1340" />I accept that successive Governments neglected the rail lines but that is no excuse for the deplorable carriages now in operation. Many of them pose safety risks and customers who use the Dublin-Kilkenny service complain on an ongoing basis about overcrowded carriages and trains which break down. I received a letter recently from a Fr. Fingleton in Carlow which stated that during a rail journey the carriage broke down, the lights and heating went and no information was given. Those are the kinds of basic issues any business must address to satisfy its customers. Customer care is being ignored by Iarnród Éireann as no effort is made to ensure information is given to passengers when a breakdown occurs. That is not good enough from any company but particularly one that offers a service to the public.</P>
    <P>The recent growth of the economy has put a focus on the development of the rail network. Those using either passenger or freight services saw old lines and a management system which did not have the vision for railway infrastructure that exists in other European countries. That must change and the Minister should set down policy in this area.</P>
    <P>The Bill provides for the establishment of a railway safety commission but there is something else that is fundamentally necessary to the company's approach to the issue. Currently, if a local authority wants to cross a railway line, as is the case in Kilkenny where the council wants to construct another leg of the ring road, it must go through many procedures with Iarnród Éireann. In Kilkenny the project has been held up for five years and little or no action has been taken by Iarnród Éireann because it demands a railway works order. There are safety issues but also issues of planning. The company has refused to enter negotiations with the local authority to resolve the issue and give it the priority it deserves so the ring road around Kilkenny city could be completed. The Minister should examine the refusal of Iarnród Éireann to deal with the matter because it is unacceptable.</P>
    <P>Almost all of O'Loughlin Road is now complete except for one small section. Since 1996 the local authority has tried to resolve the issue with Iarnród Éireann but nothing has happened. It is an issue of public safety and it has not been resolved. How will the Bill overcome such problems and make Iarnród Éireann more flexible in its approach to solving such issues to enable projects to be completed?</P>
    <P>The IAP site in Kilkenny city is one of the biggest developments in the region but it involves Iarnród Éireann. The transfer of land and the granting of access to the site is being held up by Iarnród Éireann. This is a multimillion euro development in the centre of the city that would help the economy but Iarnród Éireann is sitting on its hands.</P>
    <P>In just one city we find three examples of Iarnród Éireann sitting on its hands, preventing millions of euro from being spent, an economy <Col N="1341" /> from developing and safety issues from being addressed. That cannot continue. The Minister should bear that in mind when dealing with Iarnród Éireann.</P>
    <P>When the company appeared before the Joint Committee on European Affairs, I raised the issue of improving the carriages and passenger access on the Dublin-Kilkenny service, and that a commuter service be established. The Iarnród Éireann representative said that as soon as it was possible in the receiving station in Dublin, which he envisaged would be a short time, the service would be established. When I followed that up with officials of the company, I was told that I was mistaken and that the service could not be provided. The company had conducted a survey that indicated the service would not be supported. Anyone visiting any city in the State will see there is significant demand for such services.</P>
    <P>It is appalling that the railway lines have not been developed over the years to give easy access. Travellers from Kilkenny must go up the country to go back down. That is incredible. There has been no forward thinking or vision in the development of the railways. I hope this Bill means we will see the vision that exists in Europe, where countries have recognised the importance of travel and the use of railways for the dispersal of freight, and have developed their economies based on railways that serve the public and freight operators.</P>
    <P>The points I have raised may be parochial but they stand in the context of the discussion on railways services across the State. They make sense in terms of developing the railway service for freight and passengers. Many visitors to Ireland are baffled by our neglect of the railway lines. The Minister mentions many issues in this Bill in terms of the development of services and safety, but I hope he will take on board the issues raised by Members and that we see an improved service soon.</P>

    <P Just="Center">Question again proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;<Col N="1342" /></P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>I represent a constituency for which the railway service is extremely important. There are ten railway stations in the constituency, the highest number in any constituency. There is the Dublin-Rosslare mainline service and the DART service between Dublin city centre and Greystones and recently the local authority adopted a scheme to bring the Luas line to Cherrywood. As a result, there is substantial interest in my constituency both in rail travel and rail safety.</P>
      <P>I have mixed feelings about this Bill. I am glad that railway safety is being addressed in the House and that an independent body is being established to oversee it. I wonder, however, if what is being provided for is a convenient mechanism whereby the Minister and the Government can absolve themselves of direct responsibility for the safety of our railway lines, particularly investment in safety measures.</P>
      <P>At the end of the explanatory memorandum, we are given the estimated costs of the legislation. We are told it will come to &euro;2 million a year to fund the office of the commission and the appointment of nine staff. That sum will not provide for the safety of our railway lines.</P>
      <P>The Bill also sets out the responsibilities of the commission, which will examine and oversee the area of railway safety. Obligations are put on the operators of railway services and lines and there are provisions for the safety of new rolling stock, railway lines and services. I cannot find, however, any obligation on the Minister or Government to improve or invest in the existing railway lines or service. This is of interest to me from a constituency point of view because of my concerns and the concerns of many of my constituents about the safety of the railway line that runs between Dalkey and Shankill, which runs beside the sea, the line between Bray and Greystones and sections of the railway line from there further on, with which I am less familiar, although other Members of the House may be more familiar with it, where I understand there are similar problems.</P>
      <P>It is only a couple of weeks ago that the DART services between Bray and Greystones were suspended because of a landslide along the railway line. Last week I had the opportunity to walk along that line. There is a pleasant walk which I often take on a Sunday from Bray Head to Greystones. It is a public walkway which overlooks the railway line between Bray and Greystones. It is a beautiful area and a lovely train journey for people who take it. However, there is serious coastal erosion along that line. There is also a serious problem with landslides on the railway line. Considerable investment must be made to make that line safe.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is not the only area affected by such problems. A little over a year ago a serious accident was narrowly avoided between Shankill and Dalkey when the driver of an early morning DART train realised that a landslide was occurring overhead on Killiney Hill. I understand from local authority engineers that the cause of that landslide related to developments in the area over the <Col N="1343" /> years when water ran off the roads and became embedded in the ground over the railway line. That caused the ground to slip down on to the line.</P>
    <P>Some time before that, but within the past two years, the people of the area were greatly surprised one morning when a fleet of JCBs appeared on Killiney beach. There was concern that an invasion was about to take place or that someone was trying to make a film about the Normandy landings on Killiney beach. However, Iarnród Éireann had arranged for emergency works to be carried out because the degree of coastal erosion along the Killiney coast was putting the railway line at risk. I had already brought that issue to the attention of the authorities because of concerns constituents had expressed to me from their knowledge of the area. They saw that the coast line was being seriously eroded and that there was a risk to the railway line. There is a need for substantial investment to protect the Dublin-Rosslare railway line and those sections of the DART line which are at risk both from coastal erosion and from landslides from higher ground.</P>
    <P>I am not sure this legislation will deal with that issue. It provides for the establishment of a commission which will make reports on it and for a tribunal if there is an accident. However, what is required to deal with that problem is investment in safety, in coastal protection works and in works to protect the railway line. To achieve that, some measure must be introduced to require the different authorities which are affected to work with each other. At present, coastal protection works are the responsibility of the Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources and the local authorities. Some of the land which overhangs railway lines and adjoins the shoreline is in private ownership, while in other cases, it is the responsibility of the local authorities. There is not any means in the legislation by which the commission can deal with that.</P>
    <P>I understand the commission will be empowered to put all types of responsibilities on the operators of the line and to make rules and regulations about the safety of the line. However, in the cases I have cited and about which my constituents have concerns the land which needs to be shored up and dealt with is outside the railway line and is in different ownership from the ownership of Iarnród Éireann. The coastal protection works which are required in the areas between Dalkey and Shankill and between Bray and Greystones are outside the remit both of Iarnród Éireann and of the commission which is being established. I cannot find in the legislation any means by which the Minister can cause the local authority, the Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources who has responsibility for coastal protection, or private land owners whose land abuts or overhangs the railway line to take measures to ensure the safety of the line.</P>
    <P>I would like the Minister to re-examine that <Col N="1344" /> because the issue of safety along the Dalkey to Shankill section, the Bray to Greystones section and other sections Deputies may mention is important. These areas cannot wait a long time to be dealt with. There is an urgency to ensure the safety of those lines. The line to which I refer is in increasing use. It is the line for the Dublin-Rosslare service which connects our two main passenger ferry ports, Dún Laoghaire and Rosslare. That means many passengers use the line. It is also the line which serves the DART service to Greystones and it services an increasing amount of commuter traffic from Wicklow, Arklow and Gorey. Increasing numbers of people who cannot afford to buy a house in the Dublin area are moving there. Working middle class people in my constituency are being priced out of living there. They are moving to Arklow and Gorey and using the train to commute. That means a demand for increased services which will put increased pressure on that line and on its safety.</P>
    <P>That is one issue of safety I wanted to draw to the Minister's attention. A second issue of safety I want to draw to his attention, as I represent a constituency which has ten railway stations, relates to the safety of the stations and the safety and security of the trains which use them. I refer to the use of the train, particularly the DART service, at night. If a station is not well lit or manned, it is an intimidating place to be at 10.30 p.m. or 11 p.m. Many people who would otherwise be happy to use the DART service are discouraged from doing so because of the unfriendly and unsafe atmosphere they experience in some stations.</P>
    <P>I acknowledge &ndash; I have said this in the House and to Iarnród Éireann &ndash; there have been some improvements, but we have a long way to go. Let us consider the situation of a person getting off at Shankill DART station at 10.30 p.m., with not many passengers on the train, perhaps one or two people waiting on the platform and no staff present. Having to cross the railway bridge and proceed up a ramp to the exit is not a particularly inviting prospect at that time of night. If we want more people to use public transport and to encourage safety, we must first ensure that railway stations are properly lit and staffed, that there is somebody in charge and that people can feel safe at those stations. Concerns have also been expressed to me about safety on the trains.</P>
    <P>I will give a few examples of complaints I have received from constituents this week alone in that regard. In an e-mail message, one constituent said:</P>
    <P>The reduction in staff and an increase in lawlessness among young people has made CIE less and less able to control behaviour on trains and buses. The result is destruction of public property and growing fear among the travelling public, especially the old and vulnerable. I personally witnessed a young man urinate in sight of all, in the middle of the day, on a Dalkey station platform only a few weeks ago.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1345" /> In another case, a woman said that on a DART train, she saw a noisy group of brawny youths drinking from beer cans and smoking cigarettes. Nobody in the carriage felt able to confront the offenders, nor should the travelling public be expected to do so when there is the possibility of personal injury.</P>
    <P>This is typical of complaints I receive frequently from constituents expressing their sense of a lack of safety on trains and at stations. I have made my point as to what should be done to improve safety at railway stations. I suggest a very simple measure for the Minister's consideration to improve safety on the trains. A freephone number should be advertised within each carriage so that if there is a problem, such as an outbreak of rowdiness on a train, somebody could use his or her mobile phone discreetly to make a call to that number. Staff of the railway company, or the Garda Síochána, could then board the train at the next station to deal with the problem. While I do not consider it necessary to have a strong police presence on trains at all times of day, there are ways of bringing the attention of the appropriate authorities to problems arising in terms of personal safety so that effective action can be taken.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill in general, in the sense that railway safety is being addressed. However, the establishment of a commission alone will not deal effectively with the real issues of safety which need to be addressed and for which investment is required in relation to physical safety on railway lines. Better management and greater vigilance will be required, as well as greater improvement of railway stations, in order to give a sense of personal safety to the increasing numbers of people using the railway services, particularly the suburban services which I hope to see expanded in the years ahead.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnEllis" hpid="Mr. Ellis Mr. Ellis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ellis</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to share time with Deputies Killeen and Glennon. This Bill is welcome because rail safety, like road safety, is of paramount importance to every citizen. Nobody wishes to have accidents occurring in this country like those which have occurred elsewhere, such as the most recent one in Sydney which caused great concern in relation to rail safety. The need to update rail safety legislation is well accepted and the present Bill provides an opportunity to do so. It also gives Deputies an opportunity to fly a parochial flag in relation to problems with some of our railway lines over many years.</P>
      <P>The brief which the Minister for Transport has taken on represents the first integrated approach to national roads, the rail structure and Bus Éireann. It is appropriate that all those areas should fall within one Department. While the need for development of the rail service was generally accepted, it was only in the past five years that any major investment has taken place. Everybody welcomes the upgrading of lines, leading to greater safety on the rail system and more pleasant journeys for rail users.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1346" />I wish to refer to the Dublin-Sligo line in particular. The introduction of welded rail on that line is welcome. When the small remaining section of that project is completed, we will have, for the first time, a guarantee of long-term development of the Dublin-Sligo rail line. There is a welcome increase in the number of people using the rail system in this country and it is essential to upgrade the facilities. While there has been investment in railway stations and track, the inadequate standard of rolling stock gives cause for concern. There have been frequent breakdowns on the Dublin-Sligo line. Problems in relation to heating and overcrowding are very common on this line, especially at weekends. Action is essential in that regard.</P>
    <P>With regard to the improvement of rolling stock, a recent letter which I received from Iarnród Éireann did not make great reading but at least it gave some hope, indicating that upgraded rolling stock would not be available until 2005 or 2006. I hope the new rolling stock will not be the discards from other lines. If that were to happen, we would be left with a second class carriage system on a first class track. If we are to encourage more people to use the rail system, carriages and engines will have to be upgraded. I realise this cannot be done overnight as there is quite a long lead-in time even in the case of urban rolling stock. A figure of &euro;2 million per carriage may seem expensive but I believe people are prepared to pay for a good service. Ways and means should be found to upgrade the rolling stock at a much earlier date than is currently proposed.</P>
    <P>On the Dublin-Sligo line, at least one or two more trains per day should be introduced. The early morning train from Sligo should run six days a week. However, the greatest need is for a late night service from Dublin to Sligo. Currently, the last service leaves Connolly station at around 6.20 p.m. That is not suitable for many people. On Friday evenings, those visiting Dublin on business or those who work there are not well served by the train service. Iarnród Éireann should be asked to look favourably on the provision of a late night service, with a train leaving Dublin at, say, 9 p.m. and reaching Sligo about 12 midnight. I suggest that is not beyond the bounds of possibility for Iarnród Éireann.</P>
    <P>I want to raise one or two other parochial subjects, one of which concerns the proposal which is with Iarnród Éireann for a commuter service from Ballymote to Sligo in regard to which a feasibility study has been carried out. As the line lies idle from when the early morning train goes out past Ballymote until such time as the midday train comes down, there is plenty of time to provide a commuter service, which would also help to relieve traffic congestion in Sligo town. It is a proposal which should be looked into.</P>
    <P>The feasibility of reopening the Collooney to Limerick line which runs along the west of Ireland should also be examined. This line has been mothballed for years. With a little invest<Col N="1347" /> ment, it could make a sizeable contribution towards the development of the west of Ireland.</P>
    <P>I would appeal to Iarnród Éireann not to do away with the freight service from Dublin to Sligo. If we are to take heavy trucks off our roads, the freight service must be maintained. There is an urgent need for Iarnród Éireann to go out and market the freight service. If it did so, it would find that there is quite an amount of business out there. One must seek out business, it will not come knocking at the door.</P>

      <P>I, too, welcome the Rail Safety Bill. As virtually everybody who has contributed to the debate has said, we have, somewhat belatedly, taken on board our own personal responsibilities in road safety and clearly similar issues apply in rail safety, particularly at a time when, as Deputy Ellis said, ever greater numbers of people are prepared to consider this option. Certainly the establishment of the railway safety commission and, indeed, the advisory council, is inevitably going to lead to considerable improvement in this area. In the case of road safety, I suppose the ultimate responsibility lies with the individual motorist. In this instance, it is a slightly more corporate matter. It is, however, one which needs to be addressed following the various incidents, not only in Ireland but, indeed, internationally.</P>
      <P>Many Deputies have referred to the need to upgrade the quality of stations. That is a consideration for people who make the choice of using rail. There are a few factors which clearly affect people and influence that decision. Undoubtedly one of them is the quality of the stations. Obviously people also like to know that they will be able to be accommodated on the train and, if it is a long journey, that they will be seated on the train. Frequently people coming to stations need parking facilities and quite often these are not adequate or safe, and in either event that creates some difficulties.</P>
      <P>I was in London over the new year and I noted that they have run into a problem which we would have difficulty imagining, namely, they have too many trains for their tracks. There was a headline, which undoubtedly has some truth underlying it, that there was a proposal that as many as 100 trains be taken off the network in the UK. They are unlikely to heed the difficulty of having too many trains in the short-term but assuming that it happens with even 10% or 20% of them, it would be interesting to know what will happen to them and whether it would be possible to acquire them for use in this country at a reasonable cost in view of the fact that there appear to be so many.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to make reference to the need for upgrading and, perhaps more particularly, increasing the number of services on lines such as the Ennis-Limerick line, and indeed the Limerick-Sligo line, which was just mentioned and which effectively has been mothballed. That line, <Col N="1348" /> which requires a fair amount of investment, is one which undoubtedly could generate business were it to be opened. It requires a decision to invest in rolling stock and in marketing the line, and it will not happen without that commitment.</P>
    <P>There is a strong campaign in my own area for a spur line into Shannon Airport. I understand that would be by far the cheapest link to an airport. Consideration is being given to doing the same in the case of Dublin Airport, which from my perspective is also welcome. However, I would like to see us making a somewhat brave, and perhaps slightly unusual, decision to provide an infrastructure which would benefit people travelling into an industrial estate, which has almost 10,000 people working in it, on the periphery of the airport and which would also benefit the quality of service for the travellers using the airport itself. On occasion we need to be a little more adventurous, take what may not quite be a leap of faith and indicate our willingness to allow investment in innovative provisions such as this which undoubtedly would have the prospect of bringing very substantial benefits eventually.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimGlennonFF" hpid="Mr. Glennon Mr. Glennon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Glennon</NameTxt>
      <P>Like my colleagues, I welcome this legislation. In my first contribution on transport to this House, I congratulate the Minister on the number of initiatives he has brought about in his short time in office and look forward to a continuation of this work, hopefully over the next five years but certainly for as lengthy a period as possible. In the context of the railway system, it will be necessary for the Minister and his successors to concentrate and bring a huge degree of focus to a system which has suffered chronically since the foundation of the State. Several Deputies have mentioned that the legislation on which the system is based is almost entirely, if not completely, British. We tend to forget that the network itself is almost entirely British-built. During the course of the last century hardly any additional track was laid in this State, whereas during the same period several hundred miles of track were lifted.</P>
      <P>What we are looking at is a process of modernisation of the entire railway system. We have already had the huge investment in rail safety undertaken by the last Government to the tune of approximately &euro;600 million over a four year period. That, as an indicator of things to come, was very welcome. It has certainly brought the system up to date to a very large degree, but we must remember the base from which we have come.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It will not come as a surprise to the House, or indeed to the Minister, to hear that I am about to concentrate almost solely on the area of the railway system which relates to my constituency. To put that into perspective, when I started travelling on the train 30 years ago there was what was quaintly referred to as a halt about a mile from the main station in my home town of Skerries. This halt was provided for the benefit of the members of the local golf club. Apparently under <Col N="1349" /> the by-laws inherited by CIE, as it was at the time, from the GNR, the members had the right to ask the driver to stop at this halt, whether it was a scheduled stop or not, so that they could be convenienced in their leisure pursuits. It is probably totally coincidental that the president of that golf club for a number of years was one Seán F. Lemass. That is the background from which we are coming. It is an indicator of the massive steps that are needed.</P>
    <P>The vast bulk of my working constituents in Dublin North use the railway system to get to and from work. Thirty years ago I could get onto a train at peak hour and, as a young student with a natural degree of irresponsibility, my only question was whether I would be in a position to rest my feet on the seat opposite.</P>
    <P>That has changed dramatically. Now it is a question of whether one has sufficient space while standing to turn the pages of a newspaper. If I read a tabloid, it might be easier. It is extremely difficult to read broadsheets at peak times.</P>
    <P>Our population is dominated by commuters who want to use the rail system but who are daily being given excuses by the operator not to do so. They are being given reasons to criticise and their criticisms of a system that is being pulled kicking and screaming into the 21st century are justified. I will not compare our system with those of Europe or our immediate neighbour. Suffice to say that there is a different culture in their systems. It is a culture we must aspire to if we are to get maximum benefit from our rail infrastructure.</P>
    <P>I welcome the provision for a railway safety advisory council. I urge the Minister to ensure that a significant number of rail users, both commercial and private, are on the council. One only has to use the system to realise the difficulties encountered by rail users. I have tried to use it but, frankly, it is not worth it at times. It is unreliable, unhealthy and unsafe. I do not mean that in the sense that there is potential for crashes because the record of CIE in that regard is excellent. However, when one stands cheek by jowl with a complete stranger at 7 a.m. for a period of up to 45 minutes, one gets a real perspective on the difficulties that are encountered daily not only by adults commuting to and from work but also young teenage schoolchildren. A number of unsavoury incidents have taken place as a result of such overcrowding.</P>
    <P>Safety is not simply a question of protection from impact, it also encompasses personal privacy issues and, to some degree and without getting into the realms of hype, psychological issues. There are people who travel on the train every day for their entire working career. They are subjected to an utterly inferior service. Safety should extend beyond the prevention of impact and take account of the requirements of commuters. In that regard, I read with horror this week about the proposed major new town at Donaghmede which will have a population of approximately <Col N="1350" /> 20,000. The publicity blurb said it would be built alongside the Dublin-Belfast railway line and would avail of the existing service. If even 20% of the population of that new town were to use the existing rail service, it would have a dramatic ripple effect on all users in the area.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill and I congratulate the Minister on the initiatives he has taken during his short time in office. I hope this Bill is the start of a lengthy process of modernisation not only of the legislation relating to the railway infrastructure but also of the infrastructure itself and the culture in our railway network.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaulKehoeFG" hpid="Mr. Kehoe Mr. Kehoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kehoe</NameTxt>
      <P>I congratulate the Minister on bringing this Bill before the House. Ireland is lucky that it has had no major railway disaster in recent years. Many years ago in Wexford there were two major rail accidents but they did not result in any fatalities. Overall, there have been no major rail fatalities when one considers the disaster that occurred in Australia two weeks ago and recent accidents in the UK.</P>
      <P>Nevertheless, accidents have occurred which could have been avoided, particularly accidents on level crossings. I have spoken to our transport spokesman, Deputy Naughten, about the dangers of level crossings and the need for lighting and warning signs. People are inclined to drive straight through them, especially when they are unmanned. The Minister's decision to establish a railway safety commission, independent of Irish Rail and of the Minister's office, is welcome. I hope when its findings are released they will be implemented. The future aim of the railways is to stop accidents from happening.</P>
      <P>Railway safety has never been a priority. A great deal of money must be invested in bringing rail lines and carriageways up to proper safety standards. As happened to Deputy Gilmore, a number of my constituents have contacted me to complain about standards in railway stations and in the carriages. However, I will discuss that later. The Government's investment in the rail system has been nothing short of disgraceful in recent years. Rail travel is the future. We must try to get people off the roads. I welcome the investment in road safety but we must think of rail safety as well. The same amount of money spent on road safety should be invested in rail safety.</P>
      <P>Instead of ripping up rail lines across the country, we should promote the use of the railway. I travel on the railway line between Rosslare and Dublin. The number of speed restrictions would make one think one was on a merry-go-round. Deputy Gilmore spoke about the Bray to Greystones line, which is part of the Dublin to Rosslare line. The number of speed restrictions is unbelievable. The Minister should take a trip on that rail line. I am aware that he has promised money for it but I would like to see him travel on it and see the amount of time it takes due to speed restrictions and frequent stops.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We will not have a railway system in years to come if the Government does not invest in it now. <Col N="1351" /> The railways will be deemed unsafe for travel. I believe the Government will be happy with that. The Minister has given a commitment that the Rosslare-Waterford-Limerick line will remain open. I hope it does, to cater for the amount of freight that travels on that line. The Department can generate business on the line if the price is right and if the right person goes looking for the business. As Deputy Ellis said, if one does not go looking for business, it will not come to one's door. One has to look for business to get it.</P>
    <P>The closure of rail lines will force more people on to our already overcrowded and dangerous roads. We are trying to encourage people off the roads and to use alternative transport. That alternative is rail. A large number of people travel from my constituency of Wexford to Dublin each day by road, as they cannot get the service they want if they travel by rail. Wexford is about 80 miles from Dublin and I often travel up to the Dáil by train. The journey takes three to three and a half hours, whereas I could do it by car in little over two hours. This is not a properly run system. I lived in England many years ago on work experience through college, and I used the train as a means of transport as I had no car. Getting from Kent, in the south of England, to London took little over an hour, even though it is a longer journey than that from Wexford to Dublin. People were encouraged to use trains in England. The system was quick and people knew they would get to their destination on time. They did not have to spend two or three hours on a train. The system was safe, comfortable and provided everything that we lack. I know England has had rail accidents, but it was a comfort to travel on those trains, which is most important.</P>
    <P>The Government is losing the plot by not investing in rail safety and not assuring people that they will be safe on our trains. It is important to assure people that when they use trains, they will be safe and offer everything else they would look for. When one looks at the more basic aspect of rail service provision, the carriages that operate between Rosslare and Dublin are years old. Like other Deputies, I have received a letter from Iarnród Éireann assuring me that the rolling stock will be replaced in years to come. I travelled home from the Dáil by train about three weeks ago. The carriages on that train were scandalous. They were cold and uncomfortable. The toilets in three or four carriages were not working. I paid &euro;16 or &euro;17 for a one-way ticket. When one pays that much for a means of transport, one expects a level of service. I was not happy with the standard of service when I got off that train. It does not deter me from using the railway service. People in my constituency, however, tell me that when they receive that level of service they are not willing to use the railway again. They would prefer to travel by car, bus or whatever.</P>
    <P>Another Deputy on this side of the House mentioned wheelchair access on trains. I know a lady in my constituency who went to receive a <Col N="1352" /> hospital check-up in Dublin and returned home accompanied by her daughter, who was in a wheelchair. They could not get the wheelchair into the carriage, so the mother was forced to sit on a toilet seat. That was the only means of keeping the wheelchair stable between carriages. This is not acceptable in 2003. People with disabilities should be to the fore in terms of receiving a good service. It is a matter the Department of Transport should take up. Iarnród Éireann will apologise for the inconvenience in such cases, but that is not satisfactory for the parent who had to sit on the toilet seat the whole way from Dublin to Rosslare. I do not think the Minister would sit on a toilet seat from Dublin to Rosslare. I can assure him that I would not, and it should not be acceptable for anybody else to have to do so either. I would like to see the Government make proper resources available as a result of this Bill to ensure that persons with disabilities can use our railway system to the fullest extent. I hope the Minister will take note and make this happen.</P>
    <P>Then we come to issue of overcrowding on trains. This does not happen too often on my own line, but it does on a Friday evening. I was in Egypt during the summer and saw people hanging out of the windows of buses. One would not see the likes of that anywhere else. When one travels on some of our railway lines, however, especially on Friday evenings and weekends, the overcrowding is scandalous and dangerous. It is an accident waiting to happen, and no emergency service would be able to deal with any accident involving an overcrowded train. It would not have the necessary manpower, ambulances or fire brigades. Someone earlier mentioned being unable to read a newspaper on a train. That is totally unacceptable. Overcrowding has to be looked at immediately. There is not much prospect of our trains gaining additional carriages at present, given that the Government has only promised to replace existing carriages within the next seven or eight years. The provision of additional carriages or extensions to the line is not going to happen.</P>
    <P>I do not believe the type of overcrowding experienced on our trains would be allowed to happen in other countries. I am not 100% sure of this, but I believe some EU countries limit the number of passengers who are allowed to stand in carriages. That should be looked into immediately in order to ensure people's safety. The week before last, my local newspaper carried a two-page spread on the journey from Dublin to Rosslare on a Friday evening. It included photographs of students having to sit on the ground and people having to sit on toilets or wherever they could find a space. That is not acceptable.</P>
    <P>We must invest properly in railway stations and make them up to date and modern. Someone earlier talked about proper lighting and staffing of railway stations to make them safer. There is bad lighting in Rathnew. I noted last week that in one part of that station, there is no lighting at all for people getting off the train. The way things <Col N="1353" /> are going at the moment, we will not get the extra 2,000 gardaí we were promised, so the best resources we can hope for are lighting and CCTV cameras. Nobody knows what will happen in these stations at night time, especially when people are waiting on a train to arrive or are getting off a train. We know the way things have gone in the past year in particular in terms of muggings and so on. The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform does not know it, perhaps he does not want to.</P>
    <P>The only way to stop the type of things that have been happening to people is to put the resources into railway stations to make sure that they are properly lit, properly staffed and safe for older passengers in particular. I know older people who have free travel passes but still will not travel on trains because they are afraid of what is happening on carriages. Deputy Gilmore noted earlier that people are afraid to take trains because they are not safe on carriages or in stations. These people either take the bus or do not use their travel passes at all. They should be encouraged to use their travel passes to travel by rail. All railway tracks, particularly those near towns and cities, should be properly fenced off to prevent people, particularly young people, walking on the tracks. I thank the previous Minister for the money she spent on cutting hedges and fencing off the Rosslare-Wexford line. It made the line safer and I would like to see the same job done as far as Gorey. It is important that people are kept off railway tracks to prevent accidents. I know of two incidents in my constituency where people were killed while walking the tracks. The proper resources should be allocated to fencing off tracks.</P>
    <P>Rail freight is very important as it keeps many heavy vehicles off the roads. Iarnród Éireann spoke of closing the Rosslare-Limerick line. Had it done so many goods would have had to be carried by road. I only have to think of the use the beet factory at Wellington Bridge in Wexford makes of rail freight. The extra trucks required to carry this by road would be disastrous. It is important that this line is open for freight.</P>
    <P>The under-funding of railways in the past has forced the Government to make a decision on whether it should continue with a rail freight service. Given the increases in labour and insurance costs, Iarnród Éireann would get much more rail freight business if it looked for it. I have met many companies in Waterford through the chamber of commerce and several of them would much prefer to use rail freight than roads because they know it will arrive at its destination on time. Rail freight must be continued and it must be viable for companies to use the service. The Government has said that not enough companies are seeking to use rail freight but additional business is there to be had.</P>
    <P>Roads are already in bad repair without extra transport being forced on to them. Many lives have been lost on the road and a significant increase in freight carrying vehicles will definitely <Col N="1354" /> lead to more deaths. The programme for Government said rail freight would be encouraged. I have not yet heard or seen the Government encouraging rail freight.</P>
    <P>Ireland must get a proper rail network that incorporates safety, reliability and good service. We must also encourage people to use the service. The Minister must ensure the proper funding, expertise and attention is given to making our rail network world-class in terms of safety and reliability. Ireland has been lucky that it has not had to face the horror rail accidents witnessed in other countries. Railway is the future of Ireland's transport. I welcome the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MJNolan" hpid="Mr. Nolan Mr. Nolan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Nolan</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to share time with Deputy Mulcahy. If this Bill does nothing else, it reassures rail passengers that the Government is serious about rail safety and they can travel in the secure knowledge that best international standards are being adhered to by Irish Rail.</P>
      <P>One of the disappointments of the past 40 years is the number of lines that were closed by CIE. The line from Bagenalstown, through Borris to New Ross was closed. I am not so old that I do not remember that line running. It was closed and the rail lines were removed and bought by a company that used the sleepers in the manufacturing of hay barns. It is sad to see some of the fine bridges and architecture of this line lie unused. Examples of railways that were operational 50 years ago but no longer exist are to be found all over the country.</P>
      <P>One of the main complaints from rail users is the general overcrowding of trains &ndash; this becomes particularly bad at weekends. I know of students who travel home at weekends and complain about not being able to find a free seat on a train during the course of three or four months at a time. The quality and condition of rolling stock in recent years has left much to be desired.</P>
      <P>I am pleased the Government decided, in 1999, to initiate a programme of investment in Iarnród Éireann. To date, more than &euro;400 million has been spent on this programme. The programme will be implemented by the end of this year and the Minister tells me it is proceeding satisfactorily. Of the 371 level crossings that have been made safe, 217 were noted as being high-risk. There have not been too many accidents on our railways but some of the major accidents we have seen were at unmanned level crossings. Under this programme 228 bridges have been renewed and 150 miles of rail line has been fenced off to deter trespassers and stray animals.</P>
      <P>The employees of Iarnród Éireann are to be complimented on the manner in which they take their work so seriously. I often see them walking the tracks, ensuring the lines are safe and fences are intact. Significant funds have also been invested in upgrading cuttings and embankments and in improving safety management systems. The Exchequer and EU provided more than &euro;150 million last year and this rolling programme of investment will continue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1355" />Lack of investment over the years has taken its toll on our rail service. Successive Governments are to blame for the lack of legislation to ensure that we have a first class rail service. The modernisation of our railways must be a priority not only for this but for future Governments. The closure of lines has happened and that is unfortunate, but as far as possible they should be kept intact. Some of the fine bridges built in the last century should not be demolished or destroyed. They should be kept intact in order that if the necessary resources are available to reopen these lines at some stage in the future, that can be done.</P>
    <P>Investing in the railways should reduce, to some extent, our dependence on our roads. We are all aware of the congestion currently on our roads. I take the train on a regular basis from Carlow to Dublin to come to this House. However, one of my disappointments with the service is that it does not operate as frequently as one would like. Carlow, being 55 miles from Dublin, is within the commuter belt of Dublin. Many people living in Carlow commute to Dublin to work. From speaking to many of them I am aware that they would like to avail of a better rail service. The first train from Carlow to Dublin leaves Carlow at 6.30 a.m. and the next train does not leave until 8.50 a.m. Unfortunately, that train arrives in Dublin too late to accommodate many commuters' work needs. When Iarnród Éireann is examining how to improving its service, it should consider investment in towns within a 60-mile radius of the capital.</P>
    <P>Another aspect one hears frequently complained about is the lack of car parking spaces at some provincial rail stations. When these stations were built, no one would have envisaged the level of use of cars. Therefore, people did not plan for car parking for commuters. However, it is a fact of life now that people commute to railway stations and the number of car parking spaces available is not adequate. I encourage Iarnród Éireann to provide this facility at no cost to the commuter. Such a facility should be part and parcel of its operations. The cost of such parking for commuters using its service should be included in the price of rail tickets.</P>
    <P>A facet of rail transport which I fail to understand, particularly in Dublin, having regard to what is currently happening there, is that a direct rail link to the docks has not been built. The quays are congested on a daily basis with transport lorries carrying freight from the docks, although the port tunnel will alleviate some of that traffic. In parallel with that project, we should have examined investment in a rail link to Dublin docks. It is not beyond the engineers in Iarnród Éireann to put a spur off the Amiens Street line to link it to the docks and thereby alleviate some of the horrendous traffic that currently clogs up the city centre.</P>
    <P>Dublin docks should also be discouraged as far as possible from handling container traffic. Places such as Rosslare and Waterford, whose port <Col N="1356" /> facilities are not overused, should take a good deal more container traffic. There is a first class rail link between Waterford and Dublin and Rosslare and Dublin, although there are proposals to close part of the freight service from Rosslare to Limerick. By encouraging more shippers to use Rosslare and Waterford Ports, we could alleviate some of the current problems in the Dublin area.</P>
    <P>One of the problems we must face and for which we, as legislators, must take some of the blame is the length of time it takes for decisions to be taken and actions to be carried out. Some might say this is due to a lack of commitment by members of Government or to the Civil Service culture, under which everybody covers his or her back in case there is a problem. However, times are changing and we have an obligation to encourage and promote a greater use of our rail lines. The political masters should bite the bullet and take the necessary decisions.</P>
    <P>If we do not improve the quality of our rail transport service, inevitably we will push more commuters back on to our roads. Anyone who suffers the problem of commuting to Dublin on a weekly basis is aware that the road system cannot take much more traffic.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill, but I would like it to be only part of the solution to our problems. I am glad that Iarnród Éireann is investing in new rolling stock which will come on stream this year and next year. In tandem with that, it will have to find some way of improving the service for commuters. We should not talk only of Dublin commuters. The cities of Limerick and Cork would also benefit from an improved rail service.</P>
    <P>I wish the Minister well with the Bill and I hope it has a speedy and successful passage through both Houses of the Oireachtas.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMulcahyFF" hpid="Mr. Mulcahy Mr. Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>I am delighted to commend the Minister, the Minister of State and the Government on introducing this important legislation. Railways will play a much larger part in our lives than they have heretofore. There is the new spatial strategy and rail services will connect the regions to all the cities. It is important to note that the definition of railway activity in the Bill includes the Luas.</P>
      <P>I wish to speak about Luas and suburban rail lines. The population of Dublin is currently 1.1 million and by the year 2030 it will be 1.6 million. We will have suburban railways, perhaps an underground metro system and the Luas. The Luas will interface with streets, communities, crossroads and urban centres. People will walk within centimetres of the Luas line and the possibility for accidents in such circumstances will be increased.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I reiterate what my colleague, Deputy Nolan, said in complimenting the former Minister for Public Enterprise, who is now Leader of the Seanad, Senator O'Rourke, who undeniably put in place a major investment in March 1999 when the Government approved a railway investment <Col N="1357" /> package of &euro;546 billion to be spent between 1999 and 2003. I am aware that the Minister for Transport, Deputy Brennan, will put in place a second phase of that investment beginning in 2004, which is essential.</P>
    <P>We have inherited a great deal of English law and when statutes are put on the Statute Book in England we seem to copy or amend them for our purposes. We have the advantage sometimes of lagging behind what happens in Britain by a few years. Nowhere can we profit more from that fact, than in the case of railways. They have made a complete hames of the railway system in England, certainly <i>vis-à-vis</i> safety. We do not want to go down that road. It was one thing to privatise the railway operators, but it was another to privatise the rail track operators. I am sure the Minister will agree that what happened in England was that the rail track operators went bust and had to revert to public ownership.</P>
    <P>I want to make the case strongly that, under no circumstances should the rail network in Ireland ever come under private ownership. It is a vital national asset that may not be fully utilised at present, but it must always be kept under public control.</P>
    <P>This is not necessarily so for rail operators. The time has come when we must examine the possibility of private companies becoming involved in the rail network. We have seen how private operators have done an excellent job on provincial routes and the Dublin Airport route in complementing CIE's role in public transport. I am disappointed with the level and quality of service from Iarnród Éireann, as are many others. Last year we returned by train from the Fianna Fáil parliamentary party meeting. The locomotive broke down half way and we were left sitting on the line for an hour and a half. There was also a problem with the level of service on the train. That is one of a few experiences. I know the staff and management work hard but a little competition on the Irish rail operating system would not be bad. However, it would not apply to the track, signalling system and rail safety, only to the running and management of trains.</P>
    <P>This is an excellent Bill. The idea of a railway safety commission that is independent of the Minister is important. The functions of the commission are set out clearly in section 10: &ldquo;. . . to foster and encourage railway safety, to regulate and enforce railway safety, and to investigate and report on railway incidents&rdquo;. Those are three important functions that the commission must carry out. I am glad they are being taken from the Department because it means there will be a watchdog and external body that can monitor these areas on behalf of the public.</P>
    <P>I welcome Part 3 which lists the general duty of those working on the railways. Section 38 states: &ldquo;It shall be the general duty of a railway undertaking to ensure, in so far as is reasonably practicable, the safety of persons in the operation of its railway&rdquo;. Section 39 elaborates on that. There do not appear to be sanctions for people <Col N="1358" /> in breach of that duty. As I understand it, it is probably a matter of common law that they would be amenable to the courts. Should proper provision have been made in the Bill for people in breach of that duty to come to the attention of the commission? The general duty to take care in sections 38 and 39 appears to be floating on its own. Perhaps we should examine that.</P>
    <P>The second important aspect of the Bill is the establishment of a railway safety advisory council. Even though I am a Government backbencher, I have a question mark about this. Why do we need two bodies? There has been a dose of &ldquo;quango-itis&rdquo; in the country in recent years. We seem to establish bodies for everything. I understand the railway safety advisory council will have different functions. Section 80 sets out that it shall make recommendations on safety, if appropriate, to the Minister. That is important, but why should the commission not have the safety brief? Would it not have been possible to merge the two bodies into one and have a recommendation function within the railway safety commission? I am sure there is a good reason.</P>
    <P>In general, we have a tendency to create a large number of bodies and I intend to campaign in the next few years about what I will call &ldquo;quango-itis&rdquo;. We appear to establish agencies left, right and centre with their own offices, computers and glossy broadsheets, and this adds up to a significant amount of money. At a time when we must trim our cloth to the available wind, we should examine the number of agencies that have been established outside Departments.</P>
    <P>I hope that by the time Luas comes on stream, the commission will be up and running and producing safety statements.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeymourCrawford" hpid="Mr. Crawford Mr. Crawford">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crawford</NameTxt>
      <P>Like my colleagues, I welcome the Bill and hope that it creates safer transport and brings about major improvements in the rail network. I wish to declare an interest in that the railroad ran through my family holding until the late 1960s. Unfortunately, like the Minister's county of Donegal, the constituency of Cavan-Monaghan does not have much to benefit now from the Bill. However, I believe it is still important nationally and it is in that context I wish to speak on the Bill.</P>
      <P>I am jealous of other constituencies when I see the sizeable budget available for the rail network. The figures I obtained from the Department were &euro;261 million for railway safety and related matters and &euro;127 million for the Luas project. I welcome the expenditure of that money.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, back in the late 1960s, promises were made that if the railroad was taken out of the regions, it would save the country an enormous amount of money and we would be compensated by efforts to build a proper road network. It is now 2003 and we have received the first commitment towards a bypass of Carrickmacross in County Monaghan and there is still no commitment to a bypass of Monaghan town. When I look at successive Governments, especially the pre<Col N="1359" /> vious one during the era of the Celtic tiger, I must ask how well the money is being redistributed. Some recognition should be given to the three counties of Ulster &ndash; Donegal, Cavan and Monaghan &ndash; which are not benefiting from the railway budget. We should receive something additional in the form of roads infrastructure. I am sure the Minister of State, Deputy McDaid, would not disagree with me when I say that we should jointly ensure that a proper road runs from Dublin city to the third largest city on the island, namely, Derry. It would be of major benefit to all people in the Border area and the north-west.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMcDaid" hpid="Dr. McDaid Dr. McDaid">
      <NameTxt>Dr. McDaid</NameTxt>
      <P>And to Carrickmacross.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeymourCrawford" hpid="Mr. Crawford Mr. Crawford">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crawford</NameTxt>
      <P>Exactly. We should certainly work together to ensure that happens. It is a long time &ndash; from 1967 to 2003 &ndash; to obtain that commitment.</P>
      <P>I used the railway as much as possible in my earlier days when the lines were in place. My parents brought us to Dublin for medical and other appointments. Unfortunately, the railway did not last. In later years when I was on the board of Cork Marts-IMP, a major farmer-owned meat industry, I travelled to Dublin, joined the railroad at 7.30 in the morning and arrived in Cork at 10 a.m. That was a tremendous service. The railway services the southern part of my constituency, especially in the Carrickmacross and south Monaghan area where workers can take the train from Dundalk to Dublin. That journey takes one hour and the passengers can use mobile phones or laptop computers to work while they travel by train. As a Deputy for Cavan-Monaghan, I do not have that same advantage and I have to drive through the chaos on the roads. This is a stark example of how parts of this country are treated.</P>
      <P>Due to the lack of service on the Dublin to Dundalk route and the level of demand for the existing service, people often have to stand for the entire journey. People aged 75 or 80 years might have to get up at 6 o'clock to go to Dublin for a medical appointment and use the train for easy access to the city. They have a long wait at the hospital and take a taxi back to the train station. Having perhaps had a minor operation on their legs, they then have to stand for the full journey from Dublin to Dundalk. An hour may not be a long time, but for someone in that condition, it is very unfair.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is still some semblance of rail structure into my constituency between Navan and Kingscourt and this must be reinstated as a proper service. Imagine what this would do for the N3 road to Dublin if at least some of that traffic could be removed from the road, put on a proper rail service to Kingscourt and perhaps even be extended to Carrickmacross. This would allow people to travel in comfort and off the roads straight to the centre of Dublin city. Reality has hit home and money is scarce in 2003 even though none of us <Col N="1360" /> could have believed that a year ago. Let us not eliminate the possibility of a service in that region by removing the track. It would be much handier for people to drive to Kingscourt and use the railway from there. Freight could also be removed from the road by putting it on the train at Kingscourt and bringing it to Dublin or wherever it has to go.</P>
    <P>I want to highlight the problems that the lack of rail service has caused to the Cavan area. There was a Bus Éireann service that allowed people to get from Cavan to Dublin in the morning and back again after work. While it was a long day, they did not have any hassle. They could relax on the bus without having to worry about driving or the high cost of living in Dublin. I believe the cost of that service was &euro;37 per week. In the interest of competition, which I favour, an independent bus service was put on and the Bus Éireann one was withdrawn. Unfortunately the independent service leaves Dublin at 5 o'clock in the evening. There is a Bus Éireann service later that night but there is no early morning service. This is an example of competition requirements gone mad. People in Cavan have had to either do without the service and stay in Dublin during the week or pay for two services, &euro;38 in the morning and &euro;37 in the evening for the five days. The cost has doubled because of so-called competition. It is bureaucracy gone mad. Where there is no rail service the Government has an obligation to ensure people like this are looked after. They can get a service from County Cavan by driving behind the bus from Cavan town to Virginia, park there and get on the bus, but that is not acceptable.</P>
    <P>Where there is no railway, there should be other opportunities. When I first started travelling to Dublin through my involvement in a farmers' organisation, I could get from my home through Dublin city to Bluebell in two hours. I might not have always kept within the so-called 60 mph limit, but there was no limit in those days, if the Minister will forgive me. However, to do the same journey now requires a minimum of three hours and part of that is because of the new regulations at Slane bridge, which are unbelievable.</P>
    <P>From the M50 into Dublin there is only one lane for cars while the bus lane is often empty. Why can we not have park and ride facilities at the all the major junctions with the M50? That is not a major economic issue. Under PPP schemes, private companies would gladly build the parking facilities if there was agreement that the service would be provided on those empty bus lanes. We could solve much of the Dublin transport problem and the problem for those of us who have to drive cars into Dublin by leaving many of those cars at car parks beside the M50 and travelling from there by bus. This has been considered, but now is the time to act. This needs to be done in order to relieve some of the chaos that exists.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMcDaid" hpid="Dr. McDaid Dr. McDaid">
      <NameTxt>Dr. McDaid</NameTxt>
      <P>There are issues of planning and possible objections.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeymourCrawford" hpid="Mr. Crawford Mr. Crawford">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crawford</NameTxt>
      <P>I believe we have to start the process. Parking facilities close to those junctions could be found if there was sufficient desire to do so. It would be much easier to deal with that planning problem rather than widening streets or make other changes in the heart of the city.</P>
      <P>Due to cutbacks in Iarnród Éireann, much freight has been taken off the railroads supposedly for commercial reasons. How much effort was put into trying to make that business pay? The 40-foot trucks that have been forced on to the roads are not only jamming up the rural roads, but also those in Dublin city. I welcome the fact that the Dublin Port tunnel is being built and hope it will be completed in the shortest possible time because of the indirect chaos it is causing. The issue of how goods are transported must be considered in a more practical and commercial way.</P>
      <P>I return to the issue of cross-Border railroads. There is an interesting link between north Monaghan, Armagh and Portadown which should be studied and in which some people are already interested. We are looking at ways and means of trying to build structures which would reconnect communities on either side of the Border. A rail link between Monaghan and Portadown via Armagh would be extremely important for Monaghan town and the general north Monaghan area, which is losing many services, including, as the Minister will be aware, hospital services and its swimming pool. A railway link to Portadown would also provide valuable access to Belfast and Larne as well as the excellent rail service between Belfast and Dublin, which runs through Portadown.</P>
      <P>Older people in areas such as Monaghan and Donegal cannot truly benefit from the free transport scheme introduced many years ago. It would be great if people over 65 years, many of whom are still fit and would like to travel, could avail of the scheme in their golden years. Unlike their fellow citizens in Dublin, Cork, Galway, Sligo and elsewhere, the people of Donegal, Monaghan and Cavan have no access to the scheme, except by availing of bus services. I hope the Minister will consider the proposal for a rail link between Monaghan and Portadown via Armagh in the context of available cross-Border funding, which could be utilised for infrastructural purposes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A previous speaker referred to the need to retain all the rail bridges in areas where the railroads no longer operate or are unviable. An example of the possible difficulties this proposal could cause was the decision by Monaghan County Council, in its wisdom, to raise a road under one of the railway bridges in north Monaghan. As a result, contractors cannot get their machinery under the bridge to service the farms of the area. This is the type of pressure which could arise and may lead to some of these struc<Col N="1362" /> tures being removed. A little more common sense is required to ensure structures, which could and should be used in the future, are not removed.</P>
    <P>I have already covered the chaos on the roads, especially in Dublin. One could ask what the link is between Dublin and the lack of railroads in Cavan, Monaghan or Donegal. Dublin is the centre of our business world. Those who want to reach Government agencies and Departments or use the airport must travel to Dublin. It is foolish that in the year 2003 we do not have a railway link between Dublin city centre and the airport.</P>
    <P>When I started using the airport to travel to Europe in the late 1970s and early 1980s, one could park one's car on the footpath outside and I recall the late T. J. Maher, the former president of the organisation in which I was involved, the IFA, or NFA as it was then called, doing precisely that. The airport has grown beyond all our expectations and is the main link for tourists and business people travelling in and out of the country. On previous visits to Brussels, I could travel at minimum cost from the railway station adjacent to the airport to a range of destinations, whereas those who use Dublin Airport must take a bus or taxi or use their cars and this is causing chaos.</P>
    <P>Given the substantial sums of money available, including European Union funds, we should build the rail link to the airport sooner, rather than later. It would create much easier access for those who have to use the roads and cut down on the number of cars parked at the airport, thus freeing up parking space for others. In addition, it would provide an immediate link to the Dublin to Cork line and the northern and western lines. This matter needs to be addressed quickly.</P>
    <P>The previous speaker referred to quangos. I am concerned at the number of organisations, such as the National Roads Authority, which are not answerable to the House. I hope the new commission established by the Bill will be answerable to the Minister, the House and its committees. As matters stand, I cannot address a question, for example, concerning the Monaghan bypass, to the Minister, but must politely try to speak to the chief executive of the NRA. If the House chooses to establish new agencies, we must ensure they are answerable to the House.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JimmyDevinsFF" hpid="Dr. Devins Dr. Devins">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Devins</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to speak to this important legislation which brings together many Acts that have come before the House, some of which date back as far as 1842. I welcome the fact that the railway safety commission will be an independent body. It is important this is the case. The functions of the <Col N="1363" /> commission are clearly delineated in the legislation. Its foremost role will be to foster and encourage railway safety, which all Deputies will support. More importantly, it will regulate and enforce safety and has powers to investigate and report on any railway incidents.</P>
      <P>I have a minor query on the term of office of the commissioners. From reading the legislation, I understand they must serve not less than three years and not more than seven years and may not hold office for longer than 12 years continuously. Is this correct?</P>
      <P>The commission has the power to engage staff, consultants if necessary, in the administration of its functions. In this age of financial rectitude, it is important the commissioners are given powers to recoup some of their expenses by imposing a levy on the railway companies. This is a positive development in that those benefiting most in financial terms from the railways will have an obligation to help fund the activities of the commissioners.</P>
      <P>I also welcome the fact that the railway safety commission will have to draw up and publish a strategy within six months of the commissioners taking office and that this strategy must be updated and republished every three years.</P>
      <P>While the function of the commission is to oversee railway safety, the Bill deals extensively with what are quaintly termed &ldquo;railway undertakings.&rdquo;  The railway companies, to which I presume the term refers, are obliged to prepare a safety statement or statement case. In other words, the railway must demonstrate it is aware of the risks involved in operating railways and the ways in which it is prepared to deal with them. I welcome this proposal.</P>
      <P>A welcome proposal in the Bill is that the railway companies have to prepare a safety statement not just on their current rolling stock and railway lines but also in relation to any new stock or railway lines they propose to open. There is a common belief that many members of the public would take it as read that a new rolling stock is perfectly safe, and hopefully that is the case, but we all know from the dreadful tragedy involving the <i>Colombia</i> space shuttle that something new is not necessarily intrinsically safe. The preparation of a safety statement on new stock, therefore, and on any new railway lines which may be opened is a welcome development.</P>
      <P>Under section 46 the railway companies are obliged to have their safety statement assessed by an independent suitably qualified person. In other words, they cannot simply cobble together a safety statement and submit it to the commission. Before they do so, the safety statement must be assessed by an independently qualified person which will help reassure the general public who use the railways.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Obviously the preparation of the safety statement will cost money. I welcome the proposal by the Minister that in the case of heritage railways, which may be operating on a shoestring, the com<Col N="1364" /> mission can help them in the preparation of their safety statement by the granting of some money. That is a welcome addition. Our heritage railways are an important part of our railway system and, as such, any help we can give them in the operation of their functions is to be welcomed.</P>
    <P>Nobody wants to see railway accidents but, unfortunately, in the course of the railway system, they do occur. When these incidents occur the railway, under the terms of this Bill, must immediately investigate, prepare a statement and furnish that statement to the commission. The fact that the commission can then, at its own behest, investigate the accident and publish a report within nine months is to be welcomed. The provision whereby they can issue an interim statement on the accident before the nine months is up will also help allay fears if the accident involves serious loss of life or death.</P>
    <P>The commission also has the power to set up a tribunal of inquiry in such cases where it deems it necessary to do so. That inquiry will have the legal standing of the District Court, which we must all welcome.</P>
    <P>I also welcome the section which allows the commission to enforce all of the proposals contained in the Bill. It has a wide range of powers of enforcement which will reassure the members of the general public that when this Bill is enacted, we will have a railway safety system of the highest standing in the world.</P>
    <P>Reference has already been made by some of the previous speakers to the railway safety advisory council. This is a good idea. It is very broadly based and the status of people who will be allowed sit on the council is clearly marked out in the Bill. I am particularly delighted that provision has been made for a member of the advisory council to represent those suffering from disablement of mobility. All too frequently, many of our public transport systems do not take into account people who may be suffering from physical mobility problems. The fact that they will now have a representative on this safety council is important.</P>
    <P>Sections 81 to 88 in Part 9 deal with the use of intoxicants. Unfortunately, it is a fact of life that both alcohol and drugs are widely available in our society. The insertion of all of these sections is welcome. It will allow the railway companies in the first instance, or the railway commission, to investigate and help any persons who are suffering from problems of intoxication, be it with either alcohol or drugs. I also welcome the fact that the identification of a potential problem may be solved by counselling. Counselling will be made available to anybody involved in the operation of railways, which might help nip a serious problem in the bud.</P>
    <P>I welcome the publication of the Bill. I wish to refer to a railway which is very close to my heart, the Sligo-Dublin railway line which is 140 years old. Sligo station was first opened in December 1862. I would like to congratulate the previous Minister for Transport who made a substantial <Col N="1365" /> amount of money available to Iarnród Éireann to upgrade the facilities in the station. Sligo is about 130 miles from Dublin and it does not take rocket science to work out that if a train was travelling at an average of 60 miles an hour, it should be able to complete the journey in approximately two to two and a half hours. Unfortunately, the reality is that officially it takes three hours 20 minutes to travel from Sligo to Dublin. I say &ldquo;officially&rdquo; because frequently the train is late. That is unacceptable. The previous Government invested a significant amount of money in making available a continuously welded line which will help to give a better service. That welded line is almost finished and I thank the Minister involved for doing that. The reality, however, is that despite having this continuously welded line the rolling stock, both engines and carriages, belong to the dark ages. It is apparent that the stock used on that line has been used by Iarnród Éireann on some of the more popular lines in the country and when it is not fit for those lines, it is sent over to the west. That is unacceptable.</P>
    <P>The service is not of a very high standard. The heating system in the trains frequently breaks down. If it is working, it is frequently fixed at far too high a level. There are virtually no refreshments available on the train, but another problem has been highlighted to me repeatedly by constituents living in Sligo town. When the evening train arrives into Sligo and passengers disembark, the engine has to be kept running all night. There is not a facility in the station to restart the engine. There is a very large hotel right beside the station &ndash; it was originally a railway hotel &ndash; and the noise from the engine running all night is causing great distress both to the management and the occupants of the hotel. It would be a simple matter for Iarnród Éireann to bring down a machine which could start the engine in the morning before the train leaves for Dublin. There is also the problem that this diesel engine is pouring out fumes all night, thereby increasing air pollution. For both those reasons, therefore, it is totally unacceptable that in 2003 the train has to be kept running all night.</P>
    <P>At the beginning of this week I travelled by car from Sligo to Dublin and I carried out a small survey on the way up here. It is not terribly scientific but more in the nature of an observational survey. I decided I would count the number of articulated trucks I met coming in the opposite direction and in the course of a journey of 130 miles, and before I reached the outskirts of Dublin, I had counted 130 articulated trucks. That was virtually one truck every minute and a half to two minutes.</P>
    <P>The movement of freight should be done in a much more aggressive and widescale manner by railways. That would help reduce the amount of large articulated trucks which appear to be taking over our roads. I am aware there are proposals before the Minister, some of which are very imaginative, on the movement of freight by rail. He should look at these proposals because any<Col N="1366" /> thing that can be done to increase the movement of freight by rail, taking it off our roads, would be welcome.</P>
    <P>One of my constituency colleagues mentioned proposals for a commuter service from Ballymote to Sligo. The rail line between the two is only used four or five times a day and a commuter service would alleviate the traffic problems in the area while making financial sense by using the line more.</P>
    <P>In 1862, when the Sligo station first came into use, there were three railway companies using it. The Midland Great Western Railway served the Dublin-Sligo line, the Sligo Leitrim and Northern Counties Railway served Enniskillen and the Waterford and Limerick Railway Company served the west and north-west. Unfortunately we only have a Dublin-Sligo connection today. Many in the west of Ireland want to revitalise the area and reopening the Sligo-Limerick line, then hopefully extending it on to Waterford which would be a great boost to the economy of the area. There may not be sufficient passenger numbers to open the line but using it for freight would be of great benefit. The port in the south-east is one of the largest roll-on, roll-off ports in the country and the entire north-west could send freight in that direction. I ask the Minister to look at that in conjunction with Iarnród Éireann as it would revitalise the north-west.</P>
    <P>I congratulate the Minister on this Bill. The most important person using the railway must be the passenger and the Bill ensures that the safety of the passenger is paramount. It does not pay lip service but puts a real safety statement in place. I commend the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DamienEnglishFG" hpid="Mr. English Mr. English">
      <NameTxt>Mr. English</NameTxt>
      <P>We are lucky to have a fairly good record on rail safety, particularly in relation to major accidents, thank God. I am proud of that. Even though there have been some sad deaths over the years much work has been done to eradicate various black spots.</P>
      <P>I welcome the Bill although, as Deputy Crawford said, it does not have great relevance to my area because there is a lack of rail services there. The Bill does what should have been done many years ago by putting down proposals in writing and getting procedures right. That will keep us all safe in the long run. A commission makes good sense also as it is better to have a separate body to investigate incidents.</P>
      <P>I do not have much experience with rail safety but we should look abroad to see how using trains can make our lives safer. There seems to be a lack of investment in trains compared to roads or motorways. It is often said that the Government is having a love affair with roads. The Minister and Minister of State have done a lot of work since being appointed but I would like to see a policy which puts the rail system first. Maybe we will have to make choices between rail and road systems. I would choose rail systems but the Minister should make a firm stand on this issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the main features of rail safety is that it <Col N="1367" /> gets vehicles off the roads. If there are fewer vehicles on the road it is natural that there will be fewer crashes. We must recognise that. Rail is costly to run once it is built but it is worth it in the long run as it will save people's lives. This Bill and investment in the rail network will contribute to that process.</P>
    <P>Many drivers crash due to stress or lack of sleep. The situation on a train is the opposite, as one sits back and someone else does the work. One can read the newspaper on the train whereas many people put on make up or shave while driving, so there is a safety issue involved. We should invest in rail to encourage people off the roads. Train drivers will not be allowed to drink or take drugs, which means they will be in good shape to drive the trains. Those in cars are always rushing for appointments but the train driver will not be rushed. He or she will have procedures in place and can stick to them. Again, this will encourage people to get off the roads.</P>
    <P>I am disappointed the Bill does not deal specifically with freight transport. I am from Navan and we have little rail activity in Meath. We had some services a few years ago but some wise man closed it. A lot of money was invested in making the rail line from Kingscourt to Navan safer and I compliment the Government on that investment which meant gates and fences were put in place and so on. However, what happened when the work finished? There was no more freight and the rail line was closed. Where is the sense in that? We spend money on safety and then it is thrown to one side because it is not needed. Is there any way this line can be reopened and used? The Minister of State should look into this issue because if we had a freight depot somewhere in north Meath it would take a lot of lorries out of Dublin. Millions were spent on the rail line and it was then closed, which is crazy.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMcDaid" hpid="Dr. McDaid Dr. McDaid">
      <NameTxt>Dr. McDaid</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a time element there. Thousands of lorries were involved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DamienEnglishFG" hpid="Mr. English Mr. English">
      <NameTxt>Mr. English</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure there are reasons but was there ever a drive from Iarnród Éireann to go out and get freight business? From my investigations I sensed there was a feeling it was easier to let it off rather than trying to get business. I would like someone to try to make this work, even if it means bringing in salesmen to sell the service to businesses on a commission basis. We need to look at other ideas. In other countries businesses are well subsidised and given tax incentives to use rail services. I accept what the Minister of State says about a time element but this should be looked at. If the rail system was linked and received proper investment that time issue could be resolved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a freight line from Navan to Drogheda which passengers are not allowed to use because, Iarnród Éireann officials inform me, the state of the line only allows trains to travel at a speed of 25 miles per hour. If that is the maximum speed <Col N="1368" /> nobody would want to take that train as one could cycle faster. However, investment would encourage people to take that train. I could talk all day about the benefits of rail travel but investment is the key.</P>
    <P>I mentioned the lack of rail services from Meath but many commuters in the county would like to take the train. There is a train station in Navan but one never sees passenger trains there, only the odd train with material from Tara Mines. Those commuters drive on one of the worst roads in the country, from Navan to Drogheda, to get the train. That is a half hour drive at all hours of the morning to get a fast train which gets them to Dublin in an hour. This makes no sense. They are putting their lives at risk driving on that road and then at Drogheda, as Deputy O'Dowd and others pointed out, the train from Belfast is full and there is overcrowding. That day is gone. There will have to be more investment in carriages but I am told there is a two year waiting period for rolling stock, which makes no sense. There has been commendable honesty from the Government side in this debate and many speakers said they did not want old rolling stock in their areas. We in County Meath will take that old rolling stock if we can get some work done on our rail lines.</P>
    <P>Regarding the rail-motorway divide, are the NRA and Iarnród Éireann working together? The NRA came to Meath in 1999 to start a motorway and everyone got excited. We asked at the initial meeting if a railway line could be put next to the motorway and were told it could not be done because Iarnród Éireann was two years behind in its planning and we accepted that. Two years later they came back with their plans for the road. We asked then if Iarnród Éireann could run a track beside it and they said &ldquo;no&rdquo; because the road did not turn at an angle that a railway could follow. We accepted that argument. After that they recommended that if a railway was to go to Navan, it would be a light railway line that could turn at any angle. That could easily have been planned along with the motorway but there was no incentive for these people to work together.</P>
    <P>I am committed to the development of the rail network and want to see a workable and forward looking policy in place. This Bill will help but it would be more important if the rail network was extended. Meath should be included in any new rail plan because all the roads in the county are clogged. We must invest in rail.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanNeville" hpid="Mr. Neville Mr. Neville">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Neville</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the introduction of a railway safety commission independent of the Minister and Irish Rail. Rail safety is very important. In my county there was a serious accident where a well known nun was killed on a level crossing last year. At the time the Minister stated that Irish Rail was behind in addressing safety at level crossings. It is vital that measures are introduced.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Reports by the railway safety commission will <Col N="1369" /> aid that process. The reports must be as rigorous in their examination of safety issues as the reports of other institutions of State, such as the report of the Inspector of Mental Hospitals each year. They are totally different areas but the same standard of investigation and recommendation should apply.</P>
    <P>Investment in rail safety has been neglected through the years, as have the railways. We might talk about rail safety but it is a relatively safe way to travel when compared to the roads. Investment in the development of the railways is not just an investment in safety, but an investment in the economy and it takes traffic off the roads. It should be a more economical way to travel but currently it is very expensive. I am appalled at the idea of removing freight from the railways. It should be a national objective to encourage the development of the freight service. There was much more movement of goods by rail than by road 25 years ago. I was involved in the meat sector and 80% of our product was moved by rail from Limerick. If we do not develop that infrastructure, we will regret it in the way we regret the closure of lines in the 1950s and 1960s. We now understand how wrong that was.</P>
    <P>We should think about opening railway lines in commuter areas. In County Limerick there was a line between Limerick and Foynes which passed through Adare and Patrickswell. These are large commuter areas that will grow, thus increasing traffic into Limerick. A commuter railway should be examined and the option made attractive to people so they could leave their cars at the Patrickswell or Adare train stations.</P>
    <P>There has been criticism of overcrowding on the trains on the Cork-Dublin train, which also stops in Limerick. People complain of having to stand, particularly on Monday morning as the students return to Dublin. There is an early train at 5.45 a.m. from Limerick specifically aimed at the students but there have been complaints from those in the Charleville area that there is overcrowding and that they have to stand. On Friday evenings and Monday mornings it is common to see people sitting in corridors and between carriages. That is not good enough for people who pay their way and support the rail network. People should support that network but it must also be a two way process. Travelling must be attractive, reliable and value for money. It is much cheaper to travel from Limerick to Dublin by car than by train. The train is now quite expensive and, as a result, less attractive.</P>
    <P>The services on most lines are quite good. I have no complaint about the services from Limerick but we are lucky that there is a Limerick service and we can also link to the Cork service at Limerick Junction. There are services that I cannot criticise but there are difficulties elsewhere.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DanNeville" hpid="Mr. Neville Mr. Neville">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Neville</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome that. It will go some way towards relieving the difficulties I have mentioned. We must make travel attractive and reliable. Those are the keys to developing the service.</P>
      <P>The difficulties experienced by train drivers who have been involved in fatalities have not been mentioned. I know Iarnród Éireann has programmes to deal with the trauma of drivers who experience a death. Deaths in nine cases out of ten are suicides. I am aware of the trauma experienced by drivers and service people generally, such as doctors, psychiatrists and anyone who deals with people who have experienced death by suicide. Train drivers are extremely traumatised when something like that happens. We do not often think of how deeply it affects those who deal with such deaths. People often feel extremely depressed or guilty that they could have anticipated it or tried to avoid it. It may be illogical, but that is how they feel.</P>
      <P>People are concerned about the families of the person who committed suicide. It is important to recognise the need to assist people, particularly train drivers who are often faced with the extremely traumatic experience of someone taking his or her life by throwing himself or herself in front of a train. Perhaps the Minister will tell us about the type of facilities which are available for such people and how many people avail of them. Perhaps hew will tell us if the people who use the service have evaluated how it has helped them to deal with an extremely difficult problem.</P>
      <P>I welcome the Bill. I look forward to the establishment of the commission and to the reports which will be the most important element. I hope they will be laid before this House. The key determinant will be the response of the Minister and of Iarnród Éireann to the recommendations in the report. While the commission is independent of the Minister, the ultimate responsibility for rail safety rests with the Minister. Sometimes we hear complaints about organisations taking power away from the House. Ministers are not responsible for our national primary and secondary roads system; that responsibility lies with the National Roads Authority. Rail safety is the ultimate responsibility of the Minister. He must ensure that adequate investment is available to provide a safe service. I urge the Minister to comment on the reports we received last year about the programme by Iarnród Éireann to ensure safety at level crossings.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidStanton" hpid="Mr. Stanton Mr. Stanton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Stanton</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pleased to have the opportunity to speak on this important Bill. I did some research on the Internet before I came into the House and I discovered that the Bill has received international praise. We should acknowledge something good. I have studied the Bill which is well thought out and includes many good provisions. Our function is to comment on the provisions of the Bill and on what should be included in it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am glad there have been few rail incidents. <Col N="1371" /> Rail transport is a safe way to travel. There have also been few incidents where people who work on the railways have been injured or killed. However, when something goes wrong on the railways, it has the tendency to go very wrong. That is why it is important to be extra vigilant as far as rail safety is concerned. We cannot afford to take shortcuts or to penny-pinch when it comes to rail safety. I commend the Government in that regard. I welcome the amount of money which has been invested in rail safety and the importance of such investment because it was long overdue. The public cannot see the work which has been done because it has been done on the rail infrastructure. People could say that little is being done, but a lot has been done. I want to give credit where it is due.</P>
    <P>Perhaps the Minister will give us an overview of the Government's policy on railways. Other speakers alluded to that. Does the Government see the development and expansion of the railways as a priority? Is it part of Government's policy? Has the Cabinet discussed the railways and has it made a decision to expand the rail network? Is it trying to encourage more people to use the railways? We will be left in limbo if that is not done because we need a clear statement of Government policy and action in that regard. We would welcome a statement from the Minister in that regard.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMcDaid" hpid="Dr. McDaid Dr. McDaid">
      <NameTxt>Dr. McDaid</NameTxt>
      <P>It tends to be simplified. We could have an entire debate on rail freight only.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidStanton" hpid="Mr. Stanton Mr. Stanton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Stanton</NameTxt>
      <P>That is vitally important. That is why we need a clear statement of Government policy. We need to educate the public about rail safety. Perhaps the new commission could be given responsibility for that. I welcome the establishment of the railway safety commission which is a good move forward. It is good to hive off areas of speciality from Departments. However, I am concerned about the commission's accountability to the House and to the electorate through elected representatives. Many bodies have been established, but they cannot easily be held to account through the democratic process. Many people do not bother to vote in elections because they do not believe it will do any good. Accountability to our Parliament is being diluted year after year. Ministers, who are the only people with power in this democracy, should examine this issue to see what can be done to restore accountability. Ministers must also be accountable. That is at the root of our parliamentary democracy. If we continue to dilute that, the people will abstain from voting and will make their opinions known in other ways.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is a very serious issue. I ask the Minister to indicate whether, in the event of an incident occurring on the railway system, he can give information to Members by way of reply to parliamentary questions. That is the least I would expect. All other bodies and quangos should also <Col N="1372" /> be accountable in the same way. Information should be made available through the relevant Minister in response to questions in the House. That is most important.</P>
    <P>Part 2, section 10 of the Bill provides for the commission to enter into agreements with the national authority for occupational safety and health. I welcome that provision. Would it be useful to include the EPA also in that context? A previous subsection indicates that it is possible but I believe it should be mentioned specifically. Since many toxic substances are carried on our railways, it would be useful if there was a formal linkage with the EPA in a similar manner to that which the NHSA will have under this Bill. I ask the Minister to consider that. If it has already been considered and a decision taken not to include the EPA, perhaps the Minister will inform the House of the reasons for that decision. In case of rail incidents or accidents involving toxic substances, the advice of the EPA should form part of the commission's thinking and should be readily accessible.</P>
    <P>Under Part 5, the thrust of the Bill is that investigation of railway undertakings will, in the main, be carried out by the railway undertaking itself. There is also provision for the commission to carry out an investigation if it wishes. Is the Bill strong enough in this area? If an accident or incident occurs, is there not a difficulty in having the railway undertaking involved being the body responsible for carrying out the investigation? Should that not be tightened up so that the commission would have a direct role, a hands-on involvement in investigating all incidents in some way? Perhaps there is a level after which the commission will get involved. I ask the Minister to clear up that important point in his reply to the debate. While I do not suggest it would happen, there may be concerns that a railway undertaking might not carry out a fully satisfactory investigation in the first instance. That should be avoided.</P>
    <P>The Bill also provides that it shall not be the purpose of an investigation to attribute blame or liability. I question that provision, which is a rather unusual one. If there is a reason for it, perhaps the Minister will outline it.</P>
    <P>I welcome the proposed railway safety advisory council, the establishment of which is a very innovative move. In relation to appointments, especially with regard to the three members of the commission &ndash; this relates to the issue of accountability to which I referred previously &ndash; it would be useful if the Oireachtas committee charged with overseeing transport matters was involved in the appointment of those commissioners. What I have in mind is that when a Minister appoints people to a State board, he or she would have the support of the relevant Oireachtas committee in an open, transparent and above-board process.</P>
    <P>I am not suggesting a form of US Senate investigation or tribunal but rather that the Oireachtas committee would be informed that the Minister <Col N="1373" /> intends to appoint, in this case, three people to the commission. The Minister would outline his reasons for those appointments and the qualifications of the proposed appointees and the committee would discuss the matter. That would reassure the public of a more open approach to such appointments. There is a feeling &ndash; I know it does not happen with the Government &ndash; that friends of the Minister might be appointed to the commission. While I know it never happens, we should endeavour to avoid the possibility. Perhaps the Minister will comment on that suggestion, which I have put forward on previous occasions. The former Minister for Public Enterprise, Senator O'Rourke, indicated that she was amenable to that approach and that it would come about in the context of Dáil reform. However, Dáil reform now appears to be very far away.</P>
    <P>Part 10 of the Bill refers to works on public roads adjacent to a railway. There has been an alleged incident in relation to a railway line over a tunnel in Dublin. Those provisions of the Bill are crucially important in that context. What is the position in relation to other works that are not on public roads adjacent to railways, such as building or mining works or the laying of cables? Is that covered in this Bill? I may have missed the detail but it is important that such matters should be covered in the Bill.</P>
    <P>Other colleagues have referred to overcrowding on trains. As a frequent traveller on trains, I am very conscious of that problem. Often the train to Cork is very overcrowded at certain times, with people standing in aisles and in areas between carriages, even to the extent of obstructing the food trolley. In the event of a train having to stop suddenly, people could be catapulted in all directions. I welcome the Minister's statement that new carriages will be provided. That is long overdue and perhaps the Minister will inform the House as to when those carriages will be in operation. I also welcome the provision in the Bill for the commission to investigate new rolling stock.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMcDaid" hpid="Dr. McDaid Dr. McDaid">
      <NameTxt>Dr. McDaid</NameTxt>
      <P>The new carriages will be in operation from summer 2003.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidStanton" hpid="Mr. Stanton Mr. Stanton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Stanton</NameTxt>
      <P>From this summer we will have new rolling stock on the line to Cork. Perhaps on the Government's next visit to Cork, it will travel by train. I hope overcrowding will not be a problem by then but it is a big issue now. I have seen older people standing in overcrowded trains. On one occasion, a lady who was standing near me in the area between carriages on the Cork train informed me she had had a sleepless night during her visit to her husband who was ill in a Dublin hospital. There should be a policy of encouraging passengers to give up their seats to older people and signs to that effect should by displayed in train carriages.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Currently there are speed restrictions on many sections of the rail network. Will the Mini<Col N="1374" /> ster indicate the duration of those restrictions? I know the restrictions are for safety reasons but they can result in a considerable increase in journey times.</P>
    <P>It would be remiss on my part to speak on this Bill without mentioning the reopening of the rail link to east Cork. I know the matter is on the Minister's desk at present and I urge him and Iarnród Éireann to make a decision as soon as possible. The county development plan for Cork is totally dependant on the reopening of that rail link. The county council has more or less developed the county plan around the possible reopening of the rail link. When the delegation met the former Minister, Mary O'Rourke, she said she would not give the go-ahead for the opening until the council zoned land close to the railway line. That has been done and we still have not got a decision about the reopening of the rail link. If the rail link to east Cork does not reopen, the county development plan will possibly be unworkable and may have to be reviewed and changed. The county council has, in fairness, carried out its side of the bargain. It has zoned the land and developed planning so that a reopened rail link would be used. I understand from what I have heard that the report into the feasibility of the reopening of this rail link to east Cork is positive and I would ask the Minister of State, Deputy McDaid, to use his good offices to speed this matter up. It has been going on for quite a number of years. I was elected to this House over five and a half years ago and it was one of the first matters I raised, and it is still ongoing. There have been feasibility studies, reviews and all kinds of other studies since then. The time as come to state whether or not it will reopen, and to move it on from there.</P>
    <P>This issue is linked with the development of Kent Station in Cork. Kent Station is an old station which needs major upgrading and there are safety issues involved. When one gets off the train, there is a drop down to the platform and the intercom on the train advises passengers to be careful. There is a drop of one foot and a gap of one foot, and one must be careful not to fall between the train and the siding. Kent Station needs to be upgraded from a safety point of view and I would argue that should also encompass the reopening of the rail link to east Cork.</P>
    <P>There is significant demand for trains in Cork. People want to use the train rather than drive. More people would use the train if we had the proper facilities but, as the Minister of State said, we will have them next summer.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMcDaid" hpid="Dr. McDaid Dr. McDaid">
      <NameTxt>Dr. McDaid</NameTxt>
      <P>May I clarify that point? There are rail cars and rail carriages. The new rail cars will be operational within the Cork suburban area this summer &ndash; that is what I thought the Deputy was referring to &ndash; but the carriages will not be available until 2005.</P>

      <P>The Minister of State may not be in office in 2005. There might be a change &ndash; one never knows.</P>
      <P>The other related issue to do with rail safety is the need to encourage rail development, which was the point with which I began, from the point of view of environmental protection. The more people we get on trains and out of cars, the less pollution there will be. I think that is the case. If it is not, perhaps the Minister of State can say so. It means that there will be less pollution and less stress. I welcome the progress in Dublin on the development of the Luas, metro, etc. I look forward to that process speeding up and to the day we will see these new important services in operation.</P>
      <P>I also welcome the reference to heritage railways in the Bill. That is an important part of our heritage. From a tourism point of view, the development of heritage railways would be useful. There are parts of the old rail network lying idle all over the country. If we can encourage even voluntary groups to open those up and use them for short periods, it would be useful for tourism and would be welcome. Perhaps the Minister of State would tell us if the Government has a policy in this area and if it has identified any sections of railway which might be used in the near future.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanBoyle" hpid="Mr. Boyle Mr. Boyle">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boyle</NameTxt>
      <P>This House should be concerned with the notion of rail safety and we should welcome any legislation that purports to bring that about. It is fair to say that rail safety is of a higher standard than road safety. There is an onus on many of us in public life to constantly promote the message that it is safer to travel by rail than by private motor car. The still appalling road death statistics year-on-year would seem to indicate that is the case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are of course incidents in our folk memory of when rail safety standards were not as they should have been. The appalling disasters at Buttevant and Cherryville Junction spring to mind. Thankfully such events have happened <Col N="1376" /> infrequently and have not been repeated on a regular basis.</P>
    <P>However, there is a catalogue of incidents of a more minor nature, some of which are even comical, such as runaway engines in railway stations and minor derailments. There are also accidents external to the rail network itself. The sad death of Sr. Joan Bowles, a well regarded community working in Limerick city, at a manned railway crossing in Limerick last year need not have happened. There is still too great a reliance on these types of crossings within our rail network and I would hope that the Government would not only promote the idea of an independent agency to highlight and prevent incidents of that nature, but also put in place infrastructure which would do away with the need for manned railway crossings.</P>
    <P>It is worth noting that when the railway network was developed in the 19th century we reached a stage where Ireland had proportionately the most heavily railed network in the world. We dismantled that piece by piece in the 20th century. Sometimes that has been presented politically as something of which we should be proud. There are stories told of Tod Andrews meeting a delegation from west Cork to discuss why the west Cork railway was being closed. He challenged them on how they travelled to Dublin and, as they had travelled by car, then asked: &ldquo;Why is the railway not being closed?&rdquo;  The fact is that story was never told in its proper context. People used the easiest method of getting to their destination because the existing rail service was deliberately run down, and we have seen examples of that ever since.</P>
    <P>There has no extension of rail services in the past 30 years. There have been efforts to get back on track, if the House will pardon the pun, in terms of the quality of the existing network, and they have to be welcomed, but much of that was necessary. We are engaging in a high profile and costly exercise of introducing continuous welded track throughout the country but if we did not do that, we would not have a rail system on even our existing network.</P>
    <P>The Government has failed to say where it will provide extra services, in terms of extra trains running on the existing tracks or the reopening of the tracks which exist elsewhere. When I see that happening my party and I will start to believe that the Government is serious about rail as an alternative to road transport.</P>
    <P>We can even see this in the levels of funding that the Government has put aside in the now discredited national development plan in terms of transport in general. The road to rail ratio in the NDP was 2:1. As a result of Government decisions which have been made subsequently, that ratio has further increased in favour of roads and against rail. It is now 3:1. The Minister of State can check the figure with his colleagues if he wishes. That is the reality.</P>
    <P>Even in the case of the money put aside for rail in NDP projects, there is an unusual distribution of the sums being spent. Two thirds of that money <Col N="1377" /> is being spent in the greater Dublin region to provide new rail services in the form of the Luas, metro and enhancing the existing DART and suburban rail services. The rest of that money is being spent on the national safety programme. The Government is saying that if we get new rail, it will be in the greater Dublin region. We will not get it outside Dublin. The only thing we can and will do outside Dublin is bring it to a safety standard which it should be at anyway. That sends out the wrong messages with regard to what the Government thinks about rail as a system of transport and how it thinks people in this country should get around. We have a radial system of rail whose spokes radiate from Dublin. If we were serious about rail transport, we would have a circular system where people could get on trains to travel from Cork to Limerick or Galway. That is not possible at present.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. McDaid</NameTxt>
      <P>We have to prioritise. Three projects are costing &euro;800 million of the &euro;1.2 billion available and the port tunnel takes up most of it. Nobody would argue against being able to get from the M50 to Dublin Port in six or seven minutes through the port tunnel. That is what we want.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanBoyle" hpid="Mr. Boyle Mr. Boyle">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boyle</NameTxt>
      <P>We have put forward an argument against the port tunnel. The incident that compromised rail safety in recent weeks as a result of work on the port tunnel means there are questions as to why that is being done and what it will achieve. The port tunnel is a good example. If even a partial diversion of the spend on roads and roads projects was made into a better and enhanced rail system, it would be a better use of public money. There is no argument against that in economic terms. The money is there but the Government has chosen, and been supported by other parties in the House both in and out of government, to pursue a policy where roads are deemed to be several times more important than rail. When legislation is introduced relating to rail safety people should be made aware that rail is a Cinderella service and that safety is to be provided not because it enhances the service but because there is a moral responsibility to do so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government continues to send out wrong messages about people living outside the greater Dublin area having the option of transferring from road vehicles to rail. Even where the services exist there is such a wide variety in the quality that it further compromises the willingness of people to adopt the rail system and generates questions about its safety. Members have referred to the quality of the Sligo and Westport services. I am relatively fortunate to be from Cork South-Central because it has the pre-eminent rail service in the State. However, even with that service <Col N="1378" /> it takes two and a half hours to travel 160 miles which, in international terms, is relatively slow. Nevertheless, it is a good, comfortable and safe service. The priority of the Government should be that all rail services should be of that standard. However, I do not see that as a priority.</P>
    <P>The establishment of an agency that is independent and will monitor, inspect and bring about better standards is a good thing and the Government will be supported on it. There are fears however that, given the debate taking place at present over whether the State company responsible for public transport in this country needs to be broken up into component parts, this might be the thin end of the wedge. Once there is an independent agency, what is to stop the model that has been pursued so horrendously in Britain being adopted in Ireland? Will there be a separate company with responsibility for the rail track, a separate company with responsibility for the train stock, separate companies with responsibility for different rail lines and services on them, a Dublin train service and a train service outside Dublin, in the same way as CIE has been broken up into different companies?</P>
    <P>This is the Government's mindset. I was a member of the public transport partnership forum and I am aware of the nature of the debates that have been taking place for several years in the Department of Transport and, formerly, the Department of Public Enterprise. That debate refers to efficiencies through competition, the ultimate fallacy in terms of public transport, especially public transport that is based on safety. If one wants a public transport system in which people can have confidence and which is fully integrated, the last thing one needs is a competition model where the companies that are providing the transport are competing with each other on cost grounds. They are constantly looking at profit margins and how they can be increased by compromising, where possible, on essential spending such as safety.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMcDaid" hpid="Dr. McDaid Dr. McDaid">

    <Speaker pid="DanBoyle" hpid="Mr. Boyle Mr. Boyle">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boyle</NameTxt>
      <P>We can talk about models. For example, the French model is unified but the management is put out to contract every several years. Perhaps it is the system of management used in public transport that will improve its quality. My party strongly believes that any attempt to bring about the nonsense of competing public transport companies and systems, while pretending it is possible to have an integrated system that will have the public's confidence and will be safe, will not happen. It is never-never land politics. This Bill, while it deals with an important aspect of that debate, introduces elements we should be aware of and that we should not let develop to a further extent.</P>

      <P>That is the same argument that was used in Britain. It was said that one was track, one was rolling stock, one was geographically based, one was providing services in the south-west and one was providing services to the north-east. Any service that is provided can be broken up in those terms. Imagine if that logic was applied to the health service. Why not have competing services for pediatrics, geriatrics and oncology? A critical mass is needed in the provision of vital public services. The idea of breaking them up into small components so they can be sold to the highest bidder, who then uses them for commercial gain, does not serve the public good. The Government must be made to understand that.</P>
      <P>Other elements that have been mentioned include the rail network that is not in use for freight or passengers, although we would argue it should be. Mention has been made of heritage rail. On one level it would be good to see such lines being put back in use. They would have a tourism value. However, I would counsel against that. If lines can be used for that purpose, that is fine but we should not let a potential extension of the rail network become some type of theme park. The idea of our railways being run into the ground so we can have playthings for tourists who come to our country for three months in the year is not something we should be trying to promote. The Minister's county is the only county in the country without a rail track but historically it would have had lines from Derry to Dungloe. I have heard that said in the past.</P>
      <P>My family is also from Donegal and I do not see why there should not be a rail connection from Dungloe to Derry and a connection to an all-Ireland grid.</P>

      <P>The poverty of thinking in transport policy is the Government's biggest flaw. There are vested interests. The people who have a roads-biased policy are the people who benefit from the existence of roads. They have managed to capture the debate and deprave the language to such an extent that we build roads and the subsequent expenditure for repairs is not seen as a subsidy. However, we also build rail but every subsequent penny spent on the system or any other form of public transport is seen as a subsidy. If we are not even accounting for that money properly, how are people to know what the true comparisons are? The cost of building a stretch of road is many times more than the cost of building the same length of rail. The cost of maintaining a length of rail is many times less than the cost of maintaining a similar stretch of road. If the Government is serious about public expenditure, it cannot allow these inconsistencies to continue.</P>
      <P>My party will support the establishment of an agency but we will put down a marker about the broader agenda of breaking up the public transport company into competing interests.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1380" /> We do not believe this will serve the public good or consumer interests, nor will it strengthen consumer confidence in the safety of public transport. If that is what the Bill intends to do, the everyday reality of Government policy is working very much against it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DinnyMcGinley" hpid="Mr. McGinley Mr. McGinley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGinley</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure the Minister of State, Deputy McDaid, is wondering what prompts me to speak on the Railway Safety Bill 2001. Deputy Boyle suggested that Donegal is probably the only county in Ireland without a rail service, but I think the same is true of the county, Monaghan, in which the Ceann Comhairle lives.</P>
      <P>The Bill deals with an important subject. Anything to do with safety while travelling is very much in everyone's interest. Those of us who have to depend entirely on the road network to travel know the importance of safety. The Minister for Transport has initiated a fairly successful road safety campaign over the past few months and I credit him and the Minister of State, Deputy McDaid, for that. The campaign is yielding some positive results in terms of a reduction in fatalities in the few months since it was introduced. It is only right, proper, logical and practical that a rail safety campaign be run in conjunction with what is happening on the roads. It is an opportune time to introduce a Bill of this kind.</P>
      <P>The main purpose of the Bill is the establishment of an independent railway safety commission, which will be made up of between one and three members. I do not know how a commission of one would operate, so I assume there will eventually be three members. I presume that one of the three will serve as chairperson. Will the chairperson be appointed by the Minister or will it be a collective decision of the commission? The main responsibility of the new commission, according to the Bill, is the maintenance of safety for passengers. As other speakers have noted, we have, thankfully, had relatively few serious rail accidents in this country in recent years. Nevertheless, we can never relax our vigilance. If the Bill is going to improve the situation, it is certainly welcome.</P>
      <P>We read about horrific rail tragedies in other countries, including those on the underground and rail networks in Britain in recent years. There have been tragedies in Europe and many other parts of the world. We have a responsibility to do everything possible to avoid such accidents in this country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I cannot recall the last occasion I had an opportunity to use the rail system in this country, but I do recall using the system in England. The Minister of State, Deputy McDaid, would understand that rail travel is not feasible for those leaving Donegal to travel elsewhere in the country. If one wants to travel to Dublin by rail, one must first travel to Derry and then pass through Belfast and other parts of the country. The trip takes the best part of a day. The same is true for Sligo. We have all heard from Deputies in Sligo and Leitrim about the condition of the line to the west. It <Col N="1381" /> takes almost as much time to get from Sligo to Dublin by rail today as it did when the railway was established well over 100 years ago.</P>
    <P>The commission will have a great deal of responsibility and has much ground to make up. It will be responsible for the quality of the rolling stock, including heating, seating, restaurant refreshments and so on. Hardly a week goes by without one reading in the newspapers of the bad experiences of rail passengers. I read an article recently about a passenger travelling from, I believe, Tralee to Cork who indicated that they had encountered Third World conditions on the train. Much is left to be desired in terms of the quality of what is provided for passengers at present.</P>
    <P>It is no wonder that there are greater demands than ever upon the road network. There have been vast improvements to that network, but when I, like the Minister of State, travel from Donegal to Dublin, the journey still takes as long, despite the improvements to the N2 and A3, because the volume of traffic has increased. People do not see the railway system as a viable or acceptable alternative.</P>
    <P>I referred earlier to the situation in my county. I am glad the Minister of State is present because he lives in the county and knows what is happening there and how much people suffer both in terms of access to the county and access between places within it. It is a peripheral county and depends greatly on access for industry, for the people of the county and for the development of tourism and other services. In last week's allocation for non-national roads Donegal received &euro;25 million. However, following a question tabled in the Dáil in recent days, it was revealed that when the allocation is measured per kilometre, Donegal came only 12th in the country. In a county without rail or, at present, even an air service, a higher priority should be given to a road network upon which we are completely dependent.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State is probably aware of a renewed interest in assessing the feasibility of reopening some of the old rail networks in various parts of the county. He is also probably aware that this was raised at Donegal County Council in recent weeks and that a motion was passed. All councillors, including those from the Minister of State's party, were in favour of investigating the feasibility of opening a number of rail links from Letterkenny &ndash; his home town &ndash; to other parts of the county, including, in particular, the town of Burtonport. I understand that the council has established an in-house planning committee, made up of engineers, council employees and others, to examine the feasibility of doing something along these lines.</P>
    <P>It is possible to reopen rail lines in Donegal. I visited Fort William in the north of Scotland two or three years ago. I do not know whether the Minister of State has ever been there, but there was a beautiful, very efficient line from Fort William out to Mallaig on the west coast. One can <Col N="1382" /> take the train from Fort William to Mallaig and then get the ferry to the Isle of Skye and have a very pleasant day there. If one does not feel like coming back on the ferry, one can cross the new bridge by public transport. That is just an indication of what can be done. I understand that line has been reopened in recent years, so it is possible.</P>
    <P>When it comes to counties like Donegal, where old rail lines are still in existence, it is important to maintain these routes and not let them be developed or discarded. The lines should be retained in the ownership of the State in case, sometime in the future, we are in a position to reopen some of them.</P>
    <P>There is a renewed interest in railways throughout the country.</P>
    <P>Debate adjourned.</P>

      <P>Even though Irish legislation already provides severe penalties for a wide range of sexual offences against children, the penalties are increased from time to time, as occasion requires. Most recently, for example, in the Sex Offenders Act 2001 the maximum prison sentence for sexual assault on a child was raised from five years to 14 years. While the penalties generally for sexual offences, including sexual offences against children, are kept under review, I have no plans to increase them.</P>

      <P>We were all surprised at recent cases, particularly those involving child pornography. I was surprised to discover that the maximum sentence at the District Court for certain offences is only 12 months. I was also surprised that the DPP cannot appeal sentences imposed by the District Court and that fines in these cases are less than &euro;2,000. Judges are left to use the poor box mechanism, which has no statutory basis and is unsatisfactory. Does the Minister think it is satisfactory for judges to do this?</P>
      <P>Crimes can be tried summarily in the District Court or as indictable offences in the Circuit Court, but they never get to the latter. Has the Minister communicated with the Attorney General about this matter?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. McDowell Mr. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>I acknowledge what the Deputy has said. Under the Constitution, all offences must be tried on indictment and before a jury unless they fall into the category of minor <Col N="1383" /> offences. The jurisprudence regarding what is or is not a minor offence is long established. Two things must happen in the case of an offence that can be tried either summarily or on indictment. In nearly every case, the DPP has to decide to try it as a minor offence and the District Court judge must decline jurisdiction unless he or she is satisfied that it is also a minor offence.</P>
      <P>The prosecution of offences is not a matter for the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform. Once an offence is prosecutable, the preliminary decision as to whether it falls into the category of a minor offence is entirely the decision of the DPP, to be made as an independent officer exercising constitutional functions. Once legislation says an offence can be tried in either way, the DPP is given the choice in how he will ask for it to be tried. Thereafter, he must also persuade the judge of the District Court in question that it is a case suitable for summary trial. That is a matter for the judge and I have no influence in it.</P>
      <P>If this House creates an offence that can be tried either way, it cannot thereafter ask the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform why offences are being tried summarily. This is not a matter for the Minister to become involved in.</P>
      <P>Maximum sentences available for sexual offences are, I believe, the most severe in the European Union and they are certainly more severe than in Britain. Rape, rape under section 4 of the 1990 Act, aggravated sexual assault, unlawful carnal knowledge of females under 15 years of age, buggery with a person under 15 years of age &ndash; regardless of whether or not it was an assault &ndash; and child trafficking for purposes of sexual exploitation all carry sentences of life imprisonment. Unlawful carnal knowledge, namely, having sexual intercourse with a girl between 15 and 17 years of age in circumstances that would not amount to ordinary rape, carries a sentence of five years for the first conviction and ten for any subsequent conviction and the same applies to buggery with people in the same age group in areas where consent is not an issue. Taking a child for the purpose of sexual exploitation, allowing a child to be used for the purposes of child pornography and producing or distributing child pornography all carry maximum sentences of 14 years. Possession of child pornography carries a maximum sentence of five years. Sexual assault on a child carries a maximum sentence of 14 years, while a sexual assault on an adult carries a sentence of ten years.</P>

      <P>The current actual strength of the Garda Síochána stands at approximately 11,900. The Cabinet has authorised me to make the greatest possible use of the existing capacity of the Garda training college over the next two years to bring the strength of the force to 12,200, which is its current authorised maximum strength. While it will not be possible to increase numbers beyond that point for as long as the cap on public service numbers remains in place, the current level represents an all-time record level of strength for the force.</P>
      <P>I am committed to supporting the Garda Síochána in every way possible in tackling crime, not only through increasing Garda numbers but also by facilitating and promoting change and reform &ndash; both within the force and in the criminal justice system in general &ndash; aimed at meeting the challenges of present day crime. I am, for example, finalising proposals for legislative change to significantly improve Garda powers of criminal investigation, and I already have before this House a Bill to improve the law on public order. I also believe the increased use of technology can free up resources and enhance efficiency and effectiveness. The PULSE system has already made a significant contribution to Garda effectiveness, but I believe there is considerable potential for greater use of technology across the range of criminal justice agencies. I intend to announce a development in this regard in the near future.</P>
      <P>There is a range of factors that determine the effectiveness of the criminal justice system. I will not be content with raising the strength of the Garda Síochána to an historic high of 12,200. This figure will rise again, as soon as budgetary circumstances permit, so that the Government to make progress towards the target of 14,000 provided in the programme for Government for achievement by 2007. I want those resources, and the resources of the entire criminal justice system, used effectively to combat crime. I hope and believe I will have the support of the House for the measures I will be bringing forward to achieve that.</P>

      <P>The Minister has, as usual, simply avoided the question and waffled on about other matters. What happened to the commitments of his party, Fianna Fáil and those contained in the programme for Government to recruit an additional 2,000 gardaí? When this matter was last discussed, it was against a background of an alarming rise in crime figures that had shown a 93% increase in violent crimes and an all-time high of 62 homicides in a year. Matters have deteriorated considerably in the interim. Does <Col N="1385" /> the Minister agree that Limerick was under siege for a full week and that the entire country was in the grip of terror with gangland feuding that had run out of control? When the Minister of State said there was no problem in that there were plenty of resources, the Minister eventually had to bring in the emergency response unit. Likewise, in relation to Shannon, the policing was not adequate and the Minister had to bring in the Army.</P>

      <P>The Garda authorities have informed me that they are at present carrying out a study into illegal drug use and associated crime and this will give us a clearer picture in relation to the trends of drug misuse. I will be happy to inform the House of the outcome of that study when it is completed. In the meantime I can inform the House that, while there is no evidence to suggest any increase in the overall level of heroin use, cocaine seizures &ndash; as well as heroin seizures &ndash; have increased substantially, particularly last year. The Garda authorities have expressed concern at the apparent increase in cocaine use, especially in the Dublin city area.</P>
      <P>There are indications that some of what have been referred to as gangland murders are linked to the drugs trade. I am aware of the public concern about these murders and the House will be aware that I recently met the Garda Commissioner and other senior Garda personnel to discuss crimes which might be put into the category of gangland or organised crime. I am completely satisfied that the necessary resources, both operational and financial, are being directed towards the containment and detection of such crimes.</P>
      <P>My primary responsibility in relation to the drugs strategy, which recognises the need for a multifaceted approach to the drugs problem, is in the area of supply reduction. The objectives of the strategy in this regard are to reduce significantly the volume of illicit drugs available as well as to reduce access to all drugs among young people. In this context, I welcome the major successes of both the Garda Síochána and customs in terms of seizing drugs. The Garda Síochána policing plan for 2003 includes, as major priorities, the areas of organised crime and ensuring that the objectives of the drugs strategy are met.</P>
      <P>I understand that joint actions by the Garda and the customs service will be an important element in 2003 and beyond. In addition, the increased level of European and other international co-operation will continue.</P>
      <P>As well as all other Members of this House, I am acutely conscious of the deadly menace posed by the activities of drug traffickers and I assure the House that the Government will continue to devote the necessary resources to countering this evil trade.</P>

      <P>What I was trying to establish in tabling this question was the Minister's view on whether a more effective strategy was required in this area, given the increasing number of murders that appear to be associated with drug gangs. There is no indication from his reply that he has anything new to offer in regard to this area or that he even believes there is a need for a new strategy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Does the Minister accept that the most violent criminal gangs are now almost exclusively those involved in drug dealing? Does he further accept that the most effective strategy against such gangs is the strategy employed by the Criminal Assets <Col N="1388" /> Bureau? The Criminal Assets Bureau was set up in the aftermath of the murder of Veronica Guerin and its role &ndash; as I understood it having been one of those who argued for its establishment &ndash; was to target such criminal drug gangs. Since it was set up it appears to have gone all over the place in that it has become involved in dealing with planning corruption, the Real IRA, etc. Is there a need to refocus its attention on these criminal drug gangs to deal in an effective, co-ordinated way with the Garda? I believe there is.</P>
    <P>There is also a case for localising or regionalising the Criminal Assets Bureau in order that it can get to grips with tackling such gang crime without being centralised in Dublin. It could do that in conjunction with a specialised Garda unit, as was effectively employed in aftermath of the murder of Veronica Guerin against the Gilligan gang. The gardaí who came together at that point were effectively used as a specialist Garda unit. They broke up that gang, but now other gangs, although many of them were operating at that time, have come together. Will the Minister take on board the suggestions I made and respond to some of them?</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. McDowell Mr. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Deputy's constructive approach to all these matters. If he has any suggestions which he believes I am missing, I am always open to receiving them.</P>
      <P>In relation to CAB, it was not established exclusively to tackle drug related proceeds of crime but the proceeds of crime generally. It has been extremely effective across a wide range of criminality. I fully agree with the Deputy that at certain levels it is the most effective way of disrupting and indicting the activities of organised crime in relation to drugs.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will be aware that there is a constant pattern of drug importations being accompanied by what I might loosely describe as a &ldquo;goody bag&rdquo; of automatic weapons and the like. This is indicative of the pattern to which the Deputy has referred, which is the ruthless, savage use of murder as a day-to-day side-show in the drugs trade, whether to punish people who default on debts, who lose consignments or who are suspected of informing the authorities. That pattern undoubtedly exists. Given that we are dealing, in some cases, with the underworld, it is very difficult, on occasions, to get reliable witnesses to come forward who will point to the guilty parties.</P>
      <P>The Deputy's suggestion that CAB should be refocused or restructured on a regional basis is a novel one. I have not heard it before. As regards the effectiveness of CAB, I would need to be persuaded that fragmenting it or refocusing it is a good step rather than a bad one. It is internationally acclaimed as a model of its kind. I hope, with my opposite number in Northern Ireland, Jane Kennedy, there will be all-island participation between CAB and the new agency being established in Northern Ireland&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>In November 1997 the Government accepted in principle the recommendations set out in the report of the steering group on the efficiency and effectiveness of the Garda Síochána. That review was conducted in the framework of the strategic management initiative, SMI, throughout the public service. The report contained a number of recommendations requiring a more comprehensive development of issues relating to the organisation, operations, financing, performance and accountability of the Garda Síochána.</P>
      <P>In January 1998 the Government established a new Garda SMI implementation steering group to develop the report's recommendations for implementation. To this end, the bottom-up review group, BURG, was established in 1999 to focus on organisation structures and systems and the deployment of resources and to bring recommendations to the steering group in the areas for which it was responsible. It was also to bring with it the Garda Representative Association and Association of Garda Sergeants and Inspectors to ensure full involvement at all levels in the process of change in the Garda Síochána.</P>
      <P>Since 1999 considerable progress has been made in a major review of the Garda Síochána organisational structures and service delivery. Many projects have been completed and implementation of recommendations approved by the steering group is already under way.</P>
      <P>The report on the National Bureau of Criminal Investigation referred to by the Deputy is part of the third and final phase of the SMI steering group's work programme which is nearing completion. I will bring forward soon a major reforming statute to reorganise the Garda Síochána and its management systems and to provide for a Garda inspectorate. I hope to publish that legislation in the next session of the House after Easter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>With all due respect, I sometimes agree with Deputy Costello that the Minister does not answer the question asked of him. We are talking in this question about organised crime. The recommendations of the report are stark. The report refers to few, if any, members of the Garda Síochána being available for constant, <Col N="1390" /> proactive targeting of organised crime. It has been identified as a key weakness. The report goes on to say that no other part of the Garda Síochána is resourced or tasked to fulfil this role. Considering what has happened in Limerick and elsewhere, surely it has been proven that we need a dedicated unit within the Garda Síochána to deal with organised crime? Will the Minister answer that question?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. McDowell Mr. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy will be aware that reorganisation of the Garda Síochána is about to reach a conclusion. We are in the third and final phase. In that, the exact arrangements for tackling organised crime will be considered as part of the SMI process.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will also be aware, as other Deputies have commented in recent days, that there is a belief within the Garda Síochána that I should not establish a proliferation of specialised units at the heart of the force if the result is that I leave the ordinary rank and file and day to day Garda activity relegated to second class status. I fully accept the point the Deputy makes and it is necessary to adopt different tactics and counter-measures in respect of organised crime. I assure the Deputy that the commissioner and I will, as part of the SMI process and bringing the representative associations with us, discuss the proper basis on which to establish bodies to undertake the struggle against organised crime.</P>
      <P>However, units specialising in, for example, the investigation of drugs crimes or the theft of valuable artefacts already take on organised crime, as does the Criminal Assets Bureau. The point was made strongly in the previous question that organised crime and the drugs trade overlap substantially and that outside that trade organised crime is not seen by many as an independently serious criminal threat. Whether it makes sense to subdivide the battle against organised crime into two discrete categories, one fighting organised crime outside the drugs area and the other within, is a matter for judgment and I want to think carefully on it.</P>
      <P>It is easy to devise a new logo, hold a press conference and announce that I have established a new unit. There is nothing easier to do and there are plenty of public relations men coming to my Department with such proposals. If I am to undertake the battle against the drug pushing confraternity, I do not want to split my forces into two categories: organised crime and organised drug pushing.</P>

      <P>As I have previously informed the House, a special investigation team consisting of a chief superintendent and additional gardaí has been assigned as part of the domestic violence and sexual assault unit to conduct an analytical overview of sexual abuse allegations. This involves reviewing specific cases with a view to seeing whether further lines of inquiry might be available that could lead to preferring criminal charges, pursuing additional evidence and investigating fresh complaints that have come to notice on the dedicated telephone number that has been set up for victims at Harcourt Square.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will be aware that I announced on 3 December last that I would bring forward legislation to provide for a new statutory mechanism for investigations into matters of significant and urgent public importance. While this legislation will have general application, it will provide a mechanism for investigating the allegations of clerical sexual abuse. Work on the preparation of the legislation is under way and I hope to be able to bring detailed proposals to Government within the next few weeks with a view to having the legislation drafted and published as a matter of priority.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have consulted widely on the matter. The proposed legislation will be informed, in the first instance, by public concern over the handling by the Dublin archdiocese of allegations of clerical sexual abuse and by the meetings and useful discussions I have had with victims' organisations, representatives of the Catholic hierarchy, the <Col N="1392" /> Conference of Religious in Ireland, and other affected parties.</P>
    <P>The new procedure could provide a means of examining the systems, practices and structures in place within the Catholic Church for the handling of allegations and complaints as well as the response to such complaints. To do this, it may be sufficient for an investigation to focus on a certain area or region rather than have it covering the State. However, no decisions have yet been made on these issues. The new procedure, if applied to cases of clerical sex abuse, will not replace or interfere with the ordinary processes of the criminal law for the investigation and prosecution of offences.

      <P>This week we received the disturbing information that 15 years ago the bishops took out insurance with Church and General in relation to child sexual abuse in the dioceses and archdioceses, but they have acted in public as though they knew nothing of what was going on at that time. Will the Minister not agree that dealing with this matter is particularly urgent considering that arising out of the settlement in the Mervyn Rundle case, it became obvious there were huge areas of neglect, obstruction and non-co-operation from the highest levels of the church.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Bearing in mind the sweetheart deal done by the Department of Education and Science on behalf of the Government with the religious orders, which seems to have the blessing of the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, and that the State will be exposed to vast sums in indemnification claims, we must deal with this matter most urgently. From the Minister's answer I am not sure there was that sense of urgency in setting up this investigation process and bringing it into a legislative framework. It should have been possible for the Minister to work in the context of the High Court inspectors set up under <Col N="1393" /> the Companies Act. He should have been able to make a quick modification to that legislation so that we do not have to wait for an indefinite period when these proposals, with which I agree, would commence.</P>

      <P>When I last took questions in the House, I indicated I would take my time to bring forward proposals to deal with non-tribunal forms of inquiry on a general basis and not simply establish a specific vehicle for inquiring into the matters about which the Deputy has spoken. When considering general matters of this kind, it takes somewhat longer. However, I assure the Deputy that the heads of the Bill have been prepared in my Department. They have been prepared to a very high quality and have been sent for consultation to other Departments. Within the next couple of weeks, I hope to bring them before the Government for approval. They will then be put in the hands of the parliamentary counsel so that I can, as soon as possible, publish the legislation. It will not be confined to the issue about which the Deputy has spoken, but will introduce a new form of non-tribunal type inquiry that will be open to the State to use in circumstances where tribunals will be inappropriate, excessively expensive or likely to bring matters into the public domain which might be better investigated other than by the public adversarial trial process, which sometimes seems to characterise tribunals.</P>

Whereas that has attractions, not least to anybody in charge of the security of the State, there is another side to the story. Great democracies, such as the United States, Canada, New Zealand, Australia, Britain and Ireland, which share the common law system, have always regarded the mandatory carrying of an identity card as something which fundamentally alters the relationship of the citizen to the state. It creates a different relationship between the police and the citizen and is something on which we will all have to reflect long and hard before making it mandatory for everyone to carry identification.

      <P>asked the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform his views on diversion and other programmes aimed at diverting younger people away from crime and anti-social activities; the funding available; his plans for the further development of such programmes; and if he will make a statement on the matter. [2893/03]</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. McDowell Mr. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>The most significant criminal justice interventions directed at diverting young people from crime and anti-social behaviour are the Garda juvenile diversion programme and the Garda youth diversion projects. The Deputy will <Col N="1396" /> appreciate that there are two distinct elements to the issue. In stating this, I understand by &ldquo;diversion&rdquo; the process of preventing young people from entering the formal criminal justice system in the first place. If and when criminal prosecution and conviction occur, there are many interventions in place designed to prevent reoffending, particularly those provided by the probation and welfare service, but these measures are considered to be of a different nature to the subject matter of the question.</P>
      <P>The Garda juvenile diversion programme provides that, in certain circumstances, a juvenile under 18 years of age who freely accepts responsibility for a criminal incident may be cautioned as an alternative to prosecution. The Children Act 2001 placed this programme on a statutory footing and the relevant sections of the Act were commenced in May 2002.</P>
      <P>The programme has proved to be highly successful in diverting young people away from crime by offering guidance and support to juveniles and their families. In the more serious cases, juveniles are placed under the supervision of Garda juvenile liaison officers, who are specially trained members of the Garda Síochána responsible for administering the programme at the local level.</P>
      <P>Part 4 of the Children Act 2001 introduced the concepts of restorative justice, specifically restorative cautioning and restorative conferencing to the juvenile diversion programme. Essentially, these provisions provide for the inclusion, where appropriate and possible, of the victim, the juvenile's family and the wider stakeholding community in the process of diversion.</P>
      <P>In addition to the Garda juvenile diversion programme, there are 64 Garda youth diversion projects in place. These projects are broader in concept. They form part of a community based, multiagency crime prevention initiative which seeks to divert young persons from becoming involved or further involved in anti-social and/or criminal behaviour by providing suitable activities to facilitate personal development, promote civic responsibility and improve long-term employability prospects. The Deputy will appreciate that such a programme operates in the Youghal area.</P>
      <P>
        <i>Additional information.</i>On the basis of commissioned evaluations of the Garda youth diversion projects, my Department, in conjunction with the Garda Síochána and other key stakeholders, is in the process of finalising comprehensive guidelines for the establishment, operation, management and administration of projects. It is anticipated that these guidelines will act as a benchmark against which applications for new projects will be assessed and against which existing projects will be evaluated on an ongoing basis. I expect the guidelines will be launched in the coming months.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As the Deputy may be aware, recent years have seen a dramatic increase in the number of these projects, from 12 in 1997 to 64 at present, a <Col N="1397" /> process made possible, in part, by funding under the National Development Plan, 2000-2006. The locations of the new projects were decided upon according to local needs, prioritised by the Garda authorities, in conjunction with my Department. Funding of &euro;5.577 million has been allocated to these and related projects in the current year.</P>
    <P>In summary, the Garda authorities and I remain strongly committed to the principle and practice of diversion in the criminal justice system, a commitment warranted by consistent findings of national and international criminological research. Although the Garda juvenile diversion programme and the Garda youth diversion projects are not appropriate for all juveniles or in all circumstances, they nevertheless provide an important intervention in the lives of those juveniles who have taken a wrong turn in the process of maturing into young adults. Moreover, research indicates that of all those formally diverted from prosecution, some 87.5% do not come to the attention of the Garda Síochána again before their eighteenth birthday.</P>

      <P>Does the Minister agree that we do not have a proper youth service? How much money has been made available to the two programmes in question? Perhaps the Minister did not reach that part of the original question. How many young people are currently engaged in these programmes?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. McDowell Mr. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>The phrase &ldquo;proper youth service&rdquo; carries with it its own questions. I have to reserve judgment as to whether we need such a generalised service. On the issue of funding, &euro;5.577 million was allocated to these and related projects in the current year. The peak of offending among juveniles is between 15 and 16 years of age. I agree with the implication of the Deputy's point that this is a good investment when compared to the classic way of dealing with these offences in the Children's Court.</P>
      <P>I draw the Deputy's attention to Garda youth diversion projects under the RAPID initiative. In Dublin, for instance, in 2002, &euro;1.488 million was spent on local youth diversion and drug task force projects and in the Limerick area, some &euro;339,000 was spent in 2002. Unfortunately, efforts to extend the project to certain areas of Cork have been adversely affected by the current cap on public service recruitment. Nevertheless, I am examining ways to get around this difficulty.</P>

      <P>Does the Minister accept the strong connection between alcohol abuse and anti-social behaviour? On the question of early intervention, the earlier one intervenes with children from dysfunctional and crisis families, the better it is for all concerned. By the time many <Col N="1398" /> such children reach 12 or 13 years of age, the damage has already been done and they have been lost. Will the Minister give strong support to projects such as Breaking the Cycle in primary schools?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. McDowell Mr. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>I strongly support the projects to which the Deputy refers. I also accept that there is a linkage between alcohol consumption and premature access to alcohol and a considerable amount of juvenile criminality.</P>
      <P>To return to Deputy Stanton's supplementary question, every year between 8,000 and 9,000 juveniles are dealt with under the programmes &ndash; I do not have an exact figure for each year &ndash; whereas probably fewer than 1,000 juveniles per annum are convicted in the courts. Effectively, this means that of 10,000 offenders recorded annually, 80% to 90% are dealt with in the juvenile diversion and youth diversion schemes.</P>

      <P>The person referred to by the Deputy has been serving a life sentence for murder since January 1983. His case was considered by the interim parole board in July 2002. The board's recommendation in the case was subsequently received in my office on 13 August 2002. As is fairly acknowledged by the Deputy in his question, I publicly expressed my wish to refer the interim parole board's recommendation in the case to a ministerial colleague for consideration, arising from the fact that I had previous dealings in the matter. I sought and have received advice from the Attorney General on the practical arrangements to give effect to this. Having considered this advice, I intend to have the necessary arrangements made for the delegation to a Minister of State in my Department of the power to make a decision in the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I ask for further clarification. I presume the Minister has delegated power in this matter to the Minister of State in his Department from Limerick. When did he do this and when does he expect the Minister of State to give an answer on the matter? If that answer is a recommendation for release, will the Minister accept it?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. McDowell Mr. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>The position is that either I deal with the matter or I do not. We cannot have a position in which such power is delegated in a yo-yo like manner, in the sense that I would be free to pull it back into my hand depending on the outcome of the process. If I am to stand aside from the process, I have to do so categorically. In order for me to vest my functions in a Minister <Col N="1399" /> or Minister of State, a decision by the Government is required under, I believe, the Ministers and Secretaries (Amendment) Acts, delegating my function in the matter to a Minister or Minister of State.</P>
      <P>I have been examining a number of possibilities, one of which was that prior to leaving the country the next time I go on holidays, in which case my functions would be delegable to another member of Government. In any event, I would arrange that the matter be brought before the Minister or Minister of State in question.</P>

      <P>Unfortunately, I am so busy working on behalf of the people that there would be an undue delay. The second possibility was to advise the Government that I intended to take no part in the deliberation and seek its advice on it, but such action would be fraught with difficulty. I have asked a Minister of State in my Department to deal with the matter, which is the best way to proceed. In terms of when it will be done, that will be as soon as I have put together a memorandum for Government to authorise the delegation of my power in this respect to the Minister of State. Deputy O'Dea, one of the Ministers of State in my Department, has indicated that he is prepared to take responsibility for the matter.</P>

      <P>I am aware of the newspaper reports to which the Deputy refers and other similar articles and I fully understand why, on the basis of those reports, the Deputy has tabled the question. From a law enforcement perspective, however, what is required in order to take action against either individuals or organisations is evidence that will stand up in a court of law.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am advised by the Garda authorities that while they are also aware of the report to which Deputy Bruton refers, they do not have specific intelligence to substantiate reports that illegal organisations are involved in the activities to which the Deputy refers. However, individuals with connections to these organisations are <Col N="1400" /> strongly suspected of being involved in these activities for personal gain.</P>
    <P>While it is not possible to put a figure on the number of arms held by the organisation in question, the Deputy will be aware that the Decommissioning Act 1997 and the regulations made under it provide for the decommissioning of such arms. I look forward to further and substantial progress in this regard.</P>
    <P>As regards the final part of Deputy Bruton's question, in the Good Friday Agreement, Sinn Féin and other parties committed themselves to exclusively democratic and peaceful means of resolving differences on political issues. In addition, Sinn Féin reaffirmed its opposition to any use or threat of force by others for any political purpose, whether in regard to the Agreement or otherwise. I believe the leadership of Sinn Féin remains committed to that course.</P>

It states that while the NBCI has a small surveillance unit, it is not sufficient to meet the needs of existing investigations and future needs for the targeting of organised criminals. What we have is a reactive, not a proactive, police force. The resources are not being put in place to deal with organised crime and criminals. Will the Minister answer that question?</P>

      <P>The Deputy is beating a different drum from that being beaten by Deputy Bruton in his question. Deputy Bruton asked about particular newspaper reports concerning the activities of alleged members of the IRA and the amount of arms and material at its disposal. In relation to that particular organisation and the threat which it and other subversive organisations pose to this society, the Garda has a long-established, proactive and detailed response, with which I need not deal here. To suggest that the force is not addressing the issue of the security threat to this State is not true. The Garda has an effective, proactive, intelligence-based approach to subversive crime in this country.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnDeasyFG" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">

      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>The Garda Síochána is operating at an all-time high. In relation to these organisations, it is putting all the resources the Garda Commissioner regards as necessary into countering the subversive threat to this State. The Commissioner has not indicated to me that he requires extra resources in this area and I have no reason to believe he does. Deputies from all <Col N="1401" /> parties in this House &ndash; perhaps even all parties in general &ndash; will welcome the huge strides made in countering subversion and, in particular, the huge successes that have been scored against dissidents in the republican movement who have attempted to use this country as a base for murderous and cowardly violence in Northern Ireland.</P>

      <askee>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform</askee>
      <Quest>the steps being taken to reduce the cost of keeping a prisoner in Portlaoise Prison which is now in excess of ?177,000 per year.</Quest>
      <QRef>[2907/03]</QRef>
    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. McDowell Mr. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>The high cost of keeping a prisoner in Portlaoise Prison arises primarily because of the security nature of that prison. Security considerations there require a higher staff to prisoner ratio. The cost is of the order of &euro;177,000 per year per prisoner, based on 2001 figures. The 2002 figures will not be available until the completion of the 2002 Appropriation Accounts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The average costs for Portlaoise Prison also reflect the general cost burden created through the older structures in some of our prison facilities. It is proposed, when finances permit, to modernise this facility under the prison service build<Col N="1402" /> ing programme and this development will include the use of new technologies, a building management system and other developments in operational security to decrease the amount of staff necessary to operate the prison.</P>
    <P>The Prison Service is committed to addressing the issue of costs across all prisons, particularly in relation to the question of overtime. On that question, the Minister for Finance is currently considering proposals from me for a negotiation with the relevant interests in the Prison Service for a new approach to the question of prison officers' overtime.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>This new approach to overtime in the prison system was taken on a number of occasions and nothing happened. That is one element.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. McDowell Mr. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I will watch the space, but I hope I do not have to listen because I appear to be listening to the Minister for waffle. If the new approach is anything like the commitment to provide 2,000 extra gardaí, which has just been reneged on, we will certainly watch the space.</P>
      <P>The cost of keeping a single prisoner in Portlaoise in 2001 was &euro;177,400, and that figure will have escalated for 2002. The average cost per prisoner throughout the country is &euro;79,000, or at least that was the figure in 2001. That figure of &euro;177,400 is the equivalent of half the total amount the Minister quoted in his reply to Question No. 8 that was spent on youth diversionary programmes in the city of Limerick. A total of &euro;339,000 was the amount spent on that area. The cost of keeping two people in Portlaoise would have provided the entire budget for all the youth diversionary programmes in the city of Limerick. The figure of &euro;177,400 is an extraordinary expenditure for a poor return.</P>
      <P>We imprison three times the number of people imprisoned in Wales and England and four times the number incarcerated in Scandinavia. Will the Minister consider introducing the proposals of the reintegration of offenders programme which was presented to the Joint Committee on Justice, Equality, Defence and Women's Rights? That would provide a wide range of alternatives such as non-custodial sentences plus the maximisation of the sentence. The recidivist rate is 70% at present, which means this is a terrible waste of money.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. McDowell Mr. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy seems to forget he is talking about Portlaoise jail and that its prisoners are maximum security prisoners. I agree with the Deputy and I echo his description of the cost of keeping prisoners in jail as exorbitant. I intend doing something about it. However, alternatives to custody are not appropriate in the cases of people currently in Portlaoise, nor are diversion schemes. There is one diversion scheme <Col N="1403" /> which would be of huge help regarding most inmates of Portlaoise and that is an end to subversion in the country. If there was an end to subversion the need for a maximum security prison with such high levels of security would be eliminated.</P>
      <P>I agree fully with the Deputy that some of our prisons seem to cost enormous amounts of money compared with others, and &euro;177,000 for Portlaoise compares with a general figure of &euro;78,000 across the service. However, particular circumstances in Portlaoise regarding the level of security required and the design of the prison mean that the cost of maintaining prisoners there is higher. The Deputy will remember that there are not just subversive prisoners in Portlaoise, there are also high security organised crime figures housed there and regrettably, alternatives to custody are simply out of the question in that regard.</P>

Will he give a breakdown of the costs of keeping prisoners in other prisons, which cost an average of &euro;78,000? I know there are salaries and overtime involved but there must be other issues involved also.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. McDowell Mr. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>The figure of &euro;177,000 for Portlaoise involves putting together all the costs expended by the Irish Prison Service in maintaining the jail and dividing into that sum the average number of prisoners in the institution. That yields &euro;177,000 as a result. Across the Prison Service generally, when one divides the number of inmates into the cost of the institutions the amount is between &euro;75,000 and &euro;80,000. The majority of expenditure has nothing to do with the costs of the buildings themselves but relates to variables such as food, clothing, light, heating and the massive component of prison officers' wages and overtime. If the Deputy wants me to inquire further into the precise calculations regarding Portlaoise, subject to security requirements I will be happy to write her a letter setting them out.</P>

      <P>As I stated in my reply to Parliamentary Question No. 75 of 27 November 2002, the Report of the Committee to Review the Offences against the State Acts 1939 to 1998 is an extensive one, deals with complex issues of law and policy and involves important considerations concerning the balance to be struck between national and international security on the one hand and civil liberties and individual rights on the other.</P>
      <P>Those recommendations in the report of direct relevance to the purpose and scope of the Criminal Justice (Terrorist Offences) Bill 2002 were considered in the context of the preparation of that legislation.

      <P>As I said yesterday, the Good Friday Agreement made provision for a process to try to normalise criminal legislation here. In that context we were looking specifically at emergency legislation such as the Offences Against the State Act, juryless courts and so on. The intention under the Agreement would have been to ensure greater normalisation of legislation of that nature between the North and the Republic. However, with the terrorist legislation we are going in the opposite direction if anything. I understand that the majority on the committee which recommended the <i>status quo</i> was made up of civil servants from the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, while it was the law officers who recommended normalising the situation.

I regard special courts as a phenomenon which should be avoided if at all possible. <Col N="1405" /> However, I reiterate that the Good Friday Agreement sought a normalisation of the courts procedures north and south of the Border. In the fullness of time I intend to bring before the House arrangements to strengthen jury trials as I want to make juries and witnesses less susceptible to being intimidated and tampered with. In the meantime, the greatest single factor obstructing the normalisation of the administration of justice in Ireland is the continuing subversive threat. If we are talking about completion of the Good Friday Agreement, the greatest contribution would be an end to the subversive threat from all of those who have arms dumped or who, in dissident form, are attacking the foundations of the State and attempting to re-ignite a civil war in Northern Ireland. Unfortunately, as long as those factors are at play it is difficult for me, an inveterate supporter of jury trial, to normalise the situation as quickly as I would wish.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. McDowell Mr. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>The programme for Government contains a commitment to establish an independent Garda inspectorate which would have the power to investigate complaints and the powers of an ombudsman. Work on the preparation of a general scheme of a Bill to provide for this is well advanced and I intend bringing this to Government in the near future with a view to publication later this year.</P>
      <P>I am aware of the Human Rights Commission's views on this matter and I carefully studied its proposals for a police ombudsman published last December. I am pleased the commission welcomes the proposed inspectorate, but I note that its view is that an ombudsman would represent a more effective complaints mechanism.</P>
      <P>The commission will have the opportunity to examine my proposals in greater detail as soon as I obtain the approval of the Government for the drafting of the Bill. I have already made it clear to the commission that I will refer the matter to it in accordance with the terms of section 8(<i>b</i>) of the Human Rights Commission Act 2000. I might, however, even at this stage make one or two points which I hope will go some way towards addressing the commission's concerns.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>First, the Government commitment to give the inspectorate the powers of an ombudsman will be <Col N="1406" /> reflected in my proposals. Without going into too much detail at this stage, I intend the inspectorate to have comprehensive powers of investigation, fully equal to those that might be given to an ombudsman, so that any distinction would be more of nomenclature than of substance. It is true that I envisage the inspectorate comprising perhaps three persons, supported by appropriate staff rather than simply one person as would be the case with an ombudsman, but I am not sure how this could raise any difficulty of principle.</P>
    <P>A second and equally important point is that the principal concern of the commission over the inspectorate may arise from a misunderstanding of the proposal. The concern of the commission is that the proposed dual role of the inspectorate, whereby it will examine not only complaints but also Garda practices and procedures, is or at least could be inherently incompatible. The commission, in coming to this view, assumes that the role of the inspectorate in examining practices and procedures will be broadly similar to the role of the British Inspectorate of Constabulary, which is tasked with ensuring the efficiency and effectiveness of police forces.</P>
    <P>
    </P>
    <P>
      <i>Additional information.</i>I will not be proposing that the inspectorate will have the same functions as the British Inspectorate of Constabulary. Instead, I intend proposing that the function of the inspectorate in examining Garda practices and procedures will be focused at those practices and procedures which could give rise to complaints or significant public concern rather than, for instance, issues such as efficiency, value for money etc. In other words, there will be a very close and fully compatible link between the two proposed functions of the inspectorate.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for that reply. There certainly seems to be greater flexibility in terms of the powers of the inspectorate than was indicated in the past. Is the Minister indicating that the envisaged inspectorate, while not an ombudsman in nomenclature, will have the same powers? He mentioned that it would be a body of three persons with ancillary staff. Nuala O'Loan, the Police Ombudsman for Northern Ireland, has about 200 staff. In a previous statement, the Minister said he could not envisage an ombudsman along those lines because of the resources required and the cost. It was a concern of the Human Rights Commission that the Minister would be dealing, through the inspectorate, with the day to day running and efficacy of the Garda rather than broader human rights issues. Does the Minister envisage that the inspectorate will be a stand-alone entity, entirely separate from the Garda Commissioner and the gardaí?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. McDowell Mr. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>It will be entirely stand alone. It will not be staffed by members of the Garda Síochána for the purposes of financing or control. The Human Rights Commission made a legit<Col N="1407" /> imate point. It looked at the British Inspectorate of Constabulary and saw how it inspects police forces to see if they are wasting money or being inefficient. It examines them with a view to getting value for money from the institutions. The commission saw an incompatibility with someone whose focus was fundamentally about the rights of ordinary individuals <i>vis-à-vis</i> the police, maintaining the integrity of the police and a value for money for function, because corners might be cut in the interests of efficiency which might compromise the human rights values which are important within the force and in the way the force deals with the public.</P>
      <P>The number of people on the Garda Síochána complaints board, about one tenth of the staff of the Police Ombudsman for Northern Ireland, is inadequate but I do not envisage a staff of 200 or anything like it being ascribed to the new inspectorate. We must approach this realistically and to establish any body in present circumstances with a staff of 200 would be a huge resource commitment. This project must be set up on a step by step basis so we can see what needs exist. I cannot simply rent new office space, recruit 200 people and say, &ldquo;Here is an inspectorate.&rdquo;  I will have to do it on a more gradual basis.</P>

      <P>County Monaghan has recently been struck by the loss of two significant and long-standing employers, with the impending closure of CPV Limited in Clones and the loss <Col N="1408" /> of 60 jobs at Lissadell Towels in Carrickmacross announced this week. In all, 159 workers are being made redundant in a county without major industry and very little inward investment of significance. These losses are, therefore, devastating to the economy of County Monaghan.</P>
      <P>Two towns at opposite ends of the county, Clones and Carrickmacross, are being struck in a similar way. Medium sized manufacturing industries have gone and left many in the community without employment. This follows the loss of more than 300 jobs at Monaghan Poultry Products within the past two years.</P>
      <P>The announcement of the closure of CPV Limited in Clones came five days before Christmas and was a grievous blow to the 99 workers. We can only imagine the impact it had on them, their families and the wider community in Clones. CPV Limited was the main manufacturing industry in Clones, a town which already had a higher than average level of unemployment for many years. It has been know for some time that CPV Limited's parent company was trying to sell it off but that does not lessen the cruelty of the closure for those dependent on the company for their livelihood.</P>
      <P>Earlier this year, after a meeting with management and long before the final decision was announced, I raised with the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Harney, the difficulties of that company. It is vital that the Minister, her Department and all the relevant agencies should intervene without delay to find a replacement industry or industries for Clones. This town has long suffered the economic and social effects of partition as well as the wilful neglect of successive Governments. It must not be allowed to sink once again into a position of marginalisation.</P>
      <P>When the closure of CPV Limited was announced, I e-mailed the Minister's office urging her to take immediate action to rescue or replace these crucial jobs for the workforce and the wider Clones community, but I have yet to receive a substantive response. She was able to quickly respond to me with what I regard as snide and slanderous remarks this morning following another question I put to her.</P>
      <P>The second blow to employment in County Monaghan came with the news this week that the Lissadell Towels factory at Aclint Bridge in Carrickmacross is to lay off 60 employees. The redundancies are due to take effect in the next 70 days. Lissadell Towels has been in south Monaghan for over 30 years. This news is a huge blow to the entire community. Carrickmacross has seen great improvements in recent years which make this setback all the more disappointing. Taken individually, these job losses in County Monaghan are not as great as some which have taken place in other parts of the country, but in relative terms they are hugely significant.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The harsh reality is that as far as high technology jobs and modern employment opportunities are concerned, the Celtic tiger was <Col N="1409" /> allowed to bypass County Monaghan through the neglect of successive Governments. We have been deprived of much of the infrastructure and inward investment that is essential for the development of our region. We were not equipped to reap the full benefits of the economic upturn over the past decade. Our grossly over-centralised economy has kept major job opportunities in concentrations along the eastern and southern seaboards. Despite lip service paid to the Border, the midlands and the west &ndash; the BMW region &ndash; we are still being kept on the margins.</P>
    <P>On behalf of the people of County Monaghan, I urge the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Harney, her Department and all the relevant agencies to combine in a concerted effort to replace the jobs lost in County Monaghan. The hard-working people of that county, who have a stake in its future for their children, deserve nothing less.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankFahey" hpid="Mr. Fahey Mr. Fahey">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Mr. Fahey)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Deputy for raising this matter on the Adjournment. I apologise for the Tánaiste's absence. She is attending a management meeting of the Department outside the city.</P>
      <P>I, the Minister and Department officials learned with grave disappointment of the recent decision by CPV Limited to cease production at its Clones facility with the loss of 98 jobs. I am conscious of the effect the closure of this plant will have on Clones and, most immediately, on the employees and their families. I understand IDA Ireland met executives from the parent company, Terex Corporation USA, and the Irish facility on 11 December 2002 to discuss the future of the plant at Clones. CPV has been experiencing extremely difficult market conditions, including strong competition from manufacturing bases in South Africa. In an effort to improve efficiencies the company implemented a voluntary redundancy programme, involving 40 people, in November 2002.</P>
      <P>IDA Ireland understands that CPV does not have the orders to sustain the plant and is currently operating at a loss. Consequently, financial difficulties have forced the parent company to close the plant. The facility is due to close in the coming months unless a buyer can be found to purchase the plant as a going concern. In the event that a successful outcome is not achieved prior to closure, IDA Ireland will continue to market the facility through its network of overseas offices in an effort to secure a new company to take over the facility as a manufacturing operation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The position in relation to Lissadell Towels is that an interim examiner was appointed on 30 January 2003 to assess the future prospects of the company. The outcome of this assessment will probably involve a cessation of manufacturing, but the continuation of the company as a trading company. The reasons for this change of direction <Col N="1410" /> relate to competitiveness issues. I understand the company will discuss with its union representatives from SIPTU and its staff proposed redundancies due to a significant decline in its business activity, which is mainly as a supplier to the international hotel bedroom and bathrooms market.</P>
    <P>In reaction to the closure announcement at CPV Limited, FÁS, the national training authority, contacted the company to discuss a detailed programme to assist those who are being made redundant to find suitable alternative employment. FÁS will make available its full range of support services, including skills analysis, jobs placement, guidance and counselling interviews, identification of training needs and suitable training courses. FÁS will also ensure ongoing support and action to keep redundant workers in touch with the labour market. I understand that FÁS has also contacted Lissadell Towels Limited to arrange a meeting next week.</P>
    <P>In terms of finding new investment and providing new sources of employment in Monaghan, I am determined to do everything I can to see that this happens. The State agencies continue to aggressively market the area, which forms part of the Border, midland and west region which is a priority location for jobs promotion by the agencies. The agencies are also committed to bringing about balanced regional development. The availability of suitable premises and committed and motivated workforces are major selling points.</P>
    <P>Recognising that urban environments are generally more attractive for mobile investment, IDA Ireland has adopted a target of having 50% of all new greenfield investment located in the Objective One region, which includes Monaghan. IDA Ireland has sought to encourage investments in defined sectors, such as medical devices, ICT, engineering and internationally traded services and software sectors to the region, which seeks to build on the relative advantages in different towns.</P>
    <P>Enterprise Ireland is working closely with its client companies and regional partners in developing and sustaining businesses in the area, enhancing the business environment and encouraging new start-up companies with strong growth potential. Enterprise Ireland, as part of its regional development, also encourages Dublin-based companies to locate their business expansions in the BMW region. In addition, it is actively promoting the Lough Egish Food Park for any companies that are considering locating to the region. The park is a flagship project to attract food companies to the region and a number of companies have already located there.</P>
    <P>I assure the Deputy that the State development agencies, under the aegis of my Department, will continue to market County Monaghan for investment and will make every effort to secure alternative employment for the workers affected by the closure.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidStanton" hpid="Mr. Stanton Mr. Stanton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Stanton</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Ceann Comhairle for allowing me to raise this matter on the Adjourn<Col N="1411" /> ment. I also thank the Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Fahey, for coming into the House, although I am disappointed the Tánaiste could not be here. According to the Minister of State, a management meeting of the Department is more important to the Tánaiste than the Parliament and the job losses about which I will speak. I am also disappointed the Ceann Comhairle's office did not allow me to raise this issue by way of private notice question because the Adjournment does not allow for a question and answer session. That shows the inadequacies of our system.</P>
      <P>I want to draw the Minister of State's attention to the fact that in recent times more than 1,000 jobs have been lost in east Cork with the closure of IFI, Irish Ispat, Youghal Carpets in Carrigtwohill, Universal Foods, Artesyn in Youghal before Christmas and Technicolor yesterday evening with the loss of 234 jobs. What action will the Tánaiste, her Department and the State agencies take to deal with that? There were two major plants in Youghal, Artesyn and Technicolor &ndash; formerly Panasonic and Kodak &ndash; which was opened in 1997 by the then Minister, Deputy Richard Bruton. There is not any major manufacturing plant now in Youghal. It is becoming an unemployment blackspot. It demands urgent Government action, not a task force or a discussion group. I want to know what the Minister and the Department will do about it.</P>
      <P>Will the Tánaiste visit Youghal? Will the Minister of State indicate when she will visit the town and meet the people? If there was a plant or a pub to be opened, she would be there. More than 1,000 jobs have been lost, but the Tánaiste has not visited the area.</P>
      <P>Many families, who have mortgages and children in college, are affected by this closure. A woman who rang me yesterday told me that she had bought a new house three weeks ago. There was not any sign of the plant closing. Did the Department have any advance knowledge of this closure and, if not, why? Is there an advance warning unit in the Department? Does the Department keep in contact with the multinationals? Why was it decided to keep the plants in Poland and Wales open &ndash; I do not want to bring any misfortune on workers in those locations &ndash; while Youghal was closed? What is the Minister of State's understanding of the reason the plant was closed? Is it related to the underlying costs in the economy which have been driven up by the Government's mismanagement of it?</P>
      <P>Youghal lost 234 jobs this morning and 160 jobs before Christmas. That is 400 jobs in a small town in a short period of time. However, there is not any sign of a replacement industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Youghal needs a boost. It received a blow some weeks ago when it was announced that a new community school would not go ahead, despite weeks of planning. I urge the Minister of State to consult with his Government colleagues with a <Col N="1412" /> view to bringing some good news to the town. There is a swimming pool project ready to proceed. Could the Government give the go-ahead for that, rather than dragging its feet again? The new community school is badly needed and would be a great boost to the people of Youghal. A school and a pool are both needed in the town.</P>
    <P>I look forward to the Minister of State's response. I hope he has some plan of action rather than just reading a prepared script referring to task forces and meetings with IDA officials, all of which will be forgotten within a few weeks. I intend to raise these issues day after day on behalf of people whose families are facing a bleak future without any worthwhile income. The Minister should ensure that the workers in the non-unionised plant concerned are given adequate and proper redundancy payments and use all the resources of the State to ensure that they are properly looked after in that regard.</P>
    <P>Youghal is a beautiful area, a lovely seaside resort with excellent people and great potential for tourism development. It has taken one hammer blow after another and it is now time to turn that situation around. I call on Ministers and Ministers of State to do something for this town and its people at this time. We must not forget that other jobs are also affected when a plant of this type closes, including service and support industries and part-time workers. It is up to the Minister of State and his colleagues to act in the matter.</P>

      <P>&mdash;with the loss of 182 full-time jobs and 52 temporary jobs is a devastating blow, both for the workforce in the company and the community as a whole. It is all the more so coming soon after the recent job losses announced by Artesyn Technologies.</P>
      <P>Technicolor, a subsidiary of Thomson SA headquartered in France, took over Matsushita Electric's DVD business in mid-2002. This was a joint venture formed in 1999 between Panasonic Disc Services Corporation and Eastman Kodak Company. MMMI took over the assets of Kodak Ireland Manufacturing Limited, Youghal, County Cork, which was established in 1996 to manufacture CD-R disks. Yesterday, Technicolor informed the Minister that it intended to close its Youghal facility. The company explained that its decision follows a comprehensive review of the European DVD market, with the company concluding that to effectively compete it must continue to strengthen its supply chain and reduce manufacturing costs to enable competitive pricing for customers. The company's manufacturing and packaging operations are to be transferred to other existing facilities in Wales and Poland.</P>
      <P>I understand that FÁS, the national training authority, is contacting the company today to discuss a detailed programme to assist those who are being made redundant to find suitable alternative employment.

FÁS will also ensure ongoing support and action to keep redundant workers in touch with the labour market.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Enterprise Ireland and the South Cork Enterprise Board will meet with employees of Technicolor interested in starting their own busi<Col N="1414" /> nesses to outline the range of supports available from both organisations. Following the recent Artesyn job loss announcement, IDA met with the Youghal Chamber of Commerce and is currently working on a profile of the area which will become an intrinsic part of the IDA marketing material for the region. IDA hopes to meet with Technicolor in the coming days to discuss the situation, particularly with regard to the future utilisation of the 120,000 sq. ft. building which is being vacated by the company. IDA has been working with Artesyn to prepare a profile of its building and it is intended, with the approval of Technicolor, to undertake similar profile work of that building. This will prove useful in the future marketing of the property to potential investors.</P>
    <P>While east Cork has suffered a large number of job losses in recent times, it has also been successful in attracting new overseas investments to the area, with nearly half of all job announcements in the south-west region in 2002 being located in east Cork. This is expected to lead to over 600 new jobs in the years ahead at Schlumberger, Fournier, RF Integration, Dow Corning and Amersham Health. East Cork has proved to be a particularly attractive location for the health care, pharmaceutical and internationally-traded services sectors and IDA Ireland is hopeful that this will continue in 2003.</P>
    <P>The Government is committed to ensuring the most equitable regional distribution of job opportunities and the Minister has impressed on the development agencies the importance of making even greater efforts in this field. I assure the Deputy that the State agencies under the auspices of my Department will continue to strongly promote east Cork in the attraction of inward investment and the development and expansion of indigenous industry, including small industry.</P>

There is a huge catchment area surrounding these two schools which have been in a sad state of disrepair since the mid-1980s. In good times and bad, the essential work has not been done.

All guttering and windows need to be replaced and the entire building needs to be rewired. The senior school requires a general purposes room, servery, equipment store, library, resource area and storage, a multipurpose room, a general office, a principal's office, WC and shower facility suitable for disabled use and general utility storage. The entire building requires suitable perimeter fencing to provide security from vandalism.</P>
    <P>That is still the situation today. The parents of the area have been waiting since 1986. As cruel fate would have it in this business, the Minister who took the Adjournment debate on that occasion was none other than the then Minister for the Environment and Local Government, Deputy Noel Dempsey, who is now Minister for Education and Science. What did he say?</P>
    <P>In the Dáil on 21 March 2002, he stated that &ldquo;The Minister assures me that a project to refurbish St. Killian's junior and senior schools will proceed to the invitation of tenders as soon as possible under the expanded building programme.&rdquo;  That sentence was calculatedly intended to convey to the parents of the area that the work was going to tender. That is what Deputy Dempsey said and, ironically, he is now the Minister for Education and Science.</P>
    <P>For the nine months prior to the election, Fianna Fáil spent an unprecedented amount of money in essentially targeting my seat.</P>

      <P>I have no objection to that, but I do object to the ruthless abuse of the confidence of parents and way they were mislead. For example, on 26 April a circular was sent around by the two Fianna Fáil candidates. The one I have here is signed by the then councillor, Charlie O'Connor. He was not happy with telling them what he had obtained from the then Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Woods, but he said that &ldquo;I viewed this matter as so important that I also raised it with An Taoiseach Bertie Ahern TD. I am pleased to inform you that approval has been given to go to tender which as you know has been outstanding for some time.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Here we had a local candidate going around in Kingswood with pieces of paper saying to residents and parents that they have the approval of the Taoiseach himself to convey the expectation that this long outstanding project had been approved to go to tender. Nothing could have been further from the truth and as soon as the election was over, there were no JCBs, there were no men with shovels, there were no carpenters and there was nobody repairing gutters. The asbestos roof is still there and is now leaking. Nothing happened and the parents were then told <Col N="1416" /> it will be on the programme for 2003. The programme for 2003 duly arrived but there was nothing in it for St. Killian's junior or senior schools.</P>
    <P>What is such behaviour doing in terms of damaging confidence in politics? Fianna Fáil went around door-to-door suggesting that I was misleading the people because I had gone to great pains after the Minister, Deputy Dempsey, seemed to give me the impression that this work was going to be done. I went to considerable trouble, in terms of communicating with the Department and other agencies, to find out if there was any truth in that or any likelihood of the work proceeding. There was not, but the Fianna Fáil candidates went around and said I was misleading the people. They said they knew the truth and that the Taoiseach had indicated that the work would go to tender. It did not go to tender.</P>
    <P>The losers are the children of the area, who are being squeezed into completely inadequate and unsuitable facilities and teachers being forced to make do in improper conditions. I ask the Minister to state that they have broken their promises but that it will be included in 2004.</P>

      <P>I apologise for the absence of the Minister, Deputy Dempsey, but I am glad that the Deputy has given me the opportunity to outline to the House the Department of Education and Science's current position regarding the allocation of funding for school building projects.</P>
      <P>The 2003 capital programme, which has now been published, is designed to give the maximum amount of information to managers, boards of management, parents, pupils and principals. The criteria used for selecting projects has also been published for the first time.</P>
      <P>This year's building programme amounts to &euro;342.9 million &ndash; four times the amount allocated in 1997. The 2003 programme will deliver over 140 large-scale projects at primary and post-primary level. In addition, over 400 schools will benefit in some way from the capital programme and all primary schools benefit directly from the devolved grants scheme for minor works. The budgetary allocation for 2004 and subsequent years will determine the rate of progress on projects at schools, such as St. Killian's junior and senior schools, currently in architectural planning.</P>
      <P>The management authorities at individual schools should continue to use funds from their devolved grant to deal with any urgent health and safety matters. I wish to thank the Deputy again for giving me the opportunity on behalf of the Minister for Education and Science of outlining the current position to the House.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan" hpid="Mr. Deenihan Mr. Deenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to highlight the dilapidated and rundown condition of Mean Scoil an Leith-Triuigh, Cloghane, County Kerry. This school is privately owned and was established by the Mulcahy family in 1961, first in Castlegregory and later on the current site at Cloghane in 1963. It established a great reputation for high academic standards over the years and produced top-class students with high achievement rates in both junior and leaving certificate levels.</P>
      <P>The school still consists of the same three pre-fabs which were provided in 1973. They are disintegrating at this stage. The toilets are not working properly. The heating system is defective and the electrical works are of major concern to the principal and staff. The school is also infested with rats. At present, 80 students are attending the school, with a staff complement of six teachers. The catchment of the school covers the areas of Cloghane, Brandon and Castlegregory. The Cloghane feeder school is also a Gaelscoil.</P>
      <P>There is no question of the pupils of Mean Scoil an Leith-Triuigh being accommodated at the Tralee schools. Tralee is 25 miles away from Cloghane and Brandon. If students had to travel to any of the Tralee schools, they would have to get up at 6.30 a.m. or 7 a.m. and not return until 6.30 p.m. or 7 p.m. There is also no question of attending the schools in Dingle because they would have to use the Connor Pass, which is not accessible for buses at all times during the year. In any event, it is often closed because of icy roads and snow in the winter.</P>
      <P>A site has been acquired in Castlegregory for the new school. This new location will extend the catchment area to include Camp and the area westwards towards Annascaul, and will have accommodation for 150 students. It will obviously have all the modern, essential facilities, including a science laboratory, a computer room, etc., one would expect of a proper post-primary school.</P>
      <P>It will also be an important community resource. The area of Castlegregory, Cloghane and Brandon is totally under-exploited. I would regard it as the hidden part of Kerry. It has considerable potential for tourism, aquaculture and, in the area of eco-tourism, it was singled out some years ago by the EU for special treatment. The school will act as a catalyst for the development of the area. It will be useful for adult education, computer classes and classes by the local ICA.</P>
      <P>I understand there was a report sent recently to the Southern Health Board regarding this school. I am sure it is only a matter of time before it could be closed by the health and safety authority, which has also been informed of the state of the school. In the past week the principal had to keep his hand on the trip-switch in case the electricity would fail.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is disgraceful in this day and age that students should have to endure this type of envir<Col N="1418" /> onment in order to further their studies. It certainly is not lending itself to equality of opportunity. Students who have to pursue their education under these conditions, despite the good results achieved in the past, do not have the same opportunities as students in modern, better equipped schools. There were some problems with the acquisition of land for the school in Castlegregory but these have been overcome. In the 2003 schools building programme issued by the Minister the school was put in band two, with the comment that the pre-tender documents had been received.</P>
    <P>I urge the Minister to make a special case for this school. The school will feature on national television and in the national newspapers, if it has not already done so. It sends a sad message about the Department of Education and Science and this country that we can allow education to take place in conditions which are, in essence, not much better than what students experienced in hedge schools.</P>

      <P>I apologise for the absence of the Minister for Education and Science. I will outline the Department's proposals regarding the proposed new school in Castlegregory, County Kerry, to replace Meanscoil an Leith-Triuigh.</P>
      <P>Meanscoil an Leith-Triuigh is a co-educational all-Irish school with a current enrolment of 79 pupils. The school is currently owned by an individual who is the sole trustee of the school. It consists mainly of temporary prefabricated accommodation. The Department of Education and Science received an application for a new school to replace the existing school. The application was made jointly by the parents-teachers committee, the bishop as patron and Castlegregory community council. The sole trustee was not party to the application. Following examination of the application, the planning unit in the Department recommended the building of a new school to cater for a long-term projected enrolment of 125 to 150 pupils.</P>
      <P>A senior inspector from the Department visited the school and, following an inspection, drew up the schedule of overall accommodation based on a long-term projected enrolment figure of 150 pupils. The schedule was forwarded to the committee for agreement and was agreed by the committee. Nominations for the appointment of a design team to commence architectural planning on the new school were forwarded to the committee. A design team was appointed and the project is currently at pre-tender stage. The pre-selection of suitable contractors has also been approved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A suitable site of approximately five acres for the new school was identified in Castlegregory. It comprises five parcels of land, each one separately owned. Arrangements to acquire each parcel of land are at an advanced stage. The 2003 capital programme has been published and full <Col N="1419" /> details in relation to individual projects are available on the Department's website. Meanscoil an Leith-Triuigh is at an advanced stage of architectural planning. However, funding is not available to allow the project to progress to tender and con<Col N="1420" /> struction in the current year. The timing of when this may happen will depend on the funding allocation in 2004 and subsequent years.</P>
    <P>The Dáil adjourned at 5.25 p.m. until 2.30 p.m. on Tuesday, 11 February 2003.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 16, 34, 37, 134 and 146 together.</P>
      <P>The terms &ldquo;gangland killing&rdquo; or &ldquo;organised crime&rdquo; are widely used by the media in referring to the nature of certain serious crimes, including a number of unlawful killings perpetrated recently. It is often qualified by the suggestion that the victim was &ldquo;known to the gardaí&rdquo;. While this speculation is understandable, it does not correspond to the manner in which the Garda Síochána classifies crime or individual offences.</P>
      <P>As I informed the House last week, there are indications that a significant number of recent criminal outrages, including some brutal killings, could be categorised as being organised criminal or group activity. All unlawful deaths and violent crimes are subject to detailed investigation by the Garda regardless of the circumstances of how they occurred. The fact that a person may, or may not, be associated with alleged criminal activity does not lessen the gravity of the offence committed.</P>
      <P>The identification of the motive and the gathering of evidence available in its support are key elements of the investigation and prosecution processes. Experience in this jurisdiction, and elsewhere, has shown that it is often difficult for the relevant authorities to bring the perpetrators to justice, having regard to the intimidation and violence used within criminal circles as a sanction.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1423" />I am informed by the Garda authorities that speculation as to the nature of a motive in a particular case could serve to jeopardise the successful investigation and prosecution of these serious crimes. I do not consider it appropriate to comment further on those cases which may involve motives that accord with the media term gangland killing.</P>
    <P>As I also informed the House recently, I have had a number of meetings with the Commissioner, the Garda Síochána, and other senior Garda personnel to discuss recent criminal outrages. I am absolutely satisfied that the necessary resources are being directed towards the containment and detection of such serious criminal activity. The investigations are being undertaken by divisional and district garda at local level. All the necessary national support services are available to supplement these investigations, such as the Garda National Bureau of Criminal Investigation, and the Garda national drugs unit. I have also confirmed to the Garda authorities my willingness to pursue any other measures which would assist in addressing any problems.</P>
    <P>On a more general level, the Garda Síochána has available to it a broad range of legislation to enable serious or organised crime to be tackled. This includes the Criminal Justice Act, 1994, which marked a watershed in combating drug trafficking and organised crime with the introduction of reporting suspicious financial transactions. It includes also the legislative package concentrating on the identification of the proceeds of crime and the taking of appropriate action by the Criminal Assets Bureau to deny persons of such proceeds.</P>
    <P>CAB has been particularly successful in targeting the proceeds of suspected organised criminal activity, including drug trafficking. This has resulted in the disbandment of a number of criminal gangs, the imprisonment of prominent career criminals and the forfeiture to the State of significant proceeds of serious crime. I am informed by the Garda authorities that they are satisfied the measures and resources in place are sufficient to address these areas of criminal activity.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. McDowell Mr. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. McDowell)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 17, 38 and 40 together.</P>
      <P>As the Deputies are aware, the Supreme Court gave its judgment in the cases of L &amp; O on the 23 January. It is a significant decision which helps to bring clarity to this difficult area.</P>
      <P>The Supreme Court judgment found that the Minister was entitled to deport the persons concerned, who are the parents of Irish born children.  </P>
      <P>The issue of claims for leave to remain in the State by the non-national parents of an Irish born child has been a matter of serious concern to Government for some time. A claimed right to reside in Ireland based solely on the birth of a child in Ireland has come to be used as a method of attempting to circumvent normal immigration controls. The scale of this issue has grown considerably in recent years. In the past two years the total number of applications for residence based on an Irish born child was 15,190, 6,570 in 2001 and 8,620 in 2002. At present there are 10,667 applications on hand in respect of which no decision has been made; of these 9,077 are current or former asylum seekers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In general terms the Supreme Court judgment confirms that: the non-national parent of an Irish born child does not enjoy an automatic entitlement to reside in the State by virtue of the birth of that child alone; and while an Irish child has a constitutional right to have the care and company of its parents, there is no absolute right for this to take place in Ireland. A determination may be made to deport the immigrant family, notwithstanding the effective removal of the Irish born child, without violating the child's rights. While the Minister must consider each case involving deportation on its individual merits, he is undoubtedly entitled to take into account the considerations which would arise from allowing a particular applicant to remain &ndash; where consistency would inevitably lead to similar decisions in other cases; statistical patterns of immigration and asylum seeking and the demands thereby created on the State's resources are entitled to be taken into account &ndash; even where there is nothing known or relied upon which reflects badly on the individual concerned; the length of time that the child in question has been in the State is a relevant and necessary consideration in determining whether a deportation order should be made; the Minister is entitled to take the view that the system should not be undermined by persons seeking to take advantage of the period between arrival in the State and the complete processing of applications for asylum by relying on the birth of a child during that period as a reason for permitting them to reside in the State indefinitely; and in examining the individual cases the Minister is entitled to consider facts such as the consti<Col N="1425" /> tutional rights of the child, the length of stay of the family in the State and their circumstances, the Dublin Convention, the Government's immigration policy and the requirements of the common good. The public interest in a fair, rational and effective asylum and immigration system is a grave and substantial matter of high importance.</P>
    <P>It is clear from these judgments that the fact that a non-national gives birth to a child in Ireland cannot of itself give the parents a right to reside in the State.</P>
    <P>The clear import of this is that a large number of the non-national parents of Irish born children, where they have no other legal basis for remaining in the State, may be required to leave. This does not mean of course that all such persons will be deported or that deportation, which carries with it serious consequences in terms of re-entry to the State, will be the only option resorted to in an effort to ensure that persons leave the State. It is open to any person to leave voluntarily thus obviating the necessity for making a deportation order.</P>
    <P>I am in discussions with the Attorney General about the policy, legal and constitutional effects of the judgment. This process is likely to take some weeks. This week I gave the Government a preliminary assessment of the implications of the judgment. I will bring to Government, at an early stage, a more comprehensive assessment of the judgment, including its administrative implications and proposals for action on foot of it.</P>

      <P>Under section 13 of the Licensing Act 1872, it is an offence for a licence holder to permit drunkenness or any violent, quarrelsome or riotous behaviour on licensed premises, or to sell intoxicating liquor to a drunken person. The current penalty, which was last updated in the Intoxicating Liquor Act, 1988, is &euro;254. Under section 18 of the same Act a licence holder may refuse to admit, and may turn out of the premises, any person who is drunk, violent, quarrelsome or disorderly. Any such person who refuses or fails to leave the premises is liable to a penalty &euro;12.70. It appears that this penalty has not been increased since 1924.</P>

    <P>In its report on admission and service in licensed premises, which was published in December, the Commission on Liquor Licensing pointed to the need to strengthen legislative provisions relating to drunkenness. It made similar <Col N="1426" /> recommendations in relation to violent, quarrelsome and disorderly conduct on licensed premises. I welcome these recommendations and I thank the commission for its work in relation to these issues.</P>
    <P>Having considered the commission's recommendations, I have decided that an urgent response is called for. I intend to bring proposals to Government, as soon as possible, for the necessary legislative changes, including stronger penalties, as recommended by the commission. The necessary preparatory work is already under way in my Department and I hope to obtain Government approval for the amending legislation before Easter.</P>
    <P>As regards promotional practices, I regard practices which are conducive to, or may result in, excessive consumption of alcohol as irresponsible and unacceptable. Practices of this nature may provide adequate grounds for the Garda or other interested parties to lodge objections to the renewal of licences of the premises concerned. I see considerable merit in prohibiting promotional practices geared towards excessive alcohol consumption by legal means and I will consider this in the context of future legislation. In the meantime I would urge the licensed trade not to engage in such irresponsible activities.</P>
    <P>I will confer with the Garda Commissioner concerning the possibility of developing a clear national policy of opposing the renewal of publicans' licences where a problem of drunkenness is detected among customers or where publicans participate in promotions likely to encourage binge drinking.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 19 and 29 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1427" />The report of the review group on investment-based naturalisation in Ireland was brought by me before Government in July 2002. In the interests of openness and transparency I arranged, with Government approval, for its publication on 4 August 2002. A number of copies were placed in the Oireachtas Library at that time. The report contained a comprehensive analysis of the manner in which the scheme had operated since 1989.</P>
    <P>Furthermore, and in the context of the recent controversy concerning the appropriateness of the appointment of Ray Burke as a Minister in the last Government, the Taoiseach asked me to examine the file relating to one particular investment based case involving 11 persons and I agreed to do so. Again in the interests of openness and transparency, I took the unprecedented step of reporting to the Dáil on the outcome of my examination of that file in my response to Parliamentary Question No. 5 on 17 October 2002. My report elucidated the substance of my examination of that case and my conclusions thereon.</P>
    <P>As the Deputy is aware, it has been the general policy of successive Ministers for Justice not to publish details of individual naturalisation cases, other than what is required by law &ndash; that is the publication in <i>Iris Oifigiúil</i> of the name and address of the applicant, the date naturalised and whether he or she was an adult or minor. There is good reason for this policy. Applicants linked to investments &ndash; and, for that matter, all applicants &ndash; have an expectation that there will be no additional form of publicity about their applications other than that which is prescribed. In reporting to the Dáil I went as far as I considered possible in relation to the disclosure of information within that general policy context and I expressed my conclusions in a forthright manner. I am not prepared to go further than that. I can confirm that a complete copy of the file is currently with the Moriarty tribunal.</P>
    <P>With regard to the issue of legal advice, the matter is still the subject of ongoing discussion between officials in my Department and the Office of the Attorney General. As a consequence the legal advice in question is not yet available to me. Even if it were available to me I would not publish confidential legal advice in relation to an individual case. The Deputy can be assured that I will give any advice I receive careful consideration.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. McDowell Mr. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. McDowell)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 20 and 118 together.</P>
      <P>While I agree that the recent figures, especially in relation to violent assaults, are a cause for concern, the fact is that they also reflect the increased activity on the part of the Garda Síochána in addressing this problem which has led to a greater number of offences coming to their attention. This is confirmed by the excellent detection rate of 75% in respect of assault and 86% in respect of homicide. The crime figures for 2001 underline the continued need for robust responses to offending behaviour and the need to readily adapt to changing levels and patterns of crime.</P>
      <P>For example, although the current strength of the force is at an all time high we are prioritising Garda recruitment and training in order to bring it up to its authorised strength of 12,200 as soon as possible. In accordance with An Agreed Programme for Government, these extra gardaí will be assigned to areas of greatest need.</P>
      <P>A new Garda powers Bill will be introduced giving substantial additional powers to the Garda in investigating serious crime. The new public order legislation which is currently going through the Oireachtas will greatly enhance the power of the Garda to deal with public order offences. The Garda will continue to target the menace of organised crime, particularly by means of the Criminal Assets Bureau.</P>
      <P>The Garda Operation Encounter came into force on 23 February 2002. It is focused on all issues of public order occurring in the community. Particular attention is paid to nightclubs, fast food outlets and other venues at which large numbers of people congregate and where there is potential for disorder. Additional Garda resources have been made available and plans drawn up by each of the regional commanders to prioritise the deployment of those resources. The target hours of the operation are determined locally, based on the specific circumstances prevailing in each locality. The Garda pay particular attention to ensuring that the owners and managers of premises are fully aware of their responsibilities and of the duty of care they owe to their patrons and other members of the public.</P>
      <P>A sum of &euro;38 million has been provided for prison capital projects this year. This follows on from the unprecedented expansion of over 1,200 extra prison places in the years since 1997.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government will continue to focus on youth crime by supporting and developing evidence based preventative measures and interventions aimed at young offenders and those most at risk of offending by implementing the <Col N="1429" /> outstanding relevant provisions of the Children Act 2001. I am also committed to continuing to support and strengthen the network of Garda youth diversion projects which increased in number from 12 in 1997 to 64 currently. The continued enforcement of the Intoxicating Liquor Act, 2000 is also a useful weapon. It has resulted in 152 closure orders against licence holders up to 13 December 2002.</P>

      <P>The Commission on Liquor Licensing made no recommendations for changes in general trading hours in its second interim report which was published in July. The commission did state that it would return to the issue in its final report which is expected in mid-March.  </P>
      <P>As part of the process of reviewing existing trading hours provisions and assessing the need for further changes, the commission placed advertisements in national newspapers last autumn inviting views and submissions on the trading hours issue. A large number of submissions were received both from individuals and a broad range of interested bodies. A number of organisations were subsequently invited to make oral presentations. At present the commission is considering the views and submissions received in the context of preparing its final report. On receipt of this report I will consider any recommendations for changes in existing legislative provisions that are made by the commission.</P>
      <P>On the subject of street violence and crime, the position is that extensive powers are available to the Garda to deal with late night drinking and disturbances under the Criminal Justice (Public Order) Act 1994. As the Deputy is no doubt aware, the Criminal Justice (Public Order) Bill 2002, will, when enacted, give the Garda significant additional powers in dealing with drunkenness and public disorder. The Bill completed Second Stage in December and has been referred to the Select Committee on Justice, Equality, Defence and Women's Rights.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. McDowell Mr. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. McDowell)</NameTxt>
      <P>The figure of &euro;6 million which the Deputy quotes appears to be taken from information I previously gave in reply to a parliamentary question on 27 November 2002. This figure included court awards and out of court settlements over a five year period from 1997 to 2001. The expenditure was made in respect of allegations of assault, unlawful arrest and other alleged wrongs suffered by civilians. Although the claims of alleged assault and wrongful arrest formed the highest percentage of these types of civil actions taken against the Garda Síochána, other breaches of citizens' rights made up almost &euro;4 million of the expenditure figure quoted by the Deputy.</P>
      <P>The reality is that civil actions may be taken by the general public against members of the Garda Síochána for compensation for any alleged wrongs and personal injuries inflicted on them by Garda members in the performance of their duties. Settlement of cases takes place on the advice of the Chief State Solicitor, the Attorney General and State counsel.</P>
      <P>The Garda Commissioner has informed me that incidents which culminate in successful claims against the State in respect of the actions of gardaí are examined with a view to identifying and implementing operational strategies to eliminate or reduce similar claims in the future. A pilot scheme in conflict resolution was introduced in Store Street and Tallaght Garda stations in 2001. Following this pilot scheme, conflict resolution training has been introduced into the education programme for trainee gardaí. Training in conflict resolution is included in the programme at in-service training schools nationwide for members at garda and sergeant rank. The aim of the training is to provide members with the skills to defuse a confrontational situation without having to use force.</P>
      <P>The Garda Commissioner has also informed me that the Garda Síochána (Discipline) Regulations, 1989 are invoked in appropriate cases where the actions of individual garda come into question, some of which may also be the subject of legal actions against the State and the gardaí concerned.  </P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have made a number of public statements about the standards which should apply to members of the Garda Síochána and their dealings with the public. I have stressed the point that it is now more vital than ever that gardaí are cognisant of the rights and the dignity of each individual that they come in contact with and that they treat people fairly and impartially. I have a strong belief in the capacity of the women and men of the Garda Síochána to continue to earn and maintain the trust of the community by performing their duties to the highest standards. The maintenance of these standards in an era of rapid <Col N="1431" /> change will require that new structures and procedures be put in place. Principal among these is the Garda inspectorate which the Government has committed itself to introduce and the legislative proposals for which I am now preparing.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. McDowell Mr. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. McDowell)</NameTxt>
      <P>The legislation governing small public service vehicles, that is taxis and hackneys, is set out in the Road Traffic (Public Service Vehicles) Regulations 1963 (SI 191 of 1963) as amended. The primary legislation is the Road Traffic Act 1961 (Part VII), as amended.</P>
      <P>The processing of PSV applications in regard to the suitability of the applicant is a matter for the Garda authorities. Responsibility for ensuring that persons are fit and proper persons to be granted a licence rests with the Garda authorising officer in accordance with the provisions of the Road Traffic (Public Service Vehicles) (Amendment) (No. 2) Regulations 1970 (SI 200 of 1970). These regulations do not specify any particular convictions which would render an applicant unsuitable.</P>
      <P>The regulations also provide that where the holder of a licence to drive small PSVs is convicted of an offence which in the opinion of the court renders the holder unsuitable to hold such a licence, the court may revoke the licence and shall notify the commissioner of any such revocation. In addition, the Garda authorities may at any time revoke a licence to drive a small PSV if they consider the holder of the licence is no longer a fit and proper person to hold such a licence. The issue of amending the legislation in question is a matter for consideration by the Minister for Transport.</P>
      <P>With regard to the question of the procedures used in the consideration of applications for PSV licences, as a result of the issuing of such a licence to the person at the centre of the X case, which has been revoked since September 1999, the Garda initiated a working group to review the procedures for the processing of applications for PSV licences.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have been informed that, following this review, more stringent vetting procedures were developed and a revised application for a licence to drive a small PSV form was introduced in March 2000. The main changes in the vetting procedures include: applicants are now obliged to provide their PPS number for identity-verification purposes; applicants must provide details of two referees, who must be deemed acceptable and of sufficient standing, who can vouch for the applicant; applicants are obliged to provide <Col N="1432" /> details of previous PSV licences; and applicants are obliged to indicate if they ever had any previous convictions in this State or elsewhere.</P>
    <P>Each applicant is checked against Garda records. Where there is a doubt about the applicant's suitability that person is interviewed by the issuing officer and afforded an opportunity to address any Garda reservations. In cases where an applicant is refused a licence by the Garda authorising officer the applicant has a right of appeal to the District Court. The right of an applicant to appeal is based on the longstanding principle of natural justice and fair procedures.</P>

    <P>The figures given for January 2000 and January 2001 are provisional figures as returns are outstanding from a number of individual public service bodies.</P>
    <P>A Government commitment in the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness requires that:</P>
    <P>Every Department will take appropriate action to ensure that agencies under its aegis achieve the 3% target for the employment of people with disabilities in the Public Service at an early date.</P>
    <P>Accordingly, it is the responsibility of each Department to consider the question of the action to be taken against agencies under their aegis that fail to reach the 3% target for employment of people with disabilities.</P>
    <P>A monitoring committee established and chaired by my Department helps to monitor and guide progress in relation to the target. It has supported a number of initiatives in recent years <Col N="1433" /> including: approval of a draft code of practice for use in the public service and exploration of the options for common selection procedures for people with disabilities; raising awareness of the 3% target among, and giving information to chief executives, personnel officers and disability equality officers in the public service through a series of eight regional seminars and publication of an information brochure; publication of a brochure designed to encourage people with disabilities to consider a career in the public service and promotion of this option at the Public Sector Careers Expo in April 2001; and commissioned research on the issues and barriers relating to achievement of the target in six public service organisations. The report, published in November 2001 and titled Research Project on the Effective Recruitment of People with Disabilities in the Public Service, provides an insight into some of the issues which hinder progress and includes recommendations to assist future progress. My Department, in partnership with the Equality Authority, launched an employer resource pack on 3 December 2002 to assist public service employers in the recruitment and retention of people with disabilities.</P>
    <P>My colleague, the Minister for Finance, is responsible for the 3% target for the employment of people with disabilities within the Civil Service. The 3% target is based on the definition of disability set out in the Civil Service code of practice on the employment of people with disabilities. This definition includes people with physical, sensory or psychological impairments. In order to maintain confidentiality, the statistical returns <Col N="1434" /> made by Departments and offices do not specify the nature of the disability. The following table shows the percentage of employees with disabilities in each Department.</P>
    <P>The Programme for Prosperity and Fairness included a commitment to a review of the employment of people with a disability in the Civil Service to ascertain ongoing adherence to the 3% employment target. While Departments met the target in the mid-1990s, since then the percentage has dropped below the target and as at December 2001 the percentage of people with a disability in the Civil Service was 2.78%. The Department of Finance has written to the heads of all Departments and offices to ensure that they are aware of their legal obligations and of the importance of reaching and maintaining the 3% target.</P>
    <P>In light of the commitment in the PPF, and to improve adherence to the target, the Department of Finance, in partnership with the Civil Service Commission and the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, commissioned a study on the career progression of people with a disability in the Civil Service. The research, which was carried out by a team led by Goodbody Economic Consultants, will be published shortly. The research examines career progression for people with disabilities, highlights the challenges they face in pursuing their careers and makes recommendations for improvements. The Department of Finance is considering the recommendations and will be drawing up proposals shortly. Officials from the Department of Finance are meeting with the Civil Service staff unions to consider the recommendations.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. McDowell Mr. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. McDowell)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 25 and 42 together.</P>
      <P>It has long been the case that, subject to certain limited exceptions, every non-European Economic Area national who is present in the State for more than three months is required to register with the Garda Síochána in accordance with Article 11 of the Aliens Order 1946. Upon registration, he or she is given a Garda registration certificate which includes biographical details, a photograph and passport particulars. Details of the person in question are held on the Garda national immigration bureau's computer system which is now available to immigration officers at virtually all ports and airports throughout the State.</P>
      <P>The order of 1946 also makes provision for the taking of fingerprints from persons during the course of the registration process. Although that provision is not used it has existed on the Statute Book for over 50 years. The Aliens Order 1946 is no longer simply a ministerial order &ndash; it has the force of primary legislation by virtue of the provisions of section 2 of the Immigration Act 1999. Therefore any consideration of the problem of identity or multiple identities in the sphere of immigration would involve the possibility of invoking a power which was obviously intended for that purpose and which exists in law but which has not been availed of to date.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>No such power exists in relation to the population generally. The view of the Supreme Court, in relation to immigration law, is that the State must have very wide powers in the interest of the common good. A basic requirement in this regard is that of ensuring that the actual identity of <Col N="1436" /> immigrants is not the subject of falsification. Fingerprinting primarily concerns establishing that individuals are who they say they are.</P>
    <P>Fraud in relation to identity documents is a feature of immigration systems worldwide. This is evidenced by the terms of United Nations Security Council Resolution 1373/2001 which was adopted in the wake of the 11 September atrocities in the United States. The resolution requires that all States prevent the movement of terrorists or terrorist groups by, <i>inter alia,</i> controls on issuance of identity papers and travel documents, and through measures for preventing counterfeiting, forgery or fraudulent use of identity papers and travel documents.</P>
    <P>Between 1999 and 2001 the number of legally resident non-EEA nationals in this jurisdiction grew from approximately 30,000 to over 90,000 &ndash; representing an increase of 200% in three years. These figures do not include asylum seekers. It would be naive to believe that the undoubted benefits accruing to the State from the scale of these migratory flows are not accompanied also by abuses and attempted abuses of the immigration system by transnational criminal gangs who specialise in establishing false identities for immigrants for illicit purposes. Passport forgeries, photo substituted passports and forged work permits are a constant and growing feature of the Irish immigration landscape. As a consequence there is a danger that persons who are legally resident in the State and who acquire possession of more than one passport may seek to register in two or more identities. The concerns which this generates for the State, or any State, are much wider than that of preventing welfare fraud.</P>
    <P>The Garda registration certificate card, although not an identity card, has a value for identification purposes. This inevitably means that there is a certain level of false applications in order to establish false identities for criminal purposes. We have a duty to ensure that non-EEA nationals resident in the State are in compliance with our immigration laws both from a security aspect and to protect the integrity of our immigration system. This includes ensuring that the identities of non-EEA nationals resident here are registered on the basis of the best possible information available to us. It is not an issue of discriminating against one group of people; it is an issue of upholding the integrity and minimising the abuse of our immigration system. Given the serious threat posed by travel document abuse it is necessary to consider all options for establishing identities as conclusively as possible.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. McDowell)</NameTxt>
      <P>In July 2001 the commission was formally appointed following the enactment of the Human Rights Commission (Amendment) Act 2001. Its initial focus has been mainly concentrated on the establishment of the commission as an effective human rights institution having regard to its extensive remit and functions under the founding legislation.</P>
      <P>One of the key principles underlying the commission's independence is that it has full control over the recruitment of its own staff, subject only to general Government policy. As part of its start-up phase the commission undertook the following: consideration of its staffing structure, numbers, grading and pay, and, in particular, how it would proceed with the selection of its chief executive; selection of a suitable permanent premises and related issues; drawing up a work programme and identification of priorities; conducting research on particular subjects, <i>vis-à-vis</i> children with disabilities &ndash; exploring multiple identities and treatment of elderly persons in long-term nursing homes; preparing submissions on promised legislation such as the European Convention on Human Rights Bill 2001, and proposals for a new Garda inspectorate and complaints body; establishment of the joint committee of representatives with the Northern Ireland Human Rights Commission in accordance with the Good Friday Agreement and the Human Rights Commission Act 2000, and work arising from that commitment including, in particular, the question of establishing a charter on rights protection on an all Ireland basis; and recording of details of matters raised in correspondence for further examination and evaluation.</P>
      <P>The commission initially appointed three temporary administrative staff. A chief executive was appointed in June 2002 following a selection process. The commission's immediate permanent staffing structure was settled fairly quickly thereafter and it is now in the final stages of recruiting ten heads of senior staff. It is possible that further staff will be required but the commission has not yet given me any indication of its wishes in this regard. The budgetary allocation for the commission for 2003 is &euro;1.28 million.</P>

      <P>The Commission on Liquor Licensing in December 2002 produced a report on admission and service in licensed premises. In it the commission made recommendations for changes to the liquor licensing code. It also put forward a number of suggestions for changes to equality legislation, structures and procedures. It did not wish to make any formal recommendations in relation to these matters since the primary focus of its report was on the liquor licensing code. It noted that suggested changes to equality legislation would require further consideration and wider consultation.</P>
      <P>One such issue raised by the commission was to provide recourse to the District Court when dealing with all licensing issues, including cases involving licensed premises under the Equal Status Act 2000. At present all cases under equal status legislation are heard by ODEI &ndash; the Equality Tribunal in the first instance, with appeal to the Circuit Court.</P>
      <P>I have asked my Department to undertake a consultation process with the social partners, the ODEI &ndash; the Equality Tribunal and the Equality Authority on all the equality issues raised by the commission, and to report further to me on the outcome. Until such time as the consultation process has been completed I have no further statement to make on the matter.</P>

[2932/03]</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. McDowell Mr. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. McDowell)</NameTxt>
      <P>Shanganagh Castle was opened in 1969 as an open detention centre for males aged between 16 and 21 years of age. The centre, which stands on grounds of 24 acres, had accommodation for 60 inmates. It had been increasingly difficult to identify young male offenders suitable for this type of open prison accommodation. Shanganagh Castle had an average offender occupancy of 30 inmates in 2001 and this fell again last year, with as few as 12 inmates being detained there late last year. In addition, the full implementation of the provisions of the Children Act 2001, will mean that 16 and 17 year old inmates must be completely segregated in the prison system, resulting in a further drop in those offenders who might have been found suitable for transfer to Shanganagh Castle.</P>
      <P>A number of initiatives were taken to increase the number of inmates in Shanganagh Castle. Among these were the implementation of new procedures for dealing with assessments of candidates for the centre. Many offenders in this age group were either unsuitable or were not eligible for a transfer to Shanganagh Castle for various reasons. In addition, offenders were often unwilling to transfer to the centre.</P>
      <P>In view of the very considerable decline in the number of young offenders found suitable for transfer to Shanganagh Castle in recent years, the Irish Prisons Service established a group to examine the options for its continued use as a detention centre. While the report of the group identified an increase in the upper age limit of offenders as one option, it also recognised that:</P>
      <P>If none of the recommended options were considered viable then, as the current regime at Shanganagh Castle cannot be justified on operational or financial grounds, the closure of the castle and the subsequent disposal of the site will have to be considered.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I carefully considered this report, the centre's <Col N="1440" /> viability and the options available for its future use. I decided to close Shanganagh Castle in order to contribute to the control of costs in the Prisons Service, to make more effective use of Prisons Service staffing and other resources, and to release funds through the sale of Shanganagh Castle to be used, subject to the agreement of the Minister for Finance, for other more productive prison related purposes. The order to close the centre was made on 16 December 2002 and took effect from 20 December 2002.</P>
    <P>In relation to plans for a juvenile detention centre, the Prisons Service placed public advertisements in October 2001 seeking suitable sites for the location of a juvenile detention facility for young offenders aged 16 to 17 years, as part of the process of implementing the Children Act 2001.</P>
    <P>On foot of these advertisements submissions regarding 25 properties were received by the Prisons Service. In addition, another 15 or so sites in state ownership, including all existing prison properties, were considered giving a total of approximately 40 locations assessed with detailed feasibility studies completed by the Office of Public Works.</P>
    <P>The Office of Public Works recommended that the site referred to by the Deputy was the most suitable location of those examined and, on that basis, a planning notice under part 9 of the Local Government Planning and Development Act 2000, was served in December 2002. This involved placing public advertisements as well as site notices regarding the proposed development. The comments received on foot of these advertisements are now being evaluated in consultation with the Office of Public Works.</P>
    <P>The Deputy will be aware that it has been clearly and consistently stated in the past week, in both Houses of the Oireachtas, that I have not yet made a conclusive decision on the location of the proposed development. The proposal is one which does not come from me but rather one which has been put to me. I require more time to examine all the options open to me and hope to come to a decision on this matter shortly. I have asked the Prisons Service to review all possible alternatives. The Deputy can be assured that I will take into account all views expressed to me by local residents, South Dublin County Council, local representatives and through the Houses of the Oireachtas before reaching a decision in the matter.</P>
    <P>While I examine all of the options open to me in this matter the advice available to me at this stage is that the nature and structure of the current facilities at Shanganagh Castle would require massive investment to convert them into a suitable, secure, modern juvenile detention centre. The cost of converting whole buildings, including the listed 18th century Shanganagh Castle structure, to meet modern prison design far outweighs the cost of building on a greenfield site.</P>

      <P>The Equality Authority was established on a designate basis on 8 March 1999 and on a statutory basis on 18 October 1999 on the coming into force of the Employment Equality Act, 1998. The mandate of the authority is to work towards the elimination of discrimination and to promote equality of opportunity. Under section 40 of the 1998 Act the authority is required to prepare and submit a strategic plan for the ensuing three years. There is also a statutory requirement to have copies of the plan laid before each House of the Oireachtas. The strategic plan 2003-2005 of the authority was laid before both Houses of the Oireachtas on 24 January. I officially launched the plan on behalf of the authority on 27 January.</P>
      <P>The plan is a product of a wide consultative process. Submissions were received from a wide range of interests, both written and through regional meetings. Consultations also took place with the social partners. In addition, my Department was consulted in relation to the plan.</P>
      <P>I welcome the publication of the plan as it will form the basis for prioritising themes to direct the work of the authority and implement its mandate over the next three years. These themes include: building equality in service provision that impacts on the quality of people's lives; contributing to a more accessible workplace and labour market; developing initiatives specific to the disability ground, to the issue of carers under the family status ground and to the issue of racism; supporting the development of effective equality strategies at national and local level; addressing the specific situation and experience of those within the nine grounds faced with additional barriers of poverty and exclusion; and maintaining and developing the internal structures and systems of the authority.</P>
      <P>This plan will be developed on an annual basis by detailed business plans which will set out the deployment of resources and specific actions in pursuit of each objective. Internal reviews will also be carried out on an annual basis and will check on the progress achieved within each of the themes identified under the plan.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 41 and 141 together.</P>
      <P>Information available to the international community would indicate that Columbia continues to be the main source of cocaine smuggled into Europe. Drug abuse and trafficking affect all countries in the Americas. Closer co-operation at the regional and inter-regional levels is an important part of the response to the many facets of those problems. All countries in the Americas have continued to co-operate closely through a number of mechanisms at the inter-regional, regional and sub-regional levels.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Cocaine seizures in Ireland have increased substantially, particularly in 2002, and the Garda <Col N="1445" /> authorities have expressed concern at the apparent recent increase in cocaine use, especially in the Dublin city area. This would appear to coincide with an increase in the availability and use of cocaine in Europe generally as a result of increased production, particularly in Colombia, and a consequential drop in street price.</P>
    <P>The Customs and Excise Service has primary responsibility for the prevention, interception and seizure of controlled drugs illegally imported into the State. An Garda Síochána has responsibility for the apprehension and arrest of persons suspected of such illegal importation and for the investigation of any related offences. Having regard to the international dimension to drugs trafficking, and recognising that both agencies have an important contribution to make, clear liaison arrangements exist to promote the highest degree of co-operation to prevent and to detect such offences.</P>
    <P>The Garda Síochána and the Customs Service have competence to initiate, conduct and receive mutual enquiries and investigations within their respective competencies. I am informed by the Garda authorities that their experience of international co-operation is very positive. The assignment of liaison officers to the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, Spain and France, and to Europol and Interpol, has enhanced such co-operation, especially in relation to drugs trafficking.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 43 and 117 together.</P>
      <P>There are a number of strategies in place to tackle the problem of so-called joyriding.</P>
      <P>Targeted operations have been put in place by local Garda management in areas that have been identified as potential hotspots for joyriding. Specialist patrols and vehicles are concentrated in these areas to deal with public order and joyriding incidents.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Persons serving prison sentences for persistent offences related to joyriding offences are not <Col N="1446" /> granted early temporary release except in the most exceptional circumstances.</P>
    <P>The gardaí are constantly liaising with community groups and a number of projects are in operation which have proved valuable in dealing with offenders.</P>
    <P>The Garda and local authorities are working together in relation to estate management and reducing the opportunities for joyriding. For example, physical changes such as barriers and speed ramps are being used to reduce access to areas frequented by youths engaged in these activities.</P>
    <P>Cars without tax and insurance are impounded by the gardaí and removed to compounds. In the Dublin metropolitan region, there is a dedicated car compound located at the Talbot complex in Santry. Car compounds are being provided at all newly built divisional/district headquarters provided that there is sufficient physical space on the site.</P>
    <P>In relation to abandoned cars, the Waste Management Act 1996 specifically prohibits the abandonment of vehicles on any land and empowers local authorities to deal appropriately with the abandoned vehicles. The enforcement and implementation of these provisions is a matter for the individual local authorities. I understand that, in general, the local authorities that provide this service have entered into agreements with locally permitted operators to take the vehicles in question for dismantling and/or recovery.</P>
    <P>I am assured by the Garda authorities that they are satisfied the provisions of the Road Traffic Acts 1961 to 2002, are adequate to deal with situations where persons use or take possession of mechanically propelled vehicles without the consent of the owner.</P>
    <P>This is a complex issue which has resulted in tragedy for several families in recent times. While requiring significant inputs from the criminal justice system, this issue can only be tackled to lasting effect through a multi-faceted and multi-agency response involving both the community and relevant statutory bodies.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 44 and 135 together.</P>
      <P>I can see no basis for the Deputy's claim that the murder rate here is on a par with New York. The most recent comparison of international crime statistics published by the UK Home Office shows that, from 1998 to 2000, an average of 2.19 murders were committed for every 100,000 persons in Dublin, while the national average is 1.37. The comparable figure for New York is 8.77. Given that the most recent figures available to me show little numerical increase despite the rise in population in the Irish homicide rate, the position is unlikely to have altered in the meantime.</P>
      <P>The table below gives details of the number of homicides, i.e. murder and manslaughter, brought about by shooting, stabbing, assault and other means for the years 1997 to 2002. The figures given for the year 2002 are provisional and subject to change.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. McDowell Mr. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. McDowell)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am informed by the Director General of the Irish Prison Service that routine medical, probation and education assessments at committal result in prisoners with learning disability coming to notice early in their time in custody. Such prisoners are provided with a range of supports appropriate to their circumstances &ndash; including referral for psychological assessment as required and special arrangements within education units and workshops.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards such prisoners who may be referred to the Prison psychology service, that service does not treat persons with learning difficulties as a separate group. However, such prisoners can <Col N="1448" /> avail of the service in the same way as other offenders, both in terms of their efforts to come to terms with and to cope with their incarceration and in terms of addressing their needs around their offending. As necessary, on a case by case basis, the psychology service does make contact with community-based services in supporting the reintegration of offenders back into the community. This would include voluntary and statutory services working within the learning difficulties sector.</P>
    <P>The prison education service, which involves a partnership between the Irish Prison Service and a range of educational agencies including the vocational education committees, provides a broad programme of education for prisoners following an adult education approach. Education units are in operation in all prisons and places of detention with the exception of Cloverhill Prison where the arrangements for education are not yet complete. Participation in education in Irish prisons &ndash; over 50% &ndash; is high by international standards and there is substantial flexibility in education delivery, with significant provision for one-to-one teaching which is particularly relevant to prisoners with learning disability. Under the programme for Government, there will be particular emphasis on tackling illiteracy and lack of educational accomplishment among prisoners and, in this regard, work is ongoing in the Irish Prison Service in relation to the following key targets in the educational area, as set forth in the Prison Service strategy statement: maintain the prisoner participation rate in education at 50% against the background of increases in the prisoner population; and review the education curriculum to ensure its continuing relevance to prisoner needs.</P>

      <P>I am informed by the Garda authorities that charges have been brought against two persons in this matter.</P>
      <P>The first of these, who was a passenger in the stolen car, was sentenced at the Dublin Circuit Criminal Court on the 31 January 2003, to four year's detention. The sentence will be served from the 15 March 2004, when he has completed a sentence he is currently serving. This person pleaded guilty to the unlawful taking of the vehicle, allowing himself to be carried in it, and burglary. He was also disqualified from driving for ten years.</P>
      <P>I am also informed that the second youth, who was allegedly the driver of the car, is currently before the courts on two charges of manslaughter, one charge of endangerment and one charge of unauthorised taking. I understand that a trial date has yet to be set.</P>
      <P>As this matter is currently before the courts, I am sure that the Deputy will appreciate that it would not be appropriate for me to comment upon the newspaper article to which he has referred.  </P>

      <P>A review of the maternity protection legislation was carried out in 2000 by a working group, chaired by my Department, which comprised the social partners and relevant Departments and Government agencies.</P>
      <P>In December 2000, the Government approved the implementation of the recommendations of the working group by amendment of the existing legislation through Statutory Instrument or primary legislation, as appropriate. At that time, the Government also decided to amend the Adoptive Leave Act 1995 to reflect the proposed changes to the Maternity Protection Act 1994, where appropriate.</P>
      <P>The group's recommendation to increase the periods of maternity and additional maternity leave was implemented very shortly after the publication of its report in February 2001. The increases were announced in budget 2001 and implemented with effect from March 2001. Identical increases were simultaneously applied to the adoptive leave entitlement.</P>
      <P>On 17 July 2002, Government approval was obtained for the drafting of a Bill to give effect to the remaining recommendations of the working group. The Bill in relation to the amendment of the Maternity Leave Act 1994 is currently with the parliamentary counsel. It is expected that the Bill will be published early in 2003 and enacted as soon as possible afterwards.</P>

      <P>Section 98 of the Postal and Telecommunications Services Act 1983, as amended, provides for the disclosure of information concerning the use made of telecommunications services for the purpose of the prevention or detection of crime or in the interests of the security of the State. Such information was, I understand, held by licensed operators for a period of six years for billing purposes.</P>
      <P>The implementation of Directive 97/66/EC of the European Parliament and Council concerning the processing of personal data and the protection of privacy in the telecommunications sector provides for the erasure of certain telecommunications data. This provision may be restricted to safeguard certain objectives, such as national security, public safety and the prevention, investigation, detection and prosecution of criminal offences.</P>
      <P>Last year the Government decided that legislation should be drafted requiring licensed operators to retain information concerning the use made of telecommunications services provided by them for any person for a period of three years. As an interim measure the Government also decided that the Minister for Public Enterprise should issue Directions under section 110(1) of the Postal and Telecommunications Services Act 1983, as amended, requiring such retention.</P>
      <P>This legislation is currently under consideration in my Department as announced in the Government legislation programme published by the Government Chief Whip on 7 October last. I undertook to consult with interested parties on the scope of the proposed legislation, prior to my bringing proposals to Government. As a first step in this process I have organised an information seminar with key stakeholders to be held later this month.</P>

      <P>On 6 January 2003 I was advised by the members of the group established to examine matters arising from the &ldquo;Report raising concerns of the activity of An Garda Síochána officers during 1998&rdquo; dated 22 March 2002, prepared by the Police Ombudsman for Northern Ireland for the Minister for Foreign Affairs that they had intended to submit their report to me before the end of 2002.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, in early December it emerged that there were further lines of inquiry which the group felt should be pursued. In these circum<Col N="1452" /> stances the members of the group informed me that completion of their work would of necessity take more time than they had previously envisaged but that they would present their report as soon as possible.</P>

      <P>The Employment Equality Act 1998, which prohibits discrimination in relation to employment on nine grounds, is currently being examined in the context of the implementation of the employment aspects of Directive 2000/43/EC (Race Directive), Directive 2000/78/EC (Framework Employment Directive) and Directive 2002/73/EC (Gender Equal Treatment Directive).</P>
      <P>The purpose of Directive 2000/78/EC (Framework Employment Directive) is to provide a general framework for the prohibition of discrimination in relation to employment and occupation on grounds of religion or belief, disability, age or sexual orientation. Implementation of the directive will necessitate amendments to the Employment Equality Act 1998. A discussion paper was circulated by my Department to relevant Departments, the social partners, the Office of the Director of Equality Investigations, ODEI &ndash; the equality tribunal, and the Equality Authority in July 2002 in relation to the implementation of this directive and the employment aspects of Directives 2000/43/EC. These organisations were invited to make submissions which formed the basis of further consultations which were completed at the end of last year. Proposals, for submission to Government, in relation to implementation of the directives are being drawn up in my Department at present. Any decisions regarding the retirement age will be taken within this context.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1453" />The enactment of Directive 2000/78/EC will still allow for differences of treatment on grounds of age where the treatment can be objectively and reasonably justified by a legitimate aim and if the means of achieving that aim are appropriate and necessary. The directive also provides that it is without prejudice to national provisions laying down retirement ages.</P>
    <P>The directive must be implemented by 2 December 2003. However, in order to take account of particular conditions, member states may, if necessary, have an additional three years from December 2003, i.e. to December 2006, to implement the provisions of the directive on the age and disability grounds.</P>

      <P>Some 4,491 asylum seekers were recognised as Convention refugees from the beginning of 1992 to the end of 2002. Some 62% were male and 38% were female. Separate age statistics are not readily available in relation to Convention refugees.</P>
      <P>Figures are not available on the number of persons granted permission to remain in the State as parents of Irish children between 1992 and 1995. Some 7,930 current or former asylum seekers were granted permission to remain in the State on this basis between the beginning of 1996 and the end of 2002.</P>
      <P>Some 325 persons have been given leave to remain in the State following consideration under the provisions of section 3(6) of the Immigration Act 1999 since its commencement. There is no separate breakdown available which distinguishes former asylum seekers from other persons.</P>
      <P>Separate gender or age statistics are not available for the latter two categories.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. McDowell Mr. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. McDowell)</NameTxt>
      <P>As regards the first part of the Deputy's question, my Department has not withheld any 1972 files under section 8(4)<i>(a),</i><i>(b) </i>and <i>(c) </i>of the National Archives Act 1986, due to the fact the examination of the files in question has not been finalised.</P>
      <P>While I take the view that it is in the public interest to ensure that as much material as possible enters the public domain it is possible that records in my Department's possession may fall into the categories covered in sections 8(4)<i>(a)</i>; would be contrary to the public interest or <i>(b)</i>; would or might constitute a breach of statutory duty, or breach of good faith on the ground that they contain information supplied in confidence, or <i>(c)</i>; would or might cause distress or danger to living persons on the ground that they contain information about individuals, or would or might be likely to lead to an action for defamation.</P>
      <P>The task of examining the Department's files is, by its nature, both difficult and time consuming and it is possible that some material may have to be partially withheld and a small amount of material may have to be withheld in its entirety. This will only be determined when the examination is completed and I expect that this examination will be completed in the coming weeks.</P>
      <P>I should mention also that, partially to avoid delays in future years in this matter, I have directed that a review take place of the manner in which my Department deals with its responsibilities under the National Archives Act.</P>
      <P>In so far as the final part of the Deputy's question is concerned, I am not aware that the National Archives Advisory Council concluded that my Department was blocking the release of too many documents on security grounds: this, I believe, was an unattributed comment made to a newspaper journalist.</P>

      <P>The figures to which the Deputy refers relate to the Labour Force element of the CSO Quarterly National Household Survey. The latest survey, for August 2002, shows an estimated unemployment rate of 6.9% in the Border region &ndash; comprising counties Donegal, Sligo, Leitrim, Cavan, Monaghan and Louth &ndash; compared with a national rate of 4.6%.</P>
      <P>While the rate for the Border region continues to be somewhat higher than the State as a whole, the survey shows that unemployment in the region fell from 13.2% in November 1997 to the current 6.9%. During the same period, estimated unemployment for the State as a whole fell from 10.4% to 4.6%. Over those five years, total numbers employed in the Border region increased from 143,900 to 171,400, an increase of over 19%.</P>
      <P>Progress has therefore been made in reducing the disparity between the Border Region and the national average. The aim is to continue this trend, and in this regard the industrial development agencies, IDA Ireland and Enterprise Ireland, have strengthened their regional strategies and presence to ensure a continued flow of investment into the regions. Their efforts complement a programme of infrastructural improvements to ensure that the conditions are right for more balanced regional development.</P>

      <P>The issue of job creation is a day-to-day operational issue for the industrial development agencies under the remit of my Department and not one, for which I, as Minister, have direct involvement. These agencies are continuing their efforts towards the development of indigenous industry and in the attraction of inward investment.</P>
      <P>IDA is actively promoting Killarney as a potential location to overseas investors. In an attempt to improve the attractiveness of the town as a location for inward investment, the agency has commenced site development works on their business and technology park at Tiernaboul, Killarney, County Kerry. This site development work involves significant landscaping and site clearance work, all of which will result in the upgrading of the overall appeal of the location. In addition, the Kerry advance factory group have commenced building work on an advance unit, BES factory, in the estate. This 24,000 sq. ft. advance technology building will be completed in mid 2003 and will further enhance the attractiveness of the estate by providing an alternative property solution for potential investors.</P>
      <P>The Enterprise Ireland annual employment survey shows that permanent full-time jobs in Enterprise Ireland client companies in the South Kerry area continued to show a net increase last year, gaining 44 to year-end November 2002. The agency offers a range of supports to indigenous companies, which facilitate the maximisation of jobs. In 2002, Enterprise Ireland approved a total of &euro;1,900,282 investment support to client companies in South Kerry, leading to company investments of &euro;2,768,140, and approved a capital grant of &euro;183,487 towards the expansion of the Killarney Technology Centre under its community enterprise centre, CEC, programme. The agency is currently working with community development groups in south Kerry to assist them in preparing applications in response to the current call for submissions under the CEC programme 2002, the deadline for which is 25 April 2003.</P>
      <P>During 2002, the Kerry County Enterprise Board, CEB, offered support to 47 business projects, 25 of which are in the South and West Kerry catchment area. Future CEB project investment will have the capacity to create an additional 75 jobs spread throughout the county, 44 of which will be in the south and west Kerry area. The board also plans to provide funding for two projects in Killarney and Kenmare for the creation of technology and investment units. In addition, the board will continue to provide advisory, training and other support services benefiting a further 367 existing and potential entrepreneurs, of which approximately 180 are in the south and west Kerry region.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1462" />I am sure the Deputy will agree, from the above details, that my Department through its agencies is working to address the employment needs of Killarney and the south and west Kerry area and in promoting the area for suitable investment projects in the future. In addition, I am always happy to meet with business leaders and public representatives, other commitments permitting, when I am in the Kerry area.</P>

This implementation board was established to formulate a plan for the implementation of the recommendations of the special steering group on the Reserve. The steering group, which I established to undertake a study of the Reserve, reported to me in September 1999. I am arranging to have a copy of their report sent to the Deputy. </P>
      <P>The Reserve Defence Review Implementation Board sets out a six year implementation process for the reorganisation of the Reserve based on the steering group report proposals and that process is now under way.</P>
      <P>The Deputy Chief of Staff, Operations, has directed that each general officer commanding a brigade now establish a brigade implementation group to put in place the recommendations contained within the RDF Review Implementation Board report. This process will involve the establishment of convergence and reassignment boards to prepare plans for the amalgamation of units in line with the proposals outlined in the steering group report. The steering group report did propose an amalgamation of the 19th Infantry Battalion and 24th Infantry Battalion. However, in advance of the convergence and reassignment boards' reports being approved, it would be inappropriate for me to comment further on this particular amalgamation.</P>

      <P>Public expenditure by my Department amounted to &euro;2.8 billion in 2002. A record &euro;1.6 billion of this was spent on direct payments to farmers, which accounted for more than 68.5% of aggregate farm income. This very high level of public expenditure underlines once again the commitment of the Government to the agri-food sector. I will continue to support farm incomes by maximising the level of direct payments to farmers and ensuring that the EU Commission utilises all available market management tools to support the markets to their fullest extent. It should be remembered that farming is a cyclical business and is dependent on a number of factors including the weather and markets which contributed to the overall income decline in 2002.</P>

      <P>Income earned by artists, writers, composers and sculptors from the sale of their work is exempt from tax in Ireland in certain circumstances. The exemption is only available to individuals who are resident here for tax purposes. Section 195 of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997, formerly section 2 of the 1969 Finance Act, allows the Revenue Commissioners to make a determination, under guidelines drawn up by the Minister for Arts, Sport and Tourism, and the Arts Council, with the consent of the Minister for Finance, that certain works are original and creative, and generally recognised as having cultural or artistic merit. Earnings derived from such works are exempt from income tax. Under the terms of section 195, the Revenue Commissioners can make determinations in respect of works in the following categories: (a) &ndash; a book or other writing; (b) &ndash; a play; (<i>c</i>) &ndash; a musical composition; (d) &ndash; a painting or other like picture; and (e) &ndash; a sculpture. Performing artists are not listed as a specified category within section 195 of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 and therefore, the artists' exemption is not currently available to them. I have no plans at present to include performing artists in the artists' exemption scheme as suggested by the Deputy.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Mr. N. Dempsey)</NameTxt>
      <P>As in the case of all syllabi, the syllabus for Irish is kept under ongoing review by the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment, NCCA. In order to cater for the wide range of needs among the cohort, Irish is offered at <Col N="1467" /> three levels for the junior certificate and the established leaving certificate: ardleibhéal, gnáthleibhéal and bonnleibhéal. Irish is taught as part of the leaving certificate applied course. The syllabi, like those in the modern European languages on the curriculum, cater for the development of the four language skills: listening, speaking, reading and writing. They seek to develop these in a balanced way in accordance with the educational needs of students at the different levels.</P>
      <P>The syllabi in Irish and in the modern European languages are underpinned by the same general principles. They involve approaches and methodologies that are accepted and employed by language teachers internationally. Ongoing in-service training has been made available to teachers in relation to the teaching methods and approaches involved in the syllabi in Irish at the various levels. Since the introduction of the revised syllabi in Irish for junior certificate and leaving certificate, there has been an appreciable increase in the numbers of candidates taking those examinations at the higher level by comparison with the former intermediate and leaving certificate examinations.</P>
      <P>In line with its statutory function of keeping the school curricula under review, the NCCA has initiated a wide-ranging review of Irish at second level. In addition to the normal work of syllabus review of the NCCA, an Chomhairle um Oideachas Gaeltachta agus Gaelscoilaíochta was set up in December 2001. Its brief includes conducting research and advising the NCCA on matters relating to the teaching of Irish. I will be following its work with interest.</P>
      <P>As an interim measure until an Chomhairle um Oideachas Gaeltachta agus Gaelscolaíochta is in a position to discharge all its functions fully, a special scheme has been set up under the auspices of the Donegal Education Centre to provide materials for the teaching of Irish in Gaeltacht and all-Irish schools. Under this scheme, eight teachers have been recruited to work on the design of materials under the direction of a national co-ordinator and under the general guidance of inspectors from my Department. Materials produced to date for infant classes are being prepared for publication by An Gúm. I am strongly committed to doing all that is necessary to ensure that our young people are motivated to learn Irish and that it is presented to them in a way that is in line with international best practice in language teaching.</P>

      <P>My Department provides funding for homework clubs on a case by case basis under existing programmes such as the school completion programme, SCP. This programme, which was introduced in 2002 builds on two earlier schemes, the eight to 15 early school leaver initiative and the stay in school retention initiative, and involves 288 primary schools and 112 post-primary schools in 82 clusters. The SCP aims to develop local strategies to ensure maximum participation levels in the education process. It entails targeting individual young people of school going age, both in and out of school, and arranging supports to address inequalities in education access, participation and outcomes. One of the main features of this initiative is the provision of in-school, after school, out of school and holiday time supports.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My Department has also provided funding for homework clubs in disadvantaged areas under the fund for the development of targeted responses to children at risk. This fund is over<Col N="1469" /> seen by Minister of State, Deputy Brian Lenihan, and its purpose is to develop preventative and supportive programmes that are targeted at children and young people who are at risk of educational disadvantage and social exclusion. In addition, many of the area partnership companies have provided homework clubs under their education measure.</P>
    <P>My Department also operates a number of initiatives in disadvantaged areas that are aimed at tackling educational disadvantage. Resources allocated under these programmes are used for the provision of a range of holistic supports to enable pupils from educationally disadvantaged backgrounds to participate fully in school. These include: the home-school-community liaison scheme, which currently involves 309 primary schools and 211 post-primary schools, is a preventative strategy which promotes active co-operation between home, school and relevant community agencies in promoting the educational interests of the children and raises the awareness among parents of their own capacities to enhance their children's educational progress and to assist them in developing relevant skills; and the primary level giving children an even break programme, launched in January 2001, running for a three year period and subsuming the previous process of designation of schools that serve areas of educational disadvantage. The schools targeted were identified through an independent survey of all primary schools carried out by the Educational Research Centre, Drumcondra, on the Department's behalf. The programme involves the creation of more than 200 teaching posts and the allocation of grants to more than 2,300 primary schools in respect of disadvantaged pupils; and the early start pre-school programme for children aged three to four years, who are most at risk in areas of social disadvantage, is provided so that young children will experience an educational programme that will enhance their overall development and prevent school failure. There are 40 centres &ndash; 16 full units and 24 half units &ndash; 56 teachers and 56 child care assistants. Each early start pre-school class attracts special capitation funding, a qualified teacher and a child care assistant, a start up grant for materials-equipment and a grant to foster parental involvement; the learning support teacher service provides assistance for children experiencing learning difficulties, particularly in the core area of literacy. In September 1999 the learning support teacher service was extended to every first and second level school in the country. The number of learning support teachers in the primary system has grown from 1,242 in September 1997 to 1,485 in 2001. At second level, there are now 560 learning support teachers. Learning support guidelines have been issued to schools and a programme of in-service training began in November 2001. The use of school facilities outside of school hours is a matter for the board of management of the individual school concerned.</P>

      <P>Castletownbere fishery harbour centre is one of the five fishery harbour centres owned and managed directly by my Department. In 1998 my Department commissioned a study of the infrastructural need of Castletownbere fishery harbour centre. This study identified the need for an extension to Dinish Wharf and the provision of a new auction hall. The development proposed for Castletownbere Fishery Harbour Centre comprises three basic elements, that is, dredging to accommodate the new pier facility, a 120 metre pier extension to the existing Dinish Wharf and the construction of an auction hall building on the wharf. In 2002 it came to light that some of the material to be dredged is contaminated. Consultant engineers have been asked to devise a suitable plan to deal with the material in question and until that plan is available it will not be possible to indicate a start date for the proposed development. I should also point out that, in any event, the commencement date for the proposed development will depend on the Exchequer funding available for fishery harbour development works in 2004 and later and overall national priorities. In the meantime, ongoing maintenance works are being undertaken at Castletownbere fishery harbour centre.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>The planning, organisation and management of services at Tralee General Hospital is a matter for the Southern Health Board. As the Deputy will be aware, the report of the subgroup of the national cancer forum, Development of Services for Symptomatic Breast Disease, was published in March 2000 and contains recommendations for the establishment of a network of specialist breast units throughout the country, and the appropriate infrastructure, personnel and equipment which is needed for such specialist units. The report also makes recommendations regarding the siting of such units in each health board area. The report recommends that, based on the population in the board's functional area, it is appropriate that two centres of excellence be located in the south. The report also recommends that women with breast disease are best served by a team of specialists working together and that women experience better outcomes if their cancer is managed in centres developed along the lines of the subgroup report.</P>
      <P>The Southern Health Board's own proposals for the development of symptomatic breast disease services are informed by the report's recommendations. Accordingly, in line with the recommendations of the report, the board is to develop two individual symptomatic breast disease centres of excellence, located at South Infirmary-Victoria Hospital and Cork University Hospital. These centres will function as one unit with regard to audit, data collection, protocols, teaching and quality assurance. On a day to day management level, two individual teams of clinicians and specialists nurses working independently in the two hospitals will carry out the clinical management of patients with symptomatic breast disease.</P>
      <P>In relation to oncology services in Tralee General Hospital, the current services are being maintained. A dedicated oncology unit was established in 1999, operating five days a week and staffed by an oncology nurse specialist and three staff nurses. The specialist nurses in this unit co-ordinate the treatments for patients, manage side effects from cancer and chemotherapy and provide information and psychological support for patients and their families. The unit also co-ordinates care of patients attending other centres for chemotherapy and provides local support for patients and their families. The medical supervision of the oncology services provided at Tralee General Hospital is the responsibility of the consultant medical oncologist in Cork University Hospital who attends at Tralee General Hospital twice per month. The continued development of oncology services in Tralee General Hospital is also a matter for the Southern Health Board in the first instance.</P>

My Department's allocation in the Abridged Estimates volume for 2003 includes funding for the expansion of general practitioner out of hours co-operatives. The allocation of this funding will be determined following a series of meetings being convened by my Department with each of the health boards, including the Southern Health Board, wishing to expand their out of hours co-operatives in 2003.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 104 and 105 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The provision of orthodontic services is a matter for the health boards in the first instance. I am pleased to advise the Deputy that I have taken a number of measures to improve orthodontic ser<Col N="1477" /> vices in the Southern Health Board area and on a national basis. In the short-term, I have funded an orthodontic initiative to ease current pressures on the system. Additional funding of &euro;6.729 million was approved for orthodontic services in 2001 of which &euro;4.698 million was to fund an initiative on orthodontic waiting lists. This is enabling health boards to recruit additional staff and engage the services of private specialist orthodontic practitioners to treat patients. The SHB was allocated an additional &euro;1.191 million in 2001 for orthodontic services of which &euro;1.032 million was for the orthodontic initiative. Under the initiative, the board proposes to, <i>inter alia,</i> recruit an additional two consultant orthodontists, one of which will be based in Tralee. The chief executive officer of the SHB has informed me that the board recently advertised this position through the Local Appointments Commission but were unsuccessful in recruiting a candidate on this occasion. The board will again consider the possibility of advertising the post at the earliest opportunity.</P>
    <P>Last June, my Department provided additional funding of &euro;5 million from the treatment purchase fund to health boards specifically for the purchase of orthodontic treatment. This funding is enabling boards to provide both additional sessions for existing staff and purchase treatment <Col N="1478" /> from private specialist orthodontic practitioners. The SHB was allocated an additional &euro;0.72 million from this fund for the treatment of cases in this way. My Department has also funded the recruitment of a professor in orthodontics at Cork university dental school to facilitate the development of an approved training programme leading to specialist qualification in orthodontics.</P>
    <P>The grade of specialist in orthodontics has been created in the health board orthodontic service. This year, my Department and the health boards are funding 13 dentists from various health boards for specialist in orthodontics qualifications at training programmes in Ireland and at two separate universities in the United Kingdom. These 13 trainees for the public orthodontic service are additional to the six dentists who commenced their training last year and one dentist whose specialist training is nearing completion. Thus, there is an aggregate of 20 dentists in specialist training for orthodontics. These measures will complement the other structural changes being introduced into the orthodontic service, including the creation of an auxiliary grade of orthodontic therapist to work in the orthodontic area.</P>
    <P>The chief executive officer of the SHB has informed me of the following information on orthodontic waiting lists in the board:</P>

    <P>Patients in category A require immediate treatment and include those with congenital abnormalities of the jaws such as cleft lip and palate, and patients with major skeletal discrepancies between the sizes of the jaws. Patients in category B have less severe problems than category A patients and are placed on the orthodontic treatment waiting list.</P>
    <P>Finally, the chief executive officer of the SHB has informed me that at the end of the December 2002 quarter, there were 3,473 patients receiving orthodontic treatment in the board. This is an increase of approximately 1,173 patients in orthodontic treatment when compared with the number of patients receiving treatment in December 2001. I expect that the number of patients in orthodontic treatment will continue to increase as the measures that I have taken to improve orthodontic services take effect.</P>

      <P>Policy on the development of emergency medical services in Ireland is set out in a number of docu<Col N="1479" /> ments, including the health strategy, Quality and Fairness &ndash; A Health System for You, the Strategic Review of the Ambulance Service 2001, and Building Healthier Hearts, the Government's cardiovascular health strategy. As emergency medical care services continue to evolve and become more sophisticated the need for high quality education for emergency medical technicians increases. Educational programmes are being developed as part of a quality assurance and quality improvement process which provide personnel with appropriate knowledge and skills to ensure maintenance of accepted standards of care practice.</P>
      <P>These programmes are being developed by the pre-hospital emergency care council whose primary function is to develop appropriate standards in pre-hospital emergency care. It is in this context that the council is pursuing the development of professional and performance standards for the ambulance services, and for ambulance services personnel, in addition to the accreditation of institutions providing training for emergency medical technicians. As part of the educational process, ambulance crews are trained to a high level of professional competence to enable them to fulfil their role in dealing with all emergency responses in the pre-hospital care setting, including maternity responses.</P>
      <P>Each ambulance crew also has access to a suite of standard operating procedures which draw on current best evidence in key areas of concern to those working in the emergency ambulance service. They also provide a clear approach to assessment and treatment and are an important step in developing the focus on clinical effectiveness. I understand the agency referred to by the Deputy does not have a policy which prohibits the attendance of specialist nursing personnel in emergency maternity situations. Where an ambulance crew feel that such assistance is required, they can seek this via ambulance control. This procedure is endorsed by the services medical adviser.</P>

Under the current GP-delivered primary childhood immunisation programme, which commenced in December 1995, such records must be retained by the individual general practitioners concerned and details must also be provided to the relevant health board. <Col N="1480" /> Health boards endeavour to facilitate requests for individual immunisation records but the extent to which such records are available for the pre-1995 period may vary according to the time which has elapsed since a child was immunised. Compilation of uptake data was based on summary information supplied to the Department; individuals immunisation records were not provided. I trust this clarifies the matter.</P>

      <P>Penalty points are recorded on the licence record of an individual on the national driver file, which is held and administered by the Department of the Environment and Local Government. Points are endorsed on the licence record on receipt of either a notification from the Garda Síochána of the payment of a fixed charge, or notification of a conviction from the Courts Service in respect of an offence which attracts penalty points. Offences and the number of penalty points to be awarded in respect of such offences are set down in the First Schedule of the Road Traffic Act 2002. It is the intention that the database will be capable of providing statistical information by reference to licensing authority areas, numbers of penalty points, offences, etc. Information relating to individual gardaí is a matter for the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform. When the penalty point system is fully operational it will involve the national driver file, and the computer systems of the Garda Síochána and the courts, currently being developed.</P>

In addition, my Department is working towards the earliest possible implementation of those recommendations of the Motor Insurance Advisory Board for which I have responsibility and which the MIAB considers will contribute to lower insurance costs.</P>

Of the 16 offenders detained in the centre at that time, 14 were transferred to other institutions with the remaining two offenders, who had imminent release dates, being granted full release.</P>
      <P>Male juveniles aged 16 to 21 years of age will, henceforth, either remain in St. Patrick's Institution or, to a limited extent, will be accommodated elsewhere in the prison system including in the open centres at Shelton Abbey and Loughan House. Prisoners generally have access to a wide range of educational services and, for well over a decade now, participation in education in our prisons has consistently been over 50% of the whole prison population.</P>
      <P>St. Patrick's Institution has a strong ethic of multi-disciplinary team-working which has resulted in the development of new programmes over the past two years for the rehabilitation of offenders including a drug-free wing, personal development group programmes and a positive sentence management programme. The other institutions in which these offenders may be detained are Fort Mitchel, Shelton Abbey, Loughan House and the training unit. Education programmes are available in all the foregoing institutions. The education programmes in St. Patrick's Institution and the training unit are comprehensive. Fort Mitchel, Shelton Abbey and Loughan House can also offer comparable education programmes to those available at Shanganagh Castle in the past.</P>

      <P>As the Deputy may be aware, my Department has been given overall responsibility for the development and co-ordination of child care service provision over the course of the National Development Plan 2000-2006. In this regard, the equal opportunities child care programme, established in April 2000, has been developed with the objective of significantly increasing the number of child care places and improving the quality of child care services to enable parents to avail of work, education and training opportunities. The total funding available over the life of the national development plan is almost &euro;437 million comprising Exchequer and European Union funding.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The programme provides capital grant assistance to community groups and not-for-profit organisations and to private child care providers to build, renovate, upgrade or equip child care facilities. It provides assistance towards the staffing costs of community groups and not-for-profit <Col N="1487" /> organisations which provide child care for disadvantaged families. The programme also offers supports to the national voluntary child care organisations, and to other groups, which are working to improve the quality of child care in Ireland.</P>
    <P>It is open to any group which would include, school managerial authorities, parents' groups, and other community based not-for-profit groups, interested in developing and providing school-age child care services, on school premises or elsewhere in the community, to apply for grant assistance under the programme. In February 2002 an advertising campaign, aimed specifically at school-age child care, was launched inviting applications for funding to provide a quality school-age child care service.</P>
    <P>My Department currently chairs the working group on school-age child care which is assessing the current provision of school-age child care and is also developing guidelines on the provision of quality school-age child care</P>
    <P>I understand that the use of school premises for school-age child care would be a matter for the school management authorities. The issue of insurance therein would be a matter for the group proposing to run the service.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 127 and 128 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Commission on Liquor Licensing submit<Col N="1488" /> ted its report on admission and service in licensed premises in December last. The report contains a series of recommendations to strengthen legislative provisions in relation to licensing law and health and safety law.</P>
    <P>Having considered the commission's recommendations in relation to a strengthening of licensing law provisions I have decided that an urgent response is called for. I intend, therefore, to bring proposals to Government as soon as possible for the necessary legislative changes, including stronger penalties, as recommended by the commission. The necessary preparatory work is already under way in my Department.</P>
    <P>No formal recommendations in relation to equality legislation, structures and procedures were made by the commission in its report since the primary focus was on the liquor licensing code. Moreover, the commission noted that any changes to equality legislation would require further consideration and wider consultation.</P>
    <P>One such issue raised by the commission was to provide recourse to the District Court when dealing with all licensing issues, including cases involving licensed premises under the Equal Status Act 2000. At present all cases under equal status legislation are heard by ODEI &ndash; the Equality Tribunal in first instance, with appeal to the Circuit Court.</P>
    <P>Currently complaints of discrimination are considered, in the first instance, by the Office of the Director of Equality Investigations, apart from discriminating clubs whose redress is through the District Court. The Office of the Director of Equality Investigations is an independent statutory body set up under the Employment Equality Act 1998. The director and her equality officers and equality mediation officers are independent in the performance of their functions and carry out quasi-judicial investigations. I have no statutory function in relation to such investigations. I commend the ODEI &ndash; the equality tribunal on their work, both in terms of statutory functions under the equality legislation and in their efforts to develop the services they offer.</P>
    <P>I have asked my Department to undertake a consultation process with the social partners, the ODEI &ndash; the Equality Tribunal and the Equality Authority on all the equality issues raised by the commission, and to report further to me on the outcome. Until such time as the consultation process has been completed, I have no further statement to make on the matter.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 129 and 130 together.</P>
      <P>Section 3(6) of the Immigration Act 1999 requires the Minister to have regard to a range of eleven different factors, including humanitarian considerations, in determining whether a deportation order should be made. It applies therefore only in cases where the making of a deportation order is contemplated. The obligations imposed on the Minister arise whether the person in question is a failed asylum seeker and whether he or she has made representations of any sort. Furthermore it applies whether or not the person made representations of any sort to the Minister prior to commencement of the Immigration Act 1999.</P>
      <P>As a reflection of these realities, statistics are not maintained on the matters raised which would distinguish former asylum seekers from other classes of non-national or which would distinguish cases where representations have been made from other cases. What I can say however, is that there is no legal obligation on the Minister to respond to representations made by a person prior to the making of a deportation order. There is of course, in the vast majority of cases, an obligation on the Minister to give the person an opportunity to make representations. I can say however, that 281 persons have been given leave to remain in the State following consideration of the case under the provisions of section 3(6) of the Immigration Act 1999 since its commencement.</P>

      <P>The Inspector of Prisons and Places of Detention, Judge Dermot Kinlen, was appointed in April last year. The inspector has the following terms of reference: (a) inspect and report, as the inspector considers appropriate, to the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform on prisons and other places of detention managed on behalf of the Department by the Irish Prison Service; (b) report in particular on conditions in those institutions and on the regimes in place for prisoners and detainees; (c) investigate and report on any specific issue referred to the inspectorate by the Minister; and (d) submit to the Minister an annual report on the activities of the inspectorate.</P>
      <P>The inspector of Prisons and Places of Detention has a staff of three persons assigned to his office. This consists of a special adviser, an executive officer and a personal assistant. The special adviser is a retired prison governor who reports directly to the inspector. He accompanies the inspector on inspection visits to prisons and places of detention operated by the Irish Prison Service. He assists in any work arising from the functions of the inspectorate and he also assists the inspector in preparing the annual report to the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform. The executive officer provides administrative and secretarial support to the inspector's office. The duties of the personal assistant to the inspector are similar to his previous duties as a tipstaff to a High Court judge and include driving the inspector's car and liaising with the other members of the inspector's staff in assisting the inspector to perform the functions of his office. I understand that the inspector also proposes to avail of the services of a number of experts in a range of fields to assist him in fulfilling his duties, as and when he believes it necessary and appropriate.</P>

      <P>A visiting committee is appointed to each prison under the Prisons (Visiting Committees) Act 1925 and Prisons (Visiting Committees) Order 1925. The legislation does not specify the support services that are to be provided to the prison visiting commit<Col N="1491" /> tees. Traditionally, a clerk from the institution to which a committee is appointed provides administrative support to it. Accordingly, there is now a total of 15 clerks providing support to the visiting committees, on a part-time basis in addition to their other duties and, as such, it is not possible to accurately quantify the total annual costs of servicing the prison visiting committees. However, the clerks are paid an allowance for performing this specific function. The total cost of this particular allowance in 2002 was &euro; 9,943.36 which covered the 16 visiting committees then in operation.</P>

      <P>The PULSE System has been operational for three years and is available at 181 locations including divisional and district headquarters and all major city stations throughout the country. Under this level of coverage, 85% of all incidents are directly captured and over 75% of Garda personnel have direct access to PULSE systems in their own stations. Garda personnel in other stations have also the means to link up with the PULSE network indirectly. It is considered that the correct balance between cost and availability has been achieved with this level of coverage. However, this is a situation that will be kept under review in the light of advancements in technology, the availability of resources and the overall development of the system. Due to the size and complexity of the project, roll-out of the system has taken place in phased releases. Work to enhance the performance of the system is ongoing and will be deployed over the coming months. It is planned to deploy the final release of the system this year subject to resource availability.</P>

      <P>Although in the period 1996 to 2000, the figures for recorded indictable crime <Col N="1492" /> showed an overall decrease of approximately 27% and the 2001 figures showed a disappointing increase over the previous year of 18%, serious crime has still fallen since 1996 by approximately 14% overall. The Deputy will be aware that the crime statistics since the year 2000 are not directly comparable with those of previous years. This is due to the altered format of the annual report of the Garda Síochána since 2000 following the introduction of the PULSE system. In the following table, for each of the years 1996 to 1999, the number of indictable offences is given. The figures for 2000 and 2001 represent the new category of headline offences. </P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. McDowell Mr. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. McDowell)</NameTxt>
      <P>My Department and the Departments of Education and Science and Health and Children are currently involved in a multi-agency approach to developing responses, including the provision of custodial places, for troubled and troublesome young persons. This work is taking place in the context of the ongoing implementation of the Children Act 2001.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The National Children's Office has taken the lead role in relation to co-ordinating the implementation of the Act and have established a working group for this purpose. The group, which includes high level representation from my Department and the Departments of Education and Science and Health and Children, meets on a regular basis to review progress in implementing the Act and to bring forward further proposals. While there is significant emphasis in the legislation on custodial care being a last resort, the provision of appropriate custodial facilities will continue to be a priority. I have responsibility for the provision of accommodation for young offenders aged between 16 and 21 <Col N="1493" /> years. St. Patrick's Institution is specifically designated to cater for this age group and the majority of inmates under the 18 years of age are detained in this institution as well as in Fort Mitchel. On 13 January 2003, there were 60 offenders under the age of 18 years detained in the various prisons and places of detention under the administration of the Irish Prison Service.</P>
    <P>Under the Children Act 2001, however, I will be obliged to provide separate detention facilities for 16 and 17 year old boys and girls who are committed to custody by the courts either on remand or under sentence. The Irish Prison Service proposes to provide a 38 bed unit for male juveniles with full support facilities on a dedicated site adjacent to Cork prison. At present, a tender competition is being prepared for this facility.</P>
    <P>In addition, the Irish Prison Service is seeking suitable sites for the location of another juvenile detention facility for young offenders aged 16 to 17 years, as part of the process of implementing the Children's Act 2001. As the Deputy may be aware, I have not yet made a conclusive decision on the location of the proposed development. The Deputy may also be aware that the special school facilities that were to be provided for younger offenders in St. Patrick's Institution are now the subject of a review by the Government to see whether or not they should be devoted to 14 and 15 year old offenders and unruly children. It may well be that these will become available to augment St. Patrick's Institution.</P>

      <P>Under our legal system, the law provides generally for maximum penalties for criminal offences. The law enables the judge to exercise his-her discretion, within the maximum penalty, by reference to the conclusions he-she has reached after hearing the case, including all the evidence and assessing the culpability and circumstances of the accused. I have no proposals to depart from this principle. There are, however, a number of provisions relating to the general area of sentencing which may be of interest to the Deputy. In accordance with the provisions of the Courts and Court Officers Act 1995, funds have been made available to the Judicial Studies Institute, which was established by the Chief Justice for the purposes of judicial training. It is understood that the issue of sentencing has been examined by the institute in the context of its training programme.</P>

    <P>Section 36 of the Courts (Supplemental Provisions) Act 1961 makes provision for meetings of District Court judges to discuss, <i>inter alia,</i><Col N="1494" /> the avoidance of undue divergence in the exercise of the jurisdiction of the court and the general level of fines and penalties. While there is no similar statutory provision in the case of other courts, it is understood that they hold similar meetings.</P>

      <P>In October 2002 I launched the missing persons helpline which is operated by Victim Support. This dedicated helpline is operating as a counselling and referral service and as a primary point of contact for the families of missing persons. The helpline provides advice and psychological support for families of missing persons as well as structured liaison with the Garda Síochána. Searching for missing persons is, of course, the responsibility of the Garda auth<Col N="1495" /> orities, as are the deployment of Garda resources and the investigative methods used. The Garda Síochána operates a website which gives details of certain missing persons. On an international level, the Garda Síochána liaises with Interpol and relevant non-governmental organisations where appropriate.</P>
      <P>I am assured by the Garda authorities that the Garda Síochána does all in its power to locate missing persons and that it provides considerable support to families. I am further assured that all files on missing persons remain open and under continuous review until the person is located, or, in the case of a missing person who is presumed drowned, a verdict to that effect by the coroner. I am also assured that contact is maintained on a regular basis with the families of missing persons.</P>

      <P>The information requested by the Deputy is set out on the associated tables. Table 1 details the number of solicitors and support staff employed by the Legal Aid Board in each of its law centres as of December 2002. Table 2 shows the length of time the person longest on the waiting list has waited as of December 2002 by law centre. I would mention to the Deputy that the board does not routinely collect information relating to an average waiting time for people seeking its services. However, it does record the length of time the person longest on the waiting list has waited.</P>
      <P>I can inform the Deputy that the allocation of increased funding and resources to the Legal Aid Board in recent years, up from &euro;10.656 million in 1997 to &euro;17.075 million in 2003, has enabled the board to provide legal services to a greater number of people and has led to a significant reduction in waiting times.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I can also inform the Deputy that the board operates a procedure whereby priority is accorded for certain categories of cases, for example, domestic violence, child care, child abduction and other cases where there are time limits. These cases are dealt with immediately. Such a system for priorities is necessary to ensure that, for example, persons who are subjected to domestic violence and cases involving the care of children are provided with a priority service. In 2001, the total number of priority appointments offered by law centres was approximately 1,500, or about 22% of the total number of appointments offered to new clients during the year. I can also inform the Deputy that the board continuously monitors the operation of its law centre network and where waiting times, for whatever reasons, become excessive the position is examined by the board with a view to taking remedial action. In this regard, I would remind the Deputy <Col N="1497" /> that under section 30 of the Civil Legal Aid Act 1995, responsibility for deciding how services should be provided is solely a matter for the Legal Aid Board.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 154 and 155 together.</P>
      <P>The following table lists 50 existing candidate special areas of conservation, cSACs, as well as the recently proposed cSAC Moy river No. 002298, all of which are all partially or wholly in County Mayo. Lowland is included in some of these sites and the Moy river would be the most recent example.</P>
      <P>The European Communities (Natural Habitat) Regulations 1997, provide for amendment by the Minister for the Environment and Local Government of candidate special areas of conservation, cSAC, in response to objections from effected landowners.</P>
      <P>Where my Department does not propose, before initial assessment, to recommend the amendment of a cSAC envisaged in an objection, the Appeals Advisory Board is available to assist in the assessment of objections by carrying out a further review of cases referred to it and making an independent recommendation to the Minister for the Environment and Local Government.</P>
      <P>In all cases, boundary changes to provide for exclusions or inclusions must be justified on scientific grounds.</P>

      <P>I propose to answer Questions Nos. 156, 157 and 158 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The development of a quarry is subject to normal planning controls. Section 261 of the Plan<Col N="1503" /> ning and Development Act 2000 provides for new additional controls on the operation of quarries. This provision is intended to ensure that all quarries, including those operating since before the introduction of the planning code, are subject to a modern planning and environmental assessment system. Under that section the owners or operators of quarries over five years old, whether subject to planning permission or otherwise, will be required to register details of the quarry with the planning authority. If necessary, additional planning controls can then be applied to those quarries.</P>
    <P>I intend to commence this section shortly following publication of draft planning guidelines in relation to quarries which are at an advanced stage of preparation. The planning guidelines will, among other things, deal with best practice and mitigating measures when proposals are made to locate quarrying development near waterways.</P>
    <P>Local authorities are independent statutory bodies and, while they operate within a framework of legislation and statutory regulations, they are not subject, as a general rule, to direction or sanction by the Minister of the Environment and Local Government in specific matters.</P>

      <P>Arising from the analysis of the 2002 population Census by NUI Maynooth, the Government decided on the additional areas for inclusion in the CLÁR programme and I announced these additions on 17 January 2003.</P>
      <P>The critical criterion in the review was to maintain the 50% overall reduction and involved identifying and including any DEDs with a 50% plus population decline contiguous or near to existing CLÁR areas. Arising from the review, no DEDS were removed. The number of DEDS in the revised programme has increased from 701 to 890 and the total population in the programme has increased from 284,000 to 362,000. Waterford is the only new county with areas being included. The average decline of population in the total CLÁR area is now 49.89% or, excluding the Cooley peninsula, 50.32%.</P>
      <P>The following table details the additional DEDs and the population included in the revised programme. I am sending separately to the Deputy copies of the maps and lists of the previous and new DEDs in CLÁR.</P>

      <P>The supplementary welfare allowance scheme, which is administered by the health boards, provides for the payment of a weekly or monthly supplement in respect of rent to any person in the State whose means are insufficient to meet his or her needs. With the exception of those participating in approved employment schemes, people in full-time employment, that is, 30 hours or more per week, are excluded from receiving assistance under the supplementary welfare allowance scheme.</P>
      <P>Rent supplements are subject to a means test and are calculated to ensure that a person, after the payment of rent, has an income equal to the rate of supplementary welfare allowance appropriate to his or her family circumstances, less a minimum contribution of &euro;12 which recipients are required to pay from their own resources.</P>
      <P>A person who is not in full-time employment is entitled to apply for a rent supplement. Accordingly, in any week where a performing artist works less than 30 hours, he or she is entitled to apply for a rent supplement.</P>

      <Quest>if she will introduce special arrangements for dealing with claims by performing artists in view of their specialised careers; if they will be given a period of three years in which to pursue their profession, with entitlement to full benefits during that period with qualification of 15 weeks social insurance contributions paid in the previous 18 months and for proof of eligibility documentation to demonstrate that they are seeking work or have attended auditions, meetings, classes and so on with equity membership cards being used as proof of status as a performing artist; and if she will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 161 and 162 together.</P>
      <P>A person claiming unemployment benefit is required to have at least 39 PRSI contributions since starting work and either 39 contributions paid or credited in a recent year as defined or 26 contributions paid in that tax year and in the previous tax year. Where a person is seeking work in his or her usual employment, he or she would normally satisfy the conditions for receipt of payment, provided there is a reasonable prospect of securing such work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>People in the acting and other artistic professions who experience periods of unemployment can qualify for payment when they are out of work. It is recognised also that they may need to attend auditions on an ongoing basis for that purpose. In situations, however, where it is clear that there is no employment available or likely to <Col N="1509" /> be offered to them within a reasonable period of time, they would be expected to broaden their search to include other types of employment. The application of these conditions is the same for performing artists as for other claimants for unemployment payments.</P>
    <P>The introduction of special arrangements for performing artists as proposed would raise issues of equity <i>vis-à-vis</i> other claimants and would have financial implications. There are no current plans for changes to the legislation in this regard.</P>

      <AskConj>asked the </AskConj>
      <askee>Minister for Social and Family Affairs</askee>
      <Quest>her views on the fact that the value of all social welfare payments has decreased as they are now kept in line with the real cost of living; the way in which she will address this issue; and if she will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan" hpid="Mary Coughlan Mary Coughlan">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Social and Family Affairs (Mary Coughlan)</NameTxt>
      <P>Budget 2003 made provision for increases in the main personal rates of weekly payments ranging from 5.1% to 7.6% as well as additional increases, ranging from 5.1% to 7.6%, in the weekly rate of qualified adult allowances. These increases came into effect from the first week in January last and protect or enhance the value of all rates of payment in real terms.</P>
      <P>The key objectives of the 2003 social welfare package were as follows: to increase or maintain the value of all rates of payment in relative terms. In this regard, it is projected that prices will increase by an average of 4.8% in 2003 as a whole; to give additional increases to those aged 66 or over, in particular those on widows and old age pensions; to increase or maintain the real value of all qualified adult rates of payment and to ensure that they did not fall as a proportion of the associated personal rate; and to make significant progress in our programme of increases in the level of child benefit.</P>
      <P>Social welfare spending rose by over &euro;3.5 billion between 1997 and 2002, a level of increase significantly in excess of the level of inflation. An additional &euro;833 million in social welfare spending is provided for during this year, and this will bring the projected level of annual spending to over &euro;10 billion for the first time. At a time of great economic uncertainty, this emphasises the Government's commitment to protecting those at highest risk. My colleagues and I are committed to safeguarding the position of all social welfare recipients and I look forward to making further progress in the years ahead on the achievement of our social inclusion commitments.</P>

      <P>The household benefits package consists of three allowances, the electricity-gas allowance, the telephone allowance and free television licence. The telephone allowance covers the normal line and instrument rental charges associated with a standard telephone and a limited allowance for calls. The VAT on both the rental and the allowance for calls is covered.</P>
      <P>The electricity allowance comprises 1,800 units of electricity per annum in addition to normal standing charges. The VAT on both the electricity units and the standing charges is covered.</P>
      <P>The natural gas allowance is an alternative to the electricity allowance for people whose homes are connected to a natural gas supply. This allowance covers normal standing-supply charges and a certain amount of natural gas kilowatt hours each year. The VAT on both the supply charges and the number of kilowatt hours allowed is covered by the allowance.</P>
      <P>As outlined above, VAT on the various allowances is covered in the household benefits package and, therefore, the overall cost of the VAT increase is significantly reduced for recipients.</P>

      <Quest>if there is a common framework within the EU to allow people who have travel passes in their own country, to allow them to travel on that pass within the EU; the progress which has been made in establishing a senior euro pass card, within the EU, which would entitle older people to concessions on various services, including travel, cultural and social activities with a particular emphasis on the benefits for Irish emigrants living in the UK and elsewhere; and if she will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <P>The free travel scheme is available to all people living in the State aged 66 years, or over. It is also available to carers and to people with disabilities who are in receipt of certain social welfare payments. It applies to travel within the State and cross-Border journeys between here and Northern Ireland. A variety of travel concessions are granted by most EU member states to retired pensioners. The scope of these concession schemes and the reductions available vary widely from country to country.</P>
      <P>I understand that CIE participates in the Rail-Europe senior scheme which gives concessions to those aged over 60. However, because this scheme applies to cross-Border travel only, its benefit is limited in Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At EU level, a report entitled Towards a Senior Euro Pass was commissioned by the Social <Col N="1511" /> Affairs Directorate of the European Commission and published by Age Concern, England, at the end of 1997. This report recommended that member states should establish a senior euro pass card which would entitle older people to concessions on various services, including travel, cultural and social activities. Developments in this area would have to be advanced at EU level. However, I <Col N="1512" /> believe that there has been very little progress on this issue recently.</P>
    <P>Implementation of the all-Ireland free travel scheme, as outlined in the programme for Government, will require detailed discussions and agreements with the relevant authorities and transport providers on both sides of the Border. Work on this proposal will commence as soon as possible.</P>
